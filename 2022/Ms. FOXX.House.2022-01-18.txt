 Madam Speaker, recently the Taylorsville Times, a historic  newspaper in North Carolina's Fifth District, celebrated its 100th  anniversary.   I cannot overstate how much of an institution this newspaper is  within the community. A century of production is a testament to the  value that this newspaper creates for its dedicated readers. Like  clockwork, it continues to carry on in the Alexander County community.   Congratulations to Lee Sharpe, the publisher of the Taylorsville  Times, and his family for achieving this tremendous accomplishment.  Thanks to the diligence and hard work of Lee and his family, the  citizens of Alexander County continue to have access to an invaluable  resource.  [[Page H208]]    Here is to another prosperous 100 years of service.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague from Indiana for  holding this Special Order tonight and calling attention to the  problems of the past year.   I could use many words to describe President Biden's first full year  in office, but the one that comes to mind immediately is incompetence.   There is a blueprint for the economic and societal ruin that has  stabbed America in its back for a year. This administration is the  architect of that blueprint.   Inflation has skyrocketed to its highest level in 40 years.   Job creators have faced innumerable setbacks that have threatened  their livelihoods.   The ever-growing Federal bureaucracy has metastasized like a cancer.   Parents have been targeted by the FBI and DOJ in what can only be  described as a wave of new-age McCarthyism that has been spun by this  administration.   The southern border has all but collapsed due to gross mismanagement.   The list goes on and on.   Simply put, the policies and actions of this administration mirror  the agenda of political arsonists.   No matter how ambitious or forward-thinking the Biden administration  tries to bill itself as, it cannot shake the stench of incompetence  that surrounds every initiative it heads up.   Socialism is no longer an ominous shadow on the horizon. This  administration has brought it to our doorstep.   This great country must be saved from the ruin that this  administration has created.   Republicans will be the ones to save it.   Republicans will be the ones to safeguard the values and freedoms  that have always defined America.   Republicans will be the ones to turn this country around and deliver  for the American people.   When we retake the House of Representatives and the Senate this year,  that is precisely what we will do.   Americans demand it, and we will act.
