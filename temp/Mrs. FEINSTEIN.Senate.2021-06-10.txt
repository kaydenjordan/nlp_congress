 Mrs. President, I rise to speak in support of the  ``BASIC Act,'' which I introduced today.   I know how important it is to help students cover the full cost of  attending college, including tuition and fees, housing, food,  transportation, books, medical, childcare and supplies.   In California, even though State and institutional aid programs cover  full tuition and fees for about half of students attending a California  State University, University of California and California Community  College, students struggle to pay for the remaining cost of attendance.   Each year, over 300,000 eligible applicants do not receive a state  Cal Grant because of limited availability. Non-tuition college costs  can exceed $20K annually. Low-income students may spend about half  their family income on out-of-pocket costs after grant aid. This bill  will help accelerate California's work to make college affordable and  provide funding to reach more schools across California and across our  Nation. This is especially important at a time when community college  enrollment has slowed during the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly among  students of color, lower-income students, and students who have left to  work or take care of family members.   As we work to build back better and increase affordability and  accessibility  [[Page S4046]]  of higher education, we must help our students stay in school.   That is why I am proud to introduce this bill to authorize $1 billion  for a new grant program to help institutions of higher education meet  students' basic needs.   This funding represents an essential aspect of building more  equitable paths to higher education, and it represents an investment in  our students, our institutions, and our future.   This legislation recognizes the disproportionate impact this pandemic  has on vulnerable populations and it helps coordinate assistance across  federal agency lines.   I want to thank Senator Warren and Representative Torres for  introducing this bill with me, and I hope our colleagues will join us  in support of this bill that ensures no student is forced to choose  between their education and food or housing.   Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.                                  ______                                         By Mr. REED (for himself, Ms. Collins, Mr. Van Hollen, Ms. Cortez          Masto, and Ms. Klobuchar):   S. 2008. A bill to strengthen the United States Interagency Council  on Homelessness; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban  Affairs.   Mr. REED, Mr. President, along with Senator Collins, I am  reintroducing legislation that would eliminate the sunset date for the  United States Interagency Council on Homelessness (the Council or  USICH) so that this agency can build upon its success in helping to  prevent and end homelessness nationally.   The Council was established under the Reagan Administration as part  of the landmark Mckinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act of 1987, Since  that time, it has worked across the Federal government and the private  sector to coordinate homeless assistance nationally. In 2009, e  Homeless Emergency Assistance and Rapid Transition to Housing Act,  which I authored along with Senator Collins, expanded the Council's  role to work with public, non-profit, and private stakeholders to  develop a national strategic plan to end homelessness. According to the  Council, the Council's work ``has helped drive homelessness down by 9%  and helped 82 communities effectively end veteran homelessness and four  end chronic homelessness'' since 2010.   Even with this progress, the Department of Housing and Urban  Development's 2020 Annual Homeless Assessment Report to Congress found  that on ``a single night in 2020, roughly 580,000 people were  experiencing homelessness in the United States'' and ``2020 mark] ed]  the first time since data collection began that more individuals  experiencing homelessness were unsheltered than were sheltered.''   Clearly, we have more work to do. and if anything, COVID-19 has  further highlighted the critical importance of housing. Indeed, for  many families, their homes may be the single most effective and  accessible form of personal protective equipment. And we also know that  continuing to invest in programs to address homelessness and increase  affordable housing pays additional dividends. According to Crossroads  Rhode Island, a homeless services organization, ``In 2016,  approximately 90% of individuals experiencing homelessness in Rhode  Island were on Medicaid,'' and ``The average annual Medicaid cost for a  person experiencing homelessness in Rhode Island ($14,723) was 80%  higher than that of the average Medicaid recipient ($8,200).'' In  short, helping families avoid homelessness can actually save taxpayers  money.   This is what we call a win-win, and the Council is uniquely  positioned to facilitate a whole of government approach that marshals  the resources of the Council's 19 federal member agencies to help more  communities effectively address homelessness and also potentially save  taxpayer funds. Our bipartisan legislation ensures that the Council's  doors remain open until there truly is an end to homelessness  nationwide.   I thank the many groups that support our legislation including the  National Low Income Housing Coalition, Local Initiatives Support  Corporation, the Council of Large Public Housing Authorities,  HousingWorksRI, and others. I urge our colleagues to join Senator  Collins and me in supporting this legislation.                                  ______                                         By Mr. REED (for himself and Mr. Grassley):   S. 2009. A bill to promote transparency by permitting the Public  Company Accounting Oversight Board to allow its disciplinary  proceedings to be open to the public, and for other purposes; to the  Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.
