 Mr. Speaker, I will submit for the Record  at a later time a notice from both the comptroller and the commissioner  of Revenue Services for the State of Connecticut, who notes that a  married family with a kid in college would see a $767 tax increase next  year and a $1,667 increase in the year 2027.   Mr. Speaker, we have already protested what we think about this bill,  what they have done to this process, the stain that this is on this  institution.   1986 has been cited. No public hearings. We had 30 hearings, 12  subcommittee hearings, 456 witnesses. We have none, and now you do a  bill in double secret probation. You make Dean Wormer look good from  ``Animal House''. This is what is wrong with this process here today.   The cruelest cut is that you perpetrate a $25 billion cut in Medicare  that you don't even have to vote on. That is the worst cut. Talk about  a cowardly act in the night: a $25 billion cut to our seniors. No  wonder the AARP has spoken out so strongly against it.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. All Members are reminded that they should  address their remarks to the Chair.
