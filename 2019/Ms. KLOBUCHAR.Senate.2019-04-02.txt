 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, today I rise to discuss the importance  of upholding the Senate's constitutional obligation to provide advice  and consent on nominations.   Many people refer to the Senate as the world's greatest deliberative  body because the Senate is designed for the careful consideration and  debate of proposed laws and nominations. That is why we have so many  people sitting up in the Gallery today, because they are here to hear  debate.   How we deliberate is governed, of course, by a set of Senate rules. I  am sure some of them seem archaic when our visitors hear about quorum  calls being vitiated, but it is very important to have rules because  rules stay in place no matter who is in charge and no matter what  matter is before us. Rules create a sense of decorum and fairness not  only in this Chamber but for our country.   Only once in the history of the cloture process in the U.S. Senate  has the Senate voted to permanently reduce the time we have to debate  an issue. That happened in 1986, when we went from 100 hours of  something that is called postcloture debate time to the current rule of  30 hours. That basically means there are 30 hours to debate something  really important, such as the nomination of a Supreme Court Justice, an  ambassador, or who is going to be a Cabinet member. That is the way the  rules are now. While there have been contemporary changes to the rules,  we have not seen a permanent rule change since 1986.   The resolution we are considering asks us to make a second permanent  change. What is the backdrop? Last Congress, the Rules Committee  considered a proposal from Senator Lankford to cut off debate on the  Senate floor. The resolution before us is even more damaging because it  would reduce debate time from 30 hours to 2 hours for about 80 percent  of the nominees who come before the Senate--including Federal district  court judges--giving only 2 hours on this floor to debate.   We have time to debate these judges on the Judiciary Committee, but  only a small percentage of the Senators are on that committee, right?  Over 75 percent of the Senators aren't on that committee. We also know  we have had some judges come before us, and we don't find out things  about them until the debate on the floor occurs or Senators haven't  decided how they are going to vote until they actually come to the  floor. We have had judges who were thrown out--who were rejected,  basically--before they came up for a vote because of things that were  discussed among Senators when they were on the floor.  [[Page S2173]]    Let's face it. Most Americans are understandably unfamiliar with the  term ``postcloture'' debate. They don't exactly have the book on Senate  procedures on their reading list, but the issue before us has a real  impact on the daily lives of every person in this country, and we  should be sounding the alarm bells about it.   Healthcare--think of what we just learned this last week when  suddenly the Justice Department for this administration announced they  were going all out to repeal the Affordable Care Act. What does that  mean? Well, for every American--not just Americans who are on the  exchanges under the Affordable Care Act--for every American, it would  mean they would lose their protection for preexisting conditions. It  would mean, if someone has diabetes, if someone has a child with Down  syndrome, if someone in their family had a preexisting condition, their  healthcare coverage would be subjected to the whims of the insurance  companies.   Right now we have protections in place. What does this mean for the  rule we are talking about? In the case that started in Texas, that was  a Federal district court judge who made the decision on that case. The  people who announced it out of the Justice Department at the higher  levels actually went through confirmation on this Senate floor so  people could debate whether they should be confirmed. The people  implementing it at the Department of Health and Human Services, at the  management levels, also go through this Senate for confirmation.   Guess what, America. Now not only is this administration trying to  ram through the repeal of the Affordable Care Act, which would mean you  would lose your insurance if you have a preexisting condition, but now  they are trying to ram through the people who would make the decision-- the people who would do the work.   Instead of having 30 hours to debate a Federal district court judge  just like the one who made the decision in Texas or instead of having  30 hours to debate employees at the Justice Department--managers who  would make decisions or higher supervisors who would make the  decisions--we would get 2 hours. To me, what is this about? It is about  ramming nominations through just like they tried to ram the Affordable  Care Act repeal through the justice system in that announcement last  week.   For every Congress, there are 1,200 to 1,400 positions in the  executive branch requiring the Senate's advice and consent. Under this  resolution, 277 of those would get the full 30 hours of debate,  including the Supreme Court, circuit court, and the Cabinet-level  positions, as well as some of the people who serve on the Securities  and Exchange Commission and some of the Commissions we have. That  accounts for 277, but that leaves many more--over 1,000--who would only  get 2 hours of debate, 2 hours for what are lifetime appointments.  Hundreds of these positions--hundreds of these positions--are lifetime  appointments.   I believe in this place, once called the world's greatest  deliberative body, it is our constitutional duty to fully vet the most  senior people in our government--the people who help ensure our air and  water are clean, the people who lead our military, and the people who  oversee our justice system. It is our constitutional duty to fully vet  our Federal judges, those men and women who receive lifetime  appointments to uphold the rule of law in America.   On behalf of every American, it is our job to make sure the people  nominated to the most senior positions in our government are competent  and qualified. These roles are so important that the rules of the  Senate are designed to ensure that Senators come to a bipartisan  consensus. They don't always do that, but guess what. Sometimes we do.  The purpose of these rules is to reject partisanship so we can get  nominees who will put the good of the country before politics.   If we eliminate this crucial check on our democracy, allowing the  majority party to ram through these appointments, we will undermine our  democracy and our government.   Some of our friends on the other side of the aisle who are trying to  push this through point to the fact that in 2013, the Senate voted 78  to 16 to temporarily change the postcloture rules on debate time, but  it is very important to note that in 2013, the circumstances were very  different from what they are today. Nominations required a 60-vote  threshold. The blue-slip process for all judicial nominees was  respected--unlike now, where it is no longer respected--for the highest  courts in the land, such as the circuit courts. A thorough process--and  this is important--to select qualified judicial nominees was in place  but no longer. Have you seen the statistics that President Trump has  had more unqualified nominees than past Presidents who have been  rejected by this body?   Despite all of this, important Federal positions remained unfilled,  even though qualified nominees were waiting to be confirmed. To address  the issue, a bipartisan supermajority of the Senate supported a  temporary change in the rules, but that is not what is happening today.   The idea that we are facing similar circumstances in this Congress is  unsupported by the facts as well as statements made by some of my  Republican colleagues. The truth is--as we have heard the majority  leader of this body boast--nominees are getting confirmed, some at  paces faster than we have seen in U.S. history.   In 2017, Leader McConnell himself highlighted this fact. He said:  ``Senate Republicans are closing in on the record for the most circuit  court appointments in a president's first year in office.''   Last year, President Trump said:         We have the best judges. We put on a tremendous amount of       great federal district court judges. . . . We are setting       records.    He was right about setting records. In the first 2 years of his  Presidency, President Trump had 85 judges confirmed. That is because  they focused on getting them through, compared to just 62 for President  Obama in the same time period.   President Trump has had 30 circuit court nominees confirmed during  his first 2 years in office. This is more circuit court nominees  confirmed than any President in history.   That is why they have talked about getting these nominees through  like on a conveyor belt. So then the question becomes, why change the  rules? Why change the rules? Why change the rules for lifetime  appointments and give only 2 hours of debate?   This change is not just unnecessary, it would allow fundamentally  unqualified candidates, from judges to administration officials and  Ambassadors, to be confirmed.   The American Bar Association has rated six of the judicial nominees  put forward by the administration as ``not qualified,'' including three  who received that rating unanimously, two of whom were confirmed. In 2  years, more than 30 executive branch nominees and 5 Federal judges have  been withdrawn after initial vetting. Because nominees are being rushed  through the committee process, postcloture time is critical to our job  of evaluating nominees and fulfilling our duty to advise and consent.   For the 78 Senators who do not serve on the Judiciary Committee, this  is a critical time to talk to colleagues and staff about a judicial  nominee's record. Maybe we don't use the whole time debating them, but  guess what happens when you are not marching through these 2 hour  blocks of time. You have more time to talk about nominees to each other  and evaluate their records.   Last year, two nominees were withdrawn from consideration after their  cloture votes had been taken--Thomas Farr, for the Eastern District of  North Carolina, and Ryan Bounds, for the Ninth Circuit, Oregon. The  withdrawal of these nominees happened on a bipartisan basis. Senators  Scott, Flake, and Rubio voiced their disapproval. Bounds' nomination  failed and was withdrawn partly because Senator Rubio changed his mind  during that postcloture debate time. These cases show how critical  postcloture debate time is for considering nominations. He found out  new information that he didn't know before.   Nominees like these clearly demonstrate the importance of carefully  and thoroughly considering nominees for executive branch positions and  lifetime appointments to the bench. The American people deserve  qualified nominees, and it is our job to ensure that we take the time  and care necessary to confirm people who will serve their country with  distinction.  [[Page S2174]]    I appreciate Senator Lankford. We work together on many issues--most  notably, on election security. But this legislation will remove  important checks and balances on a permanent basis, not just on a  temporary basis. It happens at a time when we have seen unprecedented  numbers of judges confirmed on the circuit basis and a total number of  judges much higher than we saw during the same first 2 years of the  Obama administration. We also know that we are getting a slew of  unqualified nominees.   Finally, we know that this administration just keeps trying to push  things through that I consider--and the courts have considered-- unconstitutional.   Right now, we have the President going around Congress and the $1.3  billion of appropriated money that was given for security and saying: I  am just going to take money away what this Congress has appropriated  for other things and use it to build an $8 billion wall.   Not only does that create legal and constitutional issues of eminent  domain at the border, but it also creates constitutional issues about  the separation of powers and the role of this Congress.   We are at a time when this administration has decided to wreak havoc  on people's healthcare by pushing for the repeal of not just part but  of the entire Affordable Care Act, which I noted includes those  provisions that protect people from being kicked off their insurance  for preexisting conditions. The people who make these decisions at the  highest levels--at that sub-Cabinet level, which is right under the  Cabinet level, the judges who are making these decisions on the  district court level, and the workers who are at the higher sub-Cabinet  levels at the Justice Department and at Health and Human Services, who  would make decisions directly about people's healthcare--are the ones  we are talking about with this resolution. These are real issues for  real people. While this may all sound esoteric, this is not a time in  history to be permanently changing the rules and ramming through a  bunch of nominees.   Thank you.   I yield the floor.
