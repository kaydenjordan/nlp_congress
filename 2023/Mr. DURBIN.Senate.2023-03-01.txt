 Mr. President, today the Senate will vote to confirm  Judge Margaret Guzman to the U.S. District Court for the District of  Massachusetts.   Judge Guzman has had a lengthy and distinguished career in public  service and is highly qualified to be a district court judge. Judge  Guzman received her B.A. from Clark University and her J.D. from Boston  University Law School. She then served as a public defender for 13  years and later as a solo practitioner for 4 years. Throughout her  legal career, she tried more than 175 cases to verdict, judgment, or  final decision. In 2009, Judge Guzman was appointed to be an associate  justice of the District Court on the Commonwealth of Massachusetts  Trial Court. Since 2017, she has been the first justice and a district  court judge on the Ayer District Court in Middlesex County, MA. While  on the bench, Judge Guzman has presided over more than 1,000 cases that  have gone to verdict or judgment.   In addition to bringing professional diversity to the courts as a  former public defender, Judge Guzman would also bring demographic  diversity to the bench as the first Hispanic judge to serve on the  District of Massachusetts. The American Bar Association's Standing  Committee on the Federal Judiciary rated Judge Guzman ``qualified,''  and she has the strong support of her home State Senators, Mr. Markey  and Ms. Warren.   I urge my colleagues to support Judge Guzman's nomination.    I announce that the Senator from California (Mrs.  Feinstein), the Senator from Pennsylvania (Mr. Fetterman), and the  Senator from Oregon (Mr. Merkley) are necessarily absent.

Madam President, yesterday was an interesting day for me  personally, but it was an interesting day, more importantly, in the  history of the United States when it comes to the Equal Rights  Amendment.   The Equal Rights Amendment was first introduced in 1923, 100 years  ago--100 years ago. It was proposed by a leader named Dr. Alice Paul.  At the time, she had just won an important victory. She and her fellow  suffragists had just led successfully the campaign to ratify the 19th  Amendment to give women the right to vote in the United States--100  years ago.   Despite this monumental achievement, Dr. Paul recognized that just  the right to vote was not enough for gender equality, but it was the  right starting point. So she devoted the remaining years of her life to  enshrining gender equality in every facet of American life and  particularly into the Constitution with the Equal Rights Amendment.   Sadly, Dr. Paul and her fellow suffragists passed away long before  they could see the ERA become the law of the land, but their legacy  lives on today in a new generation of activists, lawmakers, and  trailblazers who are propelling the movement for equality forward.   The personal side of this relates to the fact that when I graduated  from law school in 1969, I went to work for the Lieutenant Governor of  Illinois, Paul Simon, who later served here in the Senate. One of my  first assignments in the Illinois State Senate was to work for the  passage of the Equal Rights Amendment in the State of Illinois.   The road to ratification has been long and winding. I continue to be  amazed by the proposal. Fifty years ago, it really came down to some  very basic arguments, and the leading argument against the Equal Rights  Amendment was that men and women would have to share public restrooms.  When I say that, you think: Wait a minute. You want enshrined in the  Constitution the constitutional rights of more than half of the people  living in America, and the article came down to a debate over the  future of public restrooms? I have to tell you, that had more to do  with it than almost anything else. I heard that argument over and over  and over again.   The ERA is a rallying cry for Americans young and old for good  reason. As the 28th Amendment to the Constitution, it would ensure that  our Nation lives up to the promise of real equality, and, frankly, it  is a principle that should be enshrined in the Constitution.   Thirty-eight States have ratified the Equal Rights Amendment in the  past half century--the most recent, Virginia in 2020. Thirty-eight is  the exact number needed to certify an amendment to the Constitution.  The only thing standing in the way of an Equal Rights Amendment is an  arbitrary deadline that Congress included in the preamble--let me  underline those three words, ``in the preamble''--of this amendment as  it passed in 1972 clarifying that this was not the controlling but  simply in the preamble, is what the current controversy is about.   During yesterday's hearing on the ERA, we heard from several  witnesses: my own home State Lieutenant Governor, Juliana Stratton, and  a young woman whose name is Thursday Williams, a first-generation  American, a board member of the ERA Coalition, and a senior at Trinity  College in Connecticut. She spoke on behalf of a lot of young people.  She is a college senior. Her compelling testimony was a testament to  the value of her voice in the conversation. I am glad she was there.   After graduating college, Ms. Williams plans to become an attorney.  She said:         [I] fell in love with the United States Constitution in       high school.''    You don't hear that very often, do you?   She said:         What I love the most about the Constitution is how       brilliantly it was designed to adapt to the changing needs of       its people.    She argued that today the American people deserve a Constitution that  guarantees equality regardless of sex, a Constitution that we can use  as a tool to fight discrimination.   She concluded her testimony by asking the members of the committee:         If we continue to hold back more than half of [the] people       [in America] from accessing equal opportunities, what does       that say about us as a country?        How can we be the beacon of freedom and democracy we claim       to be if we don't declare that sex discrimination contradicts       the American dream?    This young college student is pretty smart, as far as I am concerned.  She knew exactly the right question to ask. Generations of Americans  have been waiting for us in Congress to protect their fundamental  rights.   Congress approved the ERA 50 years ago, but in doing so, we imposed  that arbitrary time limit for ratification. That is why our hearing  yesterday was so important. The members of the committee were not  merely discussing the importance of the ERA; we were urging our  colleagues to join us in passing it.   This joint resolution already has bipartisan support in both  Chambers. I want to salute Senator Murkowski of Alaska, with Senator  Ben Cardin, for joining us in cosponsoring this effort. We can't wait  any longer.   I listened to the arguments about opposing the Equal Rights Amendment  in this year, 2023. Fifty years ago, the argument was, we can't see how  we are going to resolve public restrooms. Now the argument raised by  one of the witnesses called by the Republicans was, we are worried  about the impact that an Equal Rights Amendment would have on the  future of field hockey--field hockey. The woman who testified,  representing one of the Koch Industries' entities that have been  created to do politicking, said she couldn't explain to her daughter or  guarantee to her that there wouldn't be some clash as to whether men  could play on her field hockey team.    I would say to her with all due respect--and I have been a parent  myself; still am--that it is time to sit down and talk to her daughter  about the basics, and the basics are the constitutional guarantee of  her rights for the rest of her natural life, not the next field hockey  game.   There is more at stake here, and it probably relates less to her  because of who she is and her family than it does to all the other  women whose lives would be improved by the passage of the Equal Rights  Amendment. That is where we stand today.   There is no room for uncertainty when it comes to protecting equal  rights under the law. That is a lesson that was driven home last year  when the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. For the first time in  history--for the first time in the history of the United States of  America--the Supreme Court ripped away a constitutional right from the  American people. That has never, never happened before.   One of the Supreme Court Justices--by name, Clarence Thomas--made it  clear that this was just the beginning. He was going to call into  question a lot of fundamental constitutional rights, like the right to  privacy, the right to reproductive freedom, the right to family  planning.   So now Members of the Senate have to make a decision during our time:  What kind of America do we want for our granddaughters and daughters--a  country in which the fundamental rights are safe and secure or one in  which the Constitution still--still, 100 years after we started--fails  to recognize fundamental equality on the basis of sex?   I think the hearing was very clear, and I think the issue is very  clear. I know what I want to be able to explain to my little  granddaughter. She is only 3\1/2\ now, but I hope to live long enough  to someday sit down with her and have a serious conversation about  this. I want to tell her that during the course of my life, her  constitutional rights in America were at issue and that we did the  right thing for her and for her daughter and her daughter's daughter  and everyone born in America in guaranteeing basic equality.    Madam President, this week, the Senate confirmed Araceli  Martinez-Olguin to the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of  California.   A first-generation American, Ms. Martinez-Olguin graduated from  Princeton University and the University of California, Berkeley School  of Law, before clerking for Judge David Briones on the U.S. District  Court for the Western District of Texas. From there, she embarked on a  legal career defined by her commitment to protecting the rights of  immigrants, workers, students, and women--from the ACLU Women's Rights  Project to Legal Aid at Work, to the Department of Education's Office  of Civil Rights, and the National Immigration Law Center. In addition  to her experience assisting with legal briefs for cases being  considered by the Supreme Court, Ms. Martinez-Olguin has focused on  dozens of immigration and employment matters, many of which implicated  complex statutory schemes.   The American Bar Association rated Ms. Martinez-Olguin as  ``qualified,'' and her nomination was strongly supported by her home  State Senators, Mrs. Feinstein and Mr. Padilla.   With a career-long commitment to defending equal justice for all, and  a professional background that is historically underrepresented on the  bench, Ms. Martinez-Olguin will serve the Northern District of  California with distinction. I was proud to support her nomination.                            ____________________     Madam President, yesterday, the Senate voted to confirm  Jamal Whitehead to the U.S. District Court for the Western District of  Washington.   Mr. Whitehead's significant trial experience in both government and  private practice and his commitment to equal justice under law make him  an outstanding nominee to the district court. After graduating from the  University of Washington and the Seattle University School of Law, he  joined the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission's--EEOC-- Seattle field office as a trial attorney. While at the EEOC, Mr.  Whitehead was responsible for enforcing Federal employment  discrimination laws, including title VII of the Civil Rights Act and  the Americans with Disabilities Act.   Mr. Whitehead then served as an Assistant U.S. Attorney in the civil  division of the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Western District of  Washington, where he handled both employment and tort matters. He  returned to private practice in 2016 and has continued to focus on  civil rights, including representing individuals who have brought  claims against their employers for harassment, discrimination, or  retaliation.   Mr. Whitehead is President Biden's first judicial nominee living with  a known physical disability, and he will be one of few Federal judges  who understands this experience. He will bring a valuable perspective  to the district court bench. In addition, the American Bar Association  unanimously rated Mr. Whitehead ``well qualified,'' and he has the  strong support of his home-state Senators, Mrs. Murray and Ms.  Cantwell.   I supported his nomination and was glad to see him confirmed.                            ____________________
