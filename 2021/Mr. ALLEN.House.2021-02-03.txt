 Madam Speaker, I thank Congressman Smith for his work on  this important endeavor. I appreciate his hosting this opportunity to  lift up the sanctity of life. I think there would be no debate that  every life is precious and worthy of dignity and respect.   Jeremiah 1:5 says: ``Before I formed you in the womb, I knew you.''   I will repeat that. That is from the Holy Scriptures. ``Before I  formed you in the womb, I knew you.''  [[Page H318]]    The right to life should not be a political debate. We should uphold  the value and dignity of life, even those who are defenseless and not  with us yet.    This January marked the 48th anniversary of the 1973 Supreme Court  ruling on the case of Roe v. Wade that made abortion available  throughout pregnancy for nearly any reason. Since that tragic ruling,  over 62 million innocent babies have been aborted. In the year  following Roe v. Wade, one in every three abortions in the U.S. were  funded via taxpayer funds.   Again, from the Scriptures, Daniel, one of the great prophets, would  not have paid taxes in this country and probably would have gone to  jail on that basis.   Congress made changes so that taxpayer-funded abortions were  prohibited in spending bills, but the Democrats are now placing the  long bipartisan Hyde amendment on the chopping block while President  Biden rescinds important pro-life protections, like the Mexico City  policy, which allows taxpayer dollars to go toward promoting abortion  abroad. We are not only doing it here, we are doing this to the rest of  the world.   As a father of four and a grandfather of 14, I feel very passionately  about protecting unborn babies. Any and all measures that take steps to  ensure the life of an unborn child will have my complete support, and I  will adamantly oppose any that promote or defend such an immoral  practice.
