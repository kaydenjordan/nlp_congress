 Madam Speaker, we live in the greatest democracy in the  world, and I am convinced that the overwhelming majority of Americans  are good, decent people who work hard and play by the rules.   But then, we have people who have no respect for the law, people who  have little regard for the rules, people who spend a lot of their time  trying to figure out how to game the system. Law enforcement officers  call them habitual offenders. The more they get away with, the more  likely they are to engage in misconduct.   Some say it takes courage to hold powerful people accountable, but I  see it differently. I see it as a sense of duty, a regular part of my  job as a Member of Congress.   However, habitual offenders usually don't sneak up on you. They  usually telegraph their intentions time and time again.   On July 27, 2016, in my home State of Florida, then-candidate Trump  said, ``Russia, if you are listening, I hope you're able to find the  30,000 emails,'' thereby inviting foreign interference into U.S.  elections.   Then, the day after the special counsel testified before Congress,  the President, feeling undeterred and emboldened, called President  Zelensky and pressured him to help him rig the elections and chose to  hold much-needed military aid over our ally's head until the  President's demands were met.   Now, I served 12 years on the hostage negotiations team, and I know  that pressure and demands come in many forms. In this scheme, we had  both.   I have enforced the laws, and now I write the laws. But the laws mean  nothing if the accused can destroy evidence, stop witnesses from  testifying, and blatantly refuse to cooperate. I ask you to name  somebody in your community or your family who can do that.   I know the President said that he can get away with anything he wants  to. I come today to tell you that, no, he cannot, because no one is  above the law, and he shall be held accountable.                                time  1900
