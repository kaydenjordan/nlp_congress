 Madam Speaker, I rise to vote to do something.  It is too easy for dangerous people to get dangerous weapons in this  country, and we are either going to do something about it or we are  not.   I want you to imagine for a second that a shooter with an AR-15 goes  into your child's or grandchild's school tomorrow or next fall and  leaves a hole the size of a basketball in their chest or leaves their  head decapitated off their body. Ask yourself what you would ask of the  people who represent you. Would their thoughts and prayers be good  enough for you if that happened to your child? Would they being worried  about their primary election be okay with you?   The people of Uvalde, when I spoke to them, asked me how it is that  somebody who is 18 can't buy beer or cigarettes, but they can go into a  gun store and buy two AR-15s and go kill 20 people.   The teachers who died, the cops who died, the children who died  cannot vote to change the law. Only we can do that. This is our legacy.  Vote ``yes.''
