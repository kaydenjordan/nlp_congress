 Mr. Speaker, I have never met a person who wakes up in the  morning and says: I want to be poor today. That is just not the  reality.   Yet my colleagues across the aisle, and their friends in the White  House, keep pushing this false narrative that people who rely on  government assistance to make ends meet are moochers who take  government handouts and buy drugs.   Mr. Speaker, in my district, 17.9 percent of households rely on SNAP  to feed their families. They aren't lazy. They aren't addicts. They are  hardworking people, some of them with two and three jobs, just trying  to make ends meet.   The United States Government should be making it easier for Americans  to maintain a decent standard of living. Let us end this  administration's war on the working poor and help make better lives for  all of our citizens.                            ____________________
