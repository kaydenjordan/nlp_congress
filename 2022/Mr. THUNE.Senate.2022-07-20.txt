 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, one of the most important bills that we  take up every year is the National Defense Authorization Act, or NDAA,  legislation authorizing funding for our military men and women and the  defense of our country.   The Senate Armed Services Committee passed this year's bipartisan  bill a month ago, and we have less than 2 months of floor time left in  the fiscal year.   The Senate Democrats' focus this month is on a last-ditch effort to  pass some version of their Build Back Better tax-and-spending spree in  hopes, I have to assume, of eking out a few more votes in November.  Apparently, the National Defense Authorization Act will just have to  wait.   As it does every year, this year's NDAA authorizes funding for  critical military priorities. The fiscal year 2023 NDAA continues the  modernization efforts begun several years ago in the wake of the 2018  National Defense Strategy Commission report, which warned that our  Nation's readiness had eroded to the point where we might struggle to  win a war against a major power like Russia or China.   It authorizes funding to improve quality of life for our military  members and their families, which is not only something we owe these  men and women who sacrifice so much for us but is also essential for  recruiting and retaining members of our all-volunteer force. It  authorizes funding to enhance our nuclear deterrence, a key priority  with continued nuclear threats from traditional powers like Russia and  rogue states like Iran and North Korea.   And it continues our strong support for Ukraine. Ukraine no longer  dominates every front page, but for 5 months now, Ukraine has been  fighting a heroic war against Russian aggression. Thanks to support  from allies in Europe and from our own country, Ukraine is still  holding out. In a war that many experts thought could see Kyiv fall  within a matter of days, Ukraine is approaching day 150 of resisting  Vladimir Putin's Soviet-style aggression. In fact, Ukraine continues to  strike painful blows against the Russian military, which has now turned  to Iran for military support.   Later today, Olena Zelenska, wife of Ukrainian President Zelenskyy,  will be addressing Congress. She and her husband have been a beacon for  Ukrainians during this brutal war; and President Zelenskyy's iron  determination, his tireless leadership, and his unflagging commitment  to his people inspire all those who love freedom.   Ukraine is, in many ways, standing up for the whole free world right  now, sending the message that Russia's unprovoked aggression will not  be allowed to stand. And the least we and other free nations can do is  ensure they have the resources they need to carry out their fight.  Russia's war against Ukraine reminds us that nations that value freedom  and security must stand together.   Finland and Sweden are looking to stand with other free nations by  joining the NATO alliance. Vladimir Putin has turned the historic  positions of neutrality in Finland and Sweden into robust public  support to join the alliance, and both of these countries will  strengthen the capabilities and geostrategic position of NATO.   Yesterday, the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations reported the  treaty concerning their accession to NATO, and I hope the Senate and  administration will soon complete their respective roles and approve  Finland and Sweden's membership.   One priority for me in every National Defense Authorization Act is  ensuring that the men and women of Ellsworth Air Force Base in South  Dakota have everything they need to successfully carry out their  mission. Right now, my priority is ensuring Ellsworth remains a  responsive and lethal component of global strike command, with the B-1  bomber leveraging the Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile and its  Long Range Anti-Ship Missile derivative.   As we look to the future, I am working to ensure the base continues  to receive full funding for the many equipment and support facilities  that will be needed for the B-21 Raider mission at Ellsworth. I worked  to ensure full funding for the first of these facilities in last year's  NDAA, including a low-observable coating restoration facility, a wash  rack and maintenance hangar, an expanded flight simulator facility, and  more.   This year's NDAA continues that work with additional funding for the  low-observable coating restoration facility, as well as funding for two  additional construction projects--a weapons generation facility and a  radio frequency facility--that will be needed to ensure Ellsworth is  fully able to conduct the nuclear and stealth B-21 missions.   I have had the privilege of visiting the B-21 production site in  Palmdale, CA. And while the program remains heavily classified, I can  say the six planes under production are impressive feats of American  engineering and that we are honored that South Dakota will be the first  State to host the mission.   But it is not just about the hardware and cutting-edge systems. Our  greatest asset is our people, including the pilots, the maintainers,  and all of the men and women who have answered the call to serve. That  is why I am focused on ensuring our men and women in uniform have not  just the military support they need but the support they need for their  families.   More military families will be moving into the Ellsworth area with  the arrival of the B-21 mission--as many as 250 people per year,  including 100 dependents. I am committed to ensuring that the  infrastructure is in place to provide ample facilities for these  families.   To that end, I worked to include in this year's NDAA an extension of  an authority for the Secretary of Defense to adjust basic allowance for  housing rates if an installation is experiencing a sudden increase in  the number of servicemembers assigned there. This will ensure that  families at Ellsworth  [[Page S3507]]  and elsewhere will have the resources they need to secure appropriate  accommodations.   I am also working to ensure that the Douglas School District is able  to integrate and support Air Force members' children and provide  sufficient classroom space. This NDAA would provide $15 million in  impact aid for schools experiencing force structure changes like the  anticipated growth at Ellsworth with the arrival of the B-21 mission.   I am grateful to Senator Rounds for his assistance getting this  through the committee's markup and to our State's at-large  Representative, Congressman Johnson, for his work to get it included in  the House-passed bill. This expanded program should be a good first  step to help ensure that Douglas School District is able to expand to  meet the needs of new Ellsworth families.   The House of Representatives, to its credit, voted on its version of  the National Defense Authorization Act the other day. But,  unfortunately, the House legislation's total funding authorization is  lower than the Senate bill's number. That is a concern, not only  because we have a lot of priorities to fund but because inflation is  currently cutting into the military's spending power.   Inflation affects American families and businesses, but it also has a  serious effect on our Nation's security. As prices soar across the  economy, the military is able to do less with the dollars that it has  and that can affect troop readiness and the military's ability to keep  up with needed programs and purchases, from weapons to vehicles to  aircraft and ships.   It is essential that the final House and Senate bill include the  Senate's top-line funding number.   In his 1793 annual message to Congress, George Washington said:         There is a rank due to the United States among nations       which will be withheld, if not absolutely lost, by the       reputation of weakness. If we desire to avoid insult, we must       be able to repel it; if we desire to secure peace, one of the       most powerful instruments of our rising prosperity, it must       be known that we are at all times ready for war.    In other words, ``Peace through strength.''   These words hold true in every age. The surest method of securing  peace is ensuring we are prepared for war. As Russia's unprovoked  attack on Ukraine reminds us, there will always be nations who threaten  peace and freedom. And the surest way to prevent these powers from  destroying freedom is to ensure that we present a powerful threat of  our own, a credible deterrent that stops these nations and other bad  actors from wanting to tangle with us. There is no more a certain way  to invite war than to be unprepared to meet the bullies and the  dictators of the world.   The National Defense Authorization Act is one of the most essential  pieces of legislation we take up each year because it helps ensure that  our Nation is equipped to defend itself and to deter aggression.   I hope that the Democratic leadership will consider deferring its  tax-and-spending plans to take up this important national security  legislation in the near future.   I yield the floor.
