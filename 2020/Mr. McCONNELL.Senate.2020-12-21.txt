 Mr. President, yesterday leaders in the Senate and the  House and the Secretary of the Treasury reached a major agreement that  struggling Americans have needed for months.   We are going to pass another historic rescue package to help American  families through this pandemic. We are going to pass full-year  government funding so the Armed Forces and all Federal Departments have  the resources and the certainty they need. And we are going to do both  of these things as soon as possible.   Senate Republicans have been trying since July--July--to get more  targeted, bipartisan relief into the hands of the American people. Back  in July, we proposed to send about $1 trillion to priorities including  a second round of the Paycheck Protection Program, direct checks for  households, and funding for healthcare providers, testing, and K-12  schools--back in July.   Democrats said no. They said they would block anything short of their  multitrillion-dollar leftwing wish list. Here was one headline that  particularly underscores their view: ``$2 trillion or bust: Democrats  draw red line in coronavirus spending battle.''   So, in July and in August, when Republican Senators tried to extend  expiring Federal unemployment benefits, Democrats blocked us. Laid-off  workers lost their benefits.   In September and again in October, as people kept hurting, the virus  kept spreading, and schools tried to find footing, every Republican  voted for a multihundred-billion-dollar package. Both times Democrats  blocked the relief. Their view was all or nothing.   But a few days ago, with a new President-elect of their own party,  everything changed. Democrats suddenly came around to our position that  we should find consensus, make a law where we agree, and get urgent  help out the door.   In a few days of hard work, we have assembled another historic  bipartisan rescue package: just under $900 billion of relief targeted  toward our fellow Americans who need help the most.   I will begin where this pandemic will end: vaccinations. Thanks to  the genius of science and the leadership of President Trump, Operation  Warp Speed has produced safe and effective vaccines. Now, we need to  distribute them nationwide.   This rescue package provides many billions more dollars to expand  vaccine purchasing and vaccine distribution. Until we have won, we need  to keep wearing masks and taking precautions. Even so, more Americans  will fall ill, so this legislation continues to fund health providers  and COVID testing.  [[Page S7888]]    The pandemic has fallen especially hard on children and parents. Our  legislation includes major funding--more than $80 billion--for K-12  schools to reopen safely and get kids' educations back on track. There  are billions more for childcare providers to reopen safely as well, and  new investments in rural broadband will improve both education and  telehealth down the road.   Then there are Americans' personal finances, the impossible kitchen  table questions that millions of working families have faced this year  through no fault of their own.   Back in March, thanks to Chairman Rubio, Senator Collins, and Senator  Cardin, we created a Paycheck Protection Program. It saved small  businesses and helped millions of American workers keep receiving  paychecks rather than pink slips.   It would be insanity for us to have saved these jobs all this time  only to drop the ball with the end in sight, so this bill will send  more than $280 billion to reopen the PPP for a targeted second round,  and we made sure churches and faith-based organizations will continue  to be eligible.   Of course, millions have already been laid off, so months after  Republicans tried to stop benefits from expiring in the first place,  this package will resume a temporary Federal supplement to unemployment  insurance, and it extends other programs for the self-employed and gig  workers that would have expired.   Thanks to the particular leadership and direction of President Trump  and Secretary Mnuchin, households will receive a second round of direct  relief checks--$600 per adult and per child. This is just some of the  aid that will be heading Americans' way in a matter of hours. No  sprawling leftwing wish list, no unconstrained bailouts for State and  local government with no connection to COVID needs--just smart,  targeted, bipartisan policies, what Senate Republicans have been  recommending since the summer.   I cited a figure of $900 billion, but listen to this. The net new  cost--new cost--is less than roughly $350 billion. We are recovering  more than half a trillion dollars in unspent money that Congress had  already set aside and channeling it to these urgent needs.   Thanks to our colleague Senator Toomey, this legislation winds down  some of the temporary emergency powers we lent the Federal Reserve to  make sure our financial system survived last spring.   A lot of talented leaders helped make this happen. Leader McCarthy  has been an invaluable partner. White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows  has been central. Colleagues such as Senators Collins, Murkowski,  Romney, Cassidy, and Portman helped prod the Senate toward consensus  with their bipartisan work. And I just mentioned Senator Toomey.   I want to give particular thanks to the Secretary of the Treasury,  Secretary Mnuchin. Before the pandemic, Steven was already a crucial  partner for the Republican majorities in Congress. We enacted the most  consequential tax reform in a generation. We helped create the  conditions for explosive job growth, wage growth, and record-low  unemployment. Our country had the strongest possible starting point to  weather this storm   This year, the Secretary has been even more essential. He helped  Congress develop and pass the historic CARES Act in record time. It  prevented a complete economic collapse at the hands of the virus. From  drafting CARES to implementing it, to the intervening months, to this  latest package, Secretary Mnuchin has been an extremely capable and  patient partner. He helped guide our Nation through this dark period  toward the daybreak that lies ahead.   On behalf of the Senate and the country, I thank the Secretary for  his countless hours of work and his incredible effectiveness in  extraordinary times.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on a related matter, while this rescue  package will dominate headlines, we are also set to fund the entire  Federal Government on a bipartisan basis.   We must not overlook the tireless work from Chairman Shelby, Senator  Leahy, and our Appropriations Committees in both Chambers. Their hard  work goes beyond just avoiding shutdowns. Full-year funding bills give  our Armed Forces the certainty to make plans and budgets so we can  continue to modernize our capabilities and keep pace with competitors  like Russia and China.   This year's bills also tackle important domestic priorities.  Everything from agricultural research to the fight against opioid  abuse, to border security and law enforcement are provided for. We  aren't defunding the police or abolishing ICE around here--not on our  watch.   Federal law enforcement from the U.S. Marshals to the Border Patrol  will get the resources they need to protect innocent Americans and  uphold the rule of law.   And I want to especially thank Chairman Shelby and Congresswoman  Granger for beating back a number of far-left poison pills. These bills  maintain pro-life guardrails on funding, secure President Trump's  approach to title X, and respect our citizens' Second Amendment rights.   The Senate is about to cast some incredibly impactful votes. None of  us think any of this legislation is perfect, but a big bipartisan  majority of us recognize the incredible amount of good it will do when  we send it to the President's desk.   The American people have waited long enough. I am glad for our  country that we are now moving ahead together.                            ____________________     I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to the motion to  reconsider the vote by which cloture was not invoked on the nomination  of Eric J. Soskin.   I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote for which  cloture was not invoked on the nomination of Eric J. Soskin, and I ask  for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to complete my  remarks before the vote.    Mr. President, with the Senate poised to complete some  major business for the country and wrap up a most unusual year, I want  to express some gratitude to the men and women behind the scenes who  make our work possible.   Passing a historic rescue package and a full-year funding bill would  be a serious undertaking even in ordinary circumstances. And, of  course, this pandemic year has brought anything but ordinary  circumstances to the Senate, just like everywhere else.   For about 10 months and counting, COVID-19 has imposed new challenges  on hundreds of people who are already plenty busy enough.   After much of the Senate worked remotely in April, we came back to  work in early May--like the essential institution that we are. Month  after month, we have taken smart and careful precautions and remained  an exemplary safe workplace. All along, we have not just continued to  govern but completed landmark confirmations and historic legislation  for the American people. None of this would have been possible without  many people beyond the 100 of us with our names on these desks.   I want to thank the Office of the Secretary of the Senate, led by  Julie Adams and Mary Suit Jones. This team encompasses everyone from  the talented professionals who sit on the dais to the Official  Reporters of Debate, to Disbursing and many other offices.   Thanks to our Parliamentarian, Elizabeth MacDonough, who faithfully  calls the balls and strikes. She won the admiration of our temporary  presider, Chief Justice Roberts, before we reclaimed her as the  Senate's own.   Thanks also to Senate Sergeant At Arms--Mike Stenger and Jennifer  [[Page S7921]]  Hemingway and their whole team, from the doorkeepers to the IT team  that stood up enormous telework capabilities almost overnight, to the  workers who clean offices, move furniture, and keep this place running  in hundreds of ways.   Our Architect of the Capitol, Brett Blanton, assumed his role just  before the pandemic hit. He never missed a beat. His team tackled  cleaning in a way that exceeded industry standards, reconceived the  food services, and, again, physically kept the Capitol functioning.   Of course, very special thanks are due to our Attending Physician,  Dr. Brian Monahan, and the entire team he leads. Believe me, they  already had a full-time job caring for Members of Congress and the  Supreme Court. We have leaned on Dr. Monahan in countless ways all year  long. His expertise and wise counsel have been a credit to the Senate  throughout the pandemic.   Here in the Chamber, I want to thank our cloakroom teams, led by Gary  Myrick on the Democratic side and Robert Duncan on ours. Duncan had  only just stepped into his current role when the crisis began to  unfold. He navigated about 10 years' worth of big challenges in his  first 10 months in the top job. Thanks to him and his capable deputy,  Chris Tuck.   Another key group these past months has been our Rules Committee, led  by Chairman Blunt and his staff director, Fitzhugh Elder. The committee  has run point on coordinating many of the changes and adaptions that  have helped keep this body safe. They have done an outstanding job  without enough recognition or thanks.   We are grateful to the men and women of the Capitol Police, led by  Chief Steven Sund, who have stood their posts even when most of the  rest of us have worked remotely. They have stood strong during this  pandemic, during protests both peaceful and otherwise, and during the  other daily operations that they handle with courage and  professionalism.   Across the board, I want to thank all of our Senate staff. Both the  smaller footprint who have continued physically working at the Capitol  and those who kept up their hard work remotely have confronted all  kinds of novel challenges. Our institution and our country are grateful  to you all.   Last but not least, I want to thank my own team. My personal office,  led by departing chief of staff Phil Maxson, has fought every day for  Kentuckians' needs and priorities throughout this crisis. Our State  offices, steered by Terry Carmack, kept us connected to our  constituents in new ways. My communications director, Robert, Steurer,  and all their colleagues who staff these operations are invaluable to  me and to Kentucky.   Here in the Capitol, my leadership staff has given an incredible  amount of themselves to me, to our team, and to the Senate the entire  year.   Remember, this is somehow still the same calendar year that began  with an impeachment trial, continued through the CARES Act, other major  legislation over the summer, a Supreme Court vacancy and confirmation  this fall, and finally the all-out legislative sprint since  Thanksgiving.   First, my two deputy chiefs of staff. Stef Muchow runs our operations  in an incredibly historically complex time to handle operations. She  has worn about 10 different hats all year long--as usual. Scott Raab  handles policy. He has led his colleagues through a legislative year  like no other, from mammoth negotiations and historic rescue packages  to our most particular priorities and everything in between. We have  all leaned on Scott heavily, and he has been indispensable.   Beneath them, within our operation, are a lot of talented folks I am  lucky to have. I want to name them very briefly.   My chief counsel, Andrew Ferguson, offers brilliant advice, from  impeachment to policy to the judiciary.   Robert Karem, my defense policy expert, has brought critical  institutional leadership as 2020 tested everything from national  security to continuity of government.   Jane Lee handles her massive portfolio--and more besides--with  incredible effectiveness and calm under fire, and she sings the best  Christmas carols in the office.   Terry Van Doren is a policy master who delivers for Kentucky and the  country every time.   Erica Suares and Jim Neill are expert liaisons and advisers who keep  me connected inside the Senate and beyond.   Steve Donaldson has been my point man for all things election law  during this election year.   John Chapuis is a seasoned Senate veteran who picked quite the time  to join our team and cover economic policy.   Jody Wright fights to get good people in good positions with good  cheer.   Andy Quinn is a master of words and ideas.   David Popp heads my press team. He, Doug Andres, Scott Sloofman, and  their whole operation keep my message and the Republican conference's  message front and center.   Sarah Steinberg manages my days, and Alex Jenkins manages my office-- both with great humor and even greater professionalism.   Moon Sulfab keeps our technology systems running and our spirits  high.   I have to mention our healthcare expert Jen Kuskowski, who worked  remotely this spring while expecting her baby boy and has been cheering  us on while on maternity leave. We can't wait to get her back.   Thanks to Grace Graham and Peter Oppenheim, whom Senator Alexander  generously shared from his HELP Committee staff to help us in Jen's  absence.   Rounding out our leadership team are crack researchers Robert Utsey  and David Hauptmann; skilled communicators Dylan Vorbach, Valerie  Chicola, Suzanne Youngblood, Emily Hauck, and Katherine Grayson.   Our frontline troops, the jacks-of-all-trades who keep everybody in  line, are Victoria Mason, Elise Stebick, and Spencer Abraham.   Finally, at the head of this entire team is our fearless leader, our  chief of staff, Sharon Soderstrom. Everybody on Capitol Hill and  everybody in Washington knows that Sharon is one of the smartest, most  dedicated, and most effective staff leaders working at any level in any  branch of government. She is my first call and my last call on every  subject. She was in the leader's office before I was. She supported  both Trent Lott and Bill Frist. So I count my blessings on a daily  basis that I am lucky No. 3. Sharon bears the weight of the world on  her shoulders and not only delivers but somehow prioritizes lightening  everybody else's load while she is at it--a walking master class in  leadership.   I am proud of all that we have accomplished for the country in this  challenging year, and I couldn't be gladder to be heading into 2021  with these talented professionals at my side. So I thank them, Mr.  President. I thank them, one and all.                          Vote on Soskin Nomination     I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to legislative session and be in a period of morning business,  with Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, I ask the Chair to lay before the  Senate the message to accompany H.R. 133.    I move to concur in the House amendment to the Senate  amendment to H.R. 133.    I ask unanimous consent that there be 60 minutes of  debate, equally divided between the leaders or their designees; and  that following the use or yielding back of that time, the Senate vote  on the motion to concur without further motions or amendments in order  and that 60 affirmative votes be required to adopt the motion to  concur.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask the Chair to lay before the  Senate the message to accompany H.R. 1520.   The Presiding Officer laid before the Senate the following message  from the House of Representatives:         Resolved, That the House agree to the amendment of Senate       to the bill (H.R. 1520) entitled ``An Act to amend the Public       Health Service Act to provide for the publication of a list       of licensed biological products, and for other purposes.'',       do pass with an amendment to the Senate amendment.                               Motion to Concur     Mr. President, I move to concur in the House amendment  to the Senate amendment, and I know of no further debate on the motion.    I ask unanimous consent that the motion to reconsider  be considered made and laid upon the table.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the immediate consideration of H. Con. Res. 128, which was  received from the House.    I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed  to and that the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon  the table with no intervening action or debate.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that all time  be yielded back.    I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, for the information of all Senators,  here is where we are on the status of the Defense authorization bill.   The Senate has passed this annual bill to support our servicemembers  and our national security every year for the last 59 years. As I  indicated when I filed cloture on the NDAA conference report after  Thanksgiving, my intention was and is to ensure the Senate continues  fulfilling our obligation to the men and women of our Armed Forces.   I hope the President will not veto this bill, which redoubles our  commitment to modernization, advances cutting-edge capabilities, and  equips our military with the tools and resources they need to compete  with our great power adversaries on land, on sea, in the air, and in  cyberspace. These are the steps we need to take to continue to compete  with Russia and China.   In the event that President Trump does elect to veto this bipartisan  bill, it appears the House may choose to return after the holidays to  set up a vote to consider the veto. The Democratic leader and I have  agreed to a unanimous consent request as follows: The Senate will meet  for pro forma sessions only until December 29, when we will return to  session.   In the event that the President has vetoed the bill and the House has  voted to override the veto, the Senate would have the opportunity to  process the veto override at that time.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to executive session and the Committee on Foreign Relations be  discharged and the Senate proceed to the en bloc consideration of the  following nominations: PN1938, PN2024, PN2101, PN2030, and PN2025.   There being no objection, the committee was discharged, and the  Senate proceeded to consider the nominations en bloc.    I ask unanimous consent that the Senate vote on the  nominations en bloc with no intervening action or debate; that if  confirmed, the motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon  the table en bloc; and that the President be immediately notified of  the Senate's actions.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to legislative session for a period of morning business, with  Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn to then convene for pro  forma sessions only, with no business being conducted, on the following  dates and times, and that following each pro forma session, the Senate  adjourn for the next pro forma session: Thursday, December 24, at 10  a.m. and Monday, December 28, at 10 a.m. I further ask that when the  Senate adjourns on Monday, December 28, it next convene at 12 noon on  Tuesday, December 29; further, that following the prayer and pledge,  the morning hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be  approved to date, and the time for the two leaders be reserved for  their use later in the day; finally, that following leader remarks, the  Senate proceed to morning business, with Senators permitted to speak  therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned  under previous order.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 1:47 a.m., adjourned until  Thursday, December 24, 2020, at 10 a.m.                            ____________________
