 Mr. Speaker, this bill is really about mothers  and daughters who earn about 82 cents on the dollar for every dollar a  man earns. It is about mothers and daughters who lose about $1 trillion  a year because of the wage gap.   For those men who don't have a really good reason to vote for it, it  is about the fact that a woman gave birth to every man alive. So for  all of the suffering, we ought to vote for this bill, because we are  here as a result of some woman suffering for us.   At this time, I include in the Record a letter from the National  Committee on Pay Equity.                                                  National Committee                                                   on Pay Equity,                                                     April 14, 2021.      Re Pass the Paycheck Fairness Act (H.R. 7) and vote no on           harmful amendments.         Dear Representative: As the House votes on the Paycheck       Fairness Act (H.R. 7), the National Committee on Pay Equity       (NCPE) strongly urges you to pass the Paycheck Fairness Act,       H.R. 7, without amendments that limit its scope or undermine       its critical protections.        The National Committee on Pay Equity (NCPE), founded in       1979, is a coalition of women's and civil rights       organizations; labor unions; religious, professional, and       educational associations, commissions on women, state and       local pay equity coalitions and individuals working to       eliminate sex- and race-based wage discrimination and to       achieve pay equity. These pay gaps can be addressed only if       workers have the legal tools necessary to challenge       discrimination and employers are provided with effective       incentives and technical assistance to comply with the law.       The Paycheck Fairness Act is one of these urgently required       tools.        Despite federal and state equal pay laws, gender pay gaps       persist, and earnings lost to these gaps are exacerbating the       financial effects of COVID-19, falling particularly heavily       on women of color and the families who depend on their       income. The Paycheck Fairness Act, which has been passed       three previous times by the House of Representatives, mostly       recently in the 116th Congress, offers a much-needed update       to the Equal Pay Act of 1963 by providing new tools to battle       pervasive pay gaps and to challenge discrimination.        Women are increasingly the primary or co-breadwinner in       their families and cannot afford to be shortchanged any       longer. Women working full-time, year-round are typically       paid only 82 cents for every dollar paid to men, adding up to       a loss of more than $400,000 over a lifetime. This wage gap       varies by race and is larger for many women of color: Black       women working full time, year round typically make only 63       cents, Native American women only 60 cents, and Latinas only       55 cents, for every dollar paid to their white, non-Hispanic       male counterparts. Latinas lose more than $1 million over a       40-year career due to the wage gap. While Asian American and       Pacific Islander (AAPI) women make 85 cents for every dollar       paid to white, non-Hispanic men, many AAPI communities       experience drastically wider pay gaps. And even when       controlling for factors, such as education and experience,       pay gaps persist and start early in women's careers and       contribute to a wealth gap that follows them throughout their       work lives and into retirement. Persistent pay       discrimination, often cloaked by employer-imposed pay secrecy       policies, is one factor driving these wage gaps.        The Paycheck Fairness Act updates and strengthens the Equal       Pay Act of 1963 to ensure that it provides robust protection       against sex-based pay discrimination. Among other provisions,       this comprehensive bill:        ends secrecy around pay by barring retaliation against       workers who voluntarily discuss or disclose their wages, and       requiring employers to report pay data to the EEOC        prohibits employers from relying on salary history in       determining future pay, so that pay discrimination does not       follow women from job to job        closes loopholes that have allowed employers to pay women       less than men for the same work without any important       business justification related to the job        ensures women can receive the same robust remedies for sex-      based pay discrimination that are currently available to       those subjected to discrimination based on race and ethnicity        provides much needed training and technical assistance, as       well as data collection and research        The COVID-19 pandemic and systemic racism have exposed how       the work performed primarily by women, and particularly Black       and brown women, has long been and continues to be       undervalued and underpaid, even as the rest of the country is       newly recognizing the essential nature of this work. We       cannot build back an economy that works for everyone without       ensuring that all women can work with equality, safety, and       dignity, starting with pay equity. Passing the Paycheck       Fairness Act would mark a vitally important step toward       ensuring this becomes reality.        We urge you to pass the Paycheck Fairness Act without       harmful amendments that weaken its critical protections.            Sincerely,                                                   Carolyn York,                                                Secretary-Treasurer,                                  National Committee on Pay Equity.
