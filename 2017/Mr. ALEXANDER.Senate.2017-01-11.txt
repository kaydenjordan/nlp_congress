 Madam President, this amendment is an amendment I  believe almost every Senator will want to vote for because this is an  amendment that guarantees that when you walk into the local drugstore,  your medicine is safe because you know that it has been approved by the  Food and Drug Administration.   This amendment clarifies the current law, which says that if you sell  a prescription drug in the United States, it has to be approved by the  Food and Drug Administration. It may be made overseas--and many are,  and they are sold here--but they are approved by the Food and Drug  Administration.   I have the privilege of being the chairman of the HELP Committee, and  I can't tell you the number of impassioned speeches I have heard from  my Democratic friends about the importance of drug safety and the gold  standard for the Food and Drug Administration. So if you are for the  gold standard of the Food and Drug Administration, if you are for  making prescription drugs approved by the FDA, vote yes. If you are  against it, vote no.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator wish to call up his  amendment?    Madam President, I call up my amendment No. 174 and  ask unanimous consent that it be reported by number.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the clerk will report the  amendment by number.   The legislative clerk read as follows:         The Senator from Tennessee [Mr. Alexander] proposes an       amendment numbered 174.    The amendment is as follows:   (Purpose: To strengthen Social Security and Medicare without raiding    them to pay for new government programs, like Obamacare, that have  failed Americans by increasing premiums and reducing affordable health     care options, to reform Medicaid without prioritizing able-bodied   adults over the disabled, and to ensure that any importation does not  increase risk to public health according to the Secretary of Health and                              Human Services)         At the end of title III, add the following:       SEC. 3___. DEFICIT-NEUTRAL RESERVE FUND RELATING TO                     PERMITTING IMPORTATION OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS                     ONLY UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES.         The Chairman of the Committee on the Budget of the Senate       may revise the allocations of a committee or committees,       aggregates, and other appropriate levels in this resolution       for one or more bills, joint resolutions, amendments,       amendments between  [[Page S261]]       the Houses, motions, or conference reports relating to       permitting the importation of prescription drugs, which may       include certifying public health and safety, strengthening       Social Security and Medicare, and improving Medicaid, by the       amounts provided in such legislation for those purposes,       provided that such legislation would not increase the deficit       over either the period of the total of fiscal years 2017       through 2021 or the period of the total of fiscal years 2017       through 2026.    The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.    Madam President, pursuant to section 904 of the  Congressional Budget Act of 1974 and the waiver provisions of  applicable budget resolutions, I move to waive all applicable sections  of that act and applicable budget resolutions for the purposes of the  pending Alexander amendment No. 174, and I ask for the yeas and nays.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?   There appears to be a sufficient second.   The question is on agreeing to the motion to waive.   The clerk will call the roll.   The legislative clerk called the roll.
