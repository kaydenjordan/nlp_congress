 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to praise Mr. George Marable of  Montclair, New Jersey, and his DLV Lounge.   For more than 50 years, Mr. Marable's DLV Lounge was an iconic jazz  club in Montclair, New Jersey, and it showcased some of the most  talented jazz musicians in the country.   However, the DLV Lounge was more than an entertainment venue. As one  musician said, it was central to the local Black community. It was the  home of the Montclair Blues and Jazz Festival, and students from Jazz  House Kids would perform there. It was a place where local artists  could jam with nationally recognized artists. Every night, Mr. Marable  would greet his patrons and musicians alike from his swivel barstool.   It was not only a home for jazz, it was a home for Black culture.   Unfortunately, the DLV Lounge closed last year, but Mr. Marable and  the DLV Lounge will not soon be forgotten. It was a place we could all  go and feel a great community. Mr. Marable is a great man, and we  appreciate all that he has done for our community.                            ____________________
