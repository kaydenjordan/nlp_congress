 Mr. President, I want to thank the Democratic leader. His  strong support of the Dream Act encourages me but, more importantly,  gives hope to the Dreamers across America: young men and women, just  like the one he described, who are living in fear, fear that their time  in America is coming to an end.   This is the only country they have ever known. They have stood in  classroom after classroom and pledged allegiance to the American flag,  the only flag they have ever known. They sing the national anthem. They  believe they are part of America, but as Senator Schumer has reminded  us, they are missing the paperwork. Their parents brought them here as  infants, toddlers, children and never filed the paperwork, never made  them legal, and here they are in this country, searching for an answer,  searching for some hope.   My best basic question to the U.S. Senate and to my colleagues is:  Why do we make this so hard? Why is this so difficult? Don't we all  fundamentally agree on the premise that no young person should be held  responsible for the actions or decisions of their parents? That is what  is happening here. These young people didn't make the key decisions in  their lives; their parents did.   Let me quickly add, because many of the Dreamers say: Senator Durbin,  understand that our parents were doing everything they could to help  us. I couldn't agree more. From a moral viewpoint, their parents were  determined to help their children and were prepared to incur great  risk, even legal risk, to do it. I understand that. I would do the same  thing, and I am not being critical or negative. But the simple fact and  reality is that these young people, because they don't have the  paperwork, don't have a future in America.   The circumstances they face are bleak. Imagine, if you will, the  challenge of college, the challenge of going from high school on to an  education at a university, with no help whatsoever from the Federal  Government. You don't qualify for a penny in Pell grants; you don't  qualify for any help when it comes to government loans. Think about the  challenge of college and higher education without that help, without  the fundamental assistance that millions of young Americans count on.  Dreamers get no help--none. They have to fight their way forward on  their own, and they do it in remarkable and heroic ways.   Over the last break, I was down at Southern Illinois University at  Carbondale--deep southern Illinois, 300 miles or more away from the  city of Chicago--and I sat down with a group of these Dreamers who were  at the university. One young woman had worked so hard to get through  community college and now through the university at Carbondale and  still had two semesters left before graduation. She was telling me  about her struggles--taking time off to work a job, save the money, go  back to school, and here she was where she could see the finish line.  As she sat there and described it to me, she stopped and broke down in  tears. She said to me: Why am I doing this? Because of the announcement  by President Trump, I don't have any future in this country. After all  these years and all this effort, I really don't have a future here.   I don't believe that, and I begged her not to believe it either. She  has a future, an important future in the United States and in the State  of Illinois. She has proved through her determination and hard work  that she is an extraordinary young woman. She is going to get that  bachelor's degree, and I pray that we in the Senate and the House--with  the President--will give her a chance to be part of America.   President Obama did. He created DACA. I had introduced the DREAM Act  years and years ago--16 years ago--when President Obama was my  colleague in the Senate from Illinois. He was the cosponsor. I joined  with Senator Lugar, a Republican Senator from Indiana, writing to  President Obama, saying: Find a way, if you can. Find a way to protect  these Dreamers from deportation until we pass a law that needs to be  passed. And he did it. He created the DACA Program, where young people  could come forward, pay the fine and fee of almost $500 or $600, submit  themselves to a criminal background check to make sure there were no  problems in their background, show proof that they had graduated from  high school, and then--only then--would they be allowed to stay in the  United States for 2 years and not be deported and legally be allowed to  work.   Well, President Obama created by executive order the DACA Program. At  the end of the day, 780,000 of these young people stepped forward. It  was a leap of faith on their part. Each and every one of them had been  raised in America by their parents and carefully schooled in this  belief: Don't raise your head. Don't let this government see us. As  long as we can live in the shadows, as long as we are not confronted  with the legal system, we have a chance to stay. They lived with that  looming over their heads every single day. Then, when President Obama  said to them: Come forward, tell us who you are, where you live; tell  us about your family; and we will give you a chance to stay here  legally under this Executive order, they did it. They trusted in their  leaders. They trusted in their government. They were prepared to make  that leap of faith, at great risk, on the chance that this might be the  ticket they were looking for to a life in America, to be part of  America's dream and America's future.    Then, on September 5, President Trump came forward and announced that  he would abolish this program created by President Obama and that it  would end on March 5, 2018. He established a standard and said: We will  allow those who have to renew during this period of time--their 2-year  DACA protection had expired, and they would have to renew--until  November 5 to file and to qualify for a renewal period. He picked  November 5. For many of them, it was a surprise and a challenge to come  up with the filing fee and to get the papers in on time so that their  protection would continue until March 5, 2018, or beyond. Some of them  did everything they could think of. Some went to attorneys, for  example, to make sure they got this renewal of DACA completed  successfully and accurately.   Now we have learned that something terrible happened in the meantime.  They relied on the Federal Government--particularly, they relied on our  Postal Service--to mail in their applications for renewal. Who would  have argued that that was not a responsible thing to do? I can tell my  colleagues that practicing attorneys across the United States use our  Postal Service regularly.   One attorney sent the renewal to Washington by certified mail so that  there would be proof that it was mailed. He mailed it on October 21.  The problem was that the Postal Service lost the application. It didn't  arrive until a day later, a day past the deadline established by the  President.   That young person has lost the right to renew unless the Department  of Homeland Security comes up with a new ruling on the subject. That is  the complexity of the life of these young people who are simply asking  for a chance to be part of America's future. That is what that young  applicant faced. That is what hundreds of others faced. We believe that  some 8,000 were not able to renew in time and lost their protected  status.   I can't tell you what their future is, but I pray that the Senate,  before we leave this year, will decide the right thing for their  future.   I have come to the floor over 100 times to tell the personal stories  of these young people who are asking for a chance to have the Dream Act  become the law of the land. Some Republican Senators have joined me in  this effort. Notably, Lindsey Graham, the Republican Senator from South  Carolina, has been a cosponsor. Three other Republican Senators have  joined in sponsoring the Dream Act, and more are interested in helping.  The conversations continue on the floor and give me some hope that, at  the end of the day, we will do the right thing, before the end of this  year.   Let me add, too, that having served in the Senate--it has been my  honor to be here for some years--I know the calendar determines your  fate many times in the Senate. The calendar we face could determine the  fate of these Dreamers.  [[Page S7273]]    Here is what it boils down to. If we don't renew the Dream Act before  the end of this year, then it has to be done in January or February.  January and February are well known to be months of little activity in  the Senate and in the House. So if we wait until then, it is not likely  it is going to happen. That is why I am pleading with my colleagues and  the leadership of the Senate: We can't go home for the holidays until  we do this. We can't talk about dreaming of a white Christmas until we  face the Dreamers and the bleak Christmas they face if we fail to act.  I am begging my colleagues on both sides to roll up their sleeves and  join me, sit at the table, and let's get this job done.   There are specific reasons why we should, and I want to tell one of  those stories today, as I have done more than 100 times in the past.   This young lady's name is Priscilla Aguilar. Priscilla was 5 years  old when her family brought her to the United States from Mexico. She  grew up in Brownsville, TX. She was a great student. In high school she  joined a medical magnet program and graduated in the top 10 percent of  her class.   Priscilla was a member of the Health Occupations Students of America,  where she participated in regional and State competitions in biomedical  debate and medical reading. This experience sparked her love for  science.   Priscilla went off to the University of Texas at Brownsville. She  graduated with honors in the winter of 2012 with a bachelor's degree in  biological sciences. Remember, as a Dreamer, she didn't qualify for any  Federal assistance going to school. She had to work at jobs and borrow  money from others to finish her education.   After graduation, Priscilla was accepted into Teach for America, a  national nonprofit organization that places talented college graduates  in urban and rural schools where there are special challenges and  shortages of teachers. It is interesting, isn't it, that this young  woman who was brought here at the age of 5 not only worked so hard for  her own education but was then willing to give 2 years of her life in  the schools of America to help less fortunate students. Do you think  you have an insight into who she is and what her values are?   Priscilla is not alone. Twenty thousand DACA Dreamers are currently  teaching across the United States of America, including 190 in the  Teach for America Program.   Priscilla now teaches biological and medical microbiology at Mercedes  High School in Mercedes, TX. She is the head of the Science Department.  She oversees a team of nine science teachers. She teaches students of  all grade levels and coaches the school's debate team. The team won the  district championship last year and participated in the State  championship.    In 2013, a tragedy struck Priscilla's family. Her mother died  unexpectedly. Currently, Priscilla is caring for her three younger  siblings, all of whom were born in the United States and are U.S.  citizens. In fact, almost 75 percent of Dreamers have a U.S. citizen  spouse, child, or sibling.   Priscilla wrote me a letter, which I will read into the Congressional  Record:         Science and learning are my biggest passions and I want to       keep pushing myself forward so that I can be better equipped       to serve my community and my students. I want to inspire and       encourage all students to pursue careers in science. I want       to be a role model and mentor to students by succeeding in a       science career myself. If I can do it, so can they!    But without DACA, and without the Dream Act, Priscilla and 20,000  other teachers just like her will lose their jobs in America. I am not  exaggerating. DACA gives Priscilla the legal right to work in America.  If she loses that DACA protection on the March 5 deadline, or whenever  her renewal comes up, at that point she can no longer work in the  United States.   This is not an isolated case. I have told the story many times about  28 students at the Loyola University Stritch School of Medicine in  Chicago. They are all protected by DACA. They came to that medical  school in open competition--no quotas, no special slots. They are the  best and brightest. They came from all over the United States because  Loyola University--thank goodness--decided they deserved a chance.  Young people like them all across America who had given up on a medical  education because they were undocumented finally had their chance under  DACA. Twenty-eight of them now are dedicated to becoming doctors.   They can't borrow money from our Federal Government, as I mentioned  before. The State of Illinois, under both a Democratic and Republican  Governor, have created loan programs for them in medical school with  one condition: For every year the State of Illinois helps to pay for  their medical education, they have to pledge 1 year when they finish  their medical degrees in service to our State, in areas where we have  shortages of doctors--medically underserved areas.   So 28 of them now have their fate hanging in the balance, depending  on the fate of the Dream Act. Why? Because to become a doctor, you need  a residency. A residency is a job. A residency means legally working.  If these young people lose the DACA and Dreamer protection, they have  to drop out of medical school. They cannot continue their residency and  pursue a specialty that they have had their heart set on.   That is the reality of our failure to act. That is the reality of  losing Priscilla Aguilar as an inspiring science teacher in Texas, of  losing 28 doctors who are on their way to graduation at Loyola  University, and of literally thousands of others who could make America  a better, more prosperous, and a more just Nation.   Why do we make this so hard? Why do we make it so difficult for these  young people? They have overcome the odds. They have shown their  determination. They have shown their love for this country. Many of  these DACA Dreamers are begging to serve in our military, to risk their  lives for America. Yet we have failed to act. The President draws a  deadline and says: After this point, there will be no more protection  for these young people. That isn't what America stands for. That does  not reflect our values.   I stand here today honored to be the son of an immigrant to this  country. My mother was brought here at the age of 2 from Lithuania.  That immigrant family fought hard when they arrived, as most immigrant  families do. By fate, my mother became a naturalized citizen and her  son became a U.S. Senator. That is my story. That is my family's story,  but it is America's story. It is a story that has been repeated  millions of times over and over. People come here begging for a  chance--a chance for a better life, a chance to make this a better  nation.   These young people and their parents, I might add, deserve that kind  of consideration. What we are considering today doesn't affect their  parents and the Dream Act, but certainly we should give these young  people a chance. I think their parents deserve it, too, but that is a  debate for another day, perhaps. We will see.   In the meantime, I beg my colleagues to join us. Let's do something  right this year, before the end of the year, that reflects our values  of who we are. Let's acknowledge the obvious. Justice demands us to  step up and stand behind these Dreamers.   The moment is about to arrive. Senator Lindsey Graham, my Republican  cosponsor of the bill, said that a moment of reckoning is coming. He is  right. It is a moment of reckoning as to who we are in the Senate and  in the Congress and in the White House. It is a reflection on our view  of America as a nation--a nation of immigrants that has embraced  diversity and become all the stronger because of it.   I yield the floor.

Thanksgiving began as America's national harvest festival, a day to  give thanks for our rich and fertile land and the great bounty of food  it produces.   On this long Thanksgiving weekend, I plan to spend a few hours  reading the latest book from one of my favorite friends whose works  capture in loving detail life on her family's Wisconsin dairy farm, but  even more, the rock-solid values that sustained her family and her  life.   The book is called ``The Round Barn: Biography of an American Farm.''  As one reviewer wrote, reading it ``is like sitting on the porch of an  early 20th century dairy farm and watching an era in American history  pass right before your eyes.''   The Round Barn books--there are three of them now--are the creations  of Jackie Dougan Jackson, a novelist, poet, professor, mentor to  generations of writers, and one of the best-loved residents in my  hometown of Springfield, IL.   She lives in a big, old home in Springfield which, legend has it, was  once visited by another master storyteller, Abraham Lincoln.   Loretta and I are lucky to count Jackie as a dear friend of many  years. She is a kind, creative soul who never fails to reach out to  help others. At the age of 89, she is still filled with energy, empathy  and curiosity about nearly everything.   The Round Barn books keep a promise that Jackie made to her  grandfather W.J. Dougan when she was just 15 years old. She vowed then  that one day she would write a history of the dairy farm that W.J. had  founded in 1906, the farm on which three generations of Jackie's family  lived and worked.   Jackie Jackson throws open the Round Barn doors at the Dougan family  farm to tell us an American story. She gives us a rich history of farm  life at the mercy of the forces of science and the market but grounded  in rock-solid Midwestern values.   Some of those values were painted onto the silo of the family's round  barn. W.J. titled the list ``Aims for the Farm.'' They were: ``#1. Good  Crops; #2. Proper Storage; #3. Profitable Live Stock; #4. A Stable  Market''--and most important of all--``#5. Life as Well as a Living.''   W.J. Dougan was a deeply spiritual man and a hard worker. He  struggled for years to put himself through college and became a  Methodist minister, but encroaching deafness forced him to give up the  religious life he loved.   In 1906, he bought a dairy farm near Beloit, WI.   The Round Barn was built in 1911. W.J. chose the unusual shape  because he believed that a barn braced on a central concrete pillar was  cheaper to build, more efficient for a dairy operation, and less likely  to blow away in a tornado. The Round Barn quickly became a county  landmark.   W.J. marketed himself as ``the Babies Milk Man,'' and he succeeded  through hard work, dedication to his customers and community, and an  unusual talent for spotting and adopting cutting-edge advances in  agriculture. In 1925, he was named a ``Master Farmer'' by a prestigious  agricultural organization, one of only 23 Midwestern farmers so  honored.   Even so, the Great Depression, which destroyed so many family farms  and businesses, nearly wiped out the Dougan Guernsey Dairy Farm. In  1930, bankruptcy papers were drawn up but never filed.   Jackie was born in 1928, the year before the Great Depression, one of  four children of W.J.'s son Ronald and Ronald's wife, Eunice.   Jackie was a natural born writer, a prodigy. When she was 8 she wrote  a short story that took first prize in a Beloit citywide contest. Her  first novel was serialized in the Galesburg Post in Illinois when she  was 10.   She majored in classics at Beloit College, married, and then moved  with her new husband to Ann Arbor, where they both earned master's  degrees.   The couple had four daughters. Jackie would go on to earn a doctorate  in Latin from the University of Wisconsin.   She was teaching writing at Kent State University in Ohio in 1967  when her father suffered a heart attack. Jackie went home and sat at  his hospital bedside for weeks as he recounted stories of life on the  family farm.   Back in Ohio after her father's recovery, Jackie became aware of a  deep longing within her to reconnect with her rural beginnings. As she  described it in one of her Round Barn books:         There has been another clock within her. She didn't set it       nor place it there. It's been geared not to hours but to       cycles; the daily precession of milking and bottling, feeding       and cleaning the yearly procession of planting, cultivating,       harvesting. It's been set to sun, moon, health, cold, wet       dry. But now if there's a heavy spring freeze, she puts on a       coat without sensing the loss of crisp that might result from       too-late planting. If the sky lowers black, she takes an       umbrella without feeling the sway of the hay wagon racing to       reach the barn before the cloudburst. Her dailiness is not       this class, that lecture, the next trip to the stacks. . . .       It was the ground she'd stood on, the air she'd breathed. She       had no special moment, no epiphany to explain the realization       of loss that came over her. She only knows that something       elemental is gone and has been gone for some time. That it's       probably irretrievable, unless she changes the path she's       treading.    So that is what she did. Jackie Jackson changed her life's path. She  moved to Springfield, IL, and accepted a position teaching literature  and writing at an innovative university that was just opening, Sangaman  State University, now the University of Illinois at Springfield.   For years, she had been collecting stories and recollections about  the Round Barn, her family, the dairy's customers, and the townspeople.  Her trove of tales included her own notebooks, stretching back to when  she was  [[Page S7293]]  8, the stories her father had told her from his hospital bed, letters  and notes left by her grandfather, and much more.   She became a sort of detective, finding more letters tucked into  framed pictures, stuck to the attic floor in the old family home all  sorts of unexpected places. Each letter or scrap of paper became a  piece of the family puzzle.   In 1976, she began to fashion the notes and letters into the first  Round Barn book. The book published this month, ``The Round Barn:  Biography of an American Farm' is the fulfillment of her promise to her  grandfather, her magnum opus, a detailed and loving portrait of a way  of life that no longer exists.   The Dougan Guernsey Dairy Farm ceased operating in 1967, just as  agribusiness and large corporate farms were beginning to redefine  American farming.   In 1979, the Round Barn was added to the National Registry of  Historic Places.   By 2012, the dilapidated old structure had become a safety hazard,  and it was torn down, but thanks to Jackie Jackson's beautifully  detailed biography of her family's farm and the people who lived and  worked there, generations from now readers will still be able to visit  the magical world of the Round Barn.   As this Thanksgiving Day, this American harvest festival, approaches,  I am thankful for the Round Barn books that capture a bygone day of  American farming like holograms, and Loretta and I are grateful to our  friend Jackie for giving the world such a gift.   (At the request of Mr. Schumer, the following statement was ordered  to be printed in the Record.)                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                  S. 2148         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Domestic Terrorism       Prevention Act of 2017''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress finds the following:        (1) White supremacists and other right-wing extremists are       the most significant domestic terrorism threat facing the       United States.        (2) A 2009 report from the Extremism and Radicalization       Branch of the Department of Homeland Security concluded       ``that lone wolves and small terrorist cells embracing       violent right-wing extremist ideology are the most dangerous       domestic terrorism threat in the United States''.        (3) An unclassified May 2017 joint intelligence bulletin       from the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Department       of Homeland Security found that ``white supremacist extremism       poses [a] persistent threat of lethal violence,'' and that       white supremacists ``were responsible for 49 homicides in 26       attacks from 2000 to 2016 . . . more than any other domestic       extremist movement''.        (4) According to the New America Foundation, since       September 11, 2001, 76 Americans have died in terrorist       attacks by domestic extremists in the United States. 89       percent were killed by far-right-wing extremists.        (5) The fatal attacks described in paragraph (4) include--        (A) the August 5, 2012, mass shooting at a Sikh gurdwara in       Oak Creek, Wisconsin, in which a white supremacist shot and       killed 6 members of the gurdwara;        (B) the April 13, 2014, mass shooting at a Jewish community       center and a Jewish assisted living facility in Overland       Park, Kansas, in which a neo-Nazi shot and killed 3       civilians, including a 14-year-old teenager;        (C) the June 8, 2014, ambush in Las Vegas, Nevada, in which       2 supporters of the far right-wing ``patriot'' movement shot       and killed 2 police officers and a civilian;        (D) the June 17, 2015, mass shooting at the Emanuel AME       Church in Charleston, South Carolina, in which a white       supremacist shot and killed 9 members of the church;        (E) the November 27, 2015, mass shooting at a Planned       Parenthood clinic in Colorado Springs, Colorado, in which an       anti-abortion extremist shot and killed a police officer and       2 civilians;        (F) the March 20, 2017, murder of an African-American man       in New York City, allegedly committed by a white supremacist       who reportedly traveled to New York ``for the purpose of       killing black men'';        (G) the May 26, 2017, attack in Portland, Oregon, in which       a white supremacist allegedly murdered 2 men and injured a       third after the men defended 2 young women whom the       individual had targeted with anti-Muslim hate speech; and        (H) the August 12, 2017, attack in Charlottesville,       Virginia, in which a white supremacist allegedly killed 1 and       injured 19 after driving his car through a crowd of       individuals protesting a neo-Nazi rally, and of which       Attorney General Jeff Sessions said, ``It does meet the       definition of domestic terrorism in our statute.''.        (6) The Anti-Defamation League's Center on Extremism found       that right-wing extremists were responsible for 150 terrorist       acts, attempted acts, and plots and conspiracies that took       place in the United States between 1993 and 2017. These       attacks resulted in the deaths of 255 people and injured more       than 600.        (7) According to the Southern Poverty Law Center, in 2015,       for the first time in 5 years, the number of hate groups in       the United States rose by 14 percent. The increase included a       more than twofold rise in the number of Ku Klux Klan       chapters. The number of anti-government militias and       ``patriot'' groups also grew by 14 percent in 2015.        (8) In November 2017, the Federal Bureau of Investigation       released its annual hate crime incident report, which found       that in 2016, hate crimes increased by almost 5 percent,       including a 19 percent rise in hate crimes against American       Muslims. Similarly, the previous year's report found that in       2015, hate crimes increased by 6 percent. Much of that       increase came from a 66 percent rise in attacks on American       Muslims. In both reports, race-based crimes were most       numerous; more than 50 percent of those hate crimes targeted       African Americans.        (9) In January 2017, a right-wing extremist who had       expressed anti-Muslim views was  [[Page S7300]]       charged with murder for allegedly killing 6 people and       injuring 19 in a shooting rampage at a mosque in Quebec City,       Canada. It was the first-ever mass shooting at a mosque in       North America, and Prime Minister Trudeau labeled it a       terrorist attack.        (10) Between January and July 2017, news reports found 63       incidents in which American mosques were targeted by threats,       vandalism, or arson.       SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.

A bill to make a technical correction to the provision of  law authorizing a withdrawal and reservation of public land at  Limestone Hills Training Area, Montana; to the Committee on Armed  Services.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                  S. 2157           Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives       of the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.           This Act may be cited as the ``Drug-Price Transparency in       Communications Act''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.           Congress finds as follows:          (1) Direct-to-consumer advertising of prescription       pharmaceuticals is legal in only 2 developed countries, the       United States and New Zealand.          (2) Direct-to-consumer advertising of prescription       pharmaceuticals is designed to cause patients to pressure       physicians to prescribe certain medications.          (3) In 2015, pharmaceutical companies spent more than       $100,000,000 on advertising with respect to each of 16 brand-      name drugs, primarily new and expensive drugs.          (4) Prescription rates of medications advertised directly       to consumers have increased by 34.2 percent compared to a 5.1       percent increase in other pharmaceuticals.          (5) Prescription pharmaceuticals cost more in the United       States than they do in any other country.          (6) The American Medical Association has passed       resolutions calling for the ban of direct-to-consumer       advertising of prescription pharmaceuticals, and to require       price transparency in any direct-to-consumer advertising.          (7) The amount of spending by pharmaceutical companies in       marketing to health care providers is more than 4 times the       spending for direct-to-consumer advertising.          (8) Health care providers are more likely to prescribe a       certain drug if they have received payments or marketing       materials from the manufacturer of that drug.       SEC. 3. PRICE DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENT FOR DIRECT-TO-CONSUMER                     DRUG ADVERTISEMENTS.           (a) In General.--Section 303(g)(1) of the Federal Food,       Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 333(g)(1)) is amended--          (1) by striking ``(A)'' and inserting ``(i)'';          (2) by striking ``(B)'' and inserting (ii);          (3) by striking ``(1) With respect'' and inserting       ``(1)(A) With respect'';          (4) by striking ``this paragraph'' each place it appears       and inserting ``this subparagraph'';          (5) by striking ``No other civil monetary penalties in       this Act (including the civil penalty in section 303(f)(4))''       and inserting ``No civil monetary penalties (including the       civil penalty in section 303(f)(4)), other than the penalties       under this subparagraph and subparagraph (B)''; and          (6) by adding at the end the following:          ``(B) With respect to a person who is a holder of an       approved application under section 505 for a drug subject to       section 503(b) or under section 351 of the Public Health       Service Act, any such person who disseminates or causes       another party to disseminate a direct-to-consumer       advertisement that does not include the wholesale acquisition       cost (as defined in section 1847A(c)(6)(B) of the Social       Security Act) for a 30-day supply of the drug shall be liable       to the United States for a civil penalty in an amount not to       exceed $1,000,000 for the first such violation in any 3-year       period, and not to exceed $5,000,000 for each subsequent       violation in any 3-year period. For purposes of this       subparagraph, all violations under this paragraph occurring       in a single day shall be considered one violation.

A bill to establish a pilot program under the Chief of the  Forest Service may use alternative dispute resolution in lieu of  judicial review of certain projects; to the Committee on Energy and  Natural Resources.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                  S. 2148         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Domestic Terrorism       Prevention Act of 2017''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress finds the following:        (1) White supremacists and other right-wing extremists are       the most significant domestic terrorism threat facing the       United States.        (2) A 2009 report from the Extremism and Radicalization       Branch of the Department of Homeland Security concluded       ``that lone wolves and small terrorist cells embracing       violent right-wing extremist ideology are the most dangerous       domestic terrorism threat in the United States''.        (3) An unclassified May 2017 joint intelligence bulletin       from the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Department       of Homeland Security found that ``white supremacist extremism       poses [a] persistent threat of lethal violence,'' and that       white supremacists ``were responsible for 49 homicides in 26       attacks from 2000 to 2016 . . . more than any other domestic       extremist movement''.        (4) According to the New America Foundation, since       September 11, 2001, 76 Americans have died in terrorist       attacks by domestic extremists in the United States. 89       percent were killed by far-right-wing extremists.        (5) The fatal attacks described in paragraph (4) include--        (A) the August 5, 2012, mass shooting at a Sikh gurdwara in       Oak Creek, Wisconsin, in which a white supremacist shot and       killed 6 members of the gurdwara;        (B) the April 13, 2014, mass shooting at a Jewish community       center and a Jewish assisted living facility in Overland       Park, Kansas, in which a neo-Nazi shot and killed 3       civilians, including a 14-year-old teenager;        (C) the June 8, 2014, ambush in Las Vegas, Nevada, in which       2 supporters of the far right-wing ``patriot'' movement shot       and killed 2 police officers and a civilian;        (D) the June 17, 2015, mass shooting at the Emanuel AME       Church in Charleston, South Carolina, in which a white       supremacist shot and killed 9 members of the church;        (E) the November 27, 2015, mass shooting at a Planned       Parenthood clinic in Colorado Springs, Colorado, in which an       anti-abortion extremist shot and killed a police officer and       2 civilians;        (F) the March 20, 2017, murder of an African-American man       in New York City, allegedly committed by a white supremacist       who reportedly traveled to New York ``for the purpose of       killing black men'';        (G) the May 26, 2017, attack in Portland, Oregon, in which       a white supremacist allegedly murdered 2 men and injured a       third after the men defended 2 young women whom the       individual had targeted with anti-Muslim hate speech; and        (H) the August 12, 2017, attack in Charlottesville,       Virginia, in which a white supremacist allegedly killed 1 and       injured 19 after driving his car through a crowd of       individuals protesting a neo-Nazi rally, and of which       Attorney General Jeff Sessions said, ``It does meet the       definition of domestic terrorism in our statute.''.        (6) The Anti-Defamation League's Center on Extremism found       that right-wing extremists were responsible for 150 terrorist       acts, attempted acts, and plots and conspiracies that took       place in the United States between 1993 and 2017. These       attacks resulted in the deaths of 255 people and injured more       than 600.        (7) According to the Southern Poverty Law Center, in 2015,       for the first time in 5 years, the number of hate groups in       the United States rose by 14 percent. The increase included a       more than twofold rise in the number of Ku Klux Klan       chapters. The number of anti-government militias and       ``patriot'' groups also grew by 14 percent in 2015.        (8) In November 2017, the Federal Bureau of Investigation       released its annual hate crime incident report, which found       that in 2016, hate crimes increased by almost 5 percent,       including a 19 percent rise in hate crimes against American       Muslims. Similarly, the previous year's report found that in       2015, hate crimes increased by 6 percent. Much of that       increase came from a 66 percent rise in attacks on American       Muslims. In both reports, race-based crimes were most       numerous; more than 50 percent of those hate crimes targeted       African Americans.        (9) In January 2017, a right-wing extremist who had       expressed anti-Muslim views was  [[Page S7300]]       charged with murder for allegedly killing 6 people and       injuring 19 in a shooting rampage at a mosque in Quebec City,       Canada. It was the first-ever mass shooting at a mosque in       North America, and Prime Minister Trudeau labeled it a       terrorist attack.        (10) Between January and July 2017, news reports found 63       incidents in which American mosques were targeted by threats,       vandalism, or arson.       SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.

There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                  S. 2157           Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives       of the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.           This Act may be cited as the ``Drug-Price Transparency in       Communications Act''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.           Congress finds as follows:          (1) Direct-to-consumer advertising of prescription       pharmaceuticals is legal in only 2 developed countries, the       United States and New Zealand.          (2) Direct-to-consumer advertising of prescription       pharmaceuticals is designed to cause patients to pressure       physicians to prescribe certain medications.          (3) In 2015, pharmaceutical companies spent more than       $100,000,000 on advertising with respect to each of 16 brand-      name drugs, primarily new and expensive drugs.          (4) Prescription rates of medications advertised directly       to consumers have increased by 34.2 percent compared to a 5.1       percent increase in other pharmaceuticals.          (5) Prescription pharmaceuticals cost more in the United       States than they do in any other country.          (6) The American Medical Association has passed       resolutions calling for the ban of direct-to-consumer       advertising of prescription pharmaceuticals, and to require       price transparency in any direct-to-consumer advertising.          (7) The amount of spending by pharmaceutical companies in       marketing to health care providers is more than 4 times the       spending for direct-to-consumer advertising.          (8) Health care providers are more likely to prescribe a       certain drug if they have received payments or marketing       materials from the manufacturer of that drug.       SEC. 3.
