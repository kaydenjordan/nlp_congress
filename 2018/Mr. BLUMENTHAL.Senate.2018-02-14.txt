 Mr. President, watching the pictures today as I came  to the floor was deeply moving. Even though there is much that we don't  know and a lot of information that we lack about what is happening at  Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, FL, the images of  emergency vehicles and emergency responders and of young people and  children evacuating a school after another tragic incident of gun  violence brings back memories that are searing and harrowing. Once  again, we feel that churning in our stomach, that sense of gut-punch,  and a wrenching of hearts that reminds us of how we felt the day of  violence in Newtown. Yet another school is victimized by gun violence.   We are waiting to learn more of the details, but certainly our hearts  and prayers go to the victims and their loved ones. Our gratitude goes  to the courageous first responders who are on the scene now  apprehending the shooter and administering to the victims and  survivors. My thoughts and prayers are with those students, emergency  responders, parents, loved ones, and the community of Parkland.   Again, gun violence respects no boundaries. It spares no communities.  It victimizes all of us, wherever it happens and whenever, including  the gun violence that kills people every day individually, often  unpublicized and invisible.   My heart breaks to hear that one more school is facing this  unthinkable horror, that again this harrowing scene plays before the  people of America, literally unfolding in real-time. I know that I and  all of the Members of this Chamber share the grief and sympathy and  heartbreak that community is experiencing today.   Mr. President, I want to talk about the Connecticut Dreamers and  share their stories and call for this Chamber to take narrow and  focused action to prevent their draconian mass deportation and protect  them from that kind of very unfortunate outcome.   The Dreamers who would be covered under legislation, which I hope  will pass in the next 24 hours, came here as children. They grew up as  Americans. This country is the only one they know. English is the only  language many of them speak. They go to our schools. They serve in our  military. They support our economy. They believe in the American dream.  All of us believe in the American dream, but so do they. They work hard  and give back.   Deporting the Dreamers would be cruel, irrational, and inhumane-- unworthy of a great country. It would break our promise to the Dreamers  who came forward when they were told they would be given protected  status and would be a violation not only of the American dream but of  the promise made by a great nation.   Gabriela Valdiglesias came to the United States in 2001 from Lima,  Peru. She has lived in Connecticut for 17 years. She works for  Connecticut Students for a Dream, advocating for her fellow Dreamers.  For those workers, she has been working on securing their right to  safety, to higher education, to healthcare, and to live in a country  without fear and discrimination.   She shared with me some of the difficulties her family had while she  was growing up. She and her five siblings are supported by their  parents, who work in minimum-wage jobs. She hopes that if the Dream Act  passes, she will be able to take on some of the economic burden her  parents now carry. She hopes she will be able to make enough money to  support herself and her family.   She is currently in her first year of college, at a community  college, where she has faced many financial challenges. Not being able  to get a job at 18 years old is frustrating and sometimes devastating.  If the Dream Act is passed, she could finish her 2 years at community  college and transfer to a 4-year institution, and she could pursue her  dream of working as a lawyer or in the field of law.   There are countless other stories of Connecticut Dreamers, some  wanting to keep their identities confidential. There is a young man in  Bridgeport who was brought to Connecticut at the age of 5. He was  educated in the Bridgeport public schools. He majored in chemistry and  now attends Fairfield University. He has excelled there. He finished  his first degree and was accepted at the University of California,  Berkeley's physical chemistry program. He had to live under the threat  of deportation because he had no way to apply for permanent lawful  status. While he was continuing his studies here, he lived with the  threat of deportation.   There is a New Britain woman who was born in Mexico and brought to  America when she was 6 years old. The journey was terrifying. She could  barely understand what was happening. She had no idea at 6 years old  that she was entering America in a way that would affect her for the  rest of her life. It was not her choice to come here or to come here in  that way, but it has affected her. In fact, despite her attending  school and then going to college out of State at Bay Path University  and earning a great many leadership positions there, she remains in the  limbo of uncertainty and anguish and anxiety created by the threat of  deportation. She dreams about helping people, making sure that families  with low incomes can have access to occupational therapy. She is  pursuing a master's degree in occupational therapy.   Finally, there is a woman I know who came here from Venezuela. She  was brought here when she was 11 years old. She remembers her mother  telling her that she was going to America to learn English. When they  settled in Norwalk, CT, her mother also told her that she could be  successful if she were bilingual. She began to go to school right away.  Life was difficult at the beginning, and there was a lot to learn. By  the time she was a junior in high school, she stopped trying to get  perfect grades because she feared colleges would not accept her, and  even if they accepted her, she could not be eligible for financial  assistance because she was undocumented.    But she persevered, and she attended community college. She went on  to Western Connecticut State University, and she overcame obstacles  that for many Americans born here would be  [[Page S955]]  insuperable. Now facing deportation, she fears all of those dreams and  all of that work will be for naught.   These Dreamers, in fact, have trusted America. They believed in  America's promise to them. Coming forward, providing facts about their  residence, their family, their job, and Social Security number, they  believed in America. It wasn't a dream. America is to be trusted.  America is the land of opportunity. America is the greatest Nation in  the history of the world. They have a dream that is American, which is  that they will have the opportunity to pursue their full potential as  human beings to give back, to educate themselves, and to better their  lives. That is the American dream.   In Dr. Martin Luther King's ``I Have a Dream'' speech, he said:         When the architects of our republic wrote the magnificent       words of the Constitution and the Declaration of       Independence, they were signing a promissory note . . . a       promise that all men--    And he might have added women--       would be guaranteed the inalienable rights of life, liberty,       and the pursuit of happiness.    The time has long since come for us to help the Dreamers. The time is  today for us to protect them against mass draconian deportation, a  violation of a promise that would be unworthy of America.   The promissory note of this American dream can be made a reality by  this Chamber today and tomorrow.   I understand that some of my colleagues may want to change the  immigration system. It is truly a broken system in need of  comprehensive reform. That task is for another day. Today, we must make  sure that we provide these Dreamers with legal status and a path to  citizenship. That is our moral obligation. That is our job. Let's get  it done.   I yield the floor.
