 Mr. Speaker, we have a choice to make this week. We have a  choice to make whether we are going to fund the United States  Government and to fund the executive branch when that executive branch  is carrying out often unlawful, unconstitutional, but certainly,  unhelpful and foolish mandates that are crushing small businesses and  causing people to lose their jobs, forcing our members of the military  to lose their ability to serve, forcing members of the Border Patrol,  DEA, and hospitals across this country to lose workers because of these  mandates.   Why would anybody in this Chamber vote to fund a government that is  going to mandate that people have to lose their jobs through these  unlawful orders?   And the second thing we have got to decide is whether we are going to  vote for a National Defense Authorization Act that, for the first time  in history, will add women, 18-year-old girls, to the draft, without so  much as a debate in this Chamber.   I think we have an easy call, but we have got to make that call this  week and decide what we are going to do.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
