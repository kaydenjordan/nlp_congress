 Mr. Speaker, I thank both the chairs and the ranking  members for their work on this piece of legislation and, specifically,  helping to combat some injustices.   Injustice number one is this bill works to prohibit once and for all,  finally getting rid of all the toxic discharges out of Lake Okeechobee  into what we call our northern estuaries in Florida. That is fixing  injustice number one.   Injustice number two that this bill specifically addresses is, with  those toxic, poisonous waters there are Corps of Engineers personnel  that are working on top of those, sometimes for 8 or 10 hours a day,  for weeks or months on end. And it actually requires that a letter be  put in the file of those military personnel denoting their exposure to  this so if something happens to them down the road they don't have to  fight like so many of our servicemembers have to fight to get the  appropriate care.   So I thank them for their work in helping to fix injustices in this  specific piece of legislation.
