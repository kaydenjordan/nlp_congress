 Madam President, a little over a month ago I came to the  floor to honor the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, a trailblazer, an  icon, and a friend. I shared what she meant as a personal hero for me  and as a role model to millions of other women. I discussed her  groundbreaking work and how much of what she fought for is now on the  line.   I talked about the message Ruth left before she died, stating her  ``most fervent wish'' that her replacement not be named ``until a new  President is installed.''   It has been 37 days since Ruth died. I miss her. America misses her.  It has also been 37 days since Mitch McConnell declared he would  disregard Ruth's ``most fervent'' wish and move ahead with a corrupt  and illegitimate process to fill her seat on the Supreme Court. Just 8  days--8 days--before the election, when tens of millions of Americans  have already cast their ballots and just 15 days before the Supreme  Court will hear a case that could overturn the Affordable Care Act,  Donald Trump, Mitch McConnell, and their Republican buddies are shoving  aside the wishes of the American people in order to steal the Supreme  Court seat.   Mitch McConnell and the Senate Republicans violated the long- established rules of the Judiciary Committee to rush their nominee  through, giving each other a wink and a nod before they turned a blind  eye to their own rulebreaking. They even violated the rule Mitch  McConnell made up in order to keep one of President Obama's nominees  off the Court long before anyone was voting: no confirmations of  Justices in an election year. So they made up the rules, then they  broke those same rules. They cheated.   Why? Why was it so important that they were willing to turn their  backs on the very rules that they had put in place? Why rush through  this nomination?   Why? Because the Republican Party is scared that they can't win  through the democratic process, scared that they can't win by playing  by the rules, that they can't win when the American people decide the  outcome, that they can't win when elections matter.   What we are seeing today is the last gasp of a desperate party--a  party working to undermine our democracy so that they can keep pushing  their extremist agenda just a little longer, a party that doesn't  reflect the views of a majority of Americans or the values that we hold  dear.   This is a party beholden to billionaires and extremists that is  desperate to keep its grasp on power and willing to break any rule, any  precedent, or any principle to hold on to that power just a little  longer. The Republican Senators bat down every concern.   No Supreme Court nominee has been confirmed this close to a  Presidential election. They say: No problem. Republican Senators plunge  ahead with an illegitimate nomination made by a morally bankrupt  President.   The Rose Garden ceremony to celebrate the nomination turns into a  coronavirus superspreader event. Republican Senators brush it off.  Republican Senators will press ahead with hearings while members of the  Judiciary Committee are in quarantine, and some of them refused to get  tested.   Hundreds of thousands of Americans are dead and millions are waiting  for the Federal Government to finally show up and fight this pandemic.  Republican Senators say: Sorry, no time. Senate Republicans have better  things to do than pass a relief package--things like steal a Supreme  Court seat.   Here is the ugly truth: Donald Trump and his Republican buddies know  that  [[Page S6498]]  confirming Amy Coney Barrett to the Nation's highest Court is their  path to advance an extremist agenda long after the country is fed up  and disgusted with their failures. In the middle of an election, in the  depths of a pandemic, their extremist agenda is all that matters, and  that is why they are so desperate to ram her nomination through the  Senate.   The confirmation hearings were a sham. The conclusion was foregone,  and the nominee spent days ducking and dodging legitimate questions  about where she stands on issues of crucial importance to the American  people. It was little more than a PR stunt.   But what the nominee refused to say was actually very informative.  She refused to say whether the ruling upholding the right to  contraception was correct. She refused to say whether the government  can criminalize a same-sex relationship. She refused to say whether it  is wrong to separate children from their parents in order to deter  immigration. She even refused to say whether climate change is  happening and whether it poses a threat to human beings.   This was no hearing. This was a farce.   Their attempt to remain silent on key issues spoke volumes. It shows  that she believes these critical rights, protections, and values are  debatable, up for grabs. And Barrett's refusal to embrace these  commonsense values shows just how out of step, how extreme, Barrett is  and will continue to be if she is confirmed.   Let's be real. We already know what Barrett is all about. We know why  corporate interests and rightwing zealots are so excited about her, why  so many Republicans will vote to confirm her, and why Trump, who has  handed the judiciary over to the Federalist Society, has nominated her.  It is because she will advance their extremist, conservative agenda.   So her question-dodging isn't a problem for them. It is part of their  strategy to get her onto the Court.   They know where she stands, and so do the American people. We already  know because her record is clear.   Take reproductive rights. President Trump pledged to nominate Supreme  Court Justices who would overturn Roe. Listen to him. He said he would  only appoint someone who would overturn Roe, and then he picked  Barrett. In 2006, Barrett signed a newspaper ad calling for the end of  Roe and describing Roe as ``barbaric.'' She was a member of an anti- choice group while on the University of Notre Dame faculty.   And how would she overturn Roe? After all, Roe is the current law of  the land. But Barrett has that all worked out. She holds a dangerously  radical view on legal precedent.   In a 2013 Law Review article, she suggested that the Supreme Court is  not strictly bound by precedent and that public debate about Roe leaves  open the possibility of overruling it. To state it plainly, Barrett  believes women cannot be trusted to make decisions about their own  bodies. She is a clear and present danger to Roe.   When it comes to the Affordable Care Act, again, listen to Trump  himself. He said he would only nominate judges who will end the ACA  law, judges who would take away healthcare coverage from millions of  Americans. He picked Barrett.   Barrett's record indicates that is exactly what she will do--work to  gut key provisions that protect millions of Americans. She criticized  Chief Justice Roberts' opinion in 2012 upholding a critical part of the  ACA, saying that he ``pushed the Affordable Care Act beyond its  plausible meaning to save the statute.''   In a media interview in 2015, she said that in another Supreme Court  decision that upheld the ACA, the dissenting Justices who wanted to  overturn the ACA had the ``better of the legal argument.''   While claiming just to follow the text of the law, Barrett's record  shows that her purported ``textualist'' approach is nothing but a  facade, merely a cover for her to reach a result that will further the  interests of those with money and power.   Barrett's record isn't just cringeworthy; it is downright alarming.  On November 10, just 1 week after election day, the Supreme Court will  hear a case that will determine the fate of the Affordable Care Act.  And right now, 17 cases that could undermine the right to abortion care  are one step away from the Supreme Court. Twenty-one States are ready  to go. They have already drafted laws they can pass immediately--laws  that could be used to restrict abortion in case Roe is overturned.   And it is not just reproductive rights and access to healthcare that  are on the line. Trump and his Republican enablers want a Justice who  will rubberstamp Trump's racist and xenophobic attacks on immigrants,  from ripping away protections for our Dreamers to rewriting the census.  Once again, this is exactly what Donald Trump told us he would do after  he lost earlier court cases.   Trump and his Republican enablers also want a Justice who will turn  back the clock even more on workers' rights. Trump wants a Justice who  will erode workers' ability to join together and fight for fair pay and  working conditions and to push back against employment discrimination.  We know this is what they want because those are the policies the Trump  administration has pursued and what Barrett's anti-worker record tells  us that she will do.   There is another thing about Barrett's record that deserves special  attention just 8 days before the election. Trump and his Republican  enablers want a Justice who will strip away voting rights, especially  from communities of color and marginalized communities.   Trump wants a Supreme Court Justice who will help undermine our  democracy. We know this because Trump already told us his game plan to  do it. Trump and his Republican enablers are working to make voting as  difficult, confusing, and scary as possible, and they are using every  tool in order to do it.   Trump has lied repeatedly about mail-in voting. He has falsely  claimed it is a source of rampant fraud. Trump's lawyers have sued  States that have taken action to try to help Americans vote safely  during this pandemic by expanding vote-by-mail. And at the same time,  Trump and his cronies are working to dismantle the U.S. Postal Service,  slowing down mail delivery and creating even more barriers to the  ballot at a critical moment in this election.   We have all seen the President's reckless, dangerous statements over  the past few months casting down on the election itself, peddling the  fact-free claim that this election will be ``the most rigged'' in  American history and that he is ``not sure'' that the election results  will be accurate.   Most alarming of all, Trump has repeatedly refused to commit to a  peaceful transfer of power, and he said that he would not accept the  election results if he doesn't win   And as her confirmation hearing shows, Barrett is just the Justice  Donald Trump is looking for. In her hearing, Barrett refused to recuse  herself in a case that might decide the outcome of the election, and  she refused to say whether she believes that a President should commit  to the peaceful transfer of power.   She also refused to say whether voter intimidation is illegal, which  it is; whether the President can unilaterally delay an election, which  he cannot; and whether the Constitution empowers Congress to protect  the right to vote, which it does.   The stakes have never been higher for our democracy. On one issue  after another, on one right after another, Trump and his Republican  enablers have made it clear that they want a Court that will bend over  backward even further for the wealthy and well-connected while running  roughshod over everyone else. They want a Court that will keep them in  power, even when voters have had enough of their fearmongering and  division and graft, and Barrett is their choice to do just that. That  is why this vote is so critical.   A vote for Barrett is a vote to strip healthcare from millions of  people. It is a vote to turn back the clock on reproductive freedom, to  endanger Dreamers and immigrants, to let climate change rampage  unchecked, to imperil efforts to address systemic racism, to support  workers' rights, voting rights, LGBTQ rights, gun violence prevention-- all at risk.   Ultimately, it is also a vote to rubberstamp an illegitimate process  [[Page S6499]]  carried out against the wishes of much of the Nation and against the  backdrop of a deadly crisis that Senate Republicans have ignored as  Americans have died.   Let's be very clear: If Trump and Republicans succeed in ramming this  nomination through, the American people will expect us to use every  tool we have to undo the damage and restore the Court's integrity.   I am under no illusions here. Democrats have fought tooth and nail,  but the Republicans control the Senate. The reason the Republicans are  willing to break every rule to jam through an illegitimate nomination 8  days before the election is that they have realized a truth that shakes  them down to their core: The American people are not on their side.   People all over this country are fighting to reclaim our democracy.  They are registering to vote, and they are voting. They are voting like  never before. They are speaking out and telling their stories. They are  fighting for a democracy that works for all of us, not just for the  privileged few. And they will continue to fight until they have taken  our democracy back from those who have worked around the clock to  undermine it.   Now, I want to spend some time drilling down on what is at stake with  this vote, starting with the impact that dismantling the Affordable  Care Act will have on my constituents in Massachusetts.   I will start with an op-ed that I wrote with Amy Rosenthal, the  executive director of Health Care for All, and Kate Walsh. She is the  president and CEO of Boston Medical Center. It was published in the  Boston Globe, and it was entitled ``The Affordable Care Act and  coverage for Massachusetts residents is at risk.''   Here is what we wrote:         Dave was laid off from his hotel job in March due to the       coronavirus pandemic, and he lost his health insurance too. A       week later, he was rushed to the emergency room with a lung       problem. With support from an enrollment assister, he was       able to enroll in MassHealth coverage that was made possible       because of the Affordable Care Act, better known as       ObamaCare. He is just one of the hundreds of thousands of       Massachusetts residents given a lifeline by the ACA.        Yet, the multi-year effort to repeal the law is coming to a       head at the worst possible time. Just days after the November       election, the US Supreme Court will hear oral arguments in a       case seeking to overturn the ACA. And Supreme Court nominee       Amy Coney Barrett has a clear record on the issue. She has       openly questioned the constitutionality of the ACA, arguing       the Supreme Court's ruling upholding the ACA's individual       mandate was ``illegitimate.'' If she is confirmed to the       court, she may provide the decisive vote to strike it down.       For people like Dave, and more than 23 million others       nationwide, access to health care hangs in the balance.        The need for health care coverage has never been more dire       than during the COVID-19 pandemic. It has laid bare       devastating racial disparities in health care access and       outcomes. The ACA coverage expansions led to progress toward       equity, with the gap with insurance coverage rate for Black       and white adults dropping by 4 percentage points and the       difference between Hispanic and white adults falling by 9.4       points. Instead of building on these important steps,       overturning the ACA would further exacerbate inequities in       access to health care.        The elimination of the ACA would also be devastating for       people with specific health care needs, including 1.8 million       people living with substance use disorders and mental       illness. Protections would also be stripped away from 135       million people who have preexisting conditions like diabetes,       cancer, asthma, and those now who have had COVID-19.       Insurance companies could once again charge women 50 percent       more than men for coverage and impose lifetime caps on       benefits. It would strip a popular feature for families:       coverage for those up to age 26 who have sought coverage on       their parents' plans at a time when youth unemployment has       doubled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.        In Massachusetts, where our state's health reform law       served as a model for the ACA, many falsely believe we would       be protected if the ACA were struck down. This is not the       case. Thanks to the ACA, a number of new protections were       implemented in the Commonwealth: the provision allowing young       people to stay on their parents' plan and the reduction of       prescription drug costs for seniors caught in the Medicare       ``donut-hole.'' These protections could be gone overnight if       the ACA were invalidated.        In addition, an ACA repeal would impact access to health       coverage and healthcare for hundreds of thousands of       Massachusetts consumers. The state's health insurance       coverage expansions were only possible with the partnership       and funding from the federal government. This is especially       true for the expansion of MassHealth, our Medicaid program,       as well as the availability of affordable coverage through       ConnectorCare. Over 375,000 Massachusetts residents could       lose their health coverage and the state stands to lose up to       $2.4 billion in federal funds. These immense cuts would       create a funding gap that would be impossible to fill even       during normal times. The challenge is even greater now:       According to some estimates, Massachusetts may face a deficit       of up to $6 billion as a result of the pandemic. These       funding shortfalls could have devastating implications for       the health care safety net in Massachusetts.        Taking coverage away from people during the worst pandemic       we have experienced in the last century is simply despicable,       and we should all be outraged. Massachusetts deserves more       from its President and from its government. All of us must       speak up, speak out, and make it abundantly clear that the       ACA cannot be repealed.    Speaking up includes speaking up about how the ACA has transformed  people's lives. So many folks in Massachusetts reached out to my office  to share their stories and how they would be harmed if healthcare were  ripped away, so I want to introduce you to a few of those people:  Marleny, Deb, and Charlie.   Marleny is a single mom from Framingham. She receives her healthcare  through ConnectorCare, the plans we have in Massachusetts for low- income families who don't qualify for any other program. Her children  use MassHealth Family Assistance, which is our CHIP program.   She says that, without the help she gets from MassHealth and from  ConnectorCare, she couldn't pay her rent and bring food to the table  for her kids.   You know, the Affordable Care Act helped Massachusetts expand  Medicaid and more affordable insurance plans like the ones Marleny  uses. But if Trump's Supreme Court nominee overturns the ACA,  Massachusetts could lose $2.4 billion in Federal funding. Over 375,000  people like Marleny and her children could lose their coverage.   Deb from Greenfield knows what it is like not to be able to pay for  healthcare. She told me: ``I was an American whom ObamaCare saved at  the very moment I lost my career and my health.'' She writes: ``You  must step in and take action. We cannot sit idly by while our access to  affordable healthcare hangs in the balance.''   Deb is right, and there are millions of people across this country  who have lost their jobs during this pandemic and economic crisis and  could be in the exact same position that Deb was in.   And, finally, I checked back in with my friend Charlie and her mom,  Rebecca, who live in Revere. Charlie and I fought side by side at the  Capitol during the healthcare fights in 2017.   Her mom reminded me: ``Due to severe preeclampsia, Charlie was  delivered at 26 weeks gestation and weighed 790 [grams]--about 1 pound  12 ounces. She was in the NICU for 3 months. Without the ACA, she would  have exceeded a lifetime cap before ever coming home from the hospital.  Additionally, she would have been uninsurable because her birth was a  preexisting condition. With access to health care, Charlie was able to  thrive despite some pretty significant diagnoses. Now, at the age of 8,  Charlie lives a very much typical life.''   Repealing the Affordable Care Act now would be devastating for  Rebecca and Charlie. They can't go back to lifetime caps or sky-high  rates and denied coverage because of preexisting conditions. None of  these families can.   And, like so many policies, Black and Brown communities will be  disproportionately affected if the ACA is destroyed.   I want to read another op-ed I wrote recently that was published in  Shondaland. It discusses the harm of stripping away healthcare for  communities of color, and here is what it says:         Over ten years ago, President Barack Obama signed the       Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) into law.       Since then, we've made progress. Millions of Americans now       have high-quality, affordable health insurance. We no longer       have to worry about being denied coverage because of       preexisting conditions. Millions of young adults can stay on       their parents' plans until age 26. States were given the       option to expand Medicaid eligibility--providing coverage to       more than 12 million low-income Americans.        But now, the ACA is at risk because Republicans are trying       to ram through Amy Coney Barrett's nomination to serve as the       next Associate Justice of the Supreme Court. They are trying       to push her confirmation through at breakneck speed because       just one  [[Page S6500]]       week after the November elections, a case to overturn the ACA       will be in front of the Supreme Court, and Republicans want       Barrett to have their back, cast the deciding vote, and       deliver a deathblow to the law.        Republicans have railed against the ACA from the day it was       passed, making its repeal a tenet of their platform in every       presidential and congressional race. They've tried dozens and       dozens of times to tear it down piece by piece--all while       ignoring the plethora of data that demonstrates the good it       has done for the American people. Among the chorus of ACA       detractors is Judge Barrett. While she tried to claim during       her Supreme Court hearing that she is ``not hostile to the       ACA,'' her record says otherwise. She criticized Chief       Justice Roberts' vote in 2012 to uphold the ACA and wrote       reviews questioning the law's constitutionality. Her       nomination is just the latest Republican attack on the       ACA--and if she is confirmed, Mitch McConnell and Donald       Trump might get their wish and succeed in ripping       healthcare away from tens of millions of people during a       global pandemic.        Here's what that would mean: In the middle of the Covid-19       crisis, insurance companies would instantly be able to       enforce caps on coverage or deny coverage to the 133 million       Americans with preexisting conditions like asthma, diabetes,       and even pregnancy. Covid-19 itself could be considered a       preexisting condition for the millions of Americans who have       survived the virus. The 12 million low-income Americans now       covered by Medicaid expansions would lose their coverage,       including more than 850,000 Americans struggling with opioid       use disorder, [people who] rely on Medicaid for life-saving       medication assisted treatment and counseling services.       Millions of young adults would be thrown off of their       parents' insurance, forcing them to pay out of their own       pockets even as many struggle under a mountain of student       loan debt, stagnant wages, and high unemployment rates due to       the pandemic.        And the damage won't stop there. Repeal of the ACA would       have devastating consequences for Black and brown communities       that disproportionately benefit from its coverage. The ACA       helped narrow disparities in access to healthcare in the       United States and provided millions of Black and brown       families affordable options for care. Without the ACA, one in       every five Black Americans, and one in three Hispanic       Americans would be uninsured. If the ACA is dismantled, Black       and brown communities that benefit from Medicaid expansions       would be kicked off their insurance. In the midst of a       maternal mortality crisis that disproportionately impacts       mothers of color, moms across this country could lose access       to the well woman visits and the maternity coverage currently       required by the ACA.        So let's call out the Supreme Court nomination for what it       is--Donald Trump and the entire Republican Party's big chance       to complete a decade-long partisan attack on the ACA and on       Americans' rights to health care. It's the big chance for a       desperate party to impose its extreme views on the people of       this country because they couldn't actually get it done       through Congress.        The majority of Americans want the Senate to wait until       after the election to choose a new justice. It's because this       is a life or death situation for their friends, their       families, and for tens of millions of their fellow Americans.        In 2012, after yet another attack on the ACA was defeated       in the Supreme Court, Justice Ginsburg wrote that ``the       crisis created by the large number of U.S. residents who lack       health insurance is one of national dimension'' and cited the       ``inevitable yet unpredictable need for medical care'' as a       reason to uphold the legislation. [Justice Ginsburg] was       right. Health care is a basic human right. We fight for basic       human rights. We fight against this nomination. And we fight       any attempt to rip away healthcare from families. We do this       together.    It is not just healthcare for tens of millions of people that is on  the line. A woman's right to make her own healthcare decisions is also  in jeopardy. Roe v. Wade is a landmark case that protects a woman's  right to abortion care. A few weeks ago, I published an op-ed in The  Cut that discusses what this nomination means for the right to abortion  care, and I want to read it now for you. This is what I wrote:         The decision whether or not to bear a child ``is central to       a woman's life, to her dignity. It is a decision she must       make for herself. When government controls that decision for       her, she is being treated as less than a fully adult human       responsible for her own choices.''        Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said that 30 years ago, at her       Supreme Court confirmation hearing. She understood that       reproductive freedom is foundational to equality and critical       to women's health and to their economic security. Without       access to high-quality reproductive healthcare--including       contraception and safe, legal abortion--we cannot have true       equality.        But President Trump, Senate Republicans, and their       extremist allies just don't care. They've spent almost 4       years of the Trump administration--and . . . many years       before [that]--undermining health care and turning back the       clock on reproductive rights. That's why they nominated Amy       Coney Barrett to sit on the Supreme Court. She's the ticket       for a desperate, right-wing party that wants to hold onto       power a little longer in order to impose its extremist agenda       on the entire country.        President Trump and his Republican enablers have tried to       deny this obvious fact. The President recently said that he       ``didn't know'' how Barrett would rule on reproductive       rights, and Republicans in the Senate have fallen in line.       The Republican Party knows the large majority of Americans do       not support overturning Roe v. Wade. They benefit when we       stay on the sidelines--and they want us to sit back and stay       quiet while our fundamental freedoms are on the line.        But we see right through their radical play.        President Trump picked Barrett as his Supreme Court nominee       to take us back in time. Roe v. Wade established the       constitutional right to safe and legal abortion and has been       the law of the land for over 47 years. But over, and over,       and over again, President Trump has bragged about his plans       to appoint justices who would ``automatically'' overturn Roe.       The Affordable Care Act expanded access to reproductive       health care--like no-co-pay birth control--for millions [of       people]. But President Trump has promised to overturn the       Affordable Care Act in its entirety, and sent his Justice       Department to ask the Supreme Court to do exactly that.        Barrett is Trump's ideal candidate to accomplish his plans.       In 2006, she signed a newspaper ad calling for the end of Roe       and describing the decision as ``barbaric.'' She was a member       of an anti-choice group while on the University of Notre Dame       faculty. She's also been critical of the Affordable Care Act       and the Supreme Court's past decision to uphold the law in       court. Her position on abortion and other reproductive rights       are clear: She believes women cannot be trusted to make       decisions about their own bodies.        If Barrett's nomination makes you scared and angry, you are       right to be: 17 abortion-related cases are already one step       away from the Supreme Court. Twenty-one States have laws that       could be used to restrict abortion in the case that Roe is       overturned. And if Barrett's confirmation is rammed through       quickly, she'll have the opportunity--on November 10--to hear       a case about overturning the Affordable Care Act and a       lifetime on the nation's highest court to undermine the       rights and the values we hold dear.        Access to birth control has changed the economic futures of       millions of women, and access to safe abortion care is an       economic issue, too. For a young couple with modest wages and       piles of student loan debt, the decision to start or expand a       family is a powerful economic [one]. For a woman working two       jobs with two kids already in day care, an unplanned       pregnancy can upend budgets already stretched too far. For a       student still in high school or working toward a college       degree, it can derail the most careful plans for financial       independence. Indeed, one of the most common reasons that       women decide to have an abortion is because they cannot       afford to raise a child.        And let's be explicitly clear: If these attacks succeed,       they will have disproportionately negative consequences for       women of color who are already facing some of the most       insurmountable barriers to abortion care.   Rich women will still have access to abortion and reproductive care,  but it will be Black and Brown women--women with low incomes, women who  can't afford to take time off from work, and young women who were raped  or molested by a family member--who will be the most vulnerable.   This is not a moment to back down. Already, it is inspiring to see so  many women and friends of women coming off the sidelines in this fight,  and we must continue to speak up. Call your Senators and make sure this  conversation is grounded in our real experiences. Men must speak up,  too, because reproductive freedom affects us all.   Voting is already underway across the country, and there are only 26  days before the election is completed. And the data shows that most  Americans want to wait until after the election for a new Justice to be  confirmed. Justice Ginsburg gave us our marching orders: Do not fill  this Supreme Court seat until after the election when the next  President is installed. We will fight hard together to honor her wish.   There are countless powerful stories that demonstrate why abortion  rights are so important. I am going to read a few of them. The first is  from my friend and colleague from Michigan, Senator Peters, who became  the first sitting U.S. Senator to share his abortion story. I will just  read an excerpt of that powerful piece that was published in Elle  magazine.         In the late 1980s in Detroit, Peters and his then wife,       Heidi, were pregnant with their second child, a baby they       very much wanted. Heidi was four months along when her water       broke, leaving the fetus without amniotic fluid--a condition       it could not possibly survive. The doctor told the Peters to       go home and wait for a miscarriage to happen naturally.  [[Page S6501]]         But it didn't happen. They went back to the hospital the       next day, and the doctor detected a faint heartbeat. He       recommended an abortion because the fetus still had no chance       of survival, but it wasn't an option due to a hospital policy       banning the procedure. So he sent the couple home again to       wait for a miscarriage. ``The mental anguish someone goes       through is intense,'' Peters says, ``trying to have a       miscarriage for a child that was wanted.''        As they waited, Heidi's health deteriorated. When she       returned to the hospital on the third day, after another       night without a natural miscarriage, the doctor told her the       situation was dire. She could lose her uterus in a matter of       hours if she wasn't able to have an abortion, and if she       became septic from the uterine infection, she could die.        The doctor appealed to the hospital's board for an       exception to their anti-abortion policy and was denied. ``I       still vividly remember he left a message on the answering       machine saying, `They refused to give me permission, not       based on good medical practice, simply based on politics. I       recommend you immediately find another physician who can do       this procedure quickly,' '' Peters recalls.        The Peters were able to get into another hospital right       away because they were friends with its chief administrator.       Heidi was rushed into an emergency abortion that saved her       uterus and possibly her life. The whole experience was       ``painful and traumatic,'' Heidi shared in a statement. ``If       it weren't for urgent and critical medical care, I could have       lost my life.''    Reflecting on the experience now, Senator Peters says it ``enacted an  incredible emotional toll.'' So why go public with it? ``Well, it's  important for folks to understand that these things happen to folks  every day,'' he explains. ``I've always considered myself pro-choice  and believe women should be able to make these decisions themselves,  but when you live it in real life, you realize the significant impact  it can have on a family.''   Peters decided to share his story at this moment because the right to  make such decisions as a family, free of politics, has never been more  at stake. He is alarmed by the threat of Donald Trump's Supreme Court  nominee, Amy Coney Barrett--the threat she poses to women's  reproductive rights. The very conservative nominee once signed her name  onto a newspaper ad calling Roe v. Wade, the landmark decision that  legalized abortion, ``barbaric.'' If Republicans successfully confirm  her to fill Ruth Bader Ginsburg's seat, she could reverse legal  abortion in America or significantly curtail it. ``It's important for  folks who are willing to tell these stories to tell them, especially  now,'' Peters says. ``The new Supreme Court nominee could make a  decision that will have major ramifications for reproductive health for  women for decades to come. This is a pivotal moment for reproductive  freedom.''   Senator Peters is right: This is a pivotal moment for reproductive  freedom. I have heard from so many of my constituents about the  importance of Roe and reproductive freedom. I am just going to share  two of their stories.   The first is from Kate, who lives in Medford, MA. Here is what Kate  wrote:         Most of my life, my strong support for abortion was as       impersonal as it was important. A late bloomer, I barely       dated until I was in my 20s, then quickly met and married my       wonderful husband. Our birth control always worked perfectly.       Anyway, we are both family-minded, and dreamed of building       our family big with lots of kids.        My husband and I had one daughter, planned and loved. But       the second child was not so easy. I suffered three       miscarriages in two years before a baby finally stuck.       Pregnancy brought months of crushing nausea. But the sicker I       felt the better, the doctors said, things must be going       [well]. Healthy, healthy, healthy, they told me, time after       time.        By late may, the end was in sight. Big and ripe and       swollen, I bundled myself into the hospital for an       ultrasound. I brought a tiny sweater to knit while I waited.       After an hour of examination, a doctor entered the dark room.       She saw the sweater and asked, ``Is it for the baby?'' I       nodded proudly and showed her how all the pieces would line       up, just so, to fit my newborn daughter. A month was plenty       long to finish such a small project. ``It's beautiful''.       She told me, her eyes filling with tears.        Then she turned the monitor toward me so that I could see       the big, black fluid-filled holes in my baby's brain.        There was so little that I knew that day. I didn't know       about Dandy Walker Malformation or Agenesis of the corpus       callosum. I knew love. I knew fear. I knew my values. And I       knew that I was in Boston, medical mecca, hub of the       universe.        I learned more about brains in general and my baby's brain       in particular. MRI revealed poor prognosis. My daughter would       not likely ever walk, talk, support the weight of her own       head, or swallow. I learned that infant hospice was out of       the question, and that I could not refuse a feeding tube for       my baby.        Dumbfounded, I asked the neurologist, ``What does a baby       like mine do? Just . . . sleep all day?'' He winced. ``Babies       like yours,'' he explained, ``are not often comfortable       enough to sleep.'' I knew what I needed to do. 35 weeks       pregnant, and I was afraid, even, to tell my husband, my       mother, my doctor, my genetic counselor, but I talked to my       family, and I called the hospital. It was a Friday afternoon.       My doctor was busy delivering triplets. I left a message. ``I       want to know all my options,'' I said. ``All of them.''        She called me back at 6:30 p.m. and talked fast. She gave       me the number of an adoption agency in upstate New York that       specializes in medically complex children.        ``I'm so sorry,'' she said. ``But if you want an abortion,       you have to decide right away. You have to call before the       end of the work day, mountain time. You have to be on an       airplane on Monday, you have to show up Tuesday with $25,000       up front. I'm so sorry,'' she said again. I did not have       $25,000. I didn't know if the number led to a safe, legal       doctor, or if it led to some back-alley quack. I knew only my       desperation. I called the number right away. The woman on the       phone was very kind. She, too, apologized. ``But Dr. Hern       does not practice after 36 weeks, and you'll be 36 weeks on       the last day of your procedure.'' ``Yes,'' of course, I said.       ``Of course. I understand. We'll be there. We'll find the       money.''        And we did. There wasn't one day of open banking before our       trip, so a loan was out of the question. We had to rely on my       family. They were able to increase their credit while we flew       across the country and withdraw funds from their retirement       account to cover the bill later in the month. Without them, I       don't know what would have happened. I know, now, about the       abortion funds. But just as I didn't risk asking if what I       was doing was safe and legal, I didn't want to ask for       financial help. Everything felt so fragile.        I met Dr. Hern and his excellent team with great relief.       They explained the procedure. My third trimester abortion was       humane, gentle, safe--safer, even in the 36th week, than full       term live birth. We laid my daughter to rest in my womb that       first day, a Tuesday. Friday morning, after brief labor, I       delivered her whole and still, into the hands of my savior.       He brought her to me after. She was still warm, but not quite       warm enough.        Dr. Hern saved my daughter from immeasurable suffering. He       saved my family from having to go against our deepest held       values. Dr. Hern saved me from my own desperation. And every       step of the way, he saved my dignity.    I want to share one more story. This one is from Wendy in Greenfield,  MA. I will just read a part of what Wendy wrote. She said:         I know firsthand that overturning Roe--whether overtly or       by chipping away at access to abortion until Roe becomes       meaningless--will not stop women from seeking abortions. It       will, however, deny women access to safe abortions. Abortion       has been with us since women have been getting pregnant, and       will continue to be with us no matter what the politicians       and judges decide. In 1961, I was 17 and abortion was not yet       legal, but I was pregnant and did not want to be. I was       fortunate because I was able to tell my parents, and they       helped me find a doctor--but finding a safe, compassionate       doctor turned out to be a different story.        We knew an illegal abortion could be expensive and my       parents didn't have much money, so we made a plan together       that I would go by myself in the hopes that he would take       mercy on me and charge me less.        I know there were many heroic doctors who helped women back       then at great risk to themselves, but this doctor, who I'm       sure had seen other young women who were alone and without       support, thought he could take advantage instead. I remember       finding the somewhat rundown building and walking up a dark       flight of stairs to his office. There was nobody else there,       just the two of us, the office was untidy and dimly lit with       the window blinds down. And the doctor himself appeared       unkempt and unprofessional. His clothes were rumpled, he sat       too close to me and put his hand on my knee and said ``we       don't have to use the word abortion, dear.'        I knew immediately that I did not want this man to touch       me, let alone perform an abortion, so I did what many young       women in my situation back then weren't able to do: I walked       out. I went back down that flight of stairs and out into the       light of the street. I felt--and still feel--it was a narrow       escape.        So we found a second doctor--and in fact this time it was       my younger sister who had a guitar teacher who knew someone,       because that's how it worked back then--and this time my       mother came with me. We had to go at night to the back door,       and though there was no nurse or assistant, this office was       clean and it looked like a real medical office, and the       doctor looked like a real doctor. But he was not a       compassionate man. As I lay there on the exam table with my       mother in the next room, the doctor lectured me the whole       time, telling me I was a sinner, that the abortion was the       ``wages of sin,'' that he hoped I would learn my lesson, and       he threatened that if I made any noise, he would stop the       procedure, I would have to have the baby, and everyone would       ``know my shame.''        Although my experience was scary and humiliating, my story       is not as horrific as many from that time--I survived,       without injury, as many women did not--but that's because I       was lucky. I was lucky to have supportive parents, I was       lucky they could afford to pay, I was lucky to have a       precocious  [[Page S6502]]       sister, and I was lucky her guitar teacher had contacts, and       lucky he knew of a medically competent doctor. But nobody       should have to depend on luck to get a safe abortion.        Although that doctor tried to shame me, I am not ashamed. I       don't think abortion is shameful and I have never had a       moment's regret. My abortion allowed me to live the life I       wanted and to become a parent when I was able to raise a       child properly and responsibly. This was good for me and my       life, but it is also a social and public health good.       Abortion is a necessary part of family planning and women's       healthcare and denying or restricting access to it means that       women can not safely control their reproduction and therefore       can't really control their lives, which means they can't       participate fully and equally in society. It is bad social       policy to hobble half of the population.        Women of my generation already know what pain and hardship       results from abortion bans, but younger women have grown up       taking abortion access for granted as a right, and I urge       them to speak out and tell their stories. And not only women,       but men, and other family members and friends who have been       involved and who have been affected. Bring up your       experiences in conversation, contact your legislators and       tell them. They are the ones in immediate danger and whose       lives and whose families' lives will be affected.    Senator Peters' story, Kate's story, Wendy's story are just about how  gut-wrenching these decisions are. These are personal decisions that  women should make for themselves.   The Senate has no business taking up a vote on a Supreme Court  Justice who is already committed to taking away healthcare from  millions of people and to take away Roe v. Wade and this protection  from millions of women.   We may not have the votes to stop them, but that does not change the  fact that what the Senate Republicans are doing is wrong. We will  continue to fight it. We will fight it now in the Senate, and we will  fight it come election day November 3.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
