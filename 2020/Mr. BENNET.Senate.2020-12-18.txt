 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, before I give my remarks, I would like to  say that I hope the rumors are true that we are getting close to a deal  here. The country needs us to reach a bipartisan deal, as we did in  March, unanimously, when we passed the CARES Act here.   It is time for us to do that again. In Colorado and all across the  country cases are spiking and the economy is slowing down. People need  relief. They need help. I hope we will come together in a bipartisan  way and do that.   I hope that the deal is not going to come crashing down because of a  disagreement about what the Federal Reserve's authority ought to be  under the 13(3) program. That is an important program for the Federal  Reserve to help when things are really distressed in our economy--to  help our small businesses, our State and local governments, and working  families all over this country.   It is an authority that Donald Trump used--or that the Fed used while  Donald Trump was President. People on both sides of the aisle said it  was an effective authority, and if it is an effective authority for  President Trump, it should not be taken away from the Federal Reserve  just because Joe Biden is becoming President of the United States.   So I hope that we will come to an agreement. I expect that we will. I  hope it is soon. People need the help
