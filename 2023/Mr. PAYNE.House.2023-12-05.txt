 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss President Biden's  successful actions to battle climate change.   In the last 3 years, the Biden administration has protected more than  21 million acres of public lands and water. It launched the American  Climate Corps to mobilize the next generation of clean energy and  conservation workers. It has helped the country cut fossil fuel  emissions in half by 2030.   The President's climate actions have generated more than $350 billion  in clean energy private investment and created more than 210,000 clean  energy jobs in the last 15 months.   Now, the administration continues its climate improvements with a $3  billion pledge to the Green Climate Fund and new standards to reduce  methane emissions and other pollutants from oil and gas operations.  [[Page H6133]]    These actions show the President's commitment to reducing climate  change and supporting America.                            ____________________
