 Madam Speaker, today, the Supreme Court is hearing  arguments on Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, a case that  threatens abortion access throughout the country, not just in  Mississippi where the case originated.   I walked over to see the protesters, the demonstrators, the  supporters, and the objectors. There is a lot of controversy, but the  fact is, standing law in the United States, stare decisis, is that  women have a right to choose.   It is a personal right, and it is enshrined in Roe v. Wade. Roe v.  Wade was enunciated, passed, and approved by the Supreme Court when I  was in law school. The right of a woman to  [[Page H6726]]  choose is part of my political DNA. I hope it never changes.   One of the Justices asked one of the attorneys addressing the Court:  Why don't we just leave it to the States?   Well, one of the last times Mississippi and its confederate States,  all of which have abortion laws that would go into effect if Roe v.  Wade was outlawed--the issue was ``leave it to the States on slavery.''  That was wrong then, and it is wrong now. Women have the right to  choose.                            ____________________
