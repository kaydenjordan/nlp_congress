 DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I thank the Rules and  Appropriations Committee for bringing my amendment to the floor.   My amendment increases funding for the National Institute of Food and  Agriculture Research and Education Activities account by $2 million by  decreasing the Agriculture Building and Facilities account. I am  pleased that my colleague,   Bobby Rush, co-leads this amendment with  me.   The goal of the amendment is to increase funding for the  Multicultural Scholars Program designed to increase the diversity of  the food and agricultural scientific and professional workforce.   Currently, the Multicultural Scholars Program receives only about  $945,000 a year. This level of funding is critically low, given the  current racial/ethnicity gaps in food and agricultural sciences and  given the fact that communities of color were disproportionately harmed  by the dual economic and health crises in our country.   For example, even though people of color represent nearly one-quarter  of the U.S. population, farmers of color comprise less than 4 percent  of owner-operators.   Similarly, about 75 percent of registered dieticians and  nutritionists are White. In contrast, only 4 percent of dieticians  identify as Asian; 3.3 percent as Latinx; 2.5 percent identify as  Black; 1 percent identify as Native Hawaiian-Pacific Islander; and 0.6  percent identify as American Indian or Native Alaskan.   My amendment is an important step to increasing grants to low-income  minority students who attend colleges and universities that serve high  percentages of individuals underrepresented in these fields.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for the opportunity to present.
