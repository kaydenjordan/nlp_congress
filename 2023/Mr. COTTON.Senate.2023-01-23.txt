 Mr. President, in the past half century, Arkansans  have played millions of basketball games, most of which have  disappeared into a blur of fond memories and forgotten scores. For many  of the residents of Jefferson County, however, one game still stands  out from the rest: the 1973 State overall championship final between  the Vaster High School Pirates and the Little Rock Central High School  Tigers.   In that game, the Pirates represented a small rural community of only  a few hundred, against the Tigers of Little Rock, a city of a quarter  million. The Tigers were taller, better ranked, and were defending  champs. Vaster, on the other hand, had overcome great odds just to get  to the championship final, and few thought they had a chance. The  Pirates could have made a halfhearted effort that March day and met  expectations. But that is not what makes a great game and not what the  Pirates had in mind.   When they took the court, Vaster's coaches and players were intent on  shattering expectations, and that is exactly what they did. Far from  being blown out, the Pirates went toe-to-toe with the Tigers. Central  would take the lead, only for Vaster to wrest it away. The Pirates made  the Tigers fight for every pass, point, and inch of progress. And you  better believe they made Central sweat. This climactic battle between  two great teams ended in a one-point Tiger victory, after Vaster missed  a free throw in the last 12 seconds of the game.   Fifty years later, that game still fills many Arkansans with pride.  It remains proof that extraordinary effort, commitment, and drive, even  by teenagers on a basketball court, can inspire and make a difference  years later. That is why I would like to honor the great coaches,  players, and staff of the 1972-73 Vaster High School Pirates: head  coach Herbert Pryor, assistant coach Andrew Carr, Cleveland Allen, Eric  Biley, Samuel Biley, Jr., Reddic Borkins, Jimmy Dade, Carl Evans, James  Evans, Tommy Evans, Roy Franklin, Jimmy Gladney, Homer Jackson, Melvin  Jackson, Charles Petty, Rodney Ryce, Thomas Tarty, Ronnie Grice, Rodney  Crawford, and Jacob Jones.   The State of Arkansas and the U.S. Senate salute you on this 50th  anniversary of your great game.                            ____________________
