 Mr. President, I thank my colleague for his words. I will  add to that, I hope.   As we approach the end of the first session of Congress, I think it  may be prudent to look back at some of the news surrounding the current  state of the Nation's budgetary affairs. Unfortunately, none of the  news is good.   This past summer, Congress passed the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2019,  which increased the last 2 years of the Budget Control Act's  discretionary funding caps. The Congressional Budget Office tells us  that the bill has increased their forecast of the Nation's projected  deficits by $1.7 trillion over the next 10 years.   I will be the first to admit that it is largely due to mandatory  programs, which already have inadequate revenues.   In the fall, we received final tax and spending data for fiscal year  2019. The report showed the deficit for the last fiscal year was $984  billion, even though revenues were greater than ever before. Relative  to the size of the economy, that deficit--an estimated 4.6 percent of  GDP--was the highest since 2012. This also marked the fourth  consecutive year the deficit increased as a share of the economy. These  growing deficits at a time of economic strength should be a warning  sign to all. Yet hardly a whimper was heard.   In October, our national debt hit the $23 trillion mark. It was in  the papers for a while, but interest quickly waned. We simply cannot  continue down this path.   I know the bill before us is well-intentioned, and it contains many  proposals that I support. Chairman Inhofe and Ranking Member Reed and  our Armed Services colleagues have worked hard to deliver the Defense  authorization bill, and I commend them for the work they put into  trying to reach agreement with the House. Unfortunately, CBO tells us  this bill will significantly add to our debt both in the near and long  term. This is much different than the budgetary impact of the bill the  Senate approved earlier this year.   Ultimately, this bill furthers the practice of passing legislation  while ignoring the budget rules of the Senate and our overspending  problem. All of this borrowing will continue to cost us increased  interest payments and will hamstring future generations of Americans.  Congress has the power to correct course now, and I look forward to  working in good faith with the proponents of this legislation. Until  that work can be completed, I have to oppose it.   Mr. President, the conference report accompanying S. 1790 would cause  a deficit increase of more than $5 billion in each of the four  consecutive 10-year periods beginning in fiscal year 2030. A benefit  that isn't funded, once put in place, will never be taken away or even  reduced. This increase violates section 3101 of the 2016 budget  resolution. Therefore, I raise a point of order under section 3101(b)  of S. Con. Res. 11, the concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal  year 2016. Finally, I ask unanimous consent that this point of order be  debatable until the postcloture time on the conference report to  accompany S. 1790 expires.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I rise to discuss the Bipartisan  Congressional Reform Act I introduced with Senator Whitehouse and many  of my colleagues.   Last month, the Senate Budget Committee approved our legislation-- that is the Senate Budget Committee--by a vote of 15 to 6, marking the  first major legislation reported by the committee on a bipartisan basis  in nearly 30 years. I am pleased that 21 Senators have now joined  Senator Whitehouse and me as cosponsors of this bill.   Since I became chairman of the Budget Committee, we have had more  than a dozen hearings on budget process reform. We have met with  budgeting experts, including some outstanding State officials, and we  have listened to insights and concerns shared by colleagues on both  sides of the aisle. Along the way, we collected a lot of good ideas  that we tried to incorporate into our bill, and I thank all those who  contributed.   Now, this legislation will not solve all of our fiscal challenges. It  does, however, represent a good-faith, bipartisan effort to reform our  budget process in a way that encourages long-term planning, realistic  and responsible budget assumptions, and the end to the brinksmanship  surrounding our Nation's statutory debt limit.   This bill will also make evident what needs to be done next. I think  we struck a pretty good balance. The Committee for a Responsible  Federal Budget says the bill ``would improve transparency and  accountability in the budget process'' and would ``make the budget  resolution into a more effective governing tool.''   According to the Concord Coalition, which was founded by some  Democrats, ``This legislation would move the budget process in a very  positive direction.''   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the letters from the  Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget and the Concord Coalition be  printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.   The reason I am giving the speech is to clarify some  misunderstandings of other groups that were commenting on most of the  original version of the bill before amendments from both parties were  adopted in committee.   I will not detail all the reforms in this bill now, but I would like  to highlight a handful of key elements of the bill and hopefully clear  up some misunderstanding about it.   First of all, our bill tries to ensure that we have better  information on which to base budgets. Imagine this for a moment. It  would require better information on which to base budgets and more  active engagement from the tax-writing and each of the spending  committees to ensure that every corner of the Federal budget is  scrutinized and that budgets are realistic.   It would also require the Congressional Budget Office and the  Government Accountability Office conduct portfolio reviews of Federal  spending and tax expenditures to improve the efficiency and  effectiveness of Federal programs.   Here is what that means: It means grouping projects regardless of  which Cabinet Department has jurisdiction so we can see all that we are  doing.   Use housing, for instance. We have 160 programs under 20 agencies. I  can only see 5 reasons--not 160--and they should all be under one  jurisdiction, not several Cabinet jurisdictions. So, currently, nobody  is in charge of setting goals or seeing if they are effective. We are  paying multiple administrators to argue over jurisdiction rather than  results--160 of them.   Secondly, our bill would reorient the budget process from a yearly to  a biannual cycle. Right now, under the Congressional Budget Act of  1974, Congress is supposed to approve a budget resolution each year  that sets discretionary spending levels and provides fiscal parameters  for a legislation brought to the Senate floor.   The budget resolution can also provide special instructions through a  process called reconciliation. What that means is that instructions are  given to authorizing and tax-writing committees to develop legislation  to achieve hopeful and specific budgetary targets. For a variety of  reasons, this process has not worked very well in recent years.  Instead, Congress resorts to passing a series of 2-year deals that set  discretionary spending limits rather than approving the budget.   I need to explain that word ``discretionary.'' Out of all the Federal  dollars spent, Congress only votes on about 30 percent of the money  spent each year. Seventy percent of the spending is on autopilot. That  is mandated to be spent. Discretionary spending is the little amount  that Congress actually votes on.   Under our bill, Congress would approve a budget resolution in the  first year of a biennium that would, among other things, provide  appropriators 2 years of discretionary spending totals, similar to a  practice in recent years. Leadership, not the Budget Committee, has  been negotiating these 2-year spending deals.    Thirdly, the bill would make significant reforms to the content of  the budget resolution. Discretionary spending totals would be included  in the resolution text, where individual Members could amend them.  Mandatory spending totals would be broken up by budget function so we  could see trends in portfolios of Federal spending.   Here is something really new. The budget resolution would also be  required to include a target ratio of debt-to-gross domestic product,  or GDP, which is generally viewed as the best measure of the country's  ability to repay its debt. The hope is that by focusing on our debt-to- GDP target, we could put our country on a glide slope toward a more  sustainable fiscal future. Under the reform bill, that glide slope can  be cutting spending, raising revenue, or both.   Fourth, the bill would provide a mechanism to conform our country's  statutory debt limit to the levels in the resolution. This will help  incorporate the debt limit into our fiscal planning and provide a  powerful incentive to ensure that the targets set in the resolution are  attainable.   Neither side relishes voting to increase the debt limit, as it is  easy fodder for political opponents. Yet there is nearly universal  agreement that default would be unacceptable. Our bill tackles this  issue in a way that it maintains the debt limit as a tool to ensure  fiscal responsibility, while removing the brinksmanship surrounding the  potential default.   Fifth, our bill would provide a means to initiate reconciliation in  the second year of the biennium if Congress isn't living by its fiscal  plan. There has been a lot of confusion about this process, so let me  take a moment to explain it.   As I just mentioned, under our bill, each budget resolution would  include 2 years' worth of discretionary spending levels and a debt-to- GDP target for the final year of the budget. That means each new  Congress would set its own spending levels and debt targets in its  budget agreement, and it would not be bound by the targets established  by its predecessors.   If, in the second year of the biennium, the Congressional Budget  Office finds that Congress is not on track to meet its debt-to-GDP  target, then a special reconciliation process is made available. This  is akin to what can already be done under current law if you pass a  budget resolution in the second year of Congress, but because we are  giving appropriators 2 years of discretionary spending levels upfront,  we created a new process in the second year if Congress misses its  fiscal goals. Contrary to a misconception that has been circulated,  however, there is nothing automatic about this process.   Before reconciliation can proceed, the Senate Budget Committee, which  will be renamed the Committee on Fiscal Control and the Budget, would  need to approve a resolution providing deficit-reducing reconciliation  instructions to one or more committees.   That resolution, which would be amendable, would then be considered  by the full Senate. We have added protections to ensure that Senators  have the ability to offer amendments and have built in flexibility for  unforeseen realities, including economic downturns. We also applied the  existing burden rule to this process, which means it cannot be used to  make changes to Social Security.  [[Page S7081]]    Senators could offer amendments to reduce the amount of the deficit  reduction called for or they can decide they don't want to proceed with  this process at all. If they do decide to move forward with this  special reconciliation, each committee that received an instruction  would then report legislation within its jurisdiction to reduce the  deficit. The instructions themselves could not dictate what particular  programs are to be included in the reconciliation legislation. That is  left up to the authorizing and the tax-writing committees that have  specific policy expertise. One thing the instructions could not do is  increase the deficit.   After each committee approves its instructions, all the  recommendations would then be sent to the Committee on Fiscal Control  and Budget, where, again, they would need to be approved and reported  to the full Senate. After that step, the legislation would come to the  floor, where it could be subject to unlimited amendments, giving every  Senator another opportunity to support, amend, or oppose the  legislation.   Each of these steps affords the Members the opportunity to have their  ideas incorporated into the special reconciliation or to try to stop it  altogether.   In addition, a similar process would have to play out in the House of  Representatives, and the final bill would have to be signed by the  President before any policy changes could be enacted.   In general, our legislation does not attempt to prescribe House  procedures. That is in deference to the House and the constitutional  prerogative of each Chamber of Congress to develop its own rules.   I have heard some concerns that this sets up a one-sided bet that  could dictate spending cuts over revenue increases because only the  House of Representatives can initiate revenue measures. That was never  my intention, and during the Budget Committee markup to our  legislation, a substitute amendment that Senator Whitehouse and I  drafted was adopted that would allow the Senate to deem a revenue  measure approved by the House as a special reconciliation vehicle. I  look forward to working with the House on addressing the procedural  issues.   The intent of our special reconciliation process is to force a  conversation about our growing debt and deficits, not to dictate what  the outcome of that conversation will be.   As the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget said, the  criticisms that this bill is somehow a threat to low-income programs  ``is largely misplaced.'' As the group said, ``The tool would not  automate any changes to spending or revenue, but would instead  establish a process to consider deficit reduction measures. These  measures would have to pass the Senate and the House and be signed by  the President (a veto override system is also possible). Unlike current  reconciliation rules, which have been used to pass deficit-finance tax  cuts, this process is limited to deficit reduction and could help  policymakers agree to new revenue and to reforms to improve healthcare  programs. And long-term deficit reduction can easily co-exist with  near-term measures to counter a recession.''   Finally, our bill would prioritize budget transparency. It would give  the Senate new budget enforcement tools, and it would remove one of the  disincentives to bringing the budget to the floor by fixing the process  known as vote-arama.   In developing our legislation, I specifically set out to establish a  process that would allow us to be thoughtful and deliberate in our  fiscal decision making, while avoiding the automatic spending cuts over  the last decade, known as sequestration.   Under this bill, sequestration is gone. Our bill would not tilt the  scales toward one party, ideology, or policy. Rather, it aims to create  a neutral process to guide Congress in making reasoned budget  decisions. Each Congress will decide what fiscal policy changes may be  necessary, whether that means less spending, more revenue, or a  combination of the two.   We cannot be content to bury our heads in the sand as our more than  $23 trillion debt grows unchecked, swallowing the opportunities of  future generations. If you, like me, want to see Congress get back to  actual budgeting and tackling the difficult fiscal issues that we all  need to be addressed, then, please join me in supporting the bill. If  you have suggestions on how to make it better, I want to hear them. We  are always open to new ideas, and I think we have demonstrated it.   With that, I recognize my colleague, who helped to work on this bill.  In addition to working on this bill, he was on the special committee  for the Budget. It was a joint effort between the House and the Senate,  and many of the ideas he brought to this bill from that committee.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                 Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget        Enzi-Whitehouse Budget Process Bill Includes Important Reforms       Nov. 21 2019--Budget Process        The Senate Budget Committee recently marked up and reported       bipartisan legislation to reform the budget process. The       Bipartisan Congressional Budget Reform Act, introduced by       Chairman Mike Enzi (R-WY) and Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-      RI), would improve transparency and accountability in the       budget process. It would make the budget resolution into a       more effective governing tool by making it easier for       policymakers to choose fiscal targets and stick with them.       That, we hope, would mean putting the debt on a more       sustainable path. The Senate Budget Committee approved the       legislation by a vote of 15 to 6, and it currently has 19       bipartisan cosponsors in the Senate.        While there may be room to make improvements and       adjustments to the bill and some amendments were adopted in       committee, the legislation is a thoughtful, realistic, and       helpful approach to improve the budget process on a       bipartisan basis. Congress should build on and enact some       version of this proposal.      What's in the Bipartisan Congressional Budget Reform Act?        The Bipartisan Congressional Budget Reform Act is the       result of years of effort, building on several past proposals       including those from Chairman Enzi, Senator Whitehouse, the       recent Joint Select Committee on Budget and Appropriations       Process Reform (JSC), and even our own Better Budget Process       Initiative recommendations.        The proposal would incorporate debt-to-Gross-Domestic-      Product (GDP) targets into the budget resolution and the       budget process, adopt biennial budgeting while keeping annual       appropriations, link debt limit increases and discretionary       spending caps to passage of a budget resolution, and add       transparency requirements such as including interest costs in       Congressional Budget Office (CBO) scores.        A brief summary of the bill is available from the Senate       Budget Committee.        How Might the Fiscal Targets in the Bipartisan       Congressional Budget Reform Act Improve Fiscal Outcomes?        A key aspect is expanding the fiscal goals included in the       budget process. Specifically, budget resolutions would set       targets for the ratio of debt held by the public to Gross       Domestic Product (GDP). Congress would set these targets in a       joint budget resolution every odd-numbered year, and the       Congressional Budget Office (CBO) would evaluate adherence to       the target in even-numbered years. Adopting a budget       resolution would automatically spin off debt-limit-increase       legislation to be signed by the President as well as a       special reconciliation process in some cases. Setting fiscal       goals is an incredibly important first step toward achieving       long-term sustainability, and integrating them into the       budget resolution could give current members more ownership       of those objectives and hopefully strengthen their ongoing       commitment to meeting fiscal targets.        The proposal goes further than simply setting goals. It       would establish a new, deficit-reduction-only reconciliation       process if needed to achieve the debt-to-GDP levels agreed to       in the earlier budget resolution. Under this process, the       Senate Budget Committee, renamed the Committee on Fiscal       Control and the Budget, would report a simple resolution with       reconciliation instructions to the full Senate, where it       would be open for amendments. If approved by the Senate, it       would instruct applicable committees to produce deficit-      reducing legislation to achieve compliance with debt targets.       Senate procedures for regular reconciliation legislation       would apply to the new reconciliation process, including the       Byrd Rule that, among other provisions, prohibits changes to       Social Security. When marking up the legislation, however,       many members expressed a desire to understand this process       more completely before floor consideration.        While some have criticized this new tool as a threat to       low-income programs, we believe this concern is largely       misplaced. The tool would not automate any changes to       spending or revenue, but would instead establish a process to       consider deficit reduction measures. These measures would       have to pass the Senate and the House and be signed by the       President (a veto override is also possible). Unlike current       reconciliation rules, which have been used to pass deficit-      financed tax cuts, this process is limited to deficit       reduction and could help policymakers agree to new revenue       and to reforms to improve  [[Page S7082]]       health care programs. And long-term deficit reduction can       easily co-exist with near-term measures to counter a       recession.      What other provisions might improve fiscal outcomes?        In addition to improving outcomes through this special       reconciliation, the bill would establish a new pathway for a       bipartisan budget resolution, previously championed by Sen.       Whitehouse during the JSC last year and introduced separately       as S. 63, the Bipartisan Budget and Appropriations Reform Act       of 2019. A majority of both parties in the Senate Budget       Committee and at least 15 members of the minority party on       the Senate floor would be needed for a budget resolution to       qualify for this new pathway. Under it, subsequent       appropriations legislation would be easier to consider on the       Senate floor, and the budget resolution would automatically       spin off legislation with enforceable caps on discretionary       spending in addition to increasing the debt limit. This       process could help the parties to work together       toward reasonable deficit reduction measures. Folding the       debt limit and spending caps into the bipartisan pathway       for the budget resolution would also reduce opportunities       for isolated brinkmanship.        Other aspects of the bill--like asking CBO to estimate       interest costs associated with legislation and restricting       phony spending cuts known as changes in mandatory spending       programs (CHIMPs)--could also improve budget outcomes.       Adopting portfolio budgeting is another positive step, as it       would provide a more holistic review of major program areas       regardless of the committees of jurisdiction and thus help       lawmakers coordinate related authorities.        To be sure, the Bipartisan Congressional Budget Reform Act       would not fix the debt directly, nor does it include actual       deficit reduction. Through improvements in the overall budget       process, it would give lawmakers more opportunities to think       seriously about the consequences of high and rising debt as       well as more ability to budget comprehensively and mindfully.      What amendments have been proposed?        The Bipartisan Congressional Budget Reform Act was       introduced on Oct. 31 and was ordered reported by the Senate       Budget Committee on November 6. During the markup, the       committee made the following changes:        A manager's amendment by Chairman Enzi to enhance the       consensus-oriented aspects for special reconciliation.        An amendment by Senator Pat Toomey (R-PA) to create a new       point of order intended to deter the use of the Crime Victims       Fund to increase unrelated spending through CHIMPs.        An amendment by Senator Tim Kaine (D-VA) to add tax       expenditures to the scope of portfolio budgeting.        An amendment by Senator Chris Van Hollen (D-MD) to restrict       the ability of the President to use rescission authority near       the end of fiscal years and to increase related reporting       requirements.        In addition, the following amendments were considered but       not adopted:        An amendment by Senator David Perdue (R-GA) to align the       fiscal year with the calendar year. An amendment by Senator       Ron Wyden (D-OR) to remove the new reconciliation process to       enforce debt-to-GDP targets.        An amendment by Senator Jeff Merkley (D-OR) to require CBO       to provide information on the distributional impacts of       legislation. Nonetheless, Chairman Enzi pledged to work with       Senator Merkley and other members to obtain the information       they seek.        Lawmakers must continue to improve the budget process,       which has contributed to many years of inaction on a budget       resolution and even more missed deadlines. Process reforms       alone cannot create the political will to have a functioning       budget, but they may allow latent political will to       accomplish more. This bill offers thoughtful ideas to make       the process more effective and to improve the framework for       lawmakers to consider budget matters more comprehensively.                                   ____                  [From the Concord Coalition, Nov. 6, 2019]     The Concord Coalition Praises Bipartisan Senate Budget Reform Plan         Washington.--The Concord Coalition said today that a new       budget process reform bill co-sponsored by Senate Budget       Committee Chair Mike Enzi (R-WY) and Budget Committee member       Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) proposes reforms that would       address some of the most vexing problems plaguing the current       budget process.        The Bipartisan Congressional Budget Reform Act is also co-      sponsored by Senators Grassley (R-IA), Kaine (D-VA), Crapo       (R-ID), King (I-ME), Graham (R-SC), Coons (D-DE), Barrasso       (R-WY), Blunt (R-MO), Johnson (R-WI), Perdue (R-GA), Kennedy       (R-LA), Cramer (R-ND), and Braun (R-IN).        ``This legislation comes at a time when the budget process       is clearly broken and partisan tensions run high. Senators       Enzi, Whitehouse and their fellow co-sponsors are bucking       both of these trends and demonstrating a timely and exemplary       standard of leadership,'' said Robert L. Bixby, executive       director of The Concord Coalition.        Among the proposed reforms are moving the budget to a two-      year cycle, setting debt-to-GDP targets in the budget       resolution and establishing a special enforcement process for       these targets, creating a mechanism for conforming the debt       limit to the budget resolution levels, and enhancing       reporting requirements to promote transparency. It would also       establish a new procedural option to encourage budget       resolutions with substantial bipartisan support.        ``The co-sponsors understand that budget process reform is       not a panacea for the monumental fiscal challenges we face as       a nation, nor is it a substitute for making real choices on       taxes and spending,'' Bixby cautioned. ``But creating a       process that minimizes short-term brinkmanship and refocuses       attention on long-term planning would help facilitate a       discussion about how best to address these challenges. This       legislation would move the budget process in a very positive       direction.''     I yield the floor.
