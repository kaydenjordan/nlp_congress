 Madam Speaker, as we approach Memorial Day,  we are reminded of the brave servicemen and -women who have given their  lives to defend our country.   The families of those who died in conflict, known as the Gold Star  families, can never forget these sacrifices. Our country is indebted to  these selfless Americans who made the ultimate sacrifice.   No amount of financial support can ease the pain of losing a loved  one, but veterans' benefits to surviving spouses and children provide  an important lifeline during these times of need.   The 2017 tax law brought many unintended consequences that Congress  is now trying to fix, including a significant increase in tax rates on  benefits for children of these fallen servicemembers. This is  completely unacceptable. Congress must pass legislation to fix this now  so families that have already given so much are not asked to give even  more.                            ____________________
