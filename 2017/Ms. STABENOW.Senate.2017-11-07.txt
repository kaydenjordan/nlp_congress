 Mr. President, I first wish to thank my friend, the  distinguished Senator from Connecticut, for his very important words.    Mr. President, if I might just take 30 seconds to  complete my remarks.    Thank you very much.   Let me just say in conclusion that we can fix this. We don't have to  put up one more day on the count chart. Today we can make children and  families a priority by passing critical healthcare that has the  bipartisan support to get it done, if we have the urgency to do so.   Thank you.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.
