 Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Ohio for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, the previous assault weapons ban that was referenced by  our Speaker, I just want to make sure our record is actually correct.  The FBI that kept the data had to admit that, as sympathetic as they  were to an assault weapons ban, actually, it doesn't appear to have  really made any difference.   If we want to talk about crime since then, we can talk about the big  cities that have come under the control of Democratic authority, who  have pushed for things like no bond.   John Adams had it exactly right. This Constitution is intended for a  moral and religious people. It is wholly inadequate for the governing  of any other. So, we are either going to have to get rid of all of our  constitutional rights--we can't even allow freedom of an assembly or  speech, much less the Second Amendment, if we are not going to teach  moral right and wrong.   What are we finding? We are finding in our schools, of course, that  they are not teaching the Ten Commandments. Instead, they are teaching  to envy. Look around, covet, see who has something more than you, and  you should envy and covet.   Just keep in mind, under the big city laws now, if you get violent,  we will give you no bond. We will let you right back out.   Do you want to know what would do more right now than banning AR-15s?  It would be to ban Democrat thinking in the big cities that is allowing  the crime rates to just explode.   We have always had guns in America. That is why there is an America.  But we never had a time like this when we were teaching our children  everything but the moral imperatives.   That is why this bill needs to go down, and we need to go after the  causes of our violence.    Mr. Speaker, a law today that I was not aware of is 2  USC 1979, Release of Security Information. And section (c) says,  ``Nothing in this section may be construed to affect the ability of the  Senate and the House of Representatives, including any Member . . . to  obtain information of the Capitol Police regarding the operations and  activities of the Capitol Police that affect the Senate and House of  Representatives.''   Mr. Speaker, they have thousands and thousands of hours of video, and  I have seen what notice was given to one of the January 6 defendants.  It said, You will get this section, this section. That is what we will  use to prosecute. They were not given any of the exculpatory evidence.   So today, we requested this information--all the video--from the  Capitol Police, and it is worth fighting for because we need to know  all the truth.                            ____________________
