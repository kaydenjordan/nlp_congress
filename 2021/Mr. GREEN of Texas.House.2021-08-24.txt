 Madam Speaker, and still I rise to announce that  I will not only vote for H.R. 4 but I will also vote for those who are  making it possible and who have made it possible for me to vote for  H.R. 4.   I will vote for Medgar Evers, who was assassinated trying to secure  the right to vote.   I will vote for Schwerner and Goodman, two Jews who died in  Mississippi trying to secure the right to vote.   I will vote for all of those who suffered on the Edmund Pettus Bridge  on Bloody Sunday to secure the right to vote.   I will do so because although it was signed in ink by a courageous  President, it was written in blood.
