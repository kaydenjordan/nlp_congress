 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding and for  his great work on this bill that would reauthorize a program that is  critical to both American workers and businesses, and the future of our  American economy.   I am continuously hearing from family-owned manufactures across my  district, such as Atlas Tool and Die and ODM, that they cannot find  workers with the skills they need to fill good-paying jobs. I hear this  from companies also like Boeing, Intel, and Abbott. At the same time,  millions of Americans are struggling to find jobs, but they don't have  the skills that they need.   This bill addresses this problem by supporting career and technical  education programs that are matched to regional, State, and local labor  markets. These applied science, technology, engineering and  mathematics, or STEM education programs, are an important component of  the innovation engine that drives our economy.   As we work to move innovative technologies into the marketplace, we  need a skilled workforce to build and implement them. We also need to  make sure that our innovation economy benefits all Americans,  especially the middle class.   I thank my colleagues for this bill and urge all my colleagues to  support it.    I want to thank Mr. Krishnamoorthi for all his work on  this bill, and I thank the Republicans for their work. It is a good,  bipartisan bill. It is something that America needs to help strengthen  our economy and help strengthen America's middle class.
