 Madam Speaker, our current national debt is not only  huge, it is astronomical. As of today, the national debt exceeds over  $30 trillion. To put that in perspective, that amount in $100 bills  laid side by side would circle the Earth over 1,167 times. If stacked,  it would reach the International Space Station 80 times.   The debt crisis is truly out of this world, and yet my colleagues  across the aisle would rather spend even more money on unnecessary  programs with unrealistic goals. Effects of the debt are already being  felt in the form of record-high inflation and gas prices, but perhaps  the greatest tragedy is that it will be our children and our children's  children who will ultimately foot the bill.                            ____________________
