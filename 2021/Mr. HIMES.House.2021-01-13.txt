 The words have almost all been said. Search your soul.  Consider your oath. And I add four more words: Reflect on your legacy.   My friends, which way is history flowing right now? Will Donald Trump  join the pantheon of Washington, Lincoln, Roosevelt, and Reagan? Will  his 33 percent approval ratings and the condemnation of principled  Republicans consign him to the heap of reviled demigods with Joseph  McCarthy and Andrew Johnson?   Where he goes in history, you go in history, unless, today, you make  a stand.
