 Mr. President, today I wish to recognize SMA Daniel A.  Dailey, the fifteenth Sergeant Major of the Army, SMA, for his  extraordinary 30 years of faithful service to our Army and our Nation.   Sergeant Major Dailey's impressive and distinguished career has been  characterized by his diligent work, compassionate leadership, and focus  on taking care of and advocating to improve the lives of soldiers and  their family members.   In the next few weeks, Sergeant Major Dailey will transition his  responsibilities as the U.S. Army's senior enlisted leader, and he will  retire from the army after a long and distinguished career of military  service at home and abroad. While Sergeant Major Dailey may transition  his official duties, his heart and soul is that of a soldier. I know  that, as a Soldier for Life, Sergeant Major Dailey will continue his  life's work to improve our Army and to take care of our soldiers.   A native of Palmerton, PA, Sergeant Major Dailey began his journey of  service when he enlisted in the Army in 1989 and successfully completed  basic training and advanced individual training as an infantryman at  Fort Benning, GA. During his career, Sergeant Major Dailey has held  every enlisted leadership position in the mechanized infantry, ranging  from Bradley Fighting Vehicle commander to command sergeant major.   Sergeant Major Dailey has served with the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th  Infantry Divisions stateside and overseas. In March 2009, he was  selected as the 4th Infantry Division command sergeant major, where he  served as both the command sergeant major of Fort Carson, CO, and U.S.  Division-North, Iraq. In 2011, Sergeant Major Dailey was selected to  serve as the Command Sergeant Major of the United States Army Training  and Doctrine Command, TRADOC.   In addition to four deployments supporting Operations IRAQI FREEDOM  and NEW DAWN, where he earned the Bronze Star with Valor for his  leadership during the 4th Infantry Division's 2-month ``Battle for Sadr  City'' in 2008, he also deployed in support of Operations DESERT STORM  and DESERT SHIELD during the first Gulf War.   Sergeant Major Dailey's tenure as the 15th Sergeant Major of the Army  began on January 30, 2015. As Sergeant Major of the Army, Sergeant  Major Dailey serves as the senior enlisted advisor to the Army's Chief  of Staff on all matters affecting enlisted soldiers and the NCO corps.  In addition to being the soldier's voice through his membership on  multiple councils, boards, and commissions and frequently testifying  before Congress, Sergeant Major Dailey has also traveled the world to  hear and tell the soldier's story, spearheaded initiatives to enhance  Army readiness and increase soldier opportunity, and routinely met with  business and industry leaders, and State and local government officials  to improve the quality of life for Soldiers and their families.   Sergeant Major Dailey is the public face of the U.S. Army's  noncommissioned officer corps, representing the corps to the American  people in the media and through business and community engagements.  Sergeant Major Dailey is a shining example of Army values, and he  exemplifies the noncommissioned officer's creed. He has remained  technically and tactically proficient, and he has consistently provided  outstanding leadership. He is the personification of what it means to  be a professional soldier, and his service is an example of how the  Army's NCO corps is the ``Backbone of the Army.''   It has been a pleasure to know, work, and serve with Sergeant Major  Dailey during his time as the Sergeant Major of the Army. On behalf of  a grateful Nation, it is my honor to recognize the selfless service and  sacrifice of Sergeant Major Dailey and his family. I wish Sergeant  Major Dailey and his family the very best in all of their future  endeavors as he and they begins this new chapter. May God continue to  bless Sergeant Major Dailey, his family, and the United States of  America.                            ____________________
