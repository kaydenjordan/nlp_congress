 Madam Speaker, I rise in the strongest support of H.R.  8373, the Right to Contraception Act.   We all belong to committees here, and when we do, as we do, we get to  know Members very well. An observation of mine over these years as a  member of the Energy and Commerce Committee is--I don't know any Member  that has 10, 12, or 14 children. I would say there is some family  planning going on here.   This is a private decision that we all have had the freedom to make.  This bill is about family planning. It is about birth control. It is  not about controlling women. It is about the freedom that women can  make.   No politician or judge should be interfering in private healthcare  decisions or restrict access to contraception. The Supreme Court has  threatened this fundamental right, leaving this issue on the Court's  chopping block.   Madam Speaker, everyone should vote for this bill.
