 Mr. Speaker, history is the great educator. We  remember in American history the War of Independence started when the  British tried to take away the firearms of Americans, and we had the  Battles of Lexington and Concord. That revolution was successful  because Americans were able to be armed.   The Texas War of Independence started when the Mexican Government  tried to take away the firearms of Texans. That started in Gonzales,  Texas, and it was successful and we became an independent country.   The Second Amendment is a constitutional right that Americans have.  My friends on the other side don't like the Second Amendment. They wish  it wasn't there. They do everything in their power to restrict the  privilege and the right that we have under the Second Amendment, and we  get it because of our history, to protect us from government and also  for self-defense.   My friends talk about gun violence. They have got to remember that  gun violence happens many times where people are disarmed, and it  usually takes a gun to stop that gun, just like it did at the church in  Texas.   In another situation, if I were to drive my Jeep to California and I  get stopped by the California Highway Patrol, which maybe would occur,  I would show them my Texas driver's license, and then they would let me  drive, even though the laws in California are different on a driver's  license.   Second, the registration of my Jeep in Texas would pass in  California, even though if I had to get it done in California, it  probably wouldn't pass. But they recognize that because we have laws  that recognize that.   My marriage license would be accepted as well.   The right to bear arms, the right to have a concealed carry weapon,  is based on the Second Amendment of the Constitution. All this law does  is allow us to exercise that right in every State.   And that is just the way it is.    Mr. Speaker, when we turn on the tap, clean water  flows out and we hardly even think about it. The same thing happens  when we turn on the shower or flush the toilet. But for a lot of the  world, this just isn't true.   According to the USAID, over 700 million people lack dependable  access to clean water. But it is not just water. One in three people  don't have access to a toilet. Many don't know the basic hygiene  practices. As a result, over 800 children a day die.   However, progress has been made. The Water for the World Act that  Representative Blumenauer and I authored in the 113th Congress made  great strides to guarantee safe water, sanitation, and hygiene to  everyone.   But there is still work to be done. Eighty percent of the countries  receiving aid report that water issues remain. The poor still lack  water and sanitation. With our God-given resources, we have an  obligation and a privilege to make sure people receive the basic of  life: clean water.   And that is just the way it is.                            ____________________
