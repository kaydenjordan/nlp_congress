 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I rise today to offer a commonsense  amendment that will empower local communities by allowing counties to  be included in Good Neighbor Authority cooperative agreements and  contracts in order to improve forest health and bolster watershed  restoration.   The base farm bill reauthorizes Good Neighbor Authority through  fiscal year 2023 and contains a provision that allows tribal  governments to be eligible to enter into Good Neighbor Authority  cooperative agreements and contracts. Our amendment simply builds on  that commonsense provision by also authorizing counties to be eligible  for Good Neighbor Authority.   Good Neighbor Authority projects have been remarkably successful.  From 2002 to 2013, 63 projects treated more than 4,100 acres in  Colorado and Utah. These worthwhile treatments mitigated the threat of  catastrophic wildfire, reduced flooding, enhanced forest health, and  improved water quality.   Counties on both sides of the aisle requested this amendment and new  authority.   The problem in Coconino County, a liberal county represented by my  colleague Mr. O'Halleran, is that the wood is low-value timber, so they  can't attract private industry to thin their forest for pending work  they need completed.   Counties want to do this type of work themselves or find a contractor  if the Federal Government won't treat their forests. All that is  missing is the authorization from Congress.   The Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources is already entering  into cooperative agreements with counties to partner in the management  of Wisconsin County Forests, and it is working for them as well.   Some counties have actual foresters or other land management  professionals on staff. These are not limited specifically to large  counties either. For example, Adams County, Idaho, population of 4,000,  has a natural resources committee that is chaired by a retired Forest  Service employee who also serves on the local forest collaborative.   Coconino County has a forest restoration director who would be in  charge of these county Good Neighbor Authority agreements. This is a  director-level executive position that reports directly to the deputy  county manager.   While some counties will likely contract with outside entities to  perform the work, county contracts will be overseen by someone such as  an auditor or a clerk.   The National Association of Counties supports this amendment,  stating, ``NACo stands ready to work with you to promote locally  supported, consensus-driven solutions to address forest management  challenges and reduce the risk of catastrophic wildfire. NACo  encourages the United States House of Representatives to adopt your  amendment to H.R. 2 and give counties the opportunity to assist our  Federal partners to make our national forests healthy again.''   In addition to NACo, I am also honored to have the support of the  National Water Resources Association, the Arizona Association of  Conservation Districts, the Salt River Project, the Colorado Pork  Producers Council,  [[Page H4166]]  and more than 20 other local and national organizations and elected  officials.   I urge all of my colleagues in the House to support this commonsense  amendment that will empower bipartisan communities throughout the  country, improve forest health, and bolster watershed restoration.   Again, this is an authorization, not a requirement. It puts more  power into the hands of local communities who need the work done but  have nowhere to turn under the status quo.   Mr. Chairman, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from Montana (Mr.  Gianforte), my good friend and colleague, who is a cosponsor of this  amendment.    Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman for his comments.   Mr. Chair, I yield as much time as he may consume to the gentleman  from Pennsylvania (Mr. Thompson).    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of my good friend  and colleague Congressman Gianforte's wildfire salvage operations  amendment. I am glad that, with the farm bill package, we have the  opportunity to look at the forest industry and wildfire issues from all  sides.   This amendment is part and parcel of a broader wildfire strategy that  requires proactive action from Congress for the steps before, during,  and after wildfires are expected. Specifically, this amendment will  ensure that the National Forest System forest is cleared and replanted  if a catastrophic wildfire chars it to the ground.   Our National Forest System lands will be rehabilitated after wildfire  devastates them, but in a way consistent with forest plans. That way,  the ecosystem of the new forest will have better management and be less  susceptible to another large-scale burn-down event.   This is a forward-thinking amendment to fix a backwards system we  have devised in Congress, and I urge Members to vote for this  demonstration that shows Congress isn't willing to just give up and let  our forest system lands be catastrophically burnt.   Mr. Chair, I applaud Representative Gianforte for his strong  leadership and tireless efforts to reduce the threat of dangerous  wildfires. I urge adoption of this commonsense amendment.  [[Page H4167]]         Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the amendment offered  by my good friend and colleague, Mr. Westerman.   The United States is about to embark on yet another year of ravaging  catastrophic wildfire. I say ``embark'' because this is ultimately a  choice. While some amount of summer wildfire is to be expected during  the heat of summer, the devastation we have seen in recent years is  unprecedented.   2017 was one of the worst wildfire seasons on record. More than  58,000 fires burned more than 9.2 million acres. The Forest Service  spent more than $2.5 billion on suppression costs this fiscal year  alone, a new record.   These expenditures and destruction coincide perfectly with Congress'  dereliction of its duty to ensure our land management agencies are  equipped with the tools and authorities to properly manage our forests.  Congress has provided some legislative fixes this year, but I think  every Member understands full well we shouldn't pat ourselves on the  back just yet.   As the coming months will demonstrate, we and, by extension, the  American taxpayer are still on the hook here. We are susceptible to  years more of supermassive fire blanketing the country unless we build  on our progress.   Mr. Westerman's amendment here does just that. It will require the  government to holistically evaluate the impacts of its forestry  decisions on overall forest health. By requiring the costs of inaction  to be weighed, the Forest Service will have to demonstrate its  decisions are ultimately in a forest's interest.   Mr. Chair, I applaud Mr. Westerman for his strong leadership and  tireless efforts to improve a failing system that we have inherited.   Mr. Chair, I urge the adoption of the commonsense amendment    Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of my good friend and  colleague Congressman LaMalfa's amendment.   The amendment aims to streamline a bureaucratic process that is  hampering broadband infrastructure development in rural America.   As chairman of the Congressional Western Caucus and Representative  for Arizona's Fourth Congressional District, I can tell you that this  problem is all too real in the communities that I represent.   Many families and businesses in the West still lack basic broadband.  According to a November 2017 Brookings Institution study, more than 50  percent of my district live in neighborhoods without an available  broadband connection. Many of you all will find this hard to believe,  but a huge chunk of my district has no social media platform  whatsoever.   Closing the broadband availability gap should be a priority for all  Members of Congress. Doing so will create jobs, improve education, and  grow our economy.   I applaud Representative LaMalfa for his leadership and tireless  efforts to close the broadband availability gap, and I urge adoption of  this excellent amendment.  [[Page H4172]]
