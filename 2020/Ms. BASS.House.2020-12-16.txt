Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to support S. 3312, the Crisis Stabilization  and Community Reentry Act of 2020. Today, with this bill, the House  takes additional affirmative steps to promote the successful reentry  into their communities of individuals leaving correctional facilities.  [[Page H7215]]    The bill provides funding to State, local, and community  organizations to provide incarcerated and recently released individuals  with mental health and substance abuse treatment. Providing continuity  of care in relation to mental health and substance abuse treatment when  individuals are released from correctional facilities is a critical  bridge back into their communities; but continuity of care of this sort  is seldom available to returning citizens. This bill addresses that  gap.   At a series of hearings this Congress, the Judiciary Committee has  explored the many challenges that recently released individuals face.  These returning citizens confront a myriad of barriers that hamper  reentry. Unfortunately, many struggle with mental health and substance  abuse. Navigating reentry, which is already daunting, can be made even  more difficult due to these additional challenges.   Because the need is great, the reach of this bill is broad. The  grants awarded by S. 3312 improve mental health and substance abuse  treatment during pretrial detention, throughout incarceration, and upon  return to the community. Eligible grantees include juvenile justice  agencies, mental health agencies, and community-based behavioral health  providers.   The bill's keen focus on the provision of care by local, community- based providers is deliberate, as this is consistent with long-term  reentry success. This is why I am particularly supportive of this  provision of the bill that implements a preference for grantees that  provide community-based care and promote policies that reduce the  number of technical probation violations.   Also notable in S. 3312 is the broad panoply of mental health  services that it incorporates. These include peer support, enrollment  in long-term healthcare programs, and introduction to clinically proven  medications. This bill recognizes that no single reentry solution will  work for every returning individual.   The programs authorized in S. 3312 would further promote much-needed  cooperative efforts among criminal and juvenile justice agencies,  mental health agencies, and community-based behavioral health  providers.   The programs receiving funding under this bill would engage relevant  stakeholders in the formulation of program design, implementation,  training on services, and examination of healthcare reimbursement  issues that may pose a barrier to ensuring long-term financial  sustainability of these programs.   The holistic approach to reentry that this bill adopts has  consistently been shown to promote successful reentry and offer better  long-term solutions.   In recent years, Congress passed the hallmark Second Chance Act and a  number of other bills, including H.R. 8161, the One Stop Community  Reentry Program Act, focused on promoting successful reentry and, in  turn, supporting public safety. Like those bills, S. 3312, the Crisis  Stabilization and Community Reentry Act, is a necessary tool to ensure  that proper services reach people involved in the criminal justice  system.   Finally, I thank our colleague, Representative   David Trone, for  championing the companion bill in the House.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to support this bill, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, the Crisis Stabilization and Community Reentry  Act of 2020 represents a significant step toward ensuring that  incarcerated people receive appropriate mental health and substance  abuse care while in a correctional facility and that those services are  available upon their reentry into the community.   I am encouraged by the bipartisan and bicameral support for this  bill. I, again, thank Representative Trone, as well as Senators Cornyn  and Blumenthal and my colleague from the Judiciary Committee,  Representative Reschenthaler.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill  today, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to take from the  Speaker's table the concurrent resolution (S. Con. Res. 52) to correct  the enrollment of S. 3312, and ask for its immediate consideration in  the House.   The Clerk read the title of the concurrent resolution.    Mr. Speaker, I have an amendment at the desk.
