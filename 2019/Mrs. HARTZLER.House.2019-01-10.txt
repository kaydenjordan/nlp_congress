 Mr. Speaker, tonight, we are here to have a  conversation about the situation at our southern border.   The President calls it a border crisis and a humanitarian crisis, yet  others call it immoral to give more funding to secure our Nation at the  southern border. So what really is the situation?   We are in the 20th day of a government shutdown over the question of:  Is the security of the American people at risk because of what is  happening at  [[Page H443]]  our southern border? And, if it is, what should we do about it?   Tonight, my colleagues and I want to share the facts regarding the  situation, and some stories from our districts, that illustrate why we  support building a wall, as well as securing our border in other ways.   For me, it is a matter of three things:   The need to stop the flow of illegal drugs;   The safety of innocent families in our districts, as well as the  safety of innocent individuals who want to come here and immigrate to  our country; and   Third, I believe it is a matter of fairness.   Let me share what I mean.   I believe, and I think most people agree, that we have a drug crisis  in our country. I see it every week when I am back in my district, when  I talk to my law enforcement, when I talk to my families who have lost  a child through a heroin overdose, when I see the rising foster care  numbers in our State because their parents are drug addicted. We have a  crisis.   I recently had a chance to travel to the Nogales-Mariposa port of  entry that is south of Tucson, in Arizona, and boy was it eye-opening.  There I learned from our Border Patrol agents that the drug cartels are  waging a war, basically, against our country, and, sadly, in many ways,  they are winning. They have more money, they have more manpower, and  they are using drug mules to carry drugs across the unsecured part of  our border. They are involving the gangs that come down, and then those  travel up into our districts. I am from Missouri, and we see it there  in Missouri.   Last year, sadly, more than 72,000 Americans died from a drug  overdose. That is more than died in the entire Vietnam war, the entire  war, and this happens every year. That is also more deaths than people  who passed away in our country from traffic accidents and homicides  combined. Think about it.    When we hear the nightly news and there is a homicide, that somebody  has been shot and killed, it is tragic. Or we hear a report about  somebody dying in a car accident, it is terrible. But all of the people  in America who died from the traffic accidents and every person who  died in a homicide, if you put those numbers together, that does not  come close to the number of people who have died from drug overdoses.  We have got to do better.   I have got some pictures of some individuals who are victims of this  drug crisis that is a result of our open borders. But they are not just  statistics. The reason I put up their pictures here on this poster is  because they are not a number. They have names. They lived. People  loved them. They were sons, daughters, coworkers, and they were  friends.   The lady on the far side with her little boy, her name is Victoria  and her son is Andrew. Now she didn't pass away, but she has been  addicted to meth, so that when she gave birth to Andrew, he was  addicted and had to go through withdrawal symptoms, and she struggled  with a drug addiction.                                time  1700    The young man in the middle is named Eamon, and he, sadly, passed  away from a heroin overdose.   The mother here and her daughter, she is still alive, but she is  struggling with drug addiction, through heroin, and she has lost  custody of her little girl.   Like I said, we have a record number of foster kids right now in  America because of parents losing their children to drug addiction.   A large number of the people have drug addictions due to opioids. In  fact, according to the CDC, of more than 72,000 drug overdoses, many of  them were due to fentanyl, which is also coming across our southern  border. In fact, fentanyl killed 30,000 Americans last year.   The Border Patrol is doing a great job with the resources they have,  but they need more help. They found and interdicted 1.2 tons of  fentanyl--1.2 tons. That is enough to kill every American. It takes  only 2 milligrams of fentanyl to kill an individual. If you add up how  much damage 1.2 tons of fentanyl could do, it adds up to over 500  million people who could be killed. It is unbelievable.   Then cocaine, they seized enough cocaine at the southern border last  year to fill 141 1-ton pickup trucks. I made a poster just to show this  because a lot of us are familiar with pickup trucks. We have 1-ton  trucks, \3/4\-ton trucks. 141 of them, picture them filled with  cocaine. That is how much was caught by our Border Patrol at the  southern border. We have no idea how much more is not caught.   Next one I want to talk about is methamphetamine. They seized 124  tons of methamphetamine. Here is a face, and maybe you have seen these  posters or pictures before. This is what meth does to individuals in a  very short amount of time. It is awful. It is so addictive.   At one time, Missouri was called the meth capital of our country. It  tied with California for several years. It is a terrible distinction to  have, but there were meth labs everywhere. Our law enforcement was  doing as good a job as they could, interdicting and shutting down these  meth labs.   Now when I talk to my law enforcement at home, they say that we have  hardly any meth labs, but the reason is sad. The reason is because the  meth is still there, but it is coming from across our border. It is  part of this tonnage coming up. That is why we have to build a wall and  secure the border.   I could talk about heroin. They seized 6,500 pounds of heroin. That  is over 3 tons. In Missouri, in my State, we lost 380 people to heroin  overdose last year.   This is the fact: 90 percent of the heroin in our country comes from  across the southern border. The drug cartels aren't backing off. They  don't care. They see this as a revenue opportunity. They don't care  about people.   Just in 2 years, there has been a 73 percent increase in fentanyl  that they have shoved across our border, a 38 percent increase in  methamphetamine, a 22 percent increase in heroin. That just is what is  seized.   Our Border Patrol needs some help. We have to stop this drug crisis.   But there is more. Besides drug deaths, there have been numerous  deaths linked to illegal immigrants that come here.   Now, all of us support people coming here legally. Almost every one  of us in the body have some story about a relative who came here, maybe  they went through Ellis Island. I support legal immigration. But when  we have an open border, anybody can come across.   Last year, they caught 17,000 people coming across the border who had  criminal records. The ones who didn't get caught end up in our  communities and, sadly, kill people like Officer Singh.   Our hearts were broken the day after Christmas when we heard this  story of this legal immigrant who did it right. He came from Fiji. He  immigrated here, and his goal was to become a police officer. He wanted  that so much, first to be a citizen, but then he traveled 4 hours every  day to attend his police academy.   He learned English. He took English classes to learn the language, so  that he could be a good police officer. And he was a good one. He was  an honorable one.   An illegal immigrant who came across our southern border shot and  killed him. This is why we have to secure our border, and we can do it.   I am also concerned about the innocent people who are being told a  lie by the drug cartels. They are giving their life savings to a coyote  to come here. They are brought to the border and then travel across the  border.   Doctors Without Borders tells an upsetting statistic to me, and to  anybody who is listening, that one-third of all the women who try to  make that trip are sexually assaulted.   This current system is incentivizing them, with an open border, to  try to make that trek, and they are being harmed. Instead, we have to  close that border and give them the tools that will help them come here  legally, come here safely. That is what we all want.   Lastly, I want to talk about the issue of fairness. Right now, there  are 700,000 people who are in the process of becoming legal citizens of  our country, trying to come here and be an immigrant, following our  laws.   In my district, I am working with some families who are trying to get  relatives here through the legal system, and it is amazing what you go  through. First of all, it takes years. It  [[Page H444]]  takes years, but they fill out the paperwork. I have seen the pictures  of the stacks of paperwork that they have to file with our immigration  system to get them here.   There are 700,000 people right now trying to do that. It is just not  fair to allow people to jump the line and to just walk across.   Because of the way our laws are now, if you bring a child into our  country, they can hold them only 20 days, and then you have to let them  go. So they know that.   I learned that the drug cartels at the border actually have  attorneys. They are a big business. They are something else.    They know the laws. They know they are going to be let out, and they  are here. That is just not right. We can do better. We can secure the  border.   $5.7 billion in the scheme of things is not that much. We give $50  billion every year for foreign aid, so it is about a tenth of the  foreign aid we give to other countries to secure their borders.   Why don't we secure our country? We can do that.   I wanted to share some of those facts and invite some of my  colleagues to come here tonight to share their thoughts on this very  important issue that is before us as a nation and to hear their  stories.   The first person I want to yield to is the gentleman from Montana,   Greg Gianforte.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman. I appreciate his  comments. They were spot on.   We are seeing the same thing in Missouri with that meth coming up  from Mexico and the record number of people in foster care. It just  breaks your heart, and it doesn't have to be that way.    Yes, we must act.   Mr. Speaker, I would now like to invite my friend from Louisiana,   Mike Johnson, to share what he is seeing down there in Louisiana, what  his constituents are saying, and what his thoughts are.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Johnson).    Thank you so much. I appreciate your perspective down  there from Louisiana.   You bring up the great point of the number of children coming across.  I heard yesterday how Health and Human Services, which gets custody of  these children, just does not have the capacity to house them and to  take care of them. It is a crisis. That is why the President says it is  a humanitarian crisis. So we have got to act.   Mr. Speaker, we started off in Missouri; we had Montana; we have gone  down to Louisiana to hear their perspective; and now we go to North  Carolina to hear from Representative Ted Budd.   I appreciate your being here, Representative Budd, and we would love  to hear what your thoughts are on this very important topic.   I yield to the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Budd).    Well said, Representative.   Mr. Speaker, now we have my colleague and friend to the south in  Arkansas. Representative French Hill wants to share a little bit. I  appreciate his being here tonight.   I yield to the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. Hill).    Thank you, gentleman, that was excellent; and I  appreciate you bringing a picture so we can all see that what the  Border Patrol and others are running into is that individuals, clearly,  are here from other countries illegally, and that is why we need to  secure this border. It is very concerning what is happening as a result  of having an open border.   Mr. Speaker, I am glad that my colleague from Florida has shared a  little bit of his time this evening to come join us.    John Rutherford, I appreciate your being here, and I look forward to  hearing what you have to share tonight.   I yield to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Rutherford).    You sure know what you are talking about because of  the lifelong service that you have given to law enforcement.   I loved what you shared. It is time to listen to those people on the  ground and in operations. That is who we need to listen to.   You are right. When I had a chance to go to the border, the Border  Patrol are saying we need this. They are there every day risking their  lives trying to keep us safe.   So thank you for sharing your firsthand perspective from law  enforcement and what you are hearing. I appreciate it.   Now, Mr. Speaker, I would like to turn to another colleague of mine,  whom I actually had to travel to the border with back in October. She  is from Arizona, which is where the port was in Mariposa, Nogales, that  we went to.   Debbie Lesko, thank you for joining us tonight. I really appreciate  your sharing with America and with our colleagues here about what you  are seeing from Arizona and your perspective on the need to build this  security wall at the border.   I yield to the gentlewoman from Arizona (Mrs. Lesko).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for her excellent  summation of what is important. It was so touching. I thank her for  bringing the pictures of Arizonans who have lost their lives due to  Congress' failure to build the wall and keep us safe.   That is why we are here tonight, saying now is the time. We have to  stop this.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Minnesota, Pete Stauber.  He is new to Congress. I am so glad to have him here. I appreciate him  coming, and I look forward to hearing what he has to say from a  Minnesotan's point of view.    Mr. Speaker, the gentleman has that law enforcement  background that is so critical right here in Congress. That is why we  are glad he is here and appreciate him sharing. I can't imagine what he  has gone through so many times, having to go to somebody's home--the  parents--and face a mom and dad to tell them that their child has died.   That is why we are here today. I appreciate the gentleman's passion  for this issue. I share it.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Illinois,  Mike Bost, a  colleague to the east. I thank him for being here tonight and  appreciate him sharing about this important crisis that we have at our  border.    Mr. Speaker, the gentleman is right. We can do both.  We are all committed to doing that. That is why we are here. We are  working for the American public, and I believe we will get this done.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to my colleague and good friend from Alabama,  Martha Roby.    Thank you for coming and sharing. You made so many  great points. And just the sheer number of people who are coming  across, we just say those numbers, but I heard the other day, it is  like 2,000 a day.   In my district--I have a very rural district--there are a lot of  towns that don't have 2,000 people in them. So if I picture one of my  towns that has 2,000 people in it, that is how many that are coming  across every day, the southern border, 2,000 people a day.   We have just got to address this. I agree with you, we have got to do  it now. And thank you so much for coming.   I would like to now yield to the gentleman from South Carolina,  Representative Duncan, my good friend, to come here and share his  thoughts from South Carolina and why he thinks this is a real crisis,  and then why we need to deal with it right now.    Well said. Well said. I thank the gentleman; that was  great.   Now, I yield to the gentleman from Texas, Representative Brian Babin.  He is right there at the border. So what does the gentleman have to  say?    Really?    Mr. Speaker, I yield to my colleague from North  Carolina, Representative Rouzer, to share.   And while he is coming, I just want to thank the gentleman from Texas  for sharing that. That is just heartbreaking that 500,000 Texans were  killed at the hands of illegal aliens. But we can fix that.   So I thank Representative Rouzer for being here. What does the  gentleman have to say tonight about this?    Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the conversation that we  have had tonight, sharing with the American people the facts and the  stories of some people in our district about why this is so important.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the topic of this Special Order.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
