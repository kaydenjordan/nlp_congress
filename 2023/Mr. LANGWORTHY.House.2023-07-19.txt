 Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   In 2009, Colgan Air Flight 3407 crashed in Clarence, New York, a  community in my district in western New York, killing 49 passengers and  1 person on the ground.   As a congressional staffer at the time, I was there on the ground at  the crash site. I saw firsthand the sights and the sounds and the grief  of the victims' families as they grappled with the reality that their  loved ones were gone. The crash was ruled a result of pilot error.   A year later, those families successfully fought to implement a set  of enhanced safety standards, including requiring pilots to obtain  1,500 hours of training. The results are indisputable. Since its  enactment, domestic airline fatalities have dropped 99.8 percent.  Simply put, they are working, and our skies are the safest they have  ever been.   My amendment protects the integrity of the 1,500-hour flight training  requirement in the face of efforts to lower pilot training standards  and jeopardize the safety of passengers and crew alike.   As Captain Sully Sullenberger, the miracle on the Hudson pilot, has  said, while simulators have their place for experienced pilots, they  are not a replacement for in-the-sky training, and this requirement  must be protected.   Our job as elected leaders is to protect public safety and to help  ensure  [[Page H3815]]  that no other family suffers the heartbreak of losing a loved one to an  avoidable air tragedy.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support my amendment here today to  maintain high-quality training standards for our commercial pilots, and  I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Michigan (Mr. Bergman), one of only two commercial airline pilots in  Congress with more than 20,000 flight hours.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  New York (Mr. Higgins), my friend and colleague.    Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  New York (Ms. Tenney).    Mr. Chair, we put our lives in the hands of our  airline pilots, and we should apply the same standard of safety and  training that Americans have come to trust and to expect.   I strongly urge my colleagues to support this amendment, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, tonight we passed H.R. 3941, the  Schools Not Shelters Act, sponsored by my friend and colleague from New  York, Representative Marc Molinaro.   Unfortunately, this legislation is a necessary response to President  Biden's border crisis, which has been made worse by the sanctuary city  policies of New York Democrats.   We are seeing illegal immigration spill into communities across the  State, including in my district in western New York.   When Mayor Eric Adams and Governor Kathy Hochul announced their plan  to take over campuses across the State and turn them into migrant  housing, it struck many parents, including me, as an insult. Our  investment of billions of taxpayer dollars for award-winning schools  like our SUNY campuses is thrown away to become migrant camps.   The Schools Not Shelters Act sends a clear message that our Nation  values the education and well-being of our children above all else.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues in the Senate to support this  measure to put our children first.                            ____________________
