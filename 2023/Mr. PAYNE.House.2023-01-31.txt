 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to thank my Democratic  colleagues for selecting me as ranking member of the Subcommittee on  Railroads, Pipelines, and Hazardous Materials for the House Committee  on Transportation and Infrastructure.   I will work to accomplish at least four strong railroad priorities in  the new Congress.   The first is the completion of the Hudson River Tunnel and the entire  Gateway Program. This is the most important transportation project in  the  [[Page H556]]  Nation, and it will help commuters in my district as well as travelers  throughout the East Coast.   The second is using the bipartisan infrastructure law funding to  improve Amtrak and travel throughout the Northeast corridor.   The third is more oversight over freight railroads nationwide.   The fourth is a promise that I made early on in the Congress to make  sure that rail workers finally get the sick time they have earned and  deserve. We need to make sure they are operating safely and efficiently  across the country.   Again, I thank my colleagues for my selection. I look forward to  working with all of them to make these priorities into realities.                            ____________________
