 Mr. Speaker, on May 10, 1869, a Salt Lake paper  wrote that the people of Utah--the great pioneers of the Rocky  Mountains--received with acclamation the glad news of the completion of  the mighty work to which as a people they had contributed their part;  and hand in hand with the great circle of States and territories, now  rejoicing in union over the event, did thank God for its  accomplishments.   They were referencing the Golden Spike which had been driven  completing the first transcontinental railroad.   That date, May 10, will forever stand as a tribute to the men of  vision who foresaw the potential of an empire stretching from coast to  coast in the United States, bound together not only by iron rails but  also by a common interest.   From the time of the Civil War when this project started until three  or four decades later when the railroad system was completed, America  changed. In 1860, the United States was third in the world in  production of wheat. When the railroad was completed, we were first. In  1860, England produced three times as much coal as the United States.  When the railroad was complete, not only did we lead the world, we were  producing 110 million tons of coal more  [[Page H3453]]  than Great Britain. During the Civil War, England was producing six  times as much steel as we were, but when the railroad was complete, 42  percent of all steel was being produced in the United States--much of  that going to the railroad.   During the Civil War, there were only 30,000 miles of railroad track  in America. But when the system was complete, there was 167,000 miles  crisscrossing this country. Today we still have more railroad track  than any other country, 39 percent more than the number two country of  Russia, and more than the rest of the top 10, which include in order  China, India, Canada, Germany, Australia, Argentina, and France and  Belgium combined, even more than nation number 139 on that list, the  country of Lichtenstein, which has all of 5\1/2\ miles of railroad  track.   The railroad made our economic explosion possible. The railroad made  us an industrial giant. Before the railroad came, it was difficult to  move goods or even transport people. But once the spike was driven,  that was the kick-start to what we were going to do. Now, 150 years  later, we are celebrating the coming of the Central Pacific's Jupiter  with the Union Pacific's Engine 119 meeting together in Utah's  backyard. The railroads still move goods, and they also provide  passenger service.                                time  1215    I still remember as a kid my parents taking me to the Ogden train  depot for a trip somewhere into Idaho, probably Boise. I was in my  Sunday best. As we went up to the observation car, I could look out and  see the beauty of this America passing us by.   It is an American national historical park. It is a place where the  American story is without equal.   In LaRue County, Kentucky, there is the Abraham Lincoln Birthplace  National Historical Park.   In Seneca, New York, there is the Women's Rights National Historical  Park.   In Ohio, you can visit the Dayton Aviation National Historical Park  where you can walk into the bicycle shop where Orville and Wilbur  Wright first started to conquer the skies.   The Golden Spike National Historical Park is going to recognize in  Promontory Summit in Utah, the place where the world changed, where not  only was history made that day, but also the Herculean efforts of those  who organized this, as well as the immigrant manpower of Irish coming  from the east and Chinese from the west, who provided the muscle to  accomplish this project.   A national historical park is accomplished by an act of Congress, but  the Spike 150 Commission, chaired by Doug Foxley and Spencer Stokes,  has mobilized a literal army of history lovers who will host a series  of events befitting this historic moment.   It has already started with a horse parade in Brigham City, a hoedown  in Tremonton, and a country church service on Sunday. It will also  culminate this Friday when we invite all of you to come to Utah to see  the celebration of the 150th anniversary of the Golden Spike, which  encouraged the pioneering of both the spirit and economy of America.  When that Golden Spike was driven, America welcomed a new frontier.                            ____________________
