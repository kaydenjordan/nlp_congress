 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the United  States men's national soccer team on qualifying for the 2022 World Cup  this November in Qatar.   Last night, the U.S. men's national soccer team completed their  qualifying campaign in Costa Rica. It was a fitting ending to the  team's qualifying run, filled with ups and downs and exciting matches,  including big wins over Mexico, Panama, Jamaica, and Costa Rica.   After missing out on the 2018 World Cup, the United States team is  headed back to the World Cup for the first time in 8 years.   From day one of the 2022 qualifying campaign, Coach Gregg Berhalter  and the team set out on one mission and one goal, and that was to  qualify. Bolstered by a golden generation of young and exciting talent,  including players such as Christian Pulisic, Gio Reyna, Weston  McKennie, Tyler Adams, Tim Weah, and many others, the U.S. put together  a strong qualifying performance, including an undefeated record against  the Mexican national team this past year, which is the first time that  has been done in decades.   I am proud that Illinois is home to the United States Soccer  Federation, which supports our men's and women's programs at all  levels.   I know I join with many in Congress and across the country in  congratulating the U.S. men's national soccer team. This qualification  is a well-deserved result that is a testament to the hard work put in  by all of U.S. soccer and the men's team.   The team has made their country proud, and I look forward to cheering  them on at the World Cup in November.                            ____________________
