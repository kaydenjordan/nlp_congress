 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to clause 1, rule I, I demand a vote  on agreeing to the Speaker's approval of the Journal.    Mr. Speaker, I object to the vote on the ground that a  quorum is not present and make the point of order that a quorum is not  present.    Mr. Speaker, 100 years ago today, a young marine from  Murphysboro, Illinois, gave his life on the front lines during World  War I.   Paul Stout graduated in 1916 from Murphysboro High School and then  enlisted in the Marine Corps in February of 1918. In June of 1918, he  was deployed to the front lines. At age 20, he was killed in action in  France in July of 1918. For his heroic actions, he was awarded the  Purple Heart and Bronze Star with a V device for valor.   The Paul Stout American Legion Post 127 is my hometown American  Legion Post in Murphysboro. It is named after Private Stout. I had the  opportunity this last year to visit the battleground at Belleau Wood,  where he fought just a month and a half before passing in a battle  later on farther into France. I can tell you it was a truly moving  experience.   Although memories may fade over time, we must never forget those who  served and gave their lives in defense of freedom and liberty in every  war across this great globe.                            ____________________
