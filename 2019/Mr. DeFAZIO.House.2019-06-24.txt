 Mr. Chair, this is a ridiculous issue, to put it mildly.  This administration has taken two totally contradictory positions on  this.   Prior to this administration, if you had a TIFIA loan, you were  responsible for paying it back with local funds. It was counted as a  local match. It is their obligation. They have to pay it back. They  have to pay the loan fees. They have to pay for everything that is  involved.   Then, in the first year of this administration, they said it is  local. It counts as a match.   Oh, wait a minute, a year ago, they changed their mind. Exactly 1  year apart: June 29, 2017, TIFIA loans will be considered a local  match; June 29, 2018, they will not be considered a local match. They  will be considered as Federal money, ineligible.   What happened in between? I don't know. I think it had something to  do with the Portal Bridge in New Jersey and the Gateway Program, and  President Trump being in a dispute with the Democratic leader of the  Senate.   This is about politics, plain and simple, rotten politics, for  critical infrastructure that this country needs.   If a jurisdiction borrows money--they borrowed it, they have to pay  it back--that doesn't count. If they go to a bank and borrow it and pay  higher interest rates, putting more burden on local taxpayers, that is  okay. But if they got it from the Feds--by the way, the Feds make money  on TIFIA loans. It is one of the most amazing programs. We make money  on it. There has only been like one default in the history of the  program. These are good loans.   They have to pay it back, so why wouldn't it count? Politics, plain  and simple. This is trying to return to politics, as opposed to common  sense, following preexisting practices and the letter of the law.   By the way, this is just clarifying existing law because of a bizarre  interpretation written by the Trump DOT a year ago this June.    Mr. Chair, I certainly wasn't referring to my colleague,  who I know is here in good faith on his own terms.   The point is, on June 29, 2017, the DOT stated that TIFIA loans will  not be considered Federal funds for the purposes of evaluating how much  local share an applicant brings to the table.   What changed in that year? All years prior, that was allowed. In  2017, suddenly, they changed their mind.   That is what I am talking about, rotten politics.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, this is an extraordinary move to suddenly  turn trains into liquid natural gas pipelines. Of course, liquid  natural gas is not transported by pipeline. It brittlizes metal, and  this would be a new and innovative way of moving liquified natural gas.   Now, there are a few problems with this. We had the Administrator  into the committee last week. It is going to be moved in DOT 113 tank  cars.   I said: Are those puncture-proof?   He said: No, they are not puncture-proof.   I said: Well, what happens?   He said: Oh, we carry volatiles all the time.   I said: You don't carry anything like liquified natural gas.   There is something called the BLEVE; it is a boiling liquified  explosive vapor explosion. So the BLEVE has an unbelievable blast  impact. And this is just one rail car. These will be six trains a day  going through the most populated parts of Florida, 100 cars in each  train.   Envision this: Here is Fort Lauderdale, Florida. This is the blast  zone. And that is just one--one--of these tank cars. It is likely it  will cause a chain reaction and explosion. It is going to be about as  powerful as Hiroshima if it goes off.   Now, this maybe will get someone's attention. This is the Brightline  high-speed rail line. That is where they are going to run six trains a  day with 100 cars of liquified natural gas--never, ever been done  before; except in small containers, never been done before.   And, oh, by the way, within the blast zone is Mar-a-Lago. Are they  going to allow the trains to run while the President is there?   All you need is someone with a .50 caliber to shoot a hole in one of  those tank cars and you are going to have one humongous explosion that  goes beyond Mar-a-Lago.   So what is the foolishness?   The Pipeline and Hazardous Safety Materials Agency has not evaluated  this. They are the ones who are supposed to do this. They haven't  finished imposing laws that we put in place in  [[Page H5054]]  2011 for the safe movement of hazardous goods, but now they are rushing  this through.   The administration says, oh, no, we want this permit done in 12  months. Well, maybe the President doesn't know he is in a blast zone.  Maybe he wouldn't be ordering it be done in 12 months if he knew it was  within the blast zone.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   The gentleman referred to trucks. Actually, we are talking about very  small quantities in special containers, not massive rail tank cars  holding these amounts.   Another thing is that there is no known company. You can't contact  them. There is no publicly available contact information, no  headquarters, but they have petitioned and they are going through a  special permit process with--the gentleman says there is going to be  public review and input--sure--to move six trains a day with 100 cars  in each one, essentially, a liquid pipeline through these heavily  populated areas.   We saw what happened at Lac-Megantic up in Canada with just crude oil  in tank cars killing dozens of people, obliterating a town. This is 10  times more powerful than that.   Yet the gentleman from Florida is advocating that this should happen  in Florida, and the people living all along the Brightline--Fort  Lauderdale, Hollywood, the President at Mar-a-Lago--just shouldn't  worry their sweet little heads about it: It won't be a target of  terrorists; there won't be an accident; it is never going to happen.  Well, we have heard that before.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, may I inquire as to how much time I have  remaining.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself 10 seconds.   Again, this has potential for massive explosions. This has not been  done before.   This is not natural gas. It is liquefied natural gas, 600 times as  dense, and, if punctured, this is the blast zone. I hope the President  is watching.   Mr. Chair, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from  North Carolina (Mr. Price), the subcommittee chairman.    Mr. Chair, again, in closing, I think it would be wise  to actually conduct a study before this is  [[Page H5055]]  permitted. That is not the intention of this administration, and that  is why I offer this amendment.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.                                time  1600
