 Madam President, I rise today to honor the 10-year  anniversary of an organization that has been instrumental in our  efforts to protect kids and families from gun violence: Giffords, the  organization founded by former Congresswoman and gun violence victim,  Gabby Giffords.   This anniversary is particularly important to me because Gabby  Giffords and I were in the same House of Representatives freshman class  in 2007. Our offices were right next to each other, and we became fast  friends, dreaming up the idea for supermarket office hours called  ``Congress on Your Corner.'' Four years later, on January 8, 2011,  Gabby was shot in the head at one of those events. Eighteen others were  also shot, and six died. She almost lost her life that day and began a  very long road to recovery.   But my friend Gabby is a fighter, and she doesn't back down. Two  years after she was shot and just 25 days after 20 children and six  educators were killed at Sandy Hook Elementary School, she launched an  organization dedicated to the fight to end gun violence. Today, that  organization is known as Giffords.   Giffords and the gun violence prevention movement spent the next  decade growing stronger, more determined, and more convinced that the  righteousness of our cause would eventually prevail. Gabby and her  organization channeled the outrage and frustration of millions  Americans into action. Across the country, they helped to pass 525  lifesaving laws that make sure guns only end up in the hands of  responsible, law-abiding Americans. They took on the gun lobby in State  legislatures and the courts. They raised awareness, recruited  volunteers, and registered new voters.   On May 24, 2022, at Robb Elementary School, an all too familiar  tragedy struck, 19 children and 2 teachers shot and killed in their  classroom. A weary American public once again called on Congress to  act, and for the first time in 30 years, it did. One month later,  President Biden signed into law the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act,  legislation to tighten our gun laws, invest in mental health services,  and make our schools and communities safer.   That historic piece of legislation would not have been possible  without Gabby Giffords. In the face of unimaginable adversity, Gabby  spent a decade helping to build a gun violence prevention movement more  powerful than the gun lobby. The Bipartisan Safer Communities Act is  just the beginning, and we will keep fighting to end the scourge of gun  violence in this country together.   In reflection of Giffords' 10-year anniversary, I ask my colleagues  to join me in recognizing their tireless advocacy to end gun violence  and honoring my personal hero, Gabby Giffords.                            ____________________
