 Mr. President, yesterday, the Senate had a significant  vote. Senators made their voices heard on the Green New Deal, and after  a lot of grandstanding from those Senate Democrats who initially rushed  to support this proposal, not a single one voted for the proposal.   However, my Republican colleagues and I didn't vote present. We don't  believe that is what our constituents sent us here to do. Instead, we  voted against the socialist grab bag of policies that would set us back  an estimated $93 trillion and would bankrupt the State of Texas. To be  clear, voting no on the Green New Deal isn't a referendum on the issue  of lowering carbon emissions or finding cleaner energy; it is saying no  to the litany of far-left proposals that would leave American families  footing the bill to the tune of tens of thousands of dollars each.    The Green New Deal promised things like free higher education. You  might have thought this was really about the environment; well, it was  a grab bag of government handouts and takeovers. It also included  Medicare for All, which means that if you have employer-provided health  insurance, you couldn't keep it. Even President Obama said: If you like  what you have, you can keep it. But not now--not with this new, radical  group of Democrats who now say: Forget that promise. We are going to  take what you have, even if you like it.   There, of course, was the guarantee of jobs. I noted yesterday that  the only thing missing from the Green New Deal is free beer and pizza  for everybody.   It has been estimated that implementing the full list of the Green  New Deal's promises would cost the average American family $65,000 a  year, which is well over what many Americans make annually.   These ludicrous proposals were pitched as a way to uplift the middle  class and create jobs, but in reality, they would have undone the  economic gains we made these past 2 years under the Trump  administration. We could say goodbye to the record-low unemployment  levels and the growth we have been seeing. What middle-class American  do you know who could afford an extra $65,000 each year to pay the  Federal Government for the litany of Green New Deal line items, such as  tearing down every building and replacing it with a green version?   Even the liberal AFL-CIO's energy committee had this to say:   [[Page S2017]]              We will not accept proposals that could cause immediate       harm to millions of our members and their families. We will       not stand by and allow threats to our members' jobs and their       families' standard of living to go unanswered.    This is the AFL-CIO.   Instead of the Green New Deal, we should follow the Texas model of  innovation. But it is not just Texas; there are some great private  sector initiatives taking place that deal with this concern about  CO2 emissions in a much more practical, rational, free  market way. We have a thriving energy sector in Texas, as the Presiding  Officer knows, and it isn't stifled by overregulation. That is one  reason it is thriving.   The Green New Deal would force us to rely on foreign energy sources  because we wouldn't be able to produce enough here in the United States  to keep the lights on. But with investment in innovative solutions and  new technologies, we can ensure that our country can remain energy  independent and deal with legitimate concerns about the environment.   I applaud our colleagues who voted against this legislation to ensure  that the American people won't have to pick up the tab for the far-left  wing agenda of our Democratic colleagues. Conversely, I stand ready to  work on real, achievable solutions and to find ways to reduce emissions  and lessen our environmental footprint without overregulating and  overcharging.                               Deer Park, Texas    On another note, most people across the country hadn't heard of Deer  Park, TX, until last Sunday. They were probably more familiar with  nearby Houston, TX. But last Sunday morning was when the first reports  came rolling out that residents were forced to shelter in place when a  chemical tank at the Intercontinental Terminals Company, or ITC, caught  fire.   ITC's tanks hold petrochemical liquids and gases used to produce  gasoline--all highly flammable and hazardous. As many could have  predicted, but certainly no one had hoped, the fire spread quickly to a  nearby tank. By Wednesday, seven tanks were aflame. Firefighters fought  for 3 days to extinguish the massive flames, and just when it seemed as  if the fire was under control, it flared again last Friday, burning  through 11 storage tanks in total. A massive fireball and billowing  plumes of smoke could be seen for miles. This didn't stop, as new tanks  caught fire, forcing schools and businesses to close and residents to  rightfully question their safety.   Unfortunately, the story doesn't end there. By the end of the week,  as ITC drained chemicals from the remaining exposed tanks, the  containment wall surrounding the tank farm burst. Foam used to fight  the fires and contaminants leaked, forcing a portion of the Houston  Ship Channel to close and bringing a new round of health risks  associated with the release of airborne and liquid toxins.   Earlier this week, officials from ITC said that cleanup crews had  removed more than 33,000 barrels of an oily mixture from the ship  channel. That is 1 million gallons, which is more than I can even  imagine.   The chemical fire and resulting chemical spill not only brought grave  health concerns to those who live and work around Deer Park and  pollution to the air and environment, it also ground businesses in the  region to a halt. Because of the chemical spill, nearly 7 miles of the  Houston Ship Channel closed for 3 days, cutting off this booming area  of our economy from the waterway and delaying shipment of goods up and  down the ship channel. Some estimates show that the region's oil and  gas and petrochemical sectors lost $1 billion in revenue as a result of  the closure. This ship channel sees hundreds of shipments a day, with  tankers and freighters moving various products and goods up and down  the shoreline to businesses surrounding the Houston area.   The effects from the closure of facilities and companies in the area  will require a costly and lengthy recovery. Folks along the ship  channel in Southeast Houston will also be concerned about health  consequences until we can find out more answers.   The ITC's tanks contain chemicals commonly used in the production of  gasoline--xylene, naphtha, pyrolysis gasoline. Naphtha, in particular,  can irritate and burn the nose and throat when inhaled. When exposed to  fire, naphtha can produce poisonous gases. The health effects of these  chemicals are of grave concern, but it is not just the short-term  effects--the irritation and burning--that are concerning; contact with  these chemicals can potentially have lasting, long-term effects, making  it vital to discern the exact level of exposure to these chemicals  caused as a result of the fire.   It is important that we get to the bottom of this, and I am proud  that our local, State, and Federal officials have quickly jumped into  action. The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, the  Environmental Protection Agency, local responders, and the Coast Guard  were all on the scene quickly and have been working around the clock  since the start of the first fire. The U.S. Chemical Safety Board and  the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, or OSHA, have opened  investigations into the fires. The Environmental Protection Agency,  along with the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, are  conducting continuous air quality checks.   I appreciate the swift action by local, State, and Federal agencies  to protect my constituents in the region and conduct investigations to  ensure that we can prevent this type of event from ever occurring  again. I will monitor those investigations closely as they progress and  will ensure they have the resources they need in order to complete  their work.   Sometimes when people hear us talk about regulation, they act as if  our side of the aisle believes that no regulation is appropriate, which  is entirely false. It is important to have regulations to protect the  public safety of the American people and particularly in places around  tank farms like this one in Deer Park. I think it is very important  that any existing regulations--that we make sure those regulations and  laws are enforced.   As part of this investigation, I hope we will find out that there  were no violations of existing regulations and laws, but if there were,  then the people responsible should be held accountable. I am not going  to prejudge at this early point before the investigation takes place  whether there is any legal responsibility or whether anybody did things  they should not have done consistent with the laws and regulations that  do exist, but I will say that once the investigation is complete, if  there were violations of regulations designed to protect the public  safety or laws passed by Congress and signed by the President, that I  will be the first to demand there be accountability for violation of  those regulations and those laws.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
