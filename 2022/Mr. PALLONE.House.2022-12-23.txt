 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this final  omnibus package.   This bill includes important health care and consumer protection  provisions out of the Energy and Commerce Committee.   The bill invests in our children's health with two years of  additional funding for the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP)  and, for the first time, guarantees 12 months of continuous coverage  for kids on CHIP and Medicaid. This will safeguard access to health  care for 40 million young people across the nation. It also permanently  extends the option for states to provide new moms with Medicaid  coverage for 12 months postpartum, a critical part of our effort to  address the unacceptable maternal mortality crisis that  disproportionately affects women of color.   I am also pleased that we reached bipartisan agreement to ensure  Puerto Rico and the U.S. Territories have the Medicaid funding they  need to ensure access to care for their residents.   The government funding agreement also provides additional resources  to address the mental health and substance use disorder crises facing  the nation, especially among our young people. It reauthorizes key  programs that support Americans' mental health and substance use  recovery needs, expands access to medication assisted treatment,  bolsters workforce capacity and training, and establishes important new  programs and services including a national maternal mental health  hotline and task force.   The omnibus also strengthens our nation's public health agencies. It  modernizes the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) accelerated  approval program to give the agency more oversight over drugs and  biologics that receive approval through this pathway. It also provides  the agency with new authority to improve the diversity of populations  participating in clinical trials, and finally updates FDA's authority  to oversee the safety of cosmetics and personal care products. This is  something I've been working on for more than a decade and now it is a  reality. This omnibus also applies the lessons learned from the COVID- 19 pandemic to help the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  prepare to respond to future public health emergencies.   Finally, the omnibus includes a number of important consumer  protection provisions that will guard consumers against counterfeit and  dangerous products, bolster U.S. manufacturing, and continue to promote  our economic competitiveness on the world stage.   I am proud that this final bill includes so many important health  care and consumer protection provisions that came out of the Energy and  Commerce Committee in a bipartisan fashion over this last Congress. I  urge my colleagues to support this important bill that invests in the  health and well-being of the American people. I am submitting  additional supplemental materials on the intent of certain Medicaid  provisions that I authored in the omnibus.   Mr. Speaker, the bill before us today is a tremendous step forward in  expanding health care access for millions of low-income Americans. It  will permanently strengthen access to Medicaid for children, new  mothers, seniors, and individuals with disabilities. It will  responsibly wind down the maintenance of effort requirement from the  Families First Coronavirus Response Act (FFCRA), and gradually phase  out the enhanced federal Medicaid matching funds. And finally, it will  expand beneficiary protections, enhance transparency, and provide the  Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) with additional tools to  prevent improper coverage loss.   Under FFCRA, Congress provided states with a temporary increase in  their federal Medicaid dollars in exchange for states adopting  [[Page H10523]]  certain policies. Collectively, these policies were known as the  ``maintenance of effort'' requirements. One of these requirements is  that for the duration of the public health emergency, states may not  disenroll anyone from their Medicaid programs, sometimes referred to as  the continuous coverage requirement.   Experts have raised concerns that when the continuous coverage  requirement ends, millions of eligible Medicaid beneficiaries--most of  whom would be children--could improperly lose access to health care.  This is unacceptable. I'm pleased that this legislation includes  several provisions to mitigate these coverage losses.   Specifically, it gives the Secretary additional enforcement authority  to ensure that states follow all requirements that apply to Medicaid  eligibility redeterminations. These are, of course, in addition to  enforcement tools already available to the Secretary under current law.  Under this legislation, states would only receive the enhanced federal  funds if they follow these requirements. This will provide the  Secretary with more targeted enforcement authority in addition to that  which he already has under the Medicaid statute.   The bill before us also combines discretionary enforcement  authorities with mandatory penalties for states that fail to comply  with certain provisions. For example, if a state is out of compliance  with the additional beneficiary protections, the Secretary may require  a corrective action plan, assess civil monetary penalties against a  state, or require a state to stop disenrolling individuals for  procedural reasons. However, if a state fails to comply with the bill's  data reporting requirements, the bill would require the Secretary to  reduce that state's Medicaid matching rate.   States will face an unprecedented task when they begin the work of  conducting eligibility redeterminations for more than 80 million low- income individuals, including children, seniors, and individuals with  disabilities. That is why it is so critical for us to pass this bill to  provide additional protections to these vulnerable populations. That  said, I want to be clear that nothing in this bill in any way  constrains the remedies available under current law to Medicaid  beneficiaries and stakeholders who have been harmed by a state's  violations of the Medicaid statute. Specifically, the bill does not  establish a comprehensive remedial regime of the type described by the  United States Supreme Court in decisions regarding litigation involving  section 1983. It is also not the intent of Congress to alter any  federal right on the part of private individuals to use the remedies  guaranteed by Section 1983, if they are injured by unlawful state  actions involving Medicaid eligibility redeterminations.   The bill before us is a huge victory for Medicaid beneficiaries and  states. It expands coverage while giving states the resources they need  to responsibly transition from the continuous coverage requirement,  while protecting low-income individuals from improper coverage loss. It  will provide the Secretary of HHS with new tools to protect  beneficiaries, while preserving the existing enforcement mechanisms and  legal remedies that will help mitigate coverage loss. This bill is  obviously not perfect, and there is still more that must be done to  expand coverage to low-income individuals, but I'm proud of this bill  and strongly believe it will improve access to health care for millions  of our most vulnerable citizens. I urge my colleagues to join me in  supporting this important bill.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this final  omnibus package.
