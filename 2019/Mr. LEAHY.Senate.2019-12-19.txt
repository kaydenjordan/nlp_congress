 Mr. President, I am pleased to be here with my good friend  the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, Senator Shelby from  Alabama. We worked hard on this bill, he as chairman and I as vice  chairman. We reached a bipartisan, bicameral agreement that will fund  the Federal Government in fiscal year 2020.   The agreement rejects some devastating and shortsighted cuts proposed  by the President. It makes historic investments in the American people  and working families. It fully implements the bipartisan budget  agreement and allows us to invest an additional $27 billion in  nondefense programs to benefit our Nation's children, improve our  educational institutions, protect our environment, combat the opioid  crisis, promote and grow our economy, invest in our infrastructure, and  protect our elections. There is a lot in here.  [[Page S7174]]    There are 12 appropriations bills put into 2 minibuses. The first, we  refer to as the domestic minibus bill. That is a strong bipartisan bill  that makes real and historic investments in the American people and our  communities.   It rejects anti-science and know-nothingism proposals by making  record-level investments in science and research programs. We all know  that you have to invest in science and research, and you cannot turn  this on and off year by year. We have to think long term.   We also have to invest in our children's education. We have increases  in programs with proven success, such as Head Start, the child care and  development block grant, child nutrition programs, 21st-century  learning grants, Pell grants, and others.   For the third year in a row, it continues the historic level of  funding to combat opioids that we began in fiscal year 2018. This  funding is critical for State and local governments because they are at  the frontlines of this battle.   The agreement provides over $5 billion more than the President's  budget to protect national parks and public lands and fund critical  environmental protection and conservation programs. These national  parks are an important part of our heritage. The Presiding Officer has  some of the most beautiful ones in the country in his State, but all of  our national parks are beautiful. I think about the brilliance of  people like President Theodore Roosevelt who said: Let's preserve them.   Even though the administration denies that climate change exists, the  agreement includes significant resources to combat this threat in the  new fiscal year.   It rejects the President's proposal to totally eliminate key Federal  affordable housing and economic development programs.   For the first time in decades, Congress has come together to fund $25  million for gun violence research by the Centers for Disease Control  and the NIH. That is a significant step to combat the gun violence  epidemic and rash of school shootings facing our Nation.   It is a good bill. It is certainly going to improve the lives of  Vermonters. It improves the lives of millions of Americans in all the  States. It provides support for working families and supports and  promotes our economy. In a few moments, we are going to vote on the  motion to invoke cloture on this bill, and I will urge an ``aye'' vote.   The second package of bills, we refer to as the national security  minibus bill. It is critical funding to support our troops, invest in  our military, and protect our Nation from ongoing threats, both foreign  and domestic.   Importantly, it includes $425 million for election security grants.  While the administration has not requested anything, I heard from  secretaries of state--Republicans and Democrats alike--throughout the  country, including our own, Jim Condos of Vermont, of the need for  these election security grants. It is a matter of national security to  preserve our democracy, and we have to maintain full faith in our  elections.   We also fund the constitutionally mandated 2020 Decennial Census.  That is in the U.S. Constitution. It not only determines congressional  apportionment, but it also is relied on to distribute $900 billion in  Federal funds. We have to have a fair and accurate count, and the money  provided in this bill will help us achieve that.    We have significant investments to fight crime and terrorism,  implement criminal justice reforms, combat violence against women, and  keep communities safe.   We also have funding for the Department of Homeland Security.   I would note that we have one area that has been a lightning rod in  both Chambers. We tried to get a bill that would receive the required  number of votes to pass. The reason it has been difficult is because of  the President's insistence that we waste taxpayer money on an  ineffective and foolish wall on the southern border. We all want secure  borders. A wall that can be easily cut with a $100 power saw you can  buy at a local hardware store is not security, and we worry about the  cruel and ineffective immigration policies of the Trump Administration.   Last year, the President plunged us into a 35-day government shutdown  when Congress refused to fund his anti-immigration agenda. That cost  the taxpayers of this country billions of dollars that could have been  spent on better things. But we reached a resolution. Again, I  compliment Senator Shelby and Congresswomen Lowey and Granger because  we met for hours in my office and worked our way through that.   In this bill, the President will receive $1.375 billion for barriers  on the southern border, which is what he would have received if we had  a continuing resolution and far less than the $8.6 billion he  requested, $5 billion of which would have come from the Department of  Homeland Security.   I would have preferred no funding for the wall. President Trump's  wall will negatively impact communities in which it is built, rob  people of their property--in some cases, ranches and farmland that have  been in families for generations--and destroy critical habitat on the  border. But the Republicans were clear: They would not support a bill  that contained zero for the wall. They stood with the President on the  wall, as they seem to do time after time.   I am disappointed that we did not further restrict the President's  ability to steal money from our troops to pay for the wall. If the  President decides to once again steal money from our troops and their  families for the wall, he will have to answer in court and to the  American people. Our position on this is clear: It is wrong. No one  should interpret silence in this bill or the domestic minibus on this  issue as condoning the President's actions or as an agreement that what  he has done is lawful. It simply reflects a sad political reality that  the Republican Party refuses to stand up to this President and protect  the Congress's exclusive power of the purse and clarify the law.   One court has already correctly concluded that the President's raid  on military construction money was unlawful. That conclusion is based  on a long-standing provision of appropriations law, section 739 of the  financial services bill, that prevents the administration from  increasing funds for a program or activity requested in the budget  above and beyond what was provided in an appropriations act. This  provision is included again in the underlying bill, and we believe it  was correctly interpreted.   We denied the President's request to increase the number of ICE  detention beds to 54,000. This request was cruel and unjustified.  Instead, we provided funding to support the same level of beds as  fiscal year 2019. There is no need for a higher number.   President Trump is misusing ICE detention facilities for the mass  incarceration of asylum seekers and immigrants who have no criminal  history and pose no threat to our communities. There are more  effective, less expensive, and more humane ways to enforce our  immigration laws while immigrants go through judicial proceedings. That  is why I fought for and secured a significant increase in alternatives  to detention, like the Family Case Management Program.   I also fought to include restrictions on the President's ability to  increase the bed number by transferring money from other accounts. But  again, Republicans stood with the President and refused to negotiate on  this issue, and those critical reforms were not included.   Not every part of the DHS bill is controversial, however. The bill  provides critical funding for the Coast Guard to support their missions  to keep our country safe. It provides an increase for the  Transportation Security Administration, which ensures our safety and  security at our Nation's busy airports, and it provides increased  funding for FEMA whose mission is critical for communities struggling  to recover in the wake of natural disasters.   While I do not agree with everything included in this bill, on  balance, the security minibus provides funding important to keep our  Nation safe, to support our troops, to improve election security, and  ensure an accurate count for the Census. Later today, we will turn to  this bill, and I urge an aye vote.   I do thank Chairman Shelby for his hard work in negotiating the  bills. The hours were long. We didn't always agree. We had a lot of  weekends and evenings that we worked quietly out of  [[Page S7175]]  sight of the press and everything else, but knowing that we can take  each other's word, we worked in good faith to reach a resolution on  difficult matters. He made compromises necessary to get us a deal, as  did I. And I thank my friend Senator Shelby for his leadership on the  Appropriations Committee.   I say this as Dean of the Senate and as somebody who has served with  almost 20 percent of all the Senators in this country's history--I  thank him for his friendship.   I thank the Appropriations Committee staff on both sides of the  aisle. I might go home at 9 or 10 o'clock at night; they are still  there until 1 or 2 o'clock in the morning. They are hard-working, and  there were sleepless nights. We could not have done this without them.   Obviously, I thank my full committee staff--Charles Kieffer, Chanda  Betourney, Jessica Berry, Jay Tilton, and Hannah Chauvin--for their  work, as well as Shannon Hines, Jonathan Graffeo, and David Adkins on  Senator Shelby's staff. I thank all the subcommittee. It is a long  list, and I ask unanimous consent the entire list be printed in the  Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:        Vice Chairman Leahy List for Senate Amendment to H.R. 1158      (Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020) and H.R. 1865 (Further        Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020) Staff for the Record         Charles E. Kieffer, Chanda Betourney, Jay Tilton, Jessica       Berry, Hannah Chauvin, Shannon Hines, Jonathan Graffeo, David       Adkins, Margaret Pritchard, Dianne Nellor, Adrienne       Wojciechowski, Teri Curtin, Bob Ross, Morgan Ulmer, Patrick       Carroll, Elizabeth Dent, Anna Lanier Fischer, Jean Toal       Eisen, Jennifer Eskra, Blaise Sheridan, Elisabeth Coats,       Hamilton Bloom, Amber Beck, Allen Cutler, Matt Womble, Sydney       Crawford, Erik Raven, Brigid Kolish, Rob Leonard, John Lucio,       Andy Vanlandingham, Mike Clementi, Colleen Gaydos, Katy       Hagan, Chris Hall, Hanz Heinrichs, Kate Kaufer, Rachel       Littleton, Jacqui Russell, Jeremiah Van Auken, Doug Clapp,       Chris Hanson, Kathleen Williams, Tyler Owens, Jen Armstrong,       Adam DeMella, Meyer Seligman, Molly Marsh, Ellen Murray,       Diana Gourlay Hamilton, Reeves Hart, Andrew Newton, Brian       Daner, Sophie Sando, Scott Nance, Chip Walgren, Drenan       Dudley, Peter Babb, Chris Cook, Justin Harper, Thompson       Moore, Kamela White, Christian Lee, Rachael Taylor, Ryan       Hunt, Melissa Zimmerman, Faisal Amin, Emy Lesofski, Lucas       Agnew, Nona McCoy, Alex Keenan, Mark Laisch, Kelly Brown,       Kathryn Toomajian, Meghan Mott, Laura Friedel, Michael       Gentile, Ashley Palmer, Jeff Reczek, Sarah Boliek, Alley       Adcock, Michelle Dominguez, Jason McMahon, Patrick Magnuson,       Jennifer Bastin, Joanne Hoff, Tim Rieser, Alex Carnes, Kali       Farahmand, Paul Grove, Katherine Jackson, Sarita Vanka, Adam       Yezerski, Dabney Hegg, Jessi Axe, Christina Monroe, Virginia       Flores, Clare Doherty, Gus Maples, Rajat Mathur, LaShawnda       Smith, Jason Woolwine, Courtney Young, Valerie Hutton, Elmer       Myles, Penny Myles, Karin Thames, Robert Putnam, Clint       Trocchio, Christy Greene, Blair Taylor, Jenny Winkler, Hong       Nguyen, Christy Greene, George Castro.    I have often said that we Senators are merely  constitutional impediments to the staff who do such great work, and I  applaud them all on both sides of the aisle.   I yield the floor to my distinguished chairman.    Mr. President, I want to thank everybody for joining  Senator Shelby and I on this vote. It is going to help us move forward,  and, as I said in my earlier remarks, Republicans and Democrats came  together and worked extraordinarily hard on these appropriations bills,  and it shows what can be done when we work together. I think the vote  here is an indication of that.   If nobody is seeking recognition, I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Virginia  Flores, a detailee of the Transportation, Housing and Urban  Development, and Related Agencies Subcommittee, be granted floor  privileges for the debate and action on H.R. 1158 and H.R. 1865.
