 Mr. Presisent, according to press reports, the Trump  administration plans to nominate Mauricio Claver-Carone to be the next  president of the Inter-American Development Bank, IDB. It is also my  understanding that a number of Latin American governments have already  expressed support for his nomination.   As someone who has supported the IDB for decades, including at times  when amendments were proposed to eliminate or reduce the U.S.  contribution, it is important to be aware that this nomination could  jeopardize U.S. support for and cooperation with that institution.  Further, if the U.S. Treasury Department and other IDB shareholders  believe this nominee will help to build support for a capital increase  for the Bank in the U.S. Senate Appropriations Committee, of which I am  vice chairman, Mr. Claver-Carone is the wrong nominee to make the case  for such an increase.   This nomination would break a 60-year precedent that a Latin American  serves as president of the IDB and a U.S. citizen serves as executive  vice president. That precedent exists for a reason. The Bank is an  institution working to improve the lives of millions of people in Latin  America and the Caribbean, and absent a compelling reason to the  contrary, it should continue to be led by a person from the region it  serves. There are any number of Latin Americans who are well-qualified  for the job and who would be supported by the United States.   I am disappointed, albeit not surprised, that the Trump Treasury  Department would nominate such a controversial candidate as Mr. Claver- Carone. As senior director for Western Hemisphere Affairs at the  National Security Council, he has been the architect of President  Trump's most ideologically driven policies toward Latin America,  policies that have failed to achieve any of their stated goals. In  fact, these ineffective policies have made resolving conflicts with  governments we disagree with more difficult, and they have complicated  our relations with friends and allies.   Mr. Claver-Carone's idea of diplomacy is often to admonish and impose  sanctions, which in Latin America more often than not means unilateral  sanctions, which have isolated the United States, emboldened those who  the sanctions are intended to punish, and harmed people in those  countries who we want to help. While there are circumstances when well- designed sanctions make sense, Mr. Claver-Carone seems to believe that  even when it is obvious that sanctions have failed the solution is to  tighten them rather than fix them. This approach to regional problems  is wholly unsuited for the IDB, whose shareholders have traditionally  supported the institution, in part, because of its long history of  addressing regional priorities. A polarizing American at the helm could  intensify divisions, weaken shareholder support, and diminish the  Bank's ability to carry out its mission on behalf of the people it was  established to serve.   I also worry that a Claver-Carone presidency at the IDB would set the  Bank on a collision course with its largest shareholder, the United  States, should Vice President Biden win in November. Electing Mr.  Claver-Carone to a 5-year term just weeks before the U.S. Presidential  election, coupled with his unpopularity with some Members of Congress,  including key members of the Senate and House Appropriations  Committees, would not bode well for U.S. support for the Bank in the  coming years.   For these reasons, I urge the IDB board of governors to carefully  consider the enormity of the economic, public health, political, and  other challenges currently confronting Latin America, and the  implications of Mr. Claver-Carone's election shortly before the U.S.  Presidential election. These challenges have been greatly compounded by  the COVID-19 pandemic, which will have grave ramifications for the  social, economic, and political stability of the region for years to  come.   The need for steady IDB leadership that can build consensus during  this time of regional uncertainty has never been more evident than it  is today.   I ask unanimous consent that an article in The Economist on the  Claver-Carone nomination be printed in the Record.  [[Page S3307]]    There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                    [From the Economist, June 20, 2020]       A Gringo Takeover Bid for the Inter-American Development Bank               The United States breaks a gentlemen's agreement         Since it was founded in 1959, the Inter-American       Development Bank (idb) has had just four presidents: a       Chilean, a Mexican, a Uruguayan and, since 2005, Luis Alberto       Moreno, a Colombian. Under the gentlemen's agreement by which       it was founded, Latin America has the presidency and a small       majority of the capital while the United States has the       number-two job and some informal vetoes over how the bank is       run. The idb has not been free of the faults of such       institutions, such as bureaucracy and a degree of cronyism,       but it has played an important role in the region. It lends       around $12bn a year for infrastructure, health, education and       so on, does some useful research and advises governments. It       has also been a channel of communication between the two       halves of the Americas.        Donald Trump doesn't believe in gentlemen's agreements, and       his administration this week broke this one. The Treasury       Department named Mauricio Claver-Carone, the top official for       Latin America at the National Security Council (nsc), as its       candidate to replace Mr Moreno, who is due to step down in       September. Mr Claver-Carone, a Cuban-American, is technically       qualified for the post. He has been an adviser to the       Treasury and a representative to the imf, and was involved in       the Trump administration's initiatives on development       finance. He has told interlocutors that he would serve only       one term at the idb, would bring fresh ideas and would be       better placed than a Latin American to get the Treasury's       crucial support for a capital increase that would give the       bank resources to mitigate the covid-19 slump in the region.       These are things that many in Latin America might welcome.        But Mr Claver-Carone is a controversial choice, and not       just because his nomination breaks with tradition. At the nsc       he has been the chief architect of Mr Trump's Venezuela       policy, which has failed in its aim of getting rid of the       dictatorship of Nicolas Maduro. ``He's a guy who comes with       very Miami-type baggage, adversarial to Cuba and Venezuela       and representing a conservative alliance,'' says a Latin       American diplomat. ``He would bring ideology directly into       the bank.'' Mr Claver-Carone walked out of the inauguration       of Argentina's president, Alberto Fernandez, in December       because of the presence of a Venezuelan minister. Many who       have dealt with him describe him as arrogant and       confrontational.        Given the Trump administration's cold war against China, Mr       Claver-Carone's appointment as head of the idb might force       Latin America to choose between the two countries, which the       region is reluctant to do. Although China is granting fewer       loans to Latin America than it did recently, it remains one       of the region's most important trade partners. The Trump       administration was furious with Mr Moreno for agreeing to       hold the bank's annual meeting in China in 2019 (though in       the event it was delayed and moved to Ecuador because of a       row over who represented Venezuela). Mr Claver-Carone has his       own animus against Mr Moreno, who vetoed his appointment as       the bank's vice-president.        For Latin America the loss of the idb presidency would be a       big diplomatic defeat, reflecting the region's weakness and       ideological division. Its leaders are a generally       unimpressive bunch. They have failed to unite behind a       candidate of their own. Diplomats expected the job to go       either to Brazil or to Argentina. Jair Bolsonaro's government       in Brazil informally canvassed support for Rodrigo Xavier, an       experienced banker. Argentina's putative candidate, Gustavo       Beliz, is a competent former idb official, but its centreleft       government has few allies in the region. Brazil looks likely       to back Mr Claver-Carone, mainly because Mr Bolsonaro has       aligned himself closely with Mr Trump. Other smaller       countries may, too, because they are desperate for money.        The new president must secure a double majority, of       countries representing 50% of the idb's shares (the United       States has 30% and Brazil 11%) and separately of the 28       members in the Americas. That may yet be a problem for Mr       Claver-Carone.        The biggest reason to oppose his nomination is that he       represents a polarising administration that may well lose an       election in November, making him ``the earliest lame duck in       history'', as a South American official puts it. The sensible       course would be to extend Mr Moreno's term until next year,       both to give time for other candidates to emerge and to see       whether Mr Claver-Carone really represents the United States                            ____________________
