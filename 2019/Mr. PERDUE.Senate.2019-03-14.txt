 Mr. President, today I wish to congratulate one of  my constituents, Dr. Curtis Jones, Jr., on being named the 2019  National Superintendent of the Year. Dr. Jones is an outstanding public  servant, and I am honored to commend him in the Senate today.   A native of Barnesville, GA, Dr. Jones is the son of a schoolteacher  and a preacher. Prior to becoming an educator himself, Dr. Jones  graduated from the U.S. Military Academy at West Point and served over  20 years in the Army, retiring as lieutenant colonel. Upon retirement  from the Army, Dr. Jones began his career in education as a JROTC  instructor before becoming a high school principal, assistant  superintendent, and later superintendent of Griffin-Spalding County  Schools.   Dr. Jones joined his current school district, Bibb County Schools, as  superintendent in 2015. Under Dr. Jones' leadership, the school  district has been completely turned around, and the graduation rate has  increased by more than 20 percent. Dr. Jones has brought the Macon-Bibb  County community together for a common cause, and it has been a joy to  see the school district's progress as a result of his leadership and  service to those students.   Throughout this entire process, Dr. Jones has repeatedly recognized  the teachers, principals, and students in his school district for their  contribution to this award. He has also attributed his success to the  love and support of his family. Dr. Jones has truly made his State and  country proud, and I congratulate him and his family on this high  honor.                            ____________________
