 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the immediate consideration of H. Con. Res. 72, which was  received from the House.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  resolution be agreed to and that the motion to reconsider be considered  made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate.    Mr. President, unfortunately, this Congress has been  defined by previously unprecedented political antics. Things that used  to be far above the political fray are now getting roiled in  controversy.   One example is yesterday, when the minority leader blocked the  bipartisan bill that I introduced to reduce drug prices--a bill that  received unanimous support in the Judiciary Committee. I recognize my  friend from Connecticut Senator Blumenthal, who is the chief Democratic  cosponsor of that bill.   I think the most egregious example of politicalization of things that  used to be nonpartisan has to be the politicalization of the Violence  Against Women Act, or VAWA. For 25 years, this program has supported  survivors of domestic violence and sexual assault through a range of  critical programs and resources.   As a longtime victims' rights advocate myself, I am a proud supporter  of the Violence Against Women Act, and I have consistently fought not  only to continue it but to strengthen it as well.   I think there is more we can and should do to support victims, and I  know folks on the other side of the aisle feel the same way. It is safe  to say, though, that we have had our fair share of disagreements on how  exactly to accomplish that.   Earlier this year, our Democratic colleagues allowed VAWA to get  caught in the crosshairs of a funding debate when they insisted we  should not fund this vital program because it is overdue for updates.  This is a rash move, to be sure. It lines up with the ``my way or the  highway'' legislative strategy sometimes deployed by our friends on the  other side, but that hasn't stopped my Republican colleagues, led by  Senator Joni Ernst from Iowa, from pursuing a compromise.   For many months now, Senator Ernst has been working with Dianne  Feinstein, the Senator from California, to find ways to make  improvements that both sides can agree on. That is the way things get  done around here: You try to build consensus, and maybe you don't get  everything you want, but if you can get 80 percent of what you want,  you ought to take it and run.   Last week, unfortunately, Democrats walked away from the negotiating  table when it came to the Violence Against Women Act. Rather than  continuing the discussions with people of opposing views, they took the  easy way out and simply walked away and introduced their own partisan  reauthorization--one they know has no chance of passing.   Just like the version that passed the House earlier this year, this  is a messaging document, worth no more than the paper it is written on.  It is not going to reauthorize VAWA or make the program better, and it  is not going to support victims because it stands no chance of becoming  law.   I am truly disappointed that our Democratic colleagues, once again,  have chosen to play politics rather than deliver real results, this  time for the victims of domestic violence and sexual assault.   Despite the games being played here, my Republican colleagues and I  are working to put in the hard work it takes to actually accomplish  something and legislate.   Senator Ernst said she will soon be introducing a good-faith proposal  that actually has the chance to become law. It is not a partisan  document. It really is a return to where we used to be, where the  Violence Against Women Act enjoyed broad support on both sides of the  aisle and was truly not just bipartisan but nonpartisan. It is a shame  that something as urgent and undeniably important as combating domestic  violence and sexual assault has somehow fallen prey to Washington, DC,  politics.   I hope our colleagues will reconsider and return to the negotiating  table so we can reach a compromise and finally reauthorize the Violence  Against Women Act.                                 E-Cigarettes    Mr. President, on another matter, in recent months, there has been a  lot of coverage in the news and in social media about the health  consequences of e-cigarette use. The ``e'' stands for electronic-- electronic cigarette use.   We have seen alarming headlines about vaping-related illnesses that  have led to severe health consequences and dozens of deaths. I find it  particularly concerning that an increased number of children in middle  school and in high school are using these products, even though it is  inconsistent with the law. It is against the law.   The National Youth Tobacco Survey estimates that more than 5 million  middle and high school students currently use e-cigarettes, up from 3.6  million last year. Five million middle and high school children are  using this product that the law says they should not be using.   Folks at home are certainly dealing with the fallout. Last year, 19  percent of Texas high school students had used an e-cigarette in the  last 30 days, and news reports lead me to believe the number has done  nothing but go up.   Certainly, there are negative health consequences associated with it.  A teen in Michigan was recently hospitalized, as my colleague from  Michigan well knows. He was recently hospitalized after vaping and then  had to have an incredibly rare double lung transplant because of the  damage done to the lungs.   This is causing alarm for parents, for educators, for health  professionals, and just about everybody else who has heard about it. It  certainly caught my attention.   Yesterday the HELP Committee--the Health, Education, Labor, and  Pensions Committee--in the Senate held a hearing to look into the  government's lackluster response to these public health concerns. I am  seriously concerned with how, compared to traditional cigarettes, this  industry is able to evade countless government regulations, especially  through online sales.   Consumers are able to purchase traditional cigarettes online, but  there are clear guardrails in place to prevent minors from using online  purchases to skirt the age restrictions.   At the time of delivery, if you buy cigarettes online, you have to  sign and show an ID proving your age. That just  [[Page S6587]]  makes sense to me. You have to show ID when you purchase cigarettes at  a gas station or convenience store, and buying them online should be no  different, but in the case of e-cigarettes, it is different. Anyone, no  matter how old or how young, could go online and buy e-cigarettes and  have them delivered to your front door, no questions asked.   You better believe underage kids are taking advantage of that  loophole. A recent survey found that about one-third of underage e- cigarette users bought them online.   What people need to understand is that e-cigarettes are essentially a  nicotine delivery device. Nicotine, of course, is an addictive drug, so  it is not as if there aren't negative health consequences. Even if they  are not smoking tobacco, if they use e-cigarettes, there are true risks  to the health of these young people.   Now, while an adult, I believe, ought to be able to do things that  maybe negatively impact their health, I think we have an obligation to  protect children, particularly those who are making bad decisions,  before they are prepared to understand what the consequences really  are.   So while it is important for us to understand the health impact of  these devices and have serious conversations with our own children  about the risks, we should do something to prevent children from  getting their hands on e-cigarettes in the first place.   I have introduced a bill with Senator Feinstein and Senator Van  Hollen that prevents the online sale of e-cigarettes to minors using  the same safeguards that stop them from being able to use regular  cigarettes and smokeless tobacco products on the internet. The law is  the same with regard to who can legally purchase them, so we ought to  have the procedures in place that prevent underage smokers from buying  cigarettes online without a signature and without an identification  card proving their age. We ought to have the same procedures in place  for e-cigarettes.   This bill, thankfully, has broad bipartisan support, with one-quarter  of all Senators serving as cosponsors, and it has recently passed the  House by a voice vote.   When we talk about passing consensus legislation in the Senate, this  is about as easy as it comes. I hope we can bring this legislation to  the Senate floor soon so we can prevent the next generation from using  legal loopholes to get their hands on e-cigarettes.   I yield the floor.
