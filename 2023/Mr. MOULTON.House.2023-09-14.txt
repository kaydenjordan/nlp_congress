 Madam Speaker, I rise today in honor of my friend, the  six-term Congressman from Utah, Chris Stewart, who retires from  Congress this week.  [[Page H4331]]    Of all the things we have worked on together, I am most proud of  passing the bill that created the 988 Mental Health Lifeline. Since it  went live last summer, millions of Americans have received help in a  moment of mental health crisis, with countless lives saved as a result.   As fellow veterans, we have seen firsthand the consequences of  inadequate mental health care. We knew it could be an uphill battle to  pass our bill, and it was. You wouldn't believe some of the stories.   That is why you need a partner you can trust. That is Chris. Beyond  his admirable commitment to his family and this job, it is just hard  not to like Chris.   He is an Air Force veteran who broke the world record for the fastest  nonstop flight around the world. He is a successful businessman. He has  authored multiple best-selling books. What can't this guy do?    Well, one thing he didn't have to do was take a lot of political risk  to work across the aisle with a Democrat on a big bill like 988.  Political courage means something to Chris. We need more leaders like  him in Washington.   Chris, thank you for your service. We will miss you, and I wish you  and your family only the best.   Madam Speaker, I include in the Record letters of congratulations and  appreciation from the Massachusetts and Utah chapters of the American  Foundation for Suicide Prevention.                                                 September 12, 2023.      Hon. Chris Stewart,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative Stewart: The American Foundation for       Suicide Prevention's (AFSP), Massachusetts chapter writes to       congratulate you and wish you well as you leave Congress this       month. We extend our thanks and appreciation for your       outstanding leadership in finding bipartisan solutions to       prevent suicide and help save lives.        Suicide was the 11th leading cause of death in the United       States in 2021. We are grateful for your partnership with       Representative Seth Moulton to establish the new 988 Suicide       and Crisis Lifeline and build out a comprehensive crisis       response system. Since its launch just over a year ago, the       988 Lifeline has responded to millions of calls, texts, and       chats from people needing life-saving support.        Our chapter also appreciates your work to address the youth       mental health crisis and Veteran suicide prevention. Veterans       are about 1.5 times more likely to die from suicide than       their non-Veteran peers, and we appreciate your collaboration       with Representative Moulton to bring needed attention to this       important issue.        During your 11 years in Congress, you successfully worked       across the aisle to help ensure that people struggling with       their mental health are connected to timely supports and       services. We thank you for your service, and we wish you and       your family well.            Sincerely,                                              Jessica van der Stad,               Executive Director, Massachusetts Chapter, American       Foundation for Suicide Prevention.                                   ____                                                 September 12, 2023.      Hon. Chris Stewart,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative Stewart: The American Foundation for       Suicide Prevention's (AFSP) Utah chapter writes to       congratulate you on your remarkable career in Congress and to       thank you for your leadership on suicide prevention and       mental health during your 11 years in office. We thank you       for your collaboration to raise the visibility of suicide       prevention and increase access to mental health services and       supports, and we wish you well as you leave Congress later       this month.        AFSP Utah celebrated alongside you when the bipartisan       National Suicide Hotline Designation Act), a bill you led       with Rep. Seth Moulton to establish the new 988 Suicide and       Crisis Lifeline, passed in 2020. We were especially proud       that you built on the success of the crisis line in Utah to       enact this bill, which represents a monumental opportunity to       transform the way our country responds to suicide, mental       health, and substance use crises. Since its launch in July       2022, the 988 Lifeline has helped millions of people in       suicide and mental health crisis, and we have been honored to       work alongside you to support its implementation.        Through your leadership on the House 988 & Crisis Services       Task Force and the Congressional Mental Health Caucus, you       took many concrete actions to reduce the stigma associated       with mental health, educate other members of Congress and the       public about mental health and ways to get help, and identify       bipartisan solutions to prevent suicide. We are proud that       AFSP recognized these significant accomplishments with       several awards, including the 2018 ``Allies for Action''       Congressional Award and, most recently, the 988 Crisis       Response Champion Award with the National Alliance on Mental       Illness (NAMI), and the #ReimagineCrisis campaign.        We thank you for your leadership and collaboration, and we       would be happy to continue to serve as a resource for you.       Hope to see you at our Central Utah Walk in Richfield on       September 30, 2023. We wish you and your family all the best       in your next chapter.            Sincerely,                                                       Taryn Hiatt,         Executive Director, Utah Chapter, American Foundation for                                                 Suicide Prevention.                                   ____________________
