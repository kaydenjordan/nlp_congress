 When our Founding Fathers chose a bold, new,  and innovative self-rule government, it was met with deep skepticism by  the world's monarchs. They said self-rule is only a dream. Our Founders  said they are right; it is the American Dream.   Now it is our dream. We are in charge. The speakership of the United  States House of Representatives is the crucial outpost for the well- being of the people's government, the keeper, if you will, of the  dream.   Sir, if you wish to assume this awesome responsibility, please raise  your right hand.   Mr. Rogers of Kentucky then administered the oath of office to Mr.  Johnson of Louisiana, as follows:   Do you solemnly swear or affirm that you will support and defend the  Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and  domestic; that you will bear true faith and allegiance to the same;  that you take this obligation freely, without any mental reservation or  purpose of evasion; and that you will well and faithfully discharge the  duties of the office on which you are about to enter, so help you God.   (Applause, the Members rising.)    Congratulations, Mr. Speaker.  [[Page H5053]]                                ____________________
