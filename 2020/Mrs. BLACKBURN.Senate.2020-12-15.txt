 Mr. President, I am pleased that we've finally agreed  on language to enhance penalties for female genital mutilation, or FGM,  a truly horrible practice. I thank my colleagues in the House who  worked with me on this issue.   More than 200 million women and girls alive today in 30 countries in  Africa, the Middle East, Asia, and the United States have fallen victim  to this monstrous practice. Researchers estimate more than 500,000  women and girls in the U.S. have experienced or are at risk of falling  victim to FGM.   I introduced legislation on this subject earlier this year, and,  although the final language adopted by the House in H.R. 6100 doesn't  include the protections I championed in a legally precise manner, it  will send a strong message that Congress condemns the violent and  disgusting butchery of young girls and women in this country.   Federal law bans the practice of FGM. However, in 2018, a district  judge in Michigan found unconstitutional under Commerce Clause grounds  the Federal statute banning FGM. Rather than appeal, the Department of  Justice's Solicitor General wrote a letter asking Congress to amend the  law to address the constitutional problem. I ask unanimous consent that  this letter be printed in the Record following my remarks.   The bill I introduced in response to this request, S. 2017, the  Federal Prohibition of Female Genital Mutilation Act of 2019, fixes the  constitutional defects by adding specific commerce clause-focused  language to the current law. It is a straightforward change that would  make the existing statute consistent with Supreme Court precedent.   The House version of my bill will go a long way in protecting women  and girls from FGM, but I remain convinced Congress can and should go  even further to prevent this barbarity. Because H.R. 6100 only  criminalizes FGM acts committed for nonmedical reasons, it creates a  loophole in the form of a medical benefits defense. Criminal defendants  could leverage this defense against their victims by claiming they  performed FGM to prevent infections, inflammation, or sexually  transmitted diseases, all common excuses in countries where FGM is  widespread. Unlike the old law, the burden is now on the government to  prove the act was not done for medical reasons. Previously, it was the  defendant's burden to prove the act was not medically necessary, per 18  U.S.C. 116(b).   While medical issues are commonly contested in FGM cases, the  addition of a new element for the government to prove as part of its  case-in-chief makes it tougher to prosecute perpetrators.   Furthermore, section 5 of H.R. 6100 declares that the Michigan  district court decision on interstate commerce is erroneous. That  language squarely conflicts with the Solicitor General's letter to  Congress, which asserts the exact opposite.   A fix-it law should make a defective law better, not introduce new  problems or make it easier for defendants to escape accountability. I  am disappointed that these concerns were not addressed early on in the  legislative drafting process, but I am also optimistic that we will  resolve them in a future Congress.    There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                         U.S. Department of Justice,                                 Office of the Solicitor General,                                     Washington, DC, April 10, 2019.       Re United States v. Jumana Nagarwala et al., No. 17-cr-20274           (E.D. Mich. Nov. 20, 2018)        Hon. Dianne Feinstein,       Ranking Member, Committee on the Judiciary,       U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.        Dear Senator Feinstein: Consistent with 28 U.S.C. 530D, I       write to call your attention to the above-referenced decision       of the United States District Court for the Eastern District       of Michigan. A copy of the decision is attached.        This case is the first federal prosecution under 18 U.S.C.       116(a), which prohibits female genital mutilation (FGM).       Section 116(a) makes it a criminal offense to ``knowingly       circumcise[ ], excise[ ], or infibulate[ ] the whole or any       part of the labia majora or labia minora or clitoris of       another person who has not attained the age of 18 years.''       Ibid. The district court dismissed the FGM charges, holding       that Section 116(a) is beyond Congress's power. First, the       court concluded that Section 116(a) is not necessary and       proper to effectuate an international treaty under Missouri       v. Holland, 252 U.S. 416 (1920). The court rejected the       government's argument that the provision was rationally       related to implementing the United States' obligations under       the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights       (ICCPR), done, Dec. 19, 1966, 999 U.N.T.S. 171, 6 I.L.M. 368.       Second, the court relied on United States v. Lopez, 514 U.S.       549 (1995), and United States v. Morrison, 529 U.S. 598       (2000), to hold that Section 116(a) was beyond Congress's       power under the Commerce Clause. The court found that FGM was       not an economic activity but was instead a form of physical       assault, and that the statute adding Section 116(a) to the       U.S. Code was unaccompanied by detailed, record-based       findings from which a court could determine that FGM       substantially affects interstate commerce. The court further       emphasized that, unlike many federal criminal statutes,       Section 116(a) does not include any jurisdictional elements,       such as a requirement that the charged offense have an       explicit connection with, or effect on, interstate commerce.        Section 116(a) targets an especially heinous practice--      permanently mutilating young girls--that should be       universally condemned. FGM is a form of gender-based violence       and child abuse that harms victims not only when they are       girls, suffering the immediate trauma of the act, but also       throughout their lives as women, when it often results in a       range of physical and psychological harms. See Act of Sept.       30, 1996, Pub. L. 104-208, Div. C., Tit. VI, Sec. 644(a), 110       Stat. 3009-708 (18 U.S.C. 116 note). The Centers for Disease       Control and Prevention estimates that half a million women       and girls in the United States have already suffered FGM or       are at risk for being subjected to FGM in the future. See       Howard Goldberg et al., Centers for Disease Control and       Prevention, Female Genital Mutilation/Cutting in the United       States, 131 Public Health Reports 340 (2016). The Department       therefore condemns this practice in the strongest possible       terms.        That said, the Department has reluctantly determined that--      particularly in light of the Supreme Court's decision in       Morrison, which was decided after Section 116(a)'s       enactment--it lacks a reasonable defense of the provision, as       currently worded, and will not pursue an appeal of the       district court's decision. Instead, we urge that Congress act       forthwith to address the constitutional problem, by promptly       enacting the attached legislative proposal, which, in our       view, would clearly establish Congress's authority to       criminalize FGM of minors and ensure that this practice is       prohibited by federal law.        First, the Department has determined that it lacks an       adequate argument that Section 116(a), as it is currently       written, is necessary and proper to the regulation of       interstate commerce. Pursuant to the Commerce Clause,       Congress can regulate and protect the channels of interstate       commerce, the instrumentalities of interstate commerce, and       activities that ``substantially affect interstate commerce.''       Gonzales v. Raich, 545 U.S. 1, 17 (2005). Unlike many federal       criminal statutes, however, Section 116(a) does not require       proof of any nexus between the conduct at issue (performing       FGM on minors) and interstate commerce--the critical defect       found by the Supreme Court in Morrison and Lopez.       Furthermore, although FGM can be performed in circumstances       with commercial characteristics, FGM itself does not appear       to be inherently an economic activity, and when performed       purely locally, FGM does not appear to be ``part of an       economic `class of activities' that have a substantial effect       on interstate commerce.'' Ibid.        Second, the Department has determined that it does not have       an adequate argument that Section 116(a) is within Congress's       authority to enact legislation to implement the ICCPR, which       does not address FGM. None of the ICCPR's provisions       references FGM at all. Nor do they provide a basis for the       federal government itself (rather than the individual States)       to criminalize FGM of minors by private parties. This case is       therefore not analogous to Holland, which involved a treaty       that more directly addressed the parties' obligation to       protect certain migratory birds and to propose legislation to       do so. See 252 U.S. at 431. Thus, even maintaining the full       continuing validity of Holland, the Department does not       believe it can defend Section 116(a) on this ground.  [[Page S7498]]         Although the Department has determined not to appeal the       district court's decision, it recognizes the severity of the       charged conduct, its lifelong impact on victims, and the       importance of a federal prohibition on FGM committed on       minors. Accordingly, the Department urges Congress to amend       Section 116(a) to address the constitutional issue that       formed the basis of the district court's opinion in this       case. Specifically, concurrently with submitting this letter,       the Department is submitting to Congress a legislative       proposal that would amend Section 116(a) to provide that FGM       is a federal crime when (1) the defendant or victim travels       in or uses a channel or instrumentality of interstate or       foreign commerce in furtherance of the FGM; (2) the defendant       uses a means, channel, facility, or instrumentality of       interstate commerce in connection with the FGM; (3) a payment       is made in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce in       furtherance of the FGM; (4) an offer or other communication       is made in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce in       furtherance of the FGM; (5) the conduct occurs within the       United States' special maritime and territorial jurisdiction,       or within the District of Columbia or a U.S. territory; or       (6) the FGM otherwise occurs in or affects interstate or       foreign commerce. In our view, adding these provisions would       ensure that, in every prosecution under the statute, there is       a nexus to interstate commerce.        Please let me know if we can be of further assistance in       this matter.            Sincerely,                                                 Noel J. Francisco,      Solicitor General                            ____________________
