 Does the name ``Barre Seid'' ring a bell? Barre Seid, of  Chicago, a businessman--a successful businessman. He was born in 1932,  and he owned a company called Tripp Lite that made electronic products.   He was very successful in the course of his life, but he decided to  donate the value of this company to something known as the Marble  Freedom Trust. Does that ring a bell? Barre Seid, Marble Freedom Trust?   The reason I bring this up on the floor of the United States Senate  is, Mr. Seid, with this gift of $1.6 billion to Marble Freedom Trust is  setting out to change America.   Wait a minute. A 90-year-old individual, who has been charitable in  many ways, gives money away and it changes America? Yes. I stand by my  comment, because the Marble Freedom Trust is now becoming the largest  dark money--secret money--contributor to American political campaigns  in the history of the United States. And if you think I am  overreacting, the go-to leader of the Marble Freedom Trust is a man  named Leonard Leo.   I am sure none of these names register with most Americans--Barre  Seid of Chicago, Marble Freedom Trust, Leonard Leo. What does this have  to do with what my family is worried about? Well, let me get to the  bottom line because the leader from the Republican side just alluded to  it.   This $1.6 billion is going to be invested in political campaigns on  the right for conservative Republican candidates, period.   Leonard Leo has a pedigree and well-known background of involvement  in politics in Washington, and he has been very successful.  [[Page S4944]]    I am a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, currently chairman;  but over the years I have watched, over the Trump years, every judicial  nominee approved by the Republicans had to pass one litmus test: They  had to be cleared by the Federalist Society. Now, that is another name  which the average American family won't recognize, but let me tell you  what the Federalist Society is. The Federalist Society is a  clearinghouse for lawyers who want to be judges. You have got to join  it. You have got to pay your dues. You have got to show up. Most  importantly, you have to pass the checklist of required positions on  issues before you can become a judge on the Republican side.    That happened over and over and over again in the hearings we had for  nominees for lifetime appointments to the Federal court during the  Trump administration.   I would ask these lawyers sitting before us, when you could question  them: Tell me about the Federalist Society.   Oh, we just got together for lunch once in a while. It is not that  big a deal.   But what a coincidence that every nominee had to be approved by the  Federalist Society, and it didn't end there. When former President  Trump put out his list of potential Supreme Court nominees, which  included the three whom he ended up choosing, all of them were provided  by the Federalist Society--the Federalist Society and Leonard Leo.   Sadly, they got the job done. Senator McConnell was complicit in  that. When there was a vacancy on the Supreme Court with the untimely  death of Antonin Scalia, it was Senator McConnell and Senate  Republicans who blocked President Obama in his last year in office from  filling that vacancy. In fact, they refused--they said to their  Members: Don't even meet with the man.   Here is Merrick Garland, a respected jurist on the DC Circuit,  nominated to the highest Court in the land, can't even get an  appointment with a Republican Senator to plead his case that he would  be a good nominee. And the reason? Senator McConnell was bound and  determined to make sure that a Federalist Society nominee eventually  made it to the Court, and he got his way.   So now we have Leonard Leo in a new role. God only knows how much  they are paying him. But this man is now set up on a new political  agenda. It is the largest dark money, secret money effort in the  history of the United States. How did we learn about Barre Seid giving  $1.6 billion to this Marble Freedom Trust? Someone leaked it to the  newspapers. Otherwise, it would have gone unnoticed because this is, in  fact, the world of dark and secret money.   Senator McConnell made a passing reference to the fact that we are  about to vote on something called the DISCLOSE Act. The DISCLOSE Act-- and I want to salute Senator Whitehouse, who is not on the floor at the  moment. The DISCLOSE Act is really pretty basic. We are going to vote  today on this provision which would be added to our campaign law-- protecting American democracy from foreign interference and requiring  super PACs and special interest groups to disclose anyone contributing  $10,000 or more to their cause. That is it. We don't prohibit the  actual contribution; we just require disclosure. Where is it coming  from?   The reason we ask for this is that you go State by State with the  heated campaigns of the day, and you will find all sorts of ads online  and on television, and you have to race to the TV set to get close  enough to read the small print at the end of the ad that explains who  pays for it. If you knew who really paid for it, it would explain a lot  of things to you.   I have been, for example, at war with the major credit card  companies, Visa and MasterCard. They have a duopoly. And I believe they  overcharge consumers across America, and they are a contributor to  inflation. In fact, they admit that much. So, as a result, I passed an  amendment 8 or 10 years ago which they have branded the ``Durbin  amendment'' which limits debit card swipe fees, interchange fees--I get  into the world of finance here--and they hate it.   Visa and MasterCard hated my amendment like the Devil hates holy  water. Why? Because it costs them $8 billion a year. It reduces the  add-on charges that retailers--restaurants and shops--have to charge  when people use a Visa and MasterCard. So, every once in a while, they  work up the courage to come at me again and try to undo this amendment,  and they buy television ads. Do the television ads say that they are  paid for by Visa and MasterCard? No. They say they are paid for by the  Committee for a Better America or something.    What we are trying to do with the DISCLOSE Act is give to the voters  of this country more information and, in so doing, protect the whole  process from corruption by foreign money being spent or by individuals  like Mr. Seid, who puts $1.6 billion into the treasury of the  Republican side.   Now, if they came to the floor to debate this--and I don't think they  will--they are likely to say: Well, you do the same thing. You use dark  money and such.   It is true that the campaign system is set up for organizations not  to disclose, but we are authoring the solution to the problem for both  political parties. We are standing by a reform and a change--Senator  Whitehouse has led the way--that would literally say to America: You  have the right to know. Who is paying for this candidate's ads? Who is  putting all those ads on TV? What special interest group is behind this  cause?   Now, Senator McConnell says we should be dealing with serious issues.  There is no more serious issue than the integrity of our campaign  process. And I know, as a person who has been a candidate over many  years, that it has changed dramatically. I can remember not that long  ago when the first super PAC effort on the Democratic Senate side  raised something in the range of $4 million to $10 million. Well, I can  tell you that has been increasing by multiples every year, and on the  other side, it is the same story.   Do we need to sit down both political parties and put an end to this  madness? Do we need to tell Mr. Seid and his family: Take your $1.6  billion and spend it for something that is really wholesome and of  value to your community and your Nation, rather than to get into the  hunt to be the biggest spender.   Mr. Seid became the biggest spender of campaign funds in the history  of the United States with his $1.6 billion contribution to Leonard Leo,  the Marble Trust, and the Republican cause. That is a fact. I think we  ought to change it. This system we have in America is one we need to  protect and not exploit.   When the U.S. Supreme Court in Citizens United decided that money was  speech and that corporations had a right to speak, it really corrupted  the system in ways unimaginable. We are living with the results today.  Citizens United was a terrible decision. Search the Constitution all  day and night for the word ``corporations,'' and you won't even find  it. This is no constitutional protection. And the idea that if you are  rich, you can speak more loudly and more often in America is a  corruption of the basic rights we all should protect and enjoy.   So I am going to vote in favor of the DISCLOSE Act. I don't think it  is as insignificant as the Senator from Kentucky does. I think it gets  to the heart of the issue about the future of our democracy.                            Continuing Resolution     Madam President, this Senate is facing an important  deadline. Eight days from today, September 30, is the end of the fiscal  year. That leaves us just a handful of legislative days to pass a  continuing resolution that will keep the government operating while  Congress negotiates a Federal budget for the next fiscal year.   It is critical that we come to agreement as quickly as possible on a  responsible Federal budget for next year. While we continue our  negotiations, it is also critical that we not lose momentum on two  life-and-death battles in which we are now seeing hard-won progress.   I am speaking about our efforts to finally end the COVID pandemic--as  well as our Nation's efforts to help Ukraine repel Russia's immoral and  illegal war on that small democracy.   Finally, we can help our fellow Americans who are suffering in the  wake of a catastrophic Hurricane Fiona in Puerto Rico, recent  devastating floods in Kentucky, and other natural disasters.  [[Page S4945]]    Because, when disasters overwhelm the ability of communities and even  States to respond, we don't abandon our fellow citizens to suffer  alone. We reach out our hand to help.   I want to take a few minutes to speak about each of these priorities  that must be included in the continuing resolution. In recent weeks,  the world has seen a stunning contrast in courage, leadership, and  decency play out on the world stage. In Ukraine, we have witnessed the  Ukrainian military retake thousands of square miles of territory in the  Kharkiv region in a lightning counteroffensive against the Soviet  occupiers. We have seen weeping men and women able to return to their  communities. Others have come out of their homes and basements for the  first times in months, overwhelmed with emotion at what they hope is  the end of their nightmare. Still other Ukrainians are beginning the  heartbreaking work of exhuming bodies from discovered mass graves and  documenting Russian war crimes and atrocities.   This is Ukrainian President, Volodymyr Zelenskyy last week in the  newly liberated city of Izyum. President Zelenskyy is singing the  Ukrainian national anthem during a Ukrainian flag-raising ceremony with  members of the country's armed forces who drove out the Russian  occupiers. He resolutely proclaimed, that while Russia may still occupy  parts of Ukraine, for now ``[i]t is definitely impossible to occupy our  people, the Ukrainian people.''   And what was happening in Moscow as Ukrainian communities were being  liberated--and neglected and demoralized Russian troops were fleeing in  haste? Vladimir Putin, who has never visited the Russian soldiers he so  cynically uses for his disastrous war in Ukraine, was opening a giant  Ferris wheel at an amusement park, trying to give a facade of normalcy.  Putin is terrified that the Russian people will learn the truth about  his failed and grotesque war--a war fueled by lies, war crimes, and  Putin's warped nostalgia for a Soviet dystopia. Why else would he  censor the news and jail anyone who criticizes the war? Why else would  he imprison brave Russian patriots such as Alexei Navalny and Vladimir  Kara-Murza who respect the Russian people by speaking the truth and  offering real debate? Just 1 day after Putin opened the Ferris wheel in  Moscow, the ride broke down, leaving some people dangling high off the  ground. It was a pathetic and apt metaphor for Putin's disastrous war  against Ukraine. Putin vowed that Russia would take Ukraine in days,  maybe in hours. That was nearly 7 months ago. Today, Russia is losing  its war against Ukraine.   From the earliest days of this war, when Ukrainian forces repelled  Russian forces trying to seize Kiev and set up a puppet government,  U.S. and allied support has been critical to Ukraine's military  success. The successful counteroffensive we are seeing today is due,  first and foremost, to the heroism of President Zelenskyy and the  Ukrainian people. But it's also a reflection of President Biden's  foresight and leadership in rallying our allies and providing timely  and formidable assistance to Ukraine.   Yet we cannot assume that Ukraine's victory is inevitable. A wounded  beast is dangerous. Russia still occupies large swathes of Ukraine and  is threatening to unleash even more powerful weapons in a desperate  attempt to avoid complete defeat. In fact, over the last 24 hours  alone, Putin has made a number of desperate and increasingly unhinged  announcements: calling for a partial mobilization of more Russian  reservists despite mounting losses; making further veiled threats of  using nuclear weapons; and pursuing sham referendums across eastern  Ukraine, beginning as early as this Friday, echoing his past  illegitimate actions in Crimea. Let me be clear that the U.S. never  recognized the annexation of Crimea.   Today, Senator Rubio and I will introduce legislation making clear  the U.S. will never recognize Russia's annexation of any other part of  Ukraine. All this is a reminder of why we must pass additional aid to  Ukraine as part of the continuing resolution without delay.   This war is not simply a war between Russia and Ukraine. It is a  battle between democracy and autocracy. It is cheaper for us, and it is  unquestionably in our national security interest, to win this war while  it is still contained within Ukraine.   Madam President, ending the COVID pandemic once and for all is  another battle that we are winning and can't afford to give up on now.  When President Biden took office, he set an ambitious goal: to  vaccinate 70 percent of American adults. We have done that--and more.  Today, almost 80 percent of all Americans--more than 260 million  people--are well on their way to being fully vaccinated. Experts tell  us those vaccinations have helped prevent more than 60 million  infections in the United States, 17 million hospitalizations, and more  than 2 million deaths. That is a modern medical miracle. But we are not  out of danger completely. The virus is still circulating, still  mutating, and still sickening and killing people. America is still  seeing 57,000 new COVID infections daily, with more than 30,000 people  hospitalized and more than 400 people dying each day.   In March, President Biden asked for additional funding and resources  to continue the fight against COVID. For months, our Republican  colleagues have blocked that request. Their obstruction has had serious  costs. With another COVID surge likely on its way this fall, the  administration is running out of funds to purchase and distribute COVID  vaccines. And it has been forced to pause part of its free testing  program. President Biden is right; we have made huge progress against  COVID. But history shows us what happens when we declare a pandemic to  be over prematurely. The flu pandemic of 1918, which killed at least 50  million people worldwide, had at least 4 waves over about 2 years. In  some cities, the fourth wave killed even more people than the second  wave. Why was the fourth wave so much deadlier? Because, by then,  people had grown tired of precautions and given up on them. We can't  repeat that deadly mistake.   We need to pass the administration's request for additional funds for  public and global health so that we can end the COVID pandemic once and  for all, and we must also dedicate more funds to helping stop the  spread of monkeypox. I also strongly support the administration's  request for additional funding for the Global Fund to fight AIDS,  tuberculosis, and malaria, as well as Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, to  control the spread of the pandemic amid potential new variants.   Finally, as I said, Madam President, we must include in the  continuing resolution disaster relief funds to help our fellow  Americans who are suffering in the wake of natural disasters in Puerto  Rico, Kentucky, California, and many other States. The entire island of  Puerto Rico--more than 1 million people--lost power this weekend as it  was battered by Hurricane Fiona, almost exactly 5 years after the  devastation of Hurricane Maria. Roughly 70 percent of residents and  businesses lost access to clean water, with massive flooding still  ongoing. I stand ready to do all I can to provide Federal support to  the island and other communities recovering from disasters this year.  They need our help now. I hope my Republican colleagues will join  Democrats in providing it.   I yield the floor.    I announce that the Senator from Wisconsin (Ms. Baldwin)  is necessarily absent.    I announce that the Senator from Wisconsin (Ms. Baldwin)  and the Senator from New Jersey (Mr. Booker) are necessarily absent.    I announce that the Senator from Wisconsin (Ms. Baldwin),  the Senator from New Mexico (Mr. Heinrich), and the Senator from  Washington (Mrs. Murray) are necessarily absent.
