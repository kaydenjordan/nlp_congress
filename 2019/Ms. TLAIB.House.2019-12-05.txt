 Madam Speaker, I rise today to give a hearty  congratulations to our Panthers, the River Rouge High School football  team on winning their first ever state championship. Thirteenth  District strong is so incredibly proud.   In a dramatic game, our River Rouge Panthers prevailed over setbacks  early on to defeat a formidable opponent. This hard-earned victory is a  testament to the countless hours of training put in by this dedicated  team, as well as the support of its coaches and our parents.   As legendary basketball coach Phil Jackson once said, ``The strength  of the team is each individual member. The strength of each member is  the team.''   Please join me in recognizing our River Rouge High School football  team, the Panthers, and Coach Corey Parker for their outstanding  accomplishment.   Congratulations, Panthers.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, today, I am representing the Congressional  Progressive Caucus in our Special Order so that we can push forward on  a number of agendas, especially on economic justice issues. I am really  proud to join many of my colleagues today as we talk about housing for  all across the United States of America.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Minnesota (Ms. Omar).    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California  (Mr. Gomez).    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from New York  (Ms. Ocasio-Cortez), my good colleague.    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Oregon (Mr.  Blumenauer), my good colleague.    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania  (Mr. Evans), my good colleague.    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr.  Garcia), my good colleague.    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from  Massachusetts (Ms. Pressley), my good colleague.    Madam Speaker, I know from my district in Detroit and  throughout the 11 other surrounding communities, for us, being the  third poorest congressional district in the country, housing is  critical, critical not only for economic stability, but also in  providing a safe haven for many of our families across the district.   Poverty is complex. A number of factors, including State and Federal  policy failures and racial and gender inequities, have resulted in so  much increased poverty, especially among children. Adjusting poverty  requires that deep public investment in housing and other  infrastructure, healthcare access, and public school investment,  coupled with criminal justice reform policies designed to repair a  history of segregation and continued exploitation.   Less than a year, Madam Speaker, into its enactment, the opportunity  zone program has already resulted in millions of dollars of wasteful  spending and possible corruption.   From cities like Chicago and Baltimore to the city of Detroit,  billionaires were able to divert public tax dollars through a tax break  called the opportunity zone that was supposed to lead to access to  housing for our most vulnerable in communities like mine.   Instead, Madam Speaker, what we heard from an investigative report-- ProPublica published an article, titled: ``How a Tax Break to Help the  Poor Went to NBA Owner Dan Gilbert.'' The article contained disturbing  details that suggest that opportunity zones that were in the Trump tax  scam had designated census tracts that did not meet the legal criteria  and that political donations and influence had overridden the law to  reward donors with generous tax breaks supposedly intended to benefit  the poor.   Madam Speaker, in the article, billionaire Dan Gilbert's Quicken  Loans company donated $750,000 to President Trump's inauguration fund,  hosted Ivanka Trump in 2017 for a panel discussion, and last year Dan  Gilbert watched the midterm election returns at the White House with  President Trump, who has called Gilbert ``a great friend.'' In return,  Madam Speaker, three census tracts in downtown Detroit where Gilbert  owns valuable property were selected for these large tax breaks through  the opportunity zones.   According to ProPublica, multiple studies have found that property  values in those zones increased because of this tax break. At least one  of those census tracts did not meet the poverty requirement for being  an opportunity zone and appears to have been designated solely due to  political influence.   So, if we are going to talk about housing justice, we are going to  talk about impacting and helping ensure that housing is a human right,  we also need to take out the corruption and the political influence.   Email exchanges revealed Quicken executives working in concert with  the White House to designate tracts with Gilbert's investments as  opportunity zones. Madam Speaker, Quicken Loans lobbyists were directly  involved in the selection process at every level, lobbying the city,  State, and Federal officials to include Gilbert's investment zones in  the opportunity zone law.                                time  1615    So I am asking us as we stand for housing for all that we need to  restore public trust in our Federal Government which has been eroded  with the rules that have been applied unevenly here and seem to reward  the wealthiest and the best-connected among us. It appears that a tax  program supposedly designed to benefit the poorest among us is now  being used to reward political donors and wealthy investors.   I have asked the Committee on Ways and Means to investigate the  actions by billionaire Dan Gilbert, and I have also asked the Treasury  to respond to some of those questions.   This is why instead of these tax breaks for the wealthy and for  billionaire-led development, I have proposed the BOOST Act.   The BOOST Act would give 3 to $6,000 to families making less than  $100,000. It would instantly lift up 45 percent of Americans living in  poverty now. Sixty-four million children would be instantly uplifted  out of poverty. The BOOST Act would be paid for by repealing the Trump  tax scam. In there, Madam Speaker, you saw not only the opportunity  zones, but a number of tax breaks for the wealthy that only benefited  the folks who are corporate-led who have actually been tainting our  process to get access to affordable housing in this Chamber.   So I ask my colleagues, as we propose many fixes to access affordable  housing and to repair some of the historic segregation zoning laws and  the continued exploitation among many of our neighbors, that we also  make sure that we are ensured that corruption within our government is  not expanding and that we are holding those accountable who are trying  to taint that process.   So I really appreciate my colleagues, members of the Congressional  Progressive Caucus, in standing strong for housing as a human right.   Many of the proposals you see forward, Madam Speaker, will only  depend on whether or not we can implement it in a way that is just and  is very democratic and, again, has really clear oversight. Things like  the opportunity zone are not the direction that we need our country to  go in, and I am looking forward to introducing legislation that would  not only ask for repealing the opportunity zone but actually use it for  land trust and community trust funds, things that will be rooted within  communities and help those who, again, are seeing homeownership among  communities of color decrease, seeing increases between 30 to 50  percent of their income going towards rent. I think the way we have to  do it is all those goals, not only proposals, but also making sure that  we are implementing it in a way that is just and fair.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Green).    Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
