 Madam Speaker, I have talked with job creators and the  hardworking Pennsylvanians who go to work every day. Do you know what  they are saying? They are saying: I don't need government telling me  what is best for me and my family.   But just yesterday, President Biden released details for his vaccine  mandate for businesses with more than 100 employees.   President Biden's go-it-alone approach of running America has left  him tone-deaf.   Vaccine mandates are un-American, period.   That is why I partnered with Senator Braun to introduce a resolution  under the Congressional Review Act to strike down this unconstitutional  overreach of government. Every member of the Education and Labor  Committee is on board with this bill, and we have growing interest  throughout the Republican Conference.   Right before the holidays, America is facing a supply chain crisis,  rising costs on everything from gas to groceries, and President Biden  isn't listening to the people for whom he works.   Our resolution sends a message to President Biden loudly and clearly:  Americans are fed up with mandates and government control.                            ____________________
