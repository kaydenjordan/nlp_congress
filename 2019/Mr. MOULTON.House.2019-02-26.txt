 Mr. Speaker, last year I attended a rally where the  father of a gunshot victim spoke, and he talked about all the things  that he and other people around this country are doing to end senseless  gun violence.   Then he turned to the crowd and asked: But what is Congress doing?  And tens of thousands of Americans, as if they had rehearsed it  hundreds of times, all said in unison: ``Nothing.''   But what is Congress doing? Nothing.   Standing in that crowd was not a proud moment for me, because he is  right.   Mr. Speaker, 37 Americans have died from gun violence in my district  alone in the past 5 years. Gun violence is now the second leading  killer of young people Nationwide, trailing only car accidents.   For too long, Congress has done exactly what the crowd said: nothing.   This week, we are putting forth legislation to enhance background  checks, but this alone isn't enough. Thoughts and prayers won't cut it.  Only action saves lives. This is just a start.                            ____________________
