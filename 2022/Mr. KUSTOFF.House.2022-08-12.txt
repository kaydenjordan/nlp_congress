 Madam Speaker, I thank the ranking member for yielding.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to what the  Democrats call the Inflation Reduction Act which is really the  inflation expansion act.   Americans are grappling with an economy in recession and the highest  inflation that we have seen in 40 years. We are experiencing worker  shortages, empty grocery shelves, and higher energy prices. Now  Congressional Democrats are doubling down on this out-of-control  spending that led to this economic crisis.   This package that we are voting on today will raise taxes on  hardworking, middle-class families. It will authorize 87,000 new IRS  agents to target individuals and small businesses. It will reduce  lifesaving healthcare innovation by allowing the government to impose  price controls on drugs. It will hurt energy producers. And it will  certainly worsen inflation.   I am voting against this fundamentally flawed and defective package  because families, farmers, and small businesses across west Tennessee  and across the Nation need real solutions to these problems, not more  taxes and not more government spending.
