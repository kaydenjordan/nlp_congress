 Mr. Speaker, John Adams said our Constitution is fit  for a moral and religious people, and is wholly inadequate to the  government of any other.   The average American watches about 30 hours a week on broadcast TV.  And, of course, what starts on broadcast TV winds up on other screens  as well. The Federal Communications Commission is tasked with keeping  obscene and indecent content off the airwaves.   While there are some especially responsible parents who raise their  children with no TV in the house at all, as a practical matter,  broadcast TV affects the moral norms of the Nation.   I have received complaints in my office, and rightfully so, about  Cardi B and the GRAMMYs. They wonder why we are paying the FCC if they  feel this should be in living rooms across the Nation.   I realize that Kamala Harris has used her fame to promote this  performer, but I assure the FCC that millions of Americans would view  her performance as inconsistent with basic decency.   Wake up, FCC, and begin to do your job. The moral decline of America  is partly due to your utter complacency.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, D.C. statehood is a ridiculous idea, which  would have shocked our forefathers. It is a government city. It has  no--or minimum manufacturing, agriculture or natural resources. With  all its government jobs and universities, it is a recession-proof city  and should be one of the easiest cities in the Nation to govern.   Let's see how the current elected officials are doing.   This is the second highest spending area in the country per pupil.   How do they do?   Tied for worst in fourth grade reading scores, worst in the country  in eighth grade reading scores, worst in the country in fourth grade  writing scores, worst in the country in eighth grade writing scores,  and second worst in the country in eighth grade math.   They have more homeless here than 29 States. Of the cities with at  least 600,000 people, it has the sixth highest murder rate. And if it  were to become a State, it would immediately become the State with the  highest murder rate in the country.   Right now, by comparison, only 49 percent of the parents of newborn  children in the District of Columbia are married. By comparison, again,  the great foreign capital, Taipei, 96 percent of the parents are  married.   This is a government city, and it would do a horrible job as a State.
