 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chair for the time.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my support and appreciation that  the House is considering the CHIPS and Science Act.   Indiana's First Congressional District is home to an incredible  manufacturing, steel, and industrial workforce. This legislation takes  historic action to shorten supply chains, increase the production of  American-made semiconductors, and protect our national security.   I thank my Senate colleague from Indiana, Senator Todd Young, for his  steadfast leadership on this initiative.   Today is a good day for northwest Indiana and the State of Indiana.  This bipartisan legislation is an investment in research, technology,  and STEM. It allows us to be in enhanced global competitiveness. It  makes us less reliant on other countries for chips and semiconductors.  It invests in the American worker and ingenuity. It allows for our  autoworkers to complete production without stoppages. It allows for  continuity for our steel industry and steelworkers and productivity,  and it strengthens our Nation's security.   It creates an opportunity for Indiana in a bipartisan congressional  manner and the delegation to come together to compete for a tech hub,  and it creates a future for the next generation of workers.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this agreement, and I  thank the chair, again, for my time.
