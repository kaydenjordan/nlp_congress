 Mr. President, I rise today to salute the work  of three New Hampshire-based air traffic controllers--Jeff Aulbech,  Neil Cospito, and Michael Jacobson--who calmly and quickly resolved a  complex situation in the snowy skies of New England in 2018. The three  men were awarded the prestigious Archie League Medal of Safety Award  from the National Air Traffic Controllers Association, NATCA, last  year, and I ask all Americans to join me and NATCA in marveling at the  poise they all showed on that November afternoon.   Jeff, Neil and Michael work at the Boston Air Traffic Control Center,  a regional air route traffic control center in Nashua, NH, that covers  tens of thousands of miles of airspace above New England, New York, and  northeast Pennsylvania. On Tuesday, November 20, 2018, Neil was working  an F-16 aircraft from the 158th Fighter Wing of the Vermont Air  National Guard. Poor weather conditions were preventing the pilot from  landing the aircraft at its home base in Burlington, VT. Neil scoured  the region for a suitable location outside of the sprawling weather  system, and he quickly found one in Syracuse, NY. He cleared the  aircraft to travel southwest to its new destination and asked the pilot  to estimate his time en-route and his remaining fuel. When the pilot  relayed that he had 15 minutes of fuel for a 15-minute trip, Neil knew  that the F-16 had become an emergency aircraft.   As the aircraft left Neil's controlled airspace, fellow air traffic  controllers Jeff Aulbech and Mike Jacobson continued working the  emergency situation. Jeff and Mike promptly evaluated their options.  They decided the best course was to divert a flight of KC-135 tankers  from a nearby, unrelated mission and to conduct a mid-air refueling.  Jeff explained to the KC-135 pilots that the F-16 was at ``Bingo  Fuel''--a term used by military pilots when they reach a critical and  emergency fuel state. When he secured agreement from both crews, Jeff  executed precise time intercept vectors to join the two aircraft and  begin refueling. As Jeff worked with the aircraft in the sky, Mike  worked the radar and communicated with the airport in Syracuse to  confirm suitable landing conditions. A short time later, the F-16  safely touched the ground in Syracuse.   Quick thinking and error-free execution from Neil Cospito, Jeff  Aulbech, and Mike Jacobson saved the F-16 and its pilot from a number  of dangerous alternatives, and they played a pivotal role in  maneuvering this flawless refueling with a number of other planes  sharing the skies. As many of us travel across the country throughout  the year, we should take a moment to reflect on the significance of air  traffic controllers like Neil, Jeff, and Mike and thank them for  working every minute of every day each year to keep our skies safe.   On behalf of the people of New Hampshire, I ask my colleagues and all  Americans to join me in thanking Neil, Jeff, and Mike for their service  and wishing them all the best as they continue their good work.                            ____________________
