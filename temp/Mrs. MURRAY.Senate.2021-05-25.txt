 Mr. President, this bill is an important opportunity for  Congress to put partisanship aside and help families in our country by  boosting American competitiveness. This means making sure American  research is guided by science, not by ideology.   Unfortunately, with this amendment, the Senator is doing the exact  opposite. This amendment says, loud and  [[Page S3410]]  clear, that even during a pandemic, supporters will put ideology ahead  of science and ahead of patients' health and gladly undermine the same  type of research that helped develop new therapies for COVID-19.   This is an irresponsible, ideological attack on science and medical  research. And it not only undermines doctors and researchers and  patients' healthcare, it also undermines the goal of this whole bill,  which is to boost American innovation and competitiveness. I urge a  ``no'' vote.                          Vote on Amendment No. 1891
