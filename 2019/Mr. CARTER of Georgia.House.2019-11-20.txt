 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Ms.  Jennifer T. Graham for being honored by the Zonta Club of Savannah for  her work helping single mothers throughout the Savannah area.   Ms. Graham galvanized a citywide effort that has significantly aided  hundreds of mothers in our community. She founded Shelter From the  Rain, which assists low-income mothers by providing food, job search  assistance, baby supplies, mentorship, and more. Since Ms. Graham  founded the organization in 2010, Shelter From the Rain has helped over  300 single mothers.   Her background in marketing and outreach, which includes earning a  graduate degree in marketing and doing communications for a number of  local healthcare companies has helped her maximize the number of  mothers her organization reaches.   Thank you, Ms. Graham, for your work making our community a better  place to live, and thank you to the Zonta Club for recognizing the  important work she is doing. Keep up the great work.                         National Healthy Skin Month     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  month of November as National Healthy Skin Month.   Your skin is your body's largest organ, so it is critical to take  care of it. Unfortunately, skin cancer affects around 20 percent of the  population.   This month, I encourage everyone to think about ways to keep your  skin healthy during your daily activities. For example, wearing  sunscreen, moisturizing, washing your face, and protecting against  blisters are all measures one can take to stay healthy.   Additionally, I hope everyone will consider visiting a dermatologist  this month for a skin evaluation.   Thank you to the American Academy of Dermatology as well as  dermatologists around the country for your work to protect this vital  part of our health.                   Recognizing the Service of Ms. Meg Heap     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Ms. Meg  Heap, who was recently honored by the Zonta Club of Savannah for her  work to reduce domestic violence against women.   Serving as the district attorney for the Savannah area since 2013,  she has spearheaded a number of programs in coastal Georgia to create  greater equality for women. She created an early notification  prosecutor position for domestic violence and an early notification  process for the Victim Witness Program. Additionally, she created a  one-stop Chatham County Family Justice Center.   In 2019, the District Attorney Association of Georgia selected her as  the District Attorney of the Year.   From Savannah originally, Ms. Heap can be an inspiration to all of us  about giving back to your community.   Thank you, Ms. Heap, for all of your work to make Savannah a better  place to live, and thank you to the Zonta Club of Savannah for  recognizing her achievements.                   Happy 95th Birthday to Mr. Howard Young     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mr.  Howard Young, who turns 95 years young on November 25. He has lived in  the Savannah area for over 30 years, and, during this time, he has  spent countless hours helping others around the community.   After retiring in his 50s, he began to spend each day with a  different organization volunteering. On Mondays he works with the  Veterans Administration Clinic, on Tuesdays he works with senior  citizens.   And the list doesn't stop at Friday. A World War II Navy veteran, he  works with veterans to help them get medical benefits on Saturdays and  serves at the Isle of Hope Methodist Church on Sundays.   I am proud to have a constituent like Mr. Young in the First  Congressional District of Georgia. It is easy to be inspired by his  work making the world a better place to live.   As he says: ``Each passing day is gone forever, so I want to spend as  much of each day as possible helping someone who can't help himself.''   Happy birthday, Mr. Young.                            ____________________
