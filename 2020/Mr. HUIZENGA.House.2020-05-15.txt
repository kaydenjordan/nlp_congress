 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to this $3  trillion liberal, partisan wish list.   With our Nation facing an unprecedented challenge, this bill erodes  the American people's faith in government when the Speaker refuses to  work in a bipartisan manner to move our Nation forward.   Giving money to Planned Parenthood, creating marijuana diversity  studies, and permanently rewriting our Nation's election laws have  nothing to do with the challenges we are currently facing and certainly  do not help west Michigan job creators or their employees.   Sadly, provisions in this bill actually disincentivize small  businesses from opening or helping people get back to work in a safe  and responsible manner. What the manufacturer in Kentwood, the pizza  shop owner in Muskegon, or the farmers and growers I have heard from  across west Michigan expect is for Congress to take a reasonable and  responsible approach. That is not what is happening here today.   This mother-of-all Christmas tree bills isn't the HEROES Act. In  fact, it should be called the cynical partisan act of 2020, and it has  absolutely no chance of becoming law.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to  reject this bill and turn our focus to helping our constituents, safely  reopening our economy, and defeating this virus.
