 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Michigan (Mr.  Levin) for yielding.   Madam Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the role that organized  labor has played in improving the lives of countless working men and  women across this country.   Labor unions have been the driving force for all positive change for  workers in modern history. As a former union member myself, I can  attest to the power that workers wield when they exercise their right  to organize. And I have seen the incredible work that unions in  Minnesota have accomplished when they came together to fight for  working rights.    On average, a worker covered by a union contract, earns over 13  percent more in wages than someone with similar education, occupation,  and experience in nonunionized workplaces. And unions are about so much  more than wages. They create solidarity between workers across gender,  race, ethnicity, and religion. That is why we need the PRO Act, and why  we must pass it this week, and pressure the Senate to do the same.   It will address the challenges and attacks that labor unions have  been facing for decades that have led to the erosion of wages, a spike  in workplace discrimination and a dangerous growth in inequality in our  society at every turn.   The PRO Act puts power back in the hands of workers where it belongs.  I do not want to envision what workplaces would look like for my  children and their grandchildren one day if we do not pass the PRO Act.  It is a crucial step to strengthening labor rights so that we can help  shepherd through a new generation of victories for working unions and  members.   Madam Speaker, I am delighted for our chairman and vice chairman on  the Committee on Education and Labor for their work in championing  labor rights on behalf of American workers.
