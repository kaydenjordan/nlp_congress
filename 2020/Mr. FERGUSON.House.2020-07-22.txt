 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from North Carolina  (Mr. Walker) for allowing me to do this.   I rise tonight to honor the life and legacy of John Lewis.   John dedicated his life to equality and justice, and the Nation we  are so blessed to live in is better because of his work and his  sacrifice.   John was driven by his deep faith, his servant heart, and his love of  his fellow human being. While John was always right to fight for legal  changes to make America better, he ultimately knew that how you treated  your fellow human being was a matter of the heart.   John led by example. He led by showing love and grace to all people.  He showed love and grace even to those people who disagreed with him or  showed him contempt.   John was always willing to offer forgiveness to those who had done  him wrong, knowing that forgiveness was fundamental to building a  relationship built on trust and love.   Two of my most vivid memories and treasured experiences here in my  time in Congress involved John.   One was a dinner at his house. He invited the Georgia delegation  over, and he retold the story of his life and experiences in the civil  rights movement. What a cherished memory and experience.   The second was the night that we honored another Georgia giant here,  former House Member and former U.S. Senator Johnny Isakson. I remember  the night that Johnny Isakson and John Lewis met in the center and  embraced in true love, friendship, and respect. It was truly an amazing  moment.   John was an amazing man, and I believe that the only thing John Lewis  ever hated was hate itself.   Rest in peace, our dear friend.
