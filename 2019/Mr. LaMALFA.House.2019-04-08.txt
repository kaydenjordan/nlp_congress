 Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight to speak about our recent  trip, on Friday, to Calexico, California, on the southern border  between California and Mexico, with President Trump and several of my  colleagues here from the House.   What really stood out the most to me on this visit was the dedicated  men and women who do this important work along the border from the U.S.  Customs and Border Protection and the U.S. Border Patrol. They did make  it very clear to us in the group that they don't currently have the  personnel, the funding, the infrastructure, and even the commitment by  Congress to do everything they need to do to get their job done well.   This includes the continued need for a physical barrier along the  border, which they have seen and have demonstrated works very well.  They reinforced that fences do, indeed, work. They serve as chokepoints  for those who are trying to come across the border illegally. We have  much to do in this department if we are going to have a secure border.   For this time, my hat is off to them for the great work they do and  for being honest with us about what needs to be done so they can do  their jobs well instead of watching them go right on by into our  country.                            ____________________
