 Mr. President, as ranking member of the Senate  Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, each week I recognize  an outstanding Kentucky small business that exemplifies the American  entrepreneurial spirit. This week, it is my privilege to recognize  Kentucky Mist Moonshine, of Whitesburg, KY, as the Senate Small  Business of the Week.   Kentucky Mist Moonshine is a family business nearly a century in the  making. In the 1920s, during Prohibition, Little Henry Holbrook started  distilling and bootlegging corn liquor in the Appalachian Mountains.  Despite a 17-year stint in a Federal penitentiary, Henry continued  bootlegging moonshine until he passed away in the 1980s. Decades later,  in 2015, his grandson Colin Fultz decided to turn the Holbrook family  tradition into a legal business. Using trade secrets and recipes passed  down for generations, Colin perfected his family's signature moonshine  recipe for mass production. Working out a deal with the local city  [[Page S6839]]  government, he restored and outfitted a historic building in downtown  Whitesburg to operate his craft distillery. In 2015, Kentucky Mist  Moonshine opened its doors.   Today, Kentucky Mist Moonshine is renowned for its moonshine,  whiskey, and vodka. The company has grown at a significant clip,  experiencing 105 percent growth from 2019 to 2021. Featuring over 12  varieties of moonshine, their spirits are made from an original recipe  free of artificial flavors or additives. Their products are sold  throughout the United States and have drawn praise nationwide. Every  batch is made in Kentucky under Colin's watchful eye. The Kentucky Mist  Moonshine team has grown to 15 employees and expanded to include 3  locations in Orange Beach, AL, and North Myrtle Beach and Myrtle Beach,  SC. Additionally, the distillery supports local Kentucky artisans and  regional small businesses, selling hand-crafted goods at each of their  locations. Uniquely, Kentucky Mist Moonshine makes fruit-infused  moonshine and donates the fruit byproducts to local farmers for  livestock feed.   Like many small businesses, Colin is actively involved in his  community. Kentucky Mist Moonshine is part of the Southeast Kentucky  Chamber of Commerce, while Colin serves on the local board of tourism.  Locally, Kentucky Mist Moonshine has sponsored several Letcher County  Central High School sports teams. They regularly participate in local  and regional events, including the annual Mountain Heritage Festival.  Kentucky Mist Moonshine is a member of the Kentucky Distillers'  Association, Kentucky's premier bourbon and distilled spirits trade  association. Their whiskey, vodka, and moonshine have earned multiple  awards at industry and trade shows. The company's success has been  profiled in several regional and industry publications. During the  COVID-19 pandemic, Kentucky Mist Moonshine stepped up to manufacture  hand sanitizer for local hospitals and clinics. During the summer, they  hosted a series of concerts at their facility to support local artists  and build community after a year of lockdowns.   Kentucky Mist Moonshine is a remarkable example of the resilience and  adaptability of locally owned small businesses. Small businesses, like  Kentucky Mist Moonshine, form the heart of towns across Kentucky and  play a critical role in Kentucky's bourbon and whiskey industry.  Congratulations to Colin and the entire team at Kentucky Mist  Moonshine. I wish them the best of luck, and I look forward to watching  their continued growth and success in Kentucky.                            ____________________
