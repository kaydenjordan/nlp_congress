 Mr. Speaker, I thank all my colleagues, but  unfortunately, this isn't a bipartisan group.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today with deep concern about the state of free  and diverse speech in American public life.   DIRECTV, as part of the extreme negotiation tactic, deplatformed  Newsmax and silenced their unique perspective for over 13 million  DIRECTV subscribers.   This negotiation tactic is a clear example of political bias against  conservative news outlets like Newsmax, and it is having a chilling  effect on free speech and freedom of the press.   Media outlets enjoy certain privileges as members of the fourth  estate. Limiting free speech based on political views is against the  spirit of the First Amendment and contrary to a country that celebrates  and encourages the marketplace of ideas.   As a former newspaper owner and publisher, I know what it means to  represent all viewpoints in the media and to revere that marketplace of  ideas. DIRECTV has a responsibility to reassure its customers and the  American people that it is not silencing Newsmax for political reasons.   I ask, and all of us are asking, that DIRECTV immediately come to the  negotiation table with Newsmax and end this disruption of access rooted  in political bias.   Mr. Speaker, I thank, again, my colleagues and everyone standing up  for this. I just hope that everyone on both sides of the aisle, with  all viewpoints, would stand up and fight on behalf of all of us who are  now not getting a robust debate as promised by the spirit of our  Founders.
