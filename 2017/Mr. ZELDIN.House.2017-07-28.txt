 Madam Speaker, today I was absent in order to accompany  the President of the United States on a visit to my district in Long  Island, New York. Had I been present, I would have voted ``yea'' on  rollcall No. 436, ``yea'' on rollcall No. 437, and ``yea'' on rollcall  No. 438.                             personal explanation
