 Mr. Speaker, President Trump's first 100 days have been  chaos and confusion for American families and businesses. One thing is  clear: he has consistently ignored the middle class. His budget  decimates programs like Meals on Wheels. His tax plan is a huge  giveaway to the wealthiest few. And now, he is trying to eliminate  protections for people with preexisting conditions.   The Republican's latest bill to repeal the Affordable Care Act would  be devastating. And as I have heard from constituents--hundreds of  constituents throughout my district--getting sick should never mean  going bankrupt, like Christine, from Kirkland, who was born with a  congenital heart defect and relies on costly medical care to stay  alive. She told me her condition is, ``a cruel reality that is nobody's  fault. But it is malicious and disgraceful that we might face financial  ruin for me to stay alive.''   President Trump spent his first 100 days putting families like  Christine's in jeopardy. This must change in the next 100 days for  Christine and so many others.                            ____________________
