 Madam Speaker, today I rise to recognize the hard work and  dedication of Brendan Bridges as he retires from service as Greensburg  Police Chief.   First joining the department in 2001, Chief Bridges served as a  patrol officer and detective before being promoted as police chief in  2014.   Chief Bridges is turning a chapter and becoming the resource officer  in Greensburg Community Schools system.   Madam Speaker, I thank Chief Bridges for his service to our  community, and on behalf of Indiana's Sixth District I would like to  wish him the best of luck in his future endeavors.                   Shelby County's Bicentennial Anniversary     Madam Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Shelby County,  Indiana, on the bicentennial anniversary of its founding.   Created in 1821 by the Indiana General Assembly, Shelby County is a  doughnut county of the greater Indianapolis area.   With a population of around 45,000 people, Shelby County is the home  of the 21st Vice President of the United States, Thomas Hendricks.   Shelby County is predominantly built around its manufacturing and  agriculture communities that continue to attract investment from  companies around the globe.   Congratulations to Shelby County on your 200th anniversary, and I  wish you the best of luck for the next 200 years.                    Union County Bicentennial Anniversary     Madam Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Union County,  Indiana, on the bicentennial anniversary of its founding.   Two hundred years ago, the Indiana State legislature authorized the  creation of Union County by ceding land from Fayette, Franklin, and  Wayne Counties.   With a small population of around 7,000 people, Union County is a  community based on agriculture and farming.   Union County also attracts tens of thousands of visitors annually to  visit the picturesque Whitewater Memorial State Park and the beautiful  Brookville Lake.   Congratulations to Union County for its bicentennial anniversary, and  I wish them the best of luck for the next 200 years.                          In Memory of Larry Jackson     Madam Speaker, I rise today in memory of my very dear  friend, Larry Jackson. Larry was an honest, hardworking Hoosier who  always put family first.   Larry leaves behind his wonderful wife of 56 years, Judy Jackson, and  his five children and grandchildren.   Larry was a devoted member of the St. Bartholomew Catholic Church and  a dedicated man of faith.   My condolences and prayers go out to Judy and the entire Jackson  family. God bless them.                          A Big Victory for Hoosiers     Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the favorable  outcome we were able to secure for Indiana's Sixth District regarding  the OMB MSA core population threshold.   Had a revised policy been adopted, Federal funding opportunities for  Hoosiers in Indiana would have been severely reduced.   This is a big victory for midsized communities.   Hoosier cities and countless others across the Nation would have  unnecessarily lost out on Federal reserves because of Washington's  short-sightedness.   I am proud to have led my colleagues on a commonsense issue like  this.                                Stand for Life     Madam Speaker, I rise today to implore my colleagues on  the other side of the aisle to reconsider their mission to defeat the  Hyde amendment.   The greatness of a free society can best be measured by how it cares  for the most vulnerable, especially the unborn.   This legislative body has had a longstanding and bipartisan provision  that prevents American taxpayer dollars from being used to fund  abortions, and we cannot end this practice now.   Furthermore, it is why I signed on to cosponsor H.R. 18.  [[Page H3674]]    I am again urging my colleagues today to join me in always standing  for life.                            Inflation is Taxation     Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the growing  inflation crisis that threatens our Hoosier way of life back home in  Indiana's Sixth District.   My colleagues on the other side of the aisle are now trying to ram  through a bipartisan $3.5 trillion package that will stick middle-class  families with higher taxes and lower wages.   This hyper-partisan spending spree is a tax hike and a pay cut for  every American.   It is simple: Inflation is taxation.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 2668. I agree with my  Democratic colleagues that the FTC should be reasonably equipped with  tools to protect consumers. Today, the FTC has been able to return $25  million to Hoosiers that have fallen victim to fraudulent schemes.   However, as currently written the bill before the House today goes  beyond the FTC's previous use of 13(b).   The bill lacks sufficient guardrails that would provide checks and  balances to the Commission's expanded authority.   Meanwhile, we haven't had the opportunity to discuss this legislation  with the full Commission in an open and transparent hearing.   During the markup process we offered several commonsense amendments  in a good faith effort to improve the bill.   These amendments would have created thresholds of FTC authority and  clarifying definitions to ensure provisions in this bill could not be  abused.   Unfortunately, these reforms were not supported by the majority.   I am concerned that rushing this legislation through the House may  lead to higher costs for small businesses without improving protections  for the consumers, which is what we all want to do.   I urge my colleagues to oppose the underlying bill.
