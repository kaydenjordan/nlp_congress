 Mr. President, today pay tribute to the memory of  retired U.S. Marine Corps Lt. Gen. Charles Pitman, a leader who served  in our Nation's Armed Forces for nearly 40 years, earning the Silver  Star, four Distinguished Flying Crosses, and a Purple Heart.   Chuck Pitman was born in Chicago in 1935 and enlisted in the U.S.  Naval Reserve in 1952 and the U.S. Marine Corps in 1953. A pilot by the  age of 14, Chuck logged more than 12,000 flight hours during his  career, flying jets and attack and reconnaissance helicopters. He flew  three combat tours in Vietnam, where his aircraft were shot down seven  times by enemy fire.   On January 7, 1973, Chuck was commanding officer of the Marine Air  Reserve Training Detachment in New Orleans when he saw a sniper firing  at civilians from a hotel on the news. Without approval from his  supervisors and at the risk of his career with the Marines, he and his  crew flew a Marine helicopter loaded with police officers to the hotel  and helped to end the carnage. Many of the police officers and  survivors credited his actions with saving countless lives.   Chuck served as special assistant to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs  of Staff during the Iranian hostage crisis. By 1990, Chuck was a three- star general and retired from the Marine Corps. His commands included  the Marine Aviation Training Support Group in Pensacola, a role as  assistant wing commander for the 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing in  California, and the command of the 1st Marine Aircraft Wing in Japan.   Chuck spent much of the rest of his life in Florida's Pensacola  Beach. He volunteered his time with organizations including the Marine  Corps League of Pensacola and participated in numerous veteran's events  throughout the city, becoming a fixture in the community.   I express my sincere condolences to his wife, two sons, and two  daughters on the loss of an American hero and patriot. May God bless  his family during this time of sorrow.                            ____________________
