 Mr. President, last night the House Democrats finally  did what they had decided to do a long time ago. They voted to impeach  President Trump.   Over the last 12 weeks, House Democrats have conducted the most  rushed, least thorough, and most unfair impeachment inquiry in modern  history. Now their slapdash process has concluded in the first purely  partisan Presidential impeachment since the wake of the Civil War.   The opposition to impeachment was bipartisan. Only one part of one  faction wanted this outcome. The House's conduct risks deeply damaging  the institutions of American government. This particular House of  Representatives has let its partisan rage at this particular President  create a toxic new precedent that will echo well into the future.   That is what I want to discuss right now--the historic degree to  which House Democrats have failed to do their duty and what it will  mean for the Senate to do ours. So let's start at the beginning. Let's  start with the fact  [[Page S7168]]  that Washington Democrats made up their minds to impeach President  Trump since before he was even inaugurated.   Here is a reporter in April of 2016--April of 2016:         Donald Trump isn't even the Republican nominee yet . . .       [but] ``Impeachment'' is already on the lips of pundits,       newspaper editorials, constitutional scholars, and even a few       Members of Congress.    April 2016.   On Inauguration Day 2017, the headline in the Washington Post: ``The  campaign to impeach President Trump has begun.'' That was day one.   In April 2017, 3 months into the Presidency, a senior House Democrat  said: ``I am going to fight every day until he is impeached.'' That was  3 months into the administration.   In December 2017, 2 years ago, Congressman Jerry Nadler was openly  campaigning to be the ranking member on the House Judiciary Committee,  specifically--specifically--because he was an expert on impeachment.  That was Nadler's campaign to be the top Democrat on Judiciary.   This week wasn't even the first time House Democrats have introduced  articles of impeachment. It was actually the seventh time. They started  less than 6 months after the President was sworn in. They tried to  impeach President Trump for being impolite to the press, for being mean  to professional athletes, for changing President Obama's policy on  transgender people in the military. All of these things were high  crimes and misdemeanors according to Democrats. Now, this wasn't just a  few people.   Scores--scores--of Democrats voted to move forward with impeachment  on three of those prior occasions. So let's be clear. The House's vote  yesterday was not some neutral judgement that Democrats came to with  great reluctance. It was the predetermined end of a partisan crusade  that began before President Trump was even nominated, let alone sworn  in.    For the very first time in modern history, we have seen a political  faction in Congress promise from the moment--the moment--a Presidential  election ended that they would find some way to overturn it.   A few months ago, Democrats' 3-year-long impeachment in search of  articles found its way to the subject of Ukraine. House Democrats  embarked on the most rushed, least thorough, and most unfair  impeachment inquiry in modern history. Chairman Schiff's inquiry was  poisoned by partisanship from the outset. Its procedures and parameters  were unfair in unprecedented ways. Democrats tried to make Chairman  Schiff into a de facto special prosecutor, notwithstanding the fact  that he is a partisan Member of Congress who had already engaged in  strange and biased behavior.   He scrapped precedent to cut the Republican minority out of the  process. He denied President Trump the same sorts of procedural rights  that Houses of both parties had provided to past Presidents of both  parties. President Trump's counsel could not participate in Chairman  Schiff's hearings, present evidence, or cross-examine witnesses.   The House Judiciary Committee's crack at this was even more  ahistorical. It was like the Speaker called up Chairman Nadler and  ordered one impeachment, rush delivery, please.   The committee found no facts on its own and did nothing to verify the  Schiff report. Their only witnesses were liberal law professors and  congressional staffers.   So there is a reason the impeachment inquiry that led to President  Nixon's resignation required about 14 months of hearings--14 months--in  addition to a special prosecutor's investigation.   With President Clinton, the independent counsel's inquiry had been  underway literally for years before the House Judiciary Committee  actually dug in. There were mountains of evidence--mountains--mountains  of testimony from firsthand fact witnesses, and serious legal battles  to get what was necessary.   This time around? House Democrats skipped all of that and spent just  12 weeks--12 weeks. There was more than a year of hearings for Nixon,  multiple years of investigation for Clinton, and they have impeached  President Trump in 12 weeks--12 weeks.   So let's talk about what the House actually produced in those 12  weeks. House Democrats' rushed and rigged inquiry yielded two  articles--two--of impeachment. They are fundamentally unlike any  articles that any prior House of Representatives has ever passed.   The first article concerns the core events which House Democrats  claim are impeachable--the timing of aid to Ukraine. But it does not  even purport to allege any actual crime. Instead, they deployed a vague  phrase ``abuse of power''--``abuse of power''--to impugn the  President's action in a general, indeterminate way.   Speaker Pelosi's House just gave into a temptation that every other  House in history has managed to resist. Let me say that again. Speaker  Pelosi's House just gave into a temptation that every other House in  our history has managed to resist. They impeach a President whom they  do not even allege has committed an actual crime known to our laws.  They have impeached simply because they disagree with a Presidential  act and question the motive behind it.   So let's look at history. Andrew Johnson's impeachment revolved  around a clear violation of a criminal statute, albeit an  unconstitutional statute. Nixon had obstruction of justice, a felony  under our laws. Clinton had perjury, also a felony.   Now, the Constitution does not say the House can impeach only those  Presidents who violate a law, but history matters. History matters and  precedent matters.   There were important reasons why every previous House of  Representatives in American history restrained itself--restrained  itself--from crossing this Rubicon. The Framers of our Constitution  very specifically discussed whether the House should be able to impeach  Presidents just for ``maladministration''--just for maladministration-- in other words, because the House simply thought the President had bad  judgment or he was doing a bad job. They talked about all of this when  they wrote the Constitution.   The written records of our Founders' debates show they specifically  rejected this. They realized it would create total dysfunction to set  the bar for impeachment that low.   James Madison himself explained that allowing impeachment on that  basis would mean the President serves at the pleasure of the Congress  instead of the pleasure of the American people. It would make the  President a creature of Congress, not the head of a separate and equal  branch. There were powerful reasons why Congress after Congress for 230  years--230 years--required Presidential impeachment to revolve around  clear, recognizable crimes, even though that was not a strict  limitation--powerful reasons why, for 230 years, no House opened the  Pandora's box of subjective, political impeachments. That 230-year  tradition died last night.   House Democrats have tried to say they had to impeach President Trump  on this historically thin and subjective basis because the White House  challenged their requests for more witnesses.   That brings us to the second article of impeachment. The House titled  this one ``Obstruction of Congress.'' What it really does is impeach  the President for asserting Presidential privilege. The concept of  executive privilege is another two-century-old constitutional  tradition. Presidents starting with George Washington have invoked it.  Federal courts have repeatedly affirmed it is a legitimate  constitutional power.   House Democrats requested extraordinary amounts of sensitive  information from President Trump's White House, exactly the kinds of  things over which Presidents of both parties have asserted privilege in  the past.   Predictably, and appropriately, President Trump did not simply roll  over. He defended the constitutional authority of his office. There is  no surprise there. It is not a constitutional crisis for a House to  want more information than a President wants to give up. That is not a  constitutional crisis. It is a routine occurrence. The separation of  powers is messy by design.   Here is what should have happened: Either the President and Congress  negotiate a settlement or the third branch of government, the  Judiciary, addresses the dispute between the other two.  [[Page S7169]]    The Nixon impeachment featured disagreements over Presidential  privilege, so they went to the courts. The Clinton impeachment featured  disagreements over Presidential privilege, so they went to the courts.  This takes time. It is inconvenient. That is actually the point. Due  process is not meant to maximize the convenience of the prosecutor. It  is meant to protect the accused, but this time was different.   Remember, 14 months of hearings for Richard Nixon, years of  investigation for Bill Clinton, but 12 weeks for Donald Trump.  Democrats didn't have to rush this, but they chose to stick to their  political timetable at the expense of pursuing more evidence through  proper legal channels. Nobody made Chairman Schiff do this. He chose  to.   The Tuesday before last, on live television, Adam Schiff explained to  the entire country that if House Democrats had let the justice system  follow its normal course, they might not have gotten to impeach the  President in time for the election. My goodness.   In Nixon, the courts were allowed to do their work. In Clinton, the  courts were allowed to do their work. Only these House Democrats  decided due process is too much work, and they would rather impeach  with no proof.   They tried to cover for their own partisan impatience by pretending  the routine occurrence of a President exerting constitutional privilege  is itself--itself--a second impeachable offense.   The following is something Adam Schiff literally said in early  October. Here is what he said: ``Any action . . . that forces us to  litigate, or have to consider litigation, will be considered further  evidence of obstruction of justice.'' That is Adam Schiff.   Here is what the chairman effectively said and what one of his  committee members restated just this week: If the President asserts his  constitutional right, it is that much more evidence he is guilty.   If the President asserts his constitutional rights, it is that much  more evidence he is guilty.   That kind of bullying is antithetical to American justice. Those are  the House Democrats' two Articles of Impeachment. That is all their  rushed and rigged inquiry could generate: an act that the House does  not even allege is criminal and a nonsensical claim that exercising a  legitimate Presidential power is somehow an impeachable offense.   This is, by far, the thinnest basis for any House-passed Presidential  impeachment in American history--the thinnest and the weakest, and  nothing else even comes close.   Candidly, I don't think I am the only person around here who realizes  this. Even before the House voted yesterday, Democrats had already  started to signal uneasiness--uneasiness--with its end product.   Before the articles even passed, the Senate Democratic leader went on  television to demand this body redo House Democrats' homework for them;  that the Senate should supplement Chairman Schiff's sloppy work so it  is more persuasive than Chairman Schiff himself bothered to make it. Of  course, every such demand simply confirms that House Democrats have  rushed forward with a case that is much too weak.    In June, Speaker Pelosi promised the House would ``build an ironclad  case.'' Never mind that she was basically promising impeachment  months--months--before the Ukraine events, but that is a separate  matter. She promised ``an ironclad case.''   In March, Speaker Pelosi said this: ``Impeachment is so divisive to  the country that unless there's something so compelling and  overwhelming and bipartisan, I don't think we should go down that path,  because it divides the country.''   By the Speaker's own standards, she has failed the country. This case  is not compelling, not overwhelming, and as a result not bipartisan.  The failure was made clear to everyone earlier this week when Senator  Schumer began searching for ways the Senate could step out of our  proper role and try to fix the House Democrats' failures for them.   It was made even more clear last night when Speaker Pelosi suggested  that House Democrats may be too afraid--too afraid--to even transmit  their shoddy work product to the Senate.   It looks like the prosecutors are getting cold feet in front of the  entire country and second-guessing whether they even want to go to  trial. They said impeachment was so urgent that it could not even wait  for due process but now they are content to sit on their hands. This is  really comical.   Democrats' own actions concede that their allegations are unproven.  The articles aren't just unproven; they are all constitutionally  incoherent--incoherent. Frankly, if either of these articles is blessed  by the Senate, we could easily see the impeachment of every future  President of either party.   Let me say that again. If the Senate blesses this historically low  bar, we will invite the impeachment of every future President. The  House Democrats' allegations, as presented, are incompatible with our  constitutional order. They are unlike anything that has ever been seen  in 230 years of this Republic.   House Democrats want to create new rules for this President because  they feel uniquely enraged--they feel uniquely enraged. Long after the  partisan fever of this moment has broken, the institutional damage will  remain.   I have described the threat to the Presidency, but this also imperils  the Senate itself. The House has created an unfair, unfinished product  that looks nothing--nothing--like any impeachment inquiry in American  history. If the Speaker ever gets her House in order, that mess will be  dumped over here on the Senate's lap.   If the Senate blesses this slapdash impeachment--if we say that from  now on this is enough--then we invite an endless parade of impeachable  trials. Future Houses of either party will feel free to toss a ``jump  ball'' every time they feel angry--free to swamp the Senate with trial  after trial no matter how baseless the charges.   We would be giving future Houses of either party unbelievable new  power to paralyze the Senate at their whim--more thin arguments, more  incomplete evidence, more partisan impeachments.   In fact, this same House of Representatives has already indicated  they themselves may not be finished impeaching. The House Judiciary  Committee told a Federal court this very week that it will continue its  impeachment investigation even after voting on these articles, and  multiple Democratic Members have already called publicly for more.   If the Senate blesses this, if the Nation accepts this, Presidential  impeachments may cease being once-in-a-generation events and become a  constant part--a constant part--of the political background noise. This  extraordinary tool of last resort may become just another part of the  arms race of polarization.   Real statesmen would have recognized, no matter their view of this  President, that trying to remove him on this thin and partisan basis  could unsettle the foundations of our Republic.   Real statesmen would have recognized, no matter how much partisan  animosity might be coursing through their veins, that cheapening the  impeachment process was not the answer.   Historians will refer to this as the very irony of our era: that so  many who professed such concern for our norms and traditions themselves  proved willing to trample our constitutional order to get their way.   It is long past time for Washington to get a little perspective.  President Trump is not the first President with a populist streak, not  the first to make entrenched elites uncomfortable. He is certainly not  the first President to speak bluntly, to mistrust the administrative  state, or to rankle unelected bureaucrats. Heaven knows, he is not the  first President to assert the constitutional privileges of his office  rather than roll over when Congress demands unlimited sensitive  information. None of these things--none of them--is unprecedented.   I will tell you what would be unprecedented. It will be an  unprecedented constitutional crisis if the Senate literally hands the  House of Representatives a new, partisan ``vote of no confidence'' that  the Founders intentionally withheld, destroying the independence of the  Presidency. It will be unprecedented if we agree that any future House  that disliked any future President can rush through an unfair  [[Page S7170]]  inquiry, skip the legal system, and paralyze the Senate with a trial.  The House can do that at will under this President. It will be  unprecedented if the Senate says secondhand and thirdhand testimony  from unelected civil servants is enough to overturn the people's vote.  It will be an unprecedented constitutional crisis if the Senate agrees  to set the bar this low--forever.   It is clear what this moment requires. It requires the Senate to  fulfill our founding purpose. The Framers built the Senate to provide  stability, to take the long view of our Republic, to safeguard  institutions from the momentary hysteria that sometimes consumes our  politics, and to keep partisan passions from literally boiling over.  The Senate exists for moments like this.   That is why this body has the ultimate say in impeachments. The  Framers knew the House would be too vulnerable to transient passions  and violent factionalism. They needed a body that could consider legal  questions about what has been proven and political questions about what  the common good of our Nation requires. Hamilton said explicitly in  Federalist 65 that impeachment involves not just legal questions but  inherently political judgments about what outcome best serves the  Nation. The House can't do both. The courts can't do both.   This is as grave an assignment as the Constitution gives to any  branch of government, and the Framers knew only the Senate could handle  it. Well, the moment the Framers feared has arrived. A political  faction in the lower Chamber has succumbed to partisan rage. A  political faction in the House of Representatives has succumbed to a  partisan rage. They have fulfilled Hamilton's prophesy that impeachment  will ``connect itself with the pre-existing factions . . . enlist all  their animosities . . . [and] there will always be the greatest danger  that the decision will be regulated more by the comparative strength of  parties, than by the real demonstrations of innocence or guilt.''   Alexander Hamilton.   That is what happened in the House last night. The vote did not  reflect what had been proven; it only reflects how they feel about the  President.   The Senate must put this right. We must rise to the occasion. There  is only one outcome that is suited to the paucity of evidence, the  failed inquiry, the slapdash case. There is only one outcome suited to  the fact that the accusations themselves are constitutionally  incoherent. There is only one outcome that will preserve core  precedents rather than smash them into bits in a fit of partisan rage  because one party still cannot accept the American people's choice in  2016. It could not be clearer which outcome would serve the  stabilizing, institution-preserving, fever-breaking role for which the  U.S. Senate was created and which outcome would betray it.   The Senate's duty is clear. The Senate's duty is clear. When the time  comes, we must fulfill it.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I understand there are three bills at  the desk due for a second reading en bloc.    In order to place the bills on the calendar under the  provisions of rule XIV, I would object to further proceedings en bloc.    I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I just cut off a Member of our own side  because they didn't get here in time. That is to underscore that by  popular demand, everybody wants these times to be kept, and that is  what we intend to do.   I ask unanimous consent that the votes in this series be 10 minutes  in length.  [[Page S7189]]     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  cloture motion with respect to Executive Calendar No. 550 be withdrawn.    I further ask unanimous consent that following  disposition of the Davis nomination, the Senate resume consideration of  the Biegun nomination and vote on confirmation of the nomination;  finally, if confirmed, the motions to reconsider be considered made and  laid upon the table and the President be immediately notified of the  Senate's action.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following  the disposition of the Biegun nomination, the Senate proceed to  legislative session and resume consideration of the House message to  accompany H.R. 1158; that if cloture is invoked on the motion to concur  in the House amendment to the Senate amendment to H.R. 1158, the  postcloture time be expired, the other pending motions and amendments  be withdrawn, and the Senate vote on adoption of the motion to concur  in the House amendment to the Senate amendment to H.R. 1158 with no  intervening action or debate.    Mr. President, it is with gratitude that I pay tribute  today to Mike Rust, a leading advocate for positive healthcare outcomes  in Kentucky. With a long list of accomplishments and two dozen years as  president of the Kentucky Hospital Association, Mike has certainly  earned a relaxing and enjoyable retirement. Communities throughout our  Commonwealth have benefited from Mike's leadership, and I would like to  join them today in honoring his impressive career.   Before coming to Kentucky, Mike worked in senior positions at  hospitals in West Virginia and with the Florida Hospital Association.  Taking the impressive skills he developed throughout his career, Mike  joined the KHA in 1996 as its third president. Mike and his team  support the work of each and every one of Kentucky's 120-plus hospitals  to enhance healthcare services in both rural and urban communities  across the Commonwealth.   In addition to its advocacy work, the KHA under Mike's leadership  offers critical services to its membership, including research,  education, and support for patient safety and quality care. Patients  and hospitals in our State will continue to benefit from Mike's great  work for many years to come. Through his achievements on behalf of  Kentucky's hospitals and their patients, Mike has earned the respect of  his peers in our Commonwealth and across the Nation.   On a personal note, I have enjoyed partnering with Mike in my work in  the Senate to support Kentucky families and communities. Just recently,  the KHA supported my effort to raise the nationwide minimum purchase  age for tobacco products from 18 to 21. His counsel was also  particularly beneficial in our fight against the passage of Obamacare,  which the KHA rightly opposed. My staff and I will miss Mike's  collaboration on many important Kentucky priorities, but I am confident  the organization he dedicated so much of his life to will continue  building upon his legacy.   As Mike reaches this milestone, I would like to thank him for his  leadership on behalf of hospitals and families across the Commonwealth.  I share my best wishes with Mike and his family for many years of  relaxation and enjoyment together. Finally, I hope my Senate colleagues  will join me in congratulating Mike Rust for a long career of  distinguished advocacy and service to Kentucky.                            ____________________     Mr. President, it was a year ago this month that my  alma mater, the University of Louisville, hired Scott Satterfield as  its new football coach. The Cardinals convinced Scott to leave his head  coaching job at Appalachian State University and take over Louisville's  program. Today, it is a real pleasure for me to celebrate the good  decision he made and to congratulate Coach Scott Satterfield for  earning the title of ``2019 Atlantic Coast Conference Football Coach of  the Year.''   When he first walked into Louisville's locker room as head coach,  Scott faced a daunting task. The Cardinals ended their previous season  with only two wins, leaving the team disappointed and the fans less  than enthusiastic. Critics predicted another lackluster year for the  Cardinals, and a preseason poll anticipated a repeat last-place finish  in the division.  [[Page S7194]]    Well, anyone who made those predictions clearly didn't know Scott.  They didn't understand the effect he could have on UofL's program and  its student-athletes in hardly any time at all. Now, 1 year into the  Satterfield-era, the University of Louisville Cardinals have won seven  games, placed second in their division, and the team is on the way to  the Music City Bowl. And when they take the field in Nashville, the  Cardinals will be led by their award-winning and expectations-beating  head coach.   It is a great privilege for a longtime Cards fan like myself to pay  tribute to Coach Satterfield and his many accomplishments. He set out  to change the program's culture, to restore the team's confidence, and  to unite the players, coaches, and fans together around a shared  purpose. Overcoming a challenging schedule took vision and grit, which  are qualities Scott possesses in great measure.   Coach Satterfield has made fall Saturdays--or should I say  ``Satterdays''--in Louisville a whole lot of fun. Igniting an explosive  offense, including 2019 All-ACC first team honorees Tutu Atwell and  Mekhi Becton, the Cardinals averaged more than 440 yards per game. The  defense stepped up too--often when it mattered most--and helped add a  couple of quality wins to the Cardinals' resume.   Scott began this season determined to prove that this team could live  up to its greatest potential. Along with Louisville's other top-notch  coaches, he is helping to restore UofL's pride. And after only a single  season, he is already making history. As the first UofL coach to ever  be named ``ACC Coach of the Year,'' Scott has shown that he not only  has what it takes to compete at the highest levels of college football  but that he is also ready to lead his team, our university, and the  city to victory.   So I would like to congratulate Coach Scott Satterfield for receiving  this well-deserved honor and to thank him for providing some  extraordinary football to watch this season. I hope my Senate  colleagues will join me in paying tribute to Scott as he prepares to  finish strong in Nashville at the end of the month. I for one, look  forward to cheering on my Cards.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I have a request for one committee to  meet during today's session of the Senate. It has the approval of the  Majority and Minority leaders.  [[Page S7222]]    Pursuant to rule XXVI, paragraph 5(a), of the Standing Rules of the  Senate, the following committee is authorized to meet during today's  session of the Senate:                  Committee on Energy and Natural Resources    The Committee on Energy and Natural Resources is authorized to meet  during the session of the Senate on Thursday, December 19, 2019, at  9:30 a.m., to conduct a hearing.                            ____________________     Mr. President, for the information of all of our  colleagues, earlier this afternoon, my friend the Democratic leader and  I had a cordial conversation. We discussed a potential path forward  following the House Democrats' precedent-breaking impeachment of  President Trump. Our conversation was cordial, but my friend from New  York continues to insist on departing from the unanimous bipartisan  precedent that 100 Senators approved before the beginning of President  Clinton's trial.   Back in 1999, Senators recognized that there might well be  disagreements about questions that would arise at the middle and end of  the trial, such as witnesses. Here is what happened: All 100 Senators  endorsed a commonsense solution. We divided the process into two  stages. The first resolution passed unanimously before the trial began.  It laid the groundwork, such as scheduling and structured early steps  like opening arguments. Mid-trial questions such as witnesses were left  until the middle of the trial when Senators could make a more informed  judgment about that more contentious issue. All 100 Senators, including  me, including Mr. Schumer, and a number of our colleagues on both sides  who were here in 1999 endorsed the first resolution as a bipartisan,  minimalist first step.   As of today, however, we remain at an impasse because my friend the  Democratic leader continues to demand a new and different set of rules  for President Trump. He wants to break from that unanimous bipartisan  precedent and force an all-or-nothing approach. My colleague wants a  special pretrial guarantee of certain witnesses whom the House  Democrats themselves  [[Page S7226]]  did not bother to pursue as they assembled their case, or he wants to  proceed without giving any organizational resolution whatsoever. As I  said, we remain at an impasse on these logistics.   For myself, I continue to believe that the unanimous bipartisan  precedent that was good enough for President Clinton ought to be good  enough for President Trump. Fair is fair.   Now, of course, there is the matter of the Articles of Impeachment  themselves. It is a highly unusual step. The House continues to hem and  haw about whether and when she intends to take the normal next step and  transmit the House's accusations over here to the Senate. Some House  Democrats imply they are withholding the articles for some kind of  leverage so they can dictate the Senate process to Senators.   I admit, I am not sure what leverage there is in refraining from  sending us something we do not want; but, alas, if they can figure that  out, they can explain it. Meanwhile, other House Democrats seem to be  suggesting they prefer never to transmit the articles. That is fine  with me, and the Speaker of the House herself has been unclear on this.  Her message has been somewhat muddled.   So here is where we are, Mr. President. We have a curious situation  where, following House Democrats' rush to impeachment, following weeks  of pronouncement about the urgency of the situation, the prosecutors  appear to have developed cold feet. The House Democrat prosecution  seems to have gotten cold feet and to be unsure of whether they even  want to proceed to the trial.   As I said, a very unusual spectacle and, in my view, certainly not  one that reflects well on the House. So we will see whether House  Democrats ever want to work up the courage to actually take their  accusations to trial.   Let me close with this: I am proud that the Senate came together  today to confirm more well-qualified nominees and to pass major  legislation for the American people.   I wish all of my colleagues a merry Christmas, happy holidays, and a  joyous new year. I hope everyone enjoys this important time with their  families and loved ones. We will see you in 2020.                            ____________________     Mr. President, finally, for the information of all of  our colleagues, the Senate will convene on Friday, January 3, to kick  off the 2nd session of the 116th Congress. However, no rollcall votes  are expected that day, and Members should be prepared to be back and  voting on Monday, January 6.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to executive session and to the consideration of the following  nomination: Executive Calendar No. 497.    I ask unanimous consent that the Senate vote on the  nomination with no intervening action or debate; that if confirmed, the  motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table and the  President be immediately notified of the Senate's action; that no  further motions be in order and that any statements related to the  nomination be printed in the Record.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation be discharged from  PN1228 and the Senate proceed to the en bloc consideration of the  following nominations: PN1228, Executive Calendar Nos. 492 and 496.    I ask unanimous consent that the Senate vote on the  nominations en bloc with no intervening action or debate; that if  confirmed, the motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon  the table en bloc; that the President be immediately notified of the  Senate's actions; that no further motions be in order; and that any  statements related to the nominations be printed in the Record.

I ask unanimous consent that the Senate vote on the  nomination with no intervening action or debate; that if confirmed, the  motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table and the  President be immediately notified of the Senate's action; that no  further motions be in order; and that any statements related to the  nomination be printed in the Record.    I ask unanimous consent that the Committee on Foreign  Relations be discharged and the Senate proceed to the consideration of  PN1318, 1319, and 1321; that the nominations be confirmed; that the  motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with  no intervening action or debate; that no further motions be in order;  that any statements to the nominations be printed in the Record and the  President be immediately notified of the Senate's action.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to legislative session and be in a period of morning business,  with Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.
