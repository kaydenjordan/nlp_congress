 Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the time, and I am grateful to  be here with the gentleman. I want to speak to both of these bills  rather than speaking to a different bill that was considered in this  body.   With regard to H.R. 1761, this bill became necessary because of the  court-imposed misinterpretation of a congressional statute with regard  to the visual depiction, or live transmission, of a victim of  child abuse, or sexually explicit conduct. This is important because it  closes a loophole that otherwise would allow a perpetrator to walk free  because of a lack of specific intent when recording images of the  victim that they are victimizing.    This bill is important because it closes the loophole and gets back  to what the intent of Congress was when they passed legislation  intended to protect children and criminalized the production of images  of child sexual abuse. This bill does all we can at this point to  protect our children from sexual predators.   It is a moral necessity that we close this shameful loophole, created  by a judicial opinion, to provide the appropriate punishment to those  who look to harm minors. It won't protect all of our children, but it  will provide a significant deterrent to protect more of our children,  and that makes this bill important, crucial, and necessary.   With regard to H.R. 1973, Protecting Young Victims from Sexual Abuse  Act of 2017, this broadens the coverage of current laws that require  reporting of child abuse, specifically with regard to those children  who are participating in organizations that are organized for the  purpose of helping--ostensibly helping--young athletes train for  international competition.   When you are a parent of an athlete, just like your child, you trust  these coaches who are mentoring and working and interacting with your  children not just for training these children and preparing them to be  the best athlete they possibly can be, but you also entrust, many  times, your children's keeping to them.   Gone are the days where kids were playing in Little League and saw  their coaches for brief periods of time. In many instances, the  children that will be protected by this bill are those elite young  athletes who spend quite a bit of time actually away from their parents  and in the care and custody of coaches, trainers, and other people  associated with the program.   As a father of athletes, it is important that I be able to trust  that, if someone has been convicted or has had to report that, that  information is available. And due to this particular  [[Page H4522]]  legislation, the government will now be able to pursue cases that it  would not otherwise be able to prosecute.   This legislation specifies that national governing bodies are  authorized to develop training oversight practices, policies, and  procedures to prevent sexual abuse of amateur athletes. And then what  is critical, it requires that it is necessary to assure child abuse is  being reported by those who work with amateur athletes. Those reporting  requirements are essential protective deterrences and provide  assurances to all surrounding that young child and that athlete that  they have the opportunity for safekeeping.   Organizations must be taking action against coaches or other members  when allegations are made against them to assure young athletes are  kept safe. The safety of these young athletes must trump, in many  cases, perhaps, their ability to develop their unique gifts and  talents.   Mr. Speaker, I am grateful that these bills are brought forward, and  I support them.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the topic of this Special Order.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Arizona?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the topic of this Special Order.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Arizona?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, on Monday we observe Memorial Day to honor  members of America's Armed Forces who have died in service to our  Nation. For those who have lost a loved one, a friend, a neighbor, or a  comrade, this day has added significance, remembrance, and sadness.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr.  Thompson).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his comments.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Carter).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his comments.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Carter).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his comments.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Carter).    Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield to my colleague from  North Carolina (Mr. Hudson).    Mr. Speaker, each Memorial Day, a newspaper in my State,  the Arizona Republic, publishes one particular letter to remind its  readers of the sacrifice our soldiers made in defense of their country.  The letter is written by Sullivan Ballou to his wife on July 14, 1861.   Sullivan was a major in the Union Army, 32 years old, and about to  enter the first battle of Bull Run. A little more than a week later,  almost 3,000 Union soldiers had perished, including Sullivan.   Major Sullivan's letter reads as follows: ``My very dear Sarah: The  indications are very strong that we shall move in a few days--perhaps  tomorrow. Lest I should not be able to write again, I feel impelled to  write a few lines that may fall under your eye when I shall be no more.  . . .   ``I have no misgivings about, or lack of confidence in the cause in  which I am engaged, and my courage does not halt or falter. I know how  strongly American civilization now leans on the triumph of the  government and how great a debt we owe to those who went before us  through the blood and sufferings of the Revolution. And I am willing-- perfectly willing--to lay down all my joys in this life to help  maintain this government and to pay that debt. . . .   ``Sarah, my love for you is deathless. It seems to bind me with  mighty cables that nothing but omnipotence could break; and yet my love  of country comes over me like a strong wind and bears me unresistibly  on with all these chains to the battlefield. The memories of the  blissful moments I have spent with you come creeping over me, and I  feel most gratified to God and to you that I have enjoyed them for so  long. And hard it is for me to give them up and burn to ashes the hopes  of future years, when, God willing, we might still have lived and loved  together, and seen our sons grow up to honorable manhood around us.   ``I have, I know, but few and small claims upon Divine Providence,  but something whispers to me--perhaps it is the wafted prayer of my  little Edgar--that I shall return to my loved ones unharmed. If I do  not, my dear Sarah, never forget how much I love you, and when my last  breath escapes me on the battlefield, it will whisper your name.   ``Forgive my many faults and the many pains I have caused you. How  thoughtless and foolish I have oftentimes been. How gladly would I wash  out with my tears every little spot upon your happiness. . . .   ``But, O Sarah, if the dead can come back to this Earth and flit  unseen around those they loved, I shall always be near you; in the  gladdest days and in the darkest nights . . . always, always, and if  there be a soft breeze upon your check, it shall be my breath, as the  cool air fans your throbbing temple, it shall be my spirit passing by.   ``Sarah, do not mourn me dead; think I am gone and wait for thee, for  we shall meet again.''   So closes Major Ballou's letter.   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield to my colleague, the gentleman  from Virginia (Mr. Brat).    Mr. Speaker, I am going to take a moment to give  recognition to a special veteran from my district who is 90 years old  and is a World War II veteran, who worked in the U.S. Navy during World  War II and saw many trips across the Pacific Ocean and endured the life  of a sailor, sometimes monotonous and sometimes under very perilous  circumstances, including at least one attack by kamikazes of his ship  and convoy.   I pay special tribute at this time to Wayne Whitlock, who has  persevered for many years after service to his country in that great  war.   Mr. Speaker, I am also reminded tonight of President Abraham  Lincoln's Gettysburg Address. As President Lincoln looked out on a  battlefield that had experienced almost 50,000 casualties, he said:  ``The world will little note, nor long remember what we say here, but  it can never forget what they did here. It is for us the living,  rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who  fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be  here dedicated to the great task remaining before us--that from these  honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they  gave the last full measure of devotion--that we here highly resolve  that these dead shall not have died in vain--that this Nation, under  God, shall have a new birth of freedom--and that government of the  people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the  Earth.''  [[Page H4563]]    Mr. Speaker, very few of us in this Chamber will be remembered long  after we leave Washington, D.C. Almost no one will remember my speech  tonight, and it will soon become lost in the Congressional Record. Yet  we are here in this body because of the heroic efforts of men and women  who have given their lives for this country for over 200 years. We can  never forget their sacrifices.   The only reason we can participate in the activities of this Chamber  is because of the sacrifices of our Armed Forces, particularly those  who have paid the ultimate price. They have nobly defended our freedoms  and our way of life up to their last measure of devotion. They left  behind fathers, mothers, wives, sons, daughters, brothers, sisters,  friends, and communities to ensure that future generations walk in the  light of liberty.   President Lincoln was resolved that those soldiers shall not have  died in vain. They and all the soldiers who have died defending  American wars and conflicts still deserve that respect and dignity.   Mr. Speaker, we should govern every day with our heroes in mind. We  should strive to make them proud of our speech, our actions, and our  commitment to our promises. The American Dream, spirit, and  Constitution that they fought for should be our charge.   I would be remiss tonight if I did not mention the loved ones these  patriots left behind, who are also patriotic. Countless men, women, and  children have watched their American soldiers walk away from home,  hoping that they will return safely, unaffected physically, mentally,  and emotionally. Sadly, many of those heroes never make it home.  Knowing that no words can do justice to their sacrifices, I can only  say: Thank you. A grateful nation mourns with your loss.   Mr. Speaker, Monday may be the official observance of Memorial Day,  but we live with the memory of our fallen heroes every day across our  country. I am eternally grateful for their sacrifices.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
