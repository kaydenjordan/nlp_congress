 Mr. Speaker, May is National Foster Care Month, a time  to renew our commitment to the thousands of children in our Nation's  foster care system. That is why I am proud to be a member of the  Congressional Youth Foster Caucus, which is dedicated to strengthening  our Nation's child welfare system.   Today, we are celebrating the Congressional Foster Youth Shadow Day,  a special day when more than 100 foster youth from across the country  come to D.C. to spend a day with Members of Congress as we conduct our  Nation's business.   I have the privilege today of hosting Esmeralda Masco, who is from my  district in Stockton, California. Esmeralda is currently a student at  Grand Canyon University, where she is studying public policy and  aspires one day to become a civil rights lawyer. She is passionate  about helping current and former foster youth and wants, one day, to  open a resource center to help others in the foster care system to  graduate and achieve their full potential.   It gives me great pleasure to welcome Esmeralda and all of the  participants in the Congressional Youth Shadow Day to our Nation's  Capital.                            ____________________
