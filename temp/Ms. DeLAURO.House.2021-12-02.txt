 Madam Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 829, I call  up the bill (H.R. 6119) making further continuing appropriations for  the fiscal year ending September 30, 2022, and for other purposes, and  ask for its immediate consideration in the House.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise  [[Page H6874]]  and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the measure  under consideration.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, before I go any further, I would first like to take a  moment to mourn the loss of Congresswoman Carrie Meek. She was an  extraordinary force in the Congress and a pioneer who was never  deterred by any challenge that came her way. I like to say that though  she was unassuming and soft-spoken, she carried a big stick. That is  evident in her enduring legacy today. I had the honor of serving  together with Congresswoman Meek on the Appropriations Committee years  ago, and I feel immensely privileged to have worked with her to help  expand opportunity for all Americans. We all mourn her loss.   Madam Speaker, I will be frank. Instead of being here today  discussing another continuing resolution, I wish that we were here to  present a bipartisan, bicameral appropriations agreement. Continuing  resolutions are not the way to govern. They are a short-term patch that  leaves the American people behind. But we are here today because my  colleagues across the aisle have refused time and time again to begin  negotiations or even offer a proposal of their own for government  funding that delivers for the American people.   House and Senate Democrats have put forward their proposals, but  Republicans have not presented an offer of their own. There is not one  piece of paper describing what Republicans want. It has been 30 days  since I brought together a bipartisan, bicameral four-corners meeting  on November 2, and to date we have not heard one word from them--not  one word.   But now my Republican counterparts want more time--something that  they have had since we came to this floor to pass the last funding  extension 62 days ago, which means we now have no choice but to pursue  a short-term extension. Make no mistake, Madam Speaker, a vote against  this continuing resolution is a vote to shut the government down.   The legislation before us, the Further Extending Government Funding  Act, continues government funding at current levels through February  18. It makes minimal changes to address the most urgent of needs during  the period of the continuing resolution and provides $7 billion to  continue supporting Afghanistan evacuees after the end of 20 years of  war.   While I wish the February 18 end date were earlier--and I pursued  earlier dates--I believe this agreement allows the appropriations  process to move forward toward a final funding agreement that addresses  the needs of the American people.   Let me be clear, working families, small businesses, veterans, and  our military need the certainty that comes with passing omnibus funding  legislation instead of short-term funding patches. Republicans must  join us for bipartisan, bicameral negotiations to resolve our  differences and keep government working for us all.   For our communities, we need an omnibus to create and sustain good- paying jobs, support small businesses, prevent future pandemics, and  advance lifesaving medical research. We need an omnibus to strengthen  public schools, protect our air and water, combat the opioid epidemic,  and support core services such as food safety and consumer product  inspections. Without an omnibus, investments in all these areas will be  denied.   For our veterans, we need an omnibus to provide sufficient funding  for veterans' benefits, reduce backlogs for veterans and their  families, and meet the needs of the VA's healthcare system. Without an  omnibus there will be a shortfall that will cause veterans not to  receive their benefits in full.   For our national security, we need an omnibus to support defense  readiness and modernization, secure our cyber infrastructure, and  strengthen American leadership abroad. Without an omnibus, a pay raise  for troops will not be funded while funds will be misdirected to a war  we are no longer fighting.   As I said before, I wanted to be here today passing a bipartisan,  bicameral appropriations agreement. Sadly, we are not. But as  Republicans take the next 2\1/2\ months, Democrats remain ready,  willing, and able to move this process forward. We are ready to go, but  we need willing partners to put the American people first.   With a new deadline of February 18, it is long past time for our  Republican colleagues to offer constructive proposals to address the  critical issues facing the country by funding the Federal Government's  important work. As the American people put their faith and trust in us,  they deserve no less.   Madam Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on this legislation, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman  from Ohio (Ms. Kaptur), who is the chairwoman of the Appropriations  Subcommittee on Energy and Water Development, and Related Agencies.    Madam Speaker, once again, the Republicans refuse to  come to the table to negotiate, thereby jeopardizing benefits for our  veterans and our national security. We can move if they come to the  table.   I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr.  Price), the chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee on  Transportation, and Housing and Urban Development, and Related  Agencies.    Madam Speaker, antiscience fearmongering about vaccines  is wrong. Fears about government requirements for vaccines are flat-out  silly. And the Republicans are prepared to shut down the government  based on this. Incredible.   I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman from California (Ms.  Roybal-Allard), the chair of the Appropriations Subcommittee on  Homeland Security.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from Georgia (Mr. Bishop), the chairman of the Appropriations  Subcommittee on Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug  Administration, and Related Agencies.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman  from California (Ms. Lee), the chairwoman of the Appropriations  Subcommittee on State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs.    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentlewoman from California.                                time  1545     Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman  from Minnesota (Ms. McCollum), the chair of the Appropriations  Subcommittee on Defense.    Madam Speaker, once again, it has been the Republicans'  refusal to come to the table to negotiate that has stopped the process  and forced us to do a short-term stopgap measure. We shouldn't be doing  it, but Republicans need to come to the table.   Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr.  Ryan), the chairman of the Subcommittee on the Legislative Branch.    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from Ohio.    Madam Speaker, if the Republicans wanted to do something  about our defense and our security in the military, they would move to  work with us to pass the defense appropriations bill and the omnibus.   Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman from Florida  (Ms. Wasserman Schultz), the chair of the Subcommittee on Military  Construction and Veterans' Affairs.    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentlewoman from Florida.    Madam Speaker, I want to remind my colleague on the  other side of the aisle that a continuing resolution is a cut to  defense. If you come to the table, we will discuss it, then we can move  forward on the defense of this Nation.   Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman from Maine  (Ms. Pingree), the chair of the Appropriations Subcommittee on  Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies.    Madam Speaker, I just want to remind the gentleman that  antiscience fearmongering about vaccines is wrong. Science is on our  side, and history is on our side. Vaccines work.   I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Quigley),  the chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Financial Services  and General Government.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from Pennsylvania (Mr. Cartwright), the chairman of the Appropriations  Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Madam Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman an additional 30  seconds.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from Rhode Island (Mr. Cicilline).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Let me just say to you that we have heard from a number of advocacy  groups urging the Congress to move on taking up a full-year omnibus.  Let me just tell you the groups that have written to us.   We are looking at the National Defense Industrial Association: On  behalf of thousands of companies represented by the National Defense  Industrial Association, we write to request the expedited completion of  the defense appropriation bill.   We talk about the Association of American Universities: Urge you to  reach a bipartisan agreement to complete the FY22 appropriations  process before the end of the year.   The Aerospace Industries Association: Our essential partners are  urging us to avoid a further CR beyond December 3, wanting us to come  to the table in order to be able to have a full-year appropriations  bill.   The Coalition for Health Funding, the same message to all of us:  Relying on continuing resolutions would be a grave, missed opportunity  to improve the lives of all Americans. A full-year appropriations bill.   The Ad Hoc Group for Medical Research telling us the very, very same  thing: To maximize the potential of medical research, we need to move  forward with a full-year bill.   The veterans organizations saying the same thing: Do not shortchange  veterans and their benefits by holding back on a full-year  appropriations bill.   Madam Speaker, I include in the Record statements in support of the  bill from a broad coalition of groups urging negotiations now, as well  as letters from veterans' organizations and America's leading research  universities.             Broad Coalition of Groups Urging Negotiations Now         A broad coalition of groups have joined Chair DeLauro and       Democratic Appropriators urging negotiations and agreement on       fiscal year 2022 appropriations bills. These organizations       include:                      Ad Hoc Group for Medical Research         Our organizations strongly support an approach to the final       FY 2022 spending package that avoids additional CRs past       December. Aside from the budget implications, CRs create       inefficiencies and add uncertainty to a system that is       already under stress with the continued reverberations of the       ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. We strongly urge you to work       swiftly in securing bipartisan, bicameral agreement on       topline discretionary spending allocations and to ensure any       final budget agreement reflects a strong commitment to the       nation's health.                       Aerospace Industries Association         The United States aerospace and defense industries are an       essential partner with the federal government in an array of       efforts vital to our economy and our national security. Each       fall, that partnership is tested when those programs are       slowed down or deferred by the use of multiple continuing       resolutions (CR) to keep the government running . . . If       Congress fails to once again enact full-year appropriations       bills, or continues running the government into 2022 under       continuing resolutions, it will send the wrong signal to the       government's partners, like those in our industry. We count       on stable, reliable and adequate funding to support  [[Page H6886]]       the critical capabilities that we provide for all Americans.                   American Association for Cancer Research         As the nation continues to combat the COVID-19 pandemic,       cancer has not stopped, and remains the second leading cause       of death in the United States. To better prevent, detect, and       treat cancers, Congress must act swiftly to increase       investments in cancer research and prevention. A full-year       continuing resolution or funding lapse would threaten our       nation's research enterprise and stall medical breakthroughs       that could benefit the lives of millions of patients with       cancer and survivors. The AACR urges congressional       negotiators to come to the table and agree to Fiscal Year       2022 allocations that would support robust and sustained       funding for cancer research and prevention.                     Association of American Universities         Higher education, research, and innovation play integral       roles in our nation's competitiveness, security, health, and       ability to combat and overcome the pandemic. Our nation       cannot afford continued inaction on FY22 appropriations. In       the absence of final appropriations, federal agencies       postpone research award decisions and prepare for potential       lapses in funding. Continuing resolutions (CRs) slow the pace       of scientific innovation and create funding uncertainty for       researchers and students. It is vital that Congress complete       appropriations this year and avoid serial stop-gap measures       and a yearlong CR.                           Coalition on Human Needs         The nation's recovery depends on strengthening a host of       domestic programs that have been allowed to shrink for years,       not just to get to where they had been before, but to respond       to needs far greater because of the pandemic and its global       economic dislocations. A long-term continuing resolution       would be a severe failure to address these needs. We strongly       urge you to enact omnibus appropriations legislation       including all twelve bills as soon as possible.   Joint Coalition of the Campaign to Invest in American's Workforce, the    Coalition for Health Funding, the Coalition on Human Needs, and the                      Committee for Education Funding         The bill passed by the House this summer and the bill       proposed by the Senate Appropriations Committee this fall       provide vital increased funding for the programs and services       that have a profound impact on health and well-being, child       development, educational and skills attainment, employment,       and productivity. Failing to enact the FY 2022 bill and       relying on continuing resolutions (CRs) would be a grave       missed opportunity to improve the lives of all Americans.                   National Defense Industrial Association         We cannot stress enough the importance of the defense       appropriations bill to our national security and to a healthy       defense industrial base. The limbo caused under CRs wastes       precious time and money our nation cannot recover. Delayed       new starts and initiatives place a strain on companies and       their workforce, particularly as they recalibrate operations       to a post-pandemic normal. Our nation's competitors face no       similar challenges putting us at a competitive disadvantage,       particularly with emerging technologies, and place our supply       chains at increasing risk, something we cannot afford after       the nearly two years of pandemic impacts.    Veterans Service Organizations, including the American Legion and the                          Veterans of Foreign Wars         A full-year continuing resolution could result in an       estimated $7 billion shortfall in funding for mandatory       compensation and pension benefits, in large part due to an       increased number of benefit claims resulting from       congressional approval of new diseases related to Agent       Orange exposure for Vietnam veterans . . . we call on you to       reject consideration of a full-year continuing resolution       that would reduce veterans' funding below what has already       been approved in an overwhelming bipartisan vote.                                   ____                                                  November 10, 2021.      Hon. Charles E. Schumer,      Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Mitch McConnell,      Minority Leader, U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.        Dear Majority Leader Schumer and Minority Leader McConnell:       On behalf of the millions of veterans our organizations       represent, we write to express serious concerns about reports       that the Senate is considering approving a full-year       continuing resolution to fund the federal government for the       remainder of fiscal year 2022, which would have significant       negative consequences for veterans, their families,       caregivers and survivors. Therefore, we are asking that you       work together to ensure that veterans programs, benefits and       medical services receive the full level of funding for fiscal       year 2022 that was approved with strong bipartisan support       (25 to 5) by the Senate Appropriations Committee in August.        As you know, Congress approved and the President signed a       short-term continuing resolution (Public Law 117-43) on       September 30th to fund the federal government through       December 3, 2021, extending funding at the levels previously       enacted in fiscal year 2021 appropriations legislation.       Funding for Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) medical care       and benefit payments for fiscal year 2022 was previously       approved in December 2020 as advance appropriations in       Division J (Military Construction and Veterans Affairs) of       the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, Public Law 116-      260. However, the advance appropriations process only works       properly if funding levels are adjusted to address increased       demand for benefits and services as part of the following       year's regular appropriations process, as is necessary for       fiscal year 2022. Further, if Congress passes a full-year       continuing resolution, all other programs, services and       benefits would remain funded at fiscal year 2021 levels,       which would fall short of the anticipated needs.        For example, a full-year continuing resolution could result       in an estimated $7 billion shortfall in funding for mandatory       compensation and pension benefits, in large part due to an       increased number of benefit claims resulting from       congressional approval of new diseases related to Agent       Orange exposure for Vietnam veterans.        In addition, the time it takes to process these and other       claims for benefits would be significantly increased without       the $300 million increase for the Veterans Benefits       Administration approved by the Senate Appropriations       Committee. Similarly, reductions from the Committee-approved       levels for the Board of Veterans' Appeals and the National       Cemetery Administration would negatively impact veterans and       their survivors seeking their services and benefits.        Enacting a full-year continuing resolution would also       negatively hamper veterans' ability to receive timely medical       care absent the $3.3 billion increase for Veterans Medical       Community Care approved by the Senate Committee. VA's       critical Medical and Prosthetic Research programs would be       cut by $67 million and funding to support VA's health care       infrastructure would be cut $450 million below the levels       approved by the Committee if Congress passes a full-year       continuing resolution.        As leaders of the Senate, we call on you to reject       consideration of a full-year continuing resolution that would       reduce veterans' funding below what has already been approved       in an overwhelming bipartisan vote of the Senate       Appropriations Committee. Instead, we ask that you use your       influence to ensure that the Senate completes consideration       of the fiscal year 2022 appropriations so that veterans,       their families, caregivers and survivors have timely access       to all the benefits, services and medical care they have       earned.

Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Speaker, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Kevin McCarthy,      Minority Leader, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Charles Schumer,      Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Mitch McConnell,      Minority Leader, U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Pelosi and Leaders Schumer, McCarthy, and       McConnell: I write on behalf of America's leading research       universities to urge you to reach a bipartisan agreement to       complete the FY22 appropriations process before the end of       the year.        Recent suggestions that final FY22 appropriations could be       delayed until March 2022 are distressing. Higher education,       research, and innovation play integral roles in our nation's       competitiveness, security, health, and ability to combat and       overcome the pandemic. Our nation cannot afford continued  [[Page H6887]]       inaction on FY22 appropriations. In the absence of final       appropriations, federal agencies postpone research award       decisions and prepare for potential lapses in funding.       Continuing resolutions (CRs) slow the pace of scientific       innovation and create funding uncertainty for researchers and       students. It is vital that Congress complete appropriations       this year and avoid serial stop-gap measures and a year-long       CR.        Congress has made good progress in determining FY22 funding       levels, and now it is time to finish the job. Both the House       and Senate bills include important increases to federal       investments in student aid and research that would help       bolster our nation's economic competitiveness and standing as       the global innovation leader. For example, the bills propose       a $400 increase to the Pell Grant maximum award and increased       funding for other student aid programs, the National       Institutes of Health, the National Science Foundation, the       Department of Energy's Office of Science, and other critical       research agencies. AAU supports the proposed increases, and       we stand ready to reinforce efforts to ensure final passage.        We urge you to complete FY22 appropriations before the end       of the year and to approve the highest levels of funding       proposed for student aid and research programs in the House       and Senate bills. Thank you for considering our views.            Sincerely,                                                 Barbara R. Snyder,                                                         President.     Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), the majority leader of the House of  Representatives.    Madam Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Hoyer).    Madam Speaker, I have a motion at the desk.
