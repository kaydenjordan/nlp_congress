 Madam Speaker, I rise to note, in regard to the assertion  of the majority leader that the act of destroying the House copy of  President Trump's State of the Union speech was speech protected under  the First Amendment, I rise to assert that not all speech protected  under the First Amendment is allowable under the rules of the House.   Moreover, the act of destroying the House's copy of the State of the  Union Address diminishes the decorum that is critical to maintaining  the civility that is expected of every Member, including and especially  the Speaker.                            ____________________
