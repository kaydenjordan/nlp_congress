 Mr. Speaker, I have a lot of emotions as I stand before  you today.   This bill is a strong step toward combating Islamophobia, but it is  only a start. The reality today is that Muslim Americans still face  constant abuse right here at home. While it is great to fight  Islamophobia abroad, we need to be honest with ourselves about how  widespread this disgusting and bigoted anti-Muslim hate is right here  in our own country.   Simply put, my two sons and children across our country deserve to  grow up in a country where their religion, their faith, will not be  used as an excuse to target them and endanger their lives and freedoms.   Muslims across our country deserve Representatives on both sides of  the aisle who will embrace them and who will love them for who they  are, not those who encourage religious violence for their own political  gain.   Mr. Speaker, I would say to my fellow Americans who believe in a  free, inclusive, and accepting country, know that we will win this  fight. The actions of a hateful group of individuals in our country and  in this body are out of touch from the vast majority of our Americans  and neighbors who are good, decent people who reject this violent White  nationalist hate and will put party aside to protect one another from  this bigotry.
