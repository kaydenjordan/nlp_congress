 Madam Chair, I am not here to cast  aspersions on disaster relief. I live in a coastal area in South  Carolina that has been hit by three storms in the last 5 years:  Joaquin, then Matthew, then Florence.   I was a tax lawyer before I got here. I didn't know that much about  disaster relief, and, unfortunately, I have had to learn way more than  I ever wanted to. But one thing that concerns me, and concerns me  greatly, is the haphazard way in which disaster relief is granted.   And just to understand the order of magnitude that we are talking  about here in relief for Puerto Rico, the request of the Governor in  Puerto Rico amounts to, just for the two hurricanes--I don't even know  what it is for the earthquake; I don't know if they have made an  official request yet--but for the two hurricanes, Maria and the other  one, amounts to $94 billion. They have been awarded $39 billion,  allocated or announced, and they have received, obligated, $20 billion.   Now, there were 476,000 applicants approved by FEMA in Puerto Rico.  So, if you look at the amount that the Governor requested, $94 billion,  that amounts to $200,000 per FEMA applicant, $200,000, roughly. The  amount that has been allocated or announced, $40 billion, divided out,  it is just under $100,000 per FEMA applicant. And then the amount that  has actually been paid works out to--and I have got that exact number  here--$41,816 per FEMA applicant for these two storms.   And there is, remaining, a tremendous amount of money that has  already been allocated that hasn't been paid out yet. And there was  disaster money that was made available in the appropriations bill in  December for storms that occurred last year plus any storms that  occurred within 60 days thereafter, and so these earthquakes are also  allowed to access that money.   So I don't know that we really need to be rushing in to allocate  another $5 billion in aid when there is so much money that is already  available to be used for this disaster. I hesitate to do this, but I  want to point this out just to show you the order of magnitude.   After Hurricane Florence, the Governor of South Carolina requested $1  billion. Puerto Rico has requested $94 billion.   The most affected counties in my district were Marion, Dillon,  Marlboro, and Chesterfield. Marion, Dillon, and Marlboro are three of  the poorest counties in the State. Marion County is 57 percent African  American; Dillon County is 51 percent African American; and Marlboro  County is 51 percent African American. The average number of people in  poverty is 30 percent. The average household income is around $30,000-- just so you know the quality of life of these folks.   There were 14,000 houses flooded, water inside the house. Five  thousand of those, for some reason, were approved by FEMA. Even though  they excluded two-thirds of the people who were damaged in this storm,  we were still only awarded $14,000 per FEMA applicant.   Puerto Rico, right now, stands at $41,816 per FEMA applicant before  this $5 billion that they are talking about adding in here--and keeping  in mind that we already did an appropriations bill in December for  disaster allocation for last year that this earthquake is already  allowed to access.                                time  1000    So that is what I wanted to say about the disaster, the total amounts  that are asked to be allocated here. But I want to talk also a little  bit about these tax benefits.   In addition to the $4.7 billion in additional money that is being  asked to be allocated here, over the $40 billion that has already been  allocated, there are several tax provisions in this bill that have  never been considered by the Ways and Means Committee. Tax bills should  arise in the Ways and Means Committee. Tax bills should be debated  thoroughly.   I have heard over and over again, you shouldn't legislate an  appropriations bill. This appropriations bill, this disaster bill,  contains a number of very significant changes to the Tax Code. Now,  some of these were a part of a bigger bill that was marked up with no  debate and with no hearings 6 months ago or a year ago, but they have  never been debated. There has never been a hearing on any of this in  the Ways and Means Committee.   The two biggest things are, we are extending here to residents of  Puerto Rico, the child tax credit as it exists under the United States  Tax Code and the earned income tax credit. Now, people don't know what  that means. But, basically, that amounts to about $4,400 per family.  And that is not a one-time thing like this disaster allocation is. That  is forever. It goes on forever.   The really interesting thing about extending this credit to residents  of Puerto Rico, is that residents of Puerto Rico don't pay U.S. income  tax. They don't file U.S. income tax returns unless they work for the  U.S. Government, or unless their income comes from outside Puerto Rico,  which is a small number of people. They don't pay U.S. income tax.   So what we are talking about doing here is the U.S. Treasury will pay  the child tax credit and the earned income tax credit to residents of  Puerto Rico, credits against tax they don't owe and will never owe  because they simply don't pay income tax.   What this is, is a basically $400 a month entitlement forever to the  residents of Puerto Rico and it makes no sense. It is not related to  the disaster in any way. It is simply a pork barrel earmark is what it  is that lasts forever going to Puerto Rico. Those are the big things:  the earned income tax credit and the child tax credit. But let me go  further.   In addition, this bill would provide New Markets Tax Credits of $500  million to Puerto Rico. Now, the New Markets Tax Credit is a wonderful  thing. Again, it is something under the United States Tax Code. Puerto  Ricans don't pay taxes under the United States Tax Code, but this would  extend that credit. I guess, if people invest in Puerto Rico, they  would get a credit on their U.S. tax return, $500 million.   Just to put that in perspective, it is designed to get people to  invest in rundown areas, in needy areas, and it is a good thing. But  last year, the total amount for the whole country that we allocated,  that we made available for the whole country, was $3.5 billion. This  would give $500 million of that to Puerto Rico which would amount to  one-seventh of what was granted to the entire country last year. $500  million.   I just want to step back and just look at and consider carefully  these tax provisions, in particular, before we move forward with them.  In my opinion, again, they are not related to the disaster in any way.  They are simply a method of creating a new entitlement in Puerto Rico,  credits against U.S. tax for people who pay no U.S. tax.   But if we are going to do this, certainly, it should be debated fully  on this floor, and, certainly, before it ever gets to this floor, it  should be debated fully in every committee--particularly, the Ways and  Means Committee--which has any possible jurisdiction.   So let me go back and end where I started. And that is, that I am not  here to cast aspersions on disaster relief. My poor rural counties in  South Carolina have been terribly affected, have  [[Page H946]]  requested disaster relief, and have received disaster relief. Now they  have received far less than we are talking about here in Puerto Rico.   Probably, if you looked at all of this, maybe a sixth of what my poor  families, my poor African American families, who had nothing to begin  with--right in Marion County and Dillon County and Marlboro County--are  receiving about a third of what the people in Puerto Rico are going to  receive with this disaster bill.   We really need to consider the order of magnitude, number one, and  when I say these numbers, I am not even counting these tax credits.  These tax credits need to be pulled out of this bill and they need to  be fully debated.
