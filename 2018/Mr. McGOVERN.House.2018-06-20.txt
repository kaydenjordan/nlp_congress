 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   (Mr. McGOVERN asked and was given permission to revise and extend his  remarks.)    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Burgess) for yielding me the customary 30 minutes.   Mr. Speaker, my Republican colleagues are rushing to congratulate  themselves for finally addressing opioid addiction. But, Mr. Speaker,  what took them so long? This is an epidemic that fueled more drug  overdoses in America in 2016 than died in the Vietnam war. In fact,  opioids now kill more people every year than breast cancer. 115  Americans are dying from them every single day.   These statistics aren't new. They have been staring the Republicans  in the face for months. The public has been pushing this Congress to  act. Democrats have been pushing measure after measure after measure to  address opioid addiction, but the majority has used their restrictive  amendment process to block them from even getting a vote on the House  floor.   More than a dozen amendments dealing with opioids have been blocked  by the majority from even getting a debate. One of these amendments had  bipartisan support, but it was blocked all the same.   This from a Republican majority that has already turned this Congress  into the most closed Congress in history. Let me say that again. These  guys, my Republican colleagues, have presided over the most closed  Congress in history. There have already been 86 completely closed rules  during the 115th Congress, and it is only June.   That number is expected to grow later this week as the majority  considers their partisan immigration bills under a closed process.   Mr. Speaker, as well-intentioned as these bills may be, we aren't  considering them in a vacuum. And here is the deal: We are taking them  up at a time when Republicans are continuing their crusade against the  Affordable Care Act, a law that has helped millions of Americans  suffering from substance use disorders.   The Trump administration is refusing to defend the ACA. And get this:  its Justice Department recently asked in a legal filing for the courts  to invalidate this law's protections for preexisting conditions.   Mr. Speaker, does the majority realize that substance use disorders  are a preexisting condition?   If Republicans are successful, they will make the opioid crisis even  worse. And it doesn't stop there. Some conservative groups are pushing  the majority to try repealing the ACA completely again before the  summer is out.                                time  1045    This, after Republicans came within a few votes of taking healthcare  from 23 million Americans last year, including those suffering from  opioid addiction.   These rightwing groups released their latest repeal plan yesterday,  so the words from my Republican friends today ring particularly hollow.   Mr. Speaker, we all know that the best answer to an epidemic is to  get as many people as possible into treatment and to provide them and  their families the support that they need. And one of the most  effective ways to accomplish  [[Page H5298]]  this is to expand Medicaid and expand treatment options for substance  abuse through the ACA.   Last October, the Republicans made clear what they think of the  hundreds of thousands of Americans suffering from opioid addiction and  alcohol and drug abuse. They passed a budget that makes $1.3 trillion  in cuts to healthcare, including a 30 percent cut to Medicaid.   Mr. Speaker, Republicans can't bemoan the opioid epidemic on one hand  and vote time and time again to cut the very healthcare systems  required to treat addiction.   Nor can you set up a biased, tiered system that grants access to  treatment for opioid addiction at the expense of providing treatment  for addiction and abuse of other substances, like key provisions in  H.R. 5797. Not only is that inhumane and immoral, but it is also  ineffective. It undermines the entire health system of treating  substance abuse.   Mr. Speaker, many Democrats have joined the majority in supporting  one of these bills, H.R. 6, the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities  Act. It is a good bill. It would help Medicare and Medicaid better  respond to substance use disorders. We are working with the majority  here.   So, Mr. Speaker, why won't they work with us to defend the ACA,  preserve protections for preexisting conditions, and expand Medicaid.   Now, I know asking Congressional Republicans to show some empathy  right now is a tall order. This is the group that has furthered  President Trump's spin on family separations at the border, a policy he  can change unilaterally, right now if he wanted to. I mean, children  are being ripped out of their parents' arms in tears and kept in cages,  warehouses, and tent cities. It is appalling and it is un-American.   You don't have to take my word for it. Republicans, like First Lady  Laura Bush and Senator John McCain, have spoken out against it. And a  U.S. attorney in Texas made clear it was President Trump's policy  choice alone. And get this: This is a U.S. attorney who the President  himself appointed.   But change is possible. Congressional Republicans can see the error  of their ways. They can reject these calls for repeal. They can stop  sitting idly by as President Trump attacks the Affordable Care Act. And  they can start standing up for the 133 million Americans with  preexisting conditions. That includes those suffering from addiction.   They could stop giving the President cover when he falsely claims  that Democrats caused the chaos at the border that he clearly caused.   Stop playing with people's lives. We are talking about their  healthcare. We are talking about getting treatment for addiction. For  God's sake, we are talking about taking children out of the arms of  their mothers. This isn't a handful of cases, it is thousands of cases.  It is outrageous.   It is time for the adults in Congress, men and women of conscience,  to stand up for what is right, not only on the opioid crisis, but on so  many other important issues facing this country. I hope the majority  comes to its senses before it is too late.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Just let me remind my colleagues again, because I think it is worth  emphasizing, that no matter what we do in the next couple of days with  these bills that are going to be before the House, they are rendered  meaningless if the Republicans continue in their effort to cut Medicaid  and to take away protections for people with preexisting conditions.   Substance use disorder is a preexisting condition and Republicans,  working with the White House, are trying to eliminate that protection  for people. I don't get it. It doesn't make sense. But we ought to make  sure that we keep this debate in context and people know what is going  on out there.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 6 minutes to the gentlewoman from California  (Ms. Matsui).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, again, none of what we are doing here today is going to  matter if the Republicans and the Trump administration are successful  in cutting Medicaid and in basically removing the guarantee that people  who have preexisting conditions cannot be denied insurance.   I mean, if the Trump administration is successful, individuals with  preexisting conditions all across the country, including individuals  suffering from opioid use disorders, both in the individual and in the  employer market, could face a denial of coverage or skyrocketing  premiums beyond anything anybody could afford.   I don't get it. I don't understand the hypocrisy here. I know that  the efforts here today are well intentioned and people are trying to do  the right thing, but then you ruin it all when you gut the funding  sources that help people deal with the treatment they need.   This has to stop.   I know some of my friends have ideological blinders on when it comes  to anything that was passed during the Obama administration, but we  have got to put the American people first, and this is a crisis that  affects every single community in this country. If this administration  is successful in what they are trying to do to undercut the ACA, then  countless people will not have access to healthcare and will not have  access to the treatment they need.   Mr. Speaker, our Nation is in the midst of a devastating opioid  crisis that is spiraling out of control. Every day, more than 115  people in the United States die after overdosing on opioids, according  to the National Institute on Drug Abuse. The Centers for Disease  Control and Prevention has also found that opioids are responsible for  6 out of 10 overdose deaths in the United States.   The American people are in desperate need of strong action by  Congress to stem the tide of the opioid scourge. We need serious public  investment to quell this exploding crisis, not just legislation on the  peripherals. We must direct resources to the States and local  communities on the front lines of this devastating public health crisis  where assistance is needed the most.   Mr. Speaker, I am going to ask my colleagues to defeat the previous  question, and if we do, I will offer an amendment to bring up  Representative Loebsack's legislation, H.R. 4501, the Combating the  Opioid Epidemic Act. This bill would provide badly needed funding for  State grants for the prevention, detection, surveillance, and treatment  of opioid abuse.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately  prior to the vote on the previous question.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Ruiz).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 2 minutes to the  gentleman from California.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, today, we are on the floor discussing the opioid crisis.  This is an epidemic that is plaguing every community in the country,  and it is killing 115 people every single day. It is heartbreaking,  and, quite frankly, I am ashamed it is taking Congress so long to act.   I would again point out that anything we do in the next few days and  anything we have done gets erased if the Republicans succeed in cutting  Medicaid and if the President succeeds in basically eliminating  protections for people with preexisting conditions.   But, Mr. Speaker, I think it is also important that people know there  is a lot of stuff going on this week, and we are also awaiting word  from the House Republicans when the Rules Committee will have an  emergency meeting, I guess today, on two immigration bills that were  posted after 9 p.m. last night.   These bills were drafted without any Democratic input, and from what  we can tell, they are dangerous and they are certainly not a  comprehensive solution to immigration reform. They harm children, and  they leave many Dreamers behind.   This is not what our constituents want us to do. They want the  President to do what he could easily do and stop separating children  from their parents.   The President says that he wants Democrats to come to the table, but  we never get invited to anything. I tried to go and see the President  yesterday when the Republicans were meeting with him, but I was not  allowed to go into the room.   I tried to shout at the President as he was walking by, but he was  quickly escorted by. I wanted to show him the pictures on the border of  these young children who are being taken away from their parents.   The President continues to spread mistruths about immigration and  practically every other issue that is before this Congress and before  this Nation, and it seems just to be getting worse.   There are such things as facts. There are such things as truth.   Yesterday, The Washington Post published an article, entitled:  ``President Trump Seems to be Saying More and More Things That Aren't  True.'' Well, I would like to take a few minutes to read this article,  because these aren't my words, Mr. Speaker. They are the words of The  Washington Post, specifically, Ashley Parker, who wrote the piece.   If the President is watching, I think it is helpful for me to read  because I know he doesn't read, so maybe he can hear this.   ``He's done it on Twitter. He's done it in the White House driveway.  And he's done it in a speech to a business group.   ``President Trump, a man already known for trafficking in mistruths  and even outright lies--has been outdoing himself with falsehoods in  recent days, repeating and amplifying bogus claims on several of the  most pressing controversies facing his Presidency.   ``Since Saturday, Trump has tweeted false or misleading information  at least seven times on the topic of immigration and at least six times  on a Justice Department inspector general report into the FBI's  handling of its investigation into Hillary Clinton's private email  server. That is more than a  [[Page H5301]]  dozen obfuscations on just two central topics--a figure that does not  include falsehoods on other issues, whether in tweets or public  remarks.   ``The false claims come as the President--emboldened by fewer  disciplinarians inside the West Wing--indulges in frequent Twitter  screeds. A Washington Post analysis found that in June, Trump has been  tweeting at the fastest rate of his Presidency so far, an average of  11.3 messages per day.    ``Inside the White House, aides and advisers say they believe the  media is unwilling to give Trump a fair shot and is knee-jerk ready to  accuse him of lying, even in cases where the facts support his point.   ``The President often seeks to paint a self-serving and self- affirming alternate reality for himself and his supporters. Disparaging  the `fake news' media, Trump offers his own filter through which to  view the world--offering a competing reality on issues including  relationships forged (or broken) at the Group of Seven summit in  Canada, the success of the Singapore summit with the North Koreans, and  his administration's `zero tolerance' policy on illegal immigration.   `` `It's extraordinary how he is completely indifferent to the truth.  There's just no relationship between his statements--anything he  utters--and the actual truth of the matter,' said Thomas Murray,  president emeritus of the Hastings Center, the founding institution in  the field of bioethics. `As far as I can tell, the best way to  understand anything he says is what will best serve his interests in  the moment. It's irrespective to any version of the truth.'   ``According to an analysis by The Post's Fact Checker through the end  of May, Trump has made 3,251 false or misleading claims in 497 days, an  average of 6.5 such claims per day of his Presidency.''                                time  1115    ``And within the past week, Trump seems to have ramped up both the  volume and the intensity of his false statements on two of the most  prominent topics currently facing his administration: the hardline  immigration policy that has led to the separation of thousands of  children from their parents--which Trump erroneously blames on others-- and the 500-page inspector general report that he claims, incorrectly,  exonerates him in special counsel Robert S. Mueller III's probe of  Russian interference in the 2016 election.   ``Bella DePaulo, a psychology researcher at the University of  California Santa Barbara, said Trump's use of repetition is a  particularly effective technique for convincing his supporters of the  veracity of his false claims, in part because most people have a `truth  bias' or an initial inclination to accept what others say as true.   `` `When liars repeat the same lie over and over again, they can get  even more of an advantage, at least among those who want to believe  them or are not all that motivated either way,' DePaulo said in an  email. `So when people hear the same lies over and over again-- especially when they want to believe those lies--a kind of new reality  can be created. What they've heard starts to seem like it is just  obvious, and not something that needs to be questioned.'   ``On immigration, Trump and many top administration officials have  said that existing U.S. laws and court rulings have given them no  choice but to separate families trying to cross illegally into the  United States. But it is the administration's decision, announced in  April, to prosecute all southern border crossings that has led to the  separation of families.   ``That hasn't stopped the President from blaming Democrats for his  administration's decisions. `Democrats are the problem,' Trump wrote in  one tweet. In another, he was even more blunt: `The Democrats are  forcing the breakup of families at the border with their horrible and  cruel legislative agenda. . . .' ''   Mr. Speaker, let me divert a little bit here. The truth is that the  President caused this crisis, and it is not just me saying it and The  Washington Post saying it. Listen to what some of the Republicans have  said, Lindsey Graham said: ``President Trump could stop this policy  with a phone call. I'll go tell him: If you don't like families being  separated, you can tell DHS, `Stop doing it.' ''   Senator John McCain: ``The administration's current family separation  policy is an affront to the decency of the American people, and  contrary to principles and values upon which our Nation was founded.  The administration has the power to rescind this policy. It should do  so now.''   Senator Susan Collins, former First Lady Laura Bush--and I can go on  and on and on--a whole bunch of Republicans now are all agreeing with  us that the President is not telling us the truth.   So let me go back to the article: ``While Congress could pass a  legislative fix, Republicans control both the House and the Senate-- making it disingenuous at best to finger the opposing party, as the  President has repeatedly done.   ``Speaking to the National Federation of Independent Business on  Tuesday, Trump again falsely painted the humanitarian crisis as a  binary choice. `We can either release all illegal immigrant families  and minors who show up at the border from Central America, or we can  arrest the adults for the Federal crime of illegal entry,' he said.  `Those are the only two options.'   ``On Twitter, the President twice in the past 4 days has singled out  Germany as facing an increase in crime. `Crime in Germany is up 10  percent-plus (officials do not want to report these crimes) since  migrants were accepted,' Trump wrote. `Others countries are even worse.  Be smart, America.' ''   That is his tweet.   ``In fact, the opposite is true. Reported crime in Germany was  actually down by 10 percent last year and, according to German Interior  Minister . . . the country's reported crime rate last year was actually  at its lowest point in three decades.   ``The President has also falsely claimed that the inspector general  report `exonerated' him from Mueller's probe, when the report did not  delve into the Russia investigation. When he made this argument Friday  during an impromptu press gaggle in the White House driveway, a  reporter pressed him on the falsehood.   `` `Sir, that has nothing to do with collusion,' the reporter said.  `Why are you lying about it, sir?' ''   The bottom line, Mr. Speaker, is, we have a President who has a  problem with the truth, and Congress needs to stand up and do the right  thing. We need to speak the truth; we need to embrace the truth; and we  need to solve some of the issues that are before the American people.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.
