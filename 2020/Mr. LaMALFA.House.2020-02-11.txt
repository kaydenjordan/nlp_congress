 Madam Speaker, last month, Health and Human Services  issued a notice of violation to my home State of California that is in  direct violation of the Weldon amendment, by requiring all health  insurers to cover abortions in their plans.   Governor Newsom has 11 days left to comply with Federal law by  repealing the abortion mandate or risk losing important Federal funds.   In the shadow of the 47th anniversary of Rowe v. Wade, it is  important that we buck the status quo that increasingly takes human  life for granted. While Governor Newsom continues to blatantly  disregard people's personal and religious views, I will continue to  stand here as part of the fight to make sure Americans are never forced  to pay for other people's abortions.   Madam Speaker, I urge Governor Newsom to quickly repeal California's  abortion mandate and get back in line with the rule of law.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague from Montana (Mr.  Gianforte) for his leadership on this.   It is really a commonsense issue, isn't it? Government efficiency,  accountability, and reform is something that all Americans can get  behind because, let's remember for just a moment, who pays for all of  this? Who pays to keep the lights on here, all of these buildings in  Washington, D.C., all of the people working in them, all of them out in  the districts, all of them out there in the forests, what have you? It  is the American taxpayer.   What is the American taxpayer faced with? Trying to take care of  their own business, their home, their family, their mortgage, car  payments, saving for college, whatever their priorities are, maybe  going on a vacation once in a while, saving up so they can have a week  or two off.   What is it that we are doing with their money in Washington, D.C., or  my home State of California in Sacramento? How are we respecting what  they earn? How are we respecting that by the priorities we are putting  on spending what they earn?   And it isn't a contribution, like sometimes it is talked about. I  love to hear the talk around here: the contributions you make, and the  investments we are going to make. No, tax dollars are not voluntary.  They are taken from you per a formula.    So, how are we treating them? That is an important charge to me.   This is a big place, and there are a lot of Members, and there is a  lot of government, after 230-plus years of layers. So getting back to  just a little more efficiency, I think, tells those hardworking folks  that there is somebody in Washington, D.C., like this GEAR committee,  like these folks, who are trying to somehow work toward balancing the  budget someday.   The President's budget that he is talking about, he is going to take  a lot of hits for that right now. At least he is putting the concept  out there that is trying to work toward balance instead of deficit  spending. We will be consumed one day by the service on the debt if  interest rates go wild. It will eclipse our spending.   Let me just break it down, in my couple of minutes here, on a couple  of things that I think are important about this more locally, more for  the Western States that myself, Mr. Gianforte, and others share.   The RSC plan lays out more than 100 solutions for GEAR reform,  including modernizing NEPA and the Endangered Species Act, especially  important in my State, as well as the West.                                time  1515    NEPA is Big Government at its best. It has been manipulated into  something that is a monster and that it should never have been as far  as protecting the environment. It is often the largest hindrance on  forest management, water management, water storage, and for simple  power line clearing projects; like are so desperately needed in my  district since the town of Paradise burned a little over a year ago,  and we are trying to rebuild. There are more towns I could name in the  district that that same catastrophe could happen to because of  overcrowded forests, and in some cases proximity to power lines.   According to this report, the NEPA review can take nearly 6 years on  average to get a NEPA report.   We are talking about forestry, Madam Speaker.   How long does it take to study replacing a simple culvert in a Forest  Service road?   Why does that even need a study?   If you built the thing to begin with, just replace it. No. We have  got to study it to death. We have to study and get permits to clear  trees around power lines that might be hazardous, a leaning tree or a  dead tree.   Now, thankfully, we got bipartisan legislation, me and Mr. Schrader  from Oregon, to help speed that process up, and we are going to work on  another bill to speed it up even more so we can do a simple, basic,  commonsense thing like that.   Californians don't have a lot of time to wait for the government to  do the forest management on its lands and infrastructure overhauls  needed to protect them from wildfires and droughts. Indeed, when the  Pacific Gas & Electric Company says that it might be up to 10 years  before we can get out of this power shutoff situation that we are  facing because of other issues that they are battling through with  green power mandates and getting permission to do the lines.   Ten years of power shutoffs for my constituents?   Are you kidding me?   We need to narrow that down to almost nothing, because we can't have  another year like that.   So I applaud the Trump administration for recently proposing reforms  to NEPA, but we should not have had to wait 40 years for the executive  branch to act. This executive branch is doing so.   Congress should be in the business of addressing inefficiency in  government, having much more oversight, like GEAR, like my colleagues  are all working on here as well, including ending the cumulative  effects and indirect impact statements required by NEPA.   The Endangered Species Act also poses a unique set of problems to  California, specifically with critical habitat designations.   Take the valley elderberry longhorn beetle. Fish and Wildlife  recommended, I think about 15 years ago, to finally delist that. Here  we still are waiting to delist that and all the habitat issues with  elderberry plants that inhibit the ability to fix flood control  projects and to fix levees, because you have to plant back 15 to 1 for  every elderberry bush you might disturb because it is possible critical  habitat, even if you have never seen an elderberry beetle land there.   The Shasta Dam project would raise the dam 18 feet and supply about  650,000 more acre-feet of water for Californians, whether it is for  agriculture, people, habitat or whatever--18 more feet. That is a lot  of water to an existing dam. It has been halted due to a lawsuit  calling for the protection of the Shasta salamander. The 3-inch long  salamander makes its home on the banks of Lake Shasta which has been  designated as a critical habitat.   Now, when there is a lot of rain coming into Lake Shasta, the fastest  the lake can rise is about one-quarter inch per hour during heavy rain.  So all the salamander has to do is be able to move at one-quarter inch  per hour to stay ahead of the lake level.   Where is the sense here?   Eighteen feet above an already existing lake which the salamander  already thinks is pretty cool to live next to.   Critical habitats unnecessarily delay critical infrastructure  projects like the Shasta Dam, and their designation standards need to  be reformed for whatever habitat is.   The RSC GEAR report has done an excellent job at addressing these  necessary changes, including reforms to NEPA and the ESA. I sincerely  hope Congress--both sides of the aisle--will take these suggestions and  hold bureaucracy more accountable to the American people who pay for  all this.   Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.
