 Mr. Speaker, Jakelin Caal Maquin, 7-year-old girl.  Felipe Gomez Alonzo, 8 years old. Juan de Leon Gutierrez, 16 years old.  Carlos Hernandez Vasquez, 16 years old. All of these children died  under our custody in the United States of America.   In the last 8 months, six children have died in the United States of  America under the custody of the Department of Homeland Security. It  pains me to say this because I am not talking about some war-torn  country halfway around the world. This is happening right here in the  United States of America.   Over the past 2 years, under this President, President Donald Trump,  24 men, women, and children who came looking for a better life in the  United States of America died.   This administration's treatment is inhumane. What President Trump and  this administration are doing is shameful.   Mr. Speaker, let's be very clear: the crisis at the border is a  humanitarian crisis that is the product of the President's deadly  policies. We need accountability and this President will need to answer  for his role in the loss of life, on our soil, at the United States  border.                            ____________________
