 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the  life of Dr. Jessica Miller Mullinix, a loving wife and doctor at  Candler Hospital in Savannah.   Jessica had practiced as an obstetrician/gynecologist at Candler  Hospital in Savannah for 4 years, building a loyal following of  patients, colleagues, and coworkers.   Jessica graduated with magna cum laude honors from the University of  Georgia in 2009 and the Mercer University School of Medicine in 2014.   During her time at the Mercer University School of Medicine's  Savannah campus, Jessica met her husband, Dr. Patrick Mullinix.   Jessica completed her residency at Eastern Virginia Medical School in  Norfolk, Virginia, in 2018 before joining the staff at Candler where  she was the first OB/GYN to serve the Pooler area at the St. Joseph's/ Candler-Pooler Campus.   During her residency and 4 years at Candler, Jessica delivered more  than a thousand babies.   Despite her health struggles, Jessica continued to work full time at  Candler, fully dedicated to the many patients that depended on her.   Jessica will be dearly missed. Our thoughts and prayers are with her  and her family.                            ____________________
