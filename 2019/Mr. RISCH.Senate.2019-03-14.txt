 Mr. President, section 36(b) of the Arms Export Control  Act requires that Congress receive prior notification of certain  proposed arms sales as defined by that statute. Upon such notification,  the Congress has 30 calendar days during which the sale may be  reviewed. The provision stipulates that, in the Senate, the  notification of proposed sales shall be sent to the chairman of the  Senate Foreign Relations Committee.   In keeping with the committee's intention to see that relevant  information is available to the full Senate, I ask unanimous consent to  have printed in the Record the notifications which have been received.  If the cover letter references a classified annex, then such annex is  available to all Senators in the office of the Foreign Relations  Committee, room SD-423.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                    Defense Security                                              Cooperation Agency,                                                      Arlington, VA.

POLICY JUSTIFICATION                     Spain--Assault Amphibious Vehicles         The Government of Spain has requested to buy eight (8)       Assault Amphibious Vehicles, Personnel (AAVP-7A1)       Reliability, Availability, Maintainability/Rebuilt to       Standard (RAM/RS); two (2) Assault Amphibious Vehicles,       Command (AAVC-7A 1) Reliability, Availability,       Maintainability/Rebuilt to Standard (RAM/RS); and one (1)       Assault Amphibious Vehicle, Recovery (AAVR-7A1) Reliability,       Availability, Maintainability/Rebuilt to Standard (RAM/RS).       Also included are Enhanced Armor Applique Kits (EAAK), spare       and repair parts, tools and test equipment, technical data       and publications, training and training material, U.S.       Government and contractor technical and logistics support       services, and other related elements of logistics and program       support. The total estimated program cost is $107 million.        This proposed sale will support the foreign policy and       national security of the United States by improving the       security of a NATO ally which is an important force for       political stability and economic progress in Europe. It is       vital to the U.S. national interest to assist Spain in       developing and maintaining a strong and ready self-defense       capability.        The proposed addition of these eleven (11) vehicles to       Spain's fleet will afford more flexibility and maintain       Spain's expeditionary capability to counter regional threats       and continue to enhance stability in the region. Spain       currently operates 19 Assault Amphibious Vehicles (AAVs) and       is proficient at using them to their fullest capability.       Spain will have no difficulty absorbing these additional       vehicles.        The proposed sale of this equipment will not alter the       basic military balance in the region.        The principal contractor will be BAE Systems, York,       Pennsylvania, and Anniston, Alabama. There are no known       offset agreements proposed in connection with this potential       sale.        Implementation of this proposed sale will not require the       assignment of any additional U.S. Government or contractor       representative in Spain.        There will be no adverse impact on U.S. defense readiness       as a result of this proposed sale.                            Transmittal No. 19-04       Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of Offer Pursuant to           Section 36(b)(1) of the Arms Export Control Act                             Annex Item No. vii         (vii) Sensitivity of Technology:        1. The vulnerability to countermeasure information for       Assault Amphibious Vehicles is considered classified SECRET.        2. If a technologically advanced adversary were to obtain       knowledge of the hardware and software elements, the       information could be used to develop countermeasures or       equivalent systems which might reduce system effectiveness or       be used in the development of a system with similar or       advanced capabilities.        3. A determination has been made that the Government of       Spain can provide substantially the same degree of protection       for the sensitive technology being released as the U,S.       Government. This sale is necessary in furtherance of the U.S.       foreign policy and national security objectives outlined in       the Policy Justification.        4. All defense articles and services listed in this       transmittal have been authorized for release and export to       the Government of Spain.                            ____________________
