 Madam Speaker, this week, the Senate Republicans allowed  expanded Federal unemployment benefits to expire and unveiled a grossly  inadequate counter to the HEROES Act titled the HEALS Act.   The HEALS Act slashes expanded Federal employment benefits by $400 a  week during a time when families need our support the most.   Even after some States have gradually reopened, the economy has not  made a miraculous comeback. Millions of workers are still out of work,  and too many of them do not have a job to return to.   Workers are relying on these unemployment benefits to cover basic  life necessities while our economy recovers.   The HEALS Act is a moral failure. It puts corporations first instead  of helping the people we were elected to serve or supporting the local  governments battling this crisis.   This is not a time to play politics. We have to be bold and act with  urgency.                            ____________________
