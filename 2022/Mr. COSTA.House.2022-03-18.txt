 Madam Speaker, as Vladimir Putin attempts to drape the  Iron Curtain over Russia once again, I stress the importance of working  together with our European allies to support Ukraine's sovereignty and  democracies around the world. Make no mistake about it: This is the  test of our time.   As the co-chair of the Transatlantic Legislators' Dialogue, I work  closely with my European Co-Chair Radoslaw ``Radek'' Sikorski. Congress  and the European Parliament have taken steps to deal with this pariah  Putin.   Congress passed $13.6 billion last week for Ukraine, which provides  support for humanitarian aid, military assistance, and economic  resolve. American allies, such as Poland and other European countries,  are doing a great deal to deal with the refugee problem.   President Biden separately provided an additional $800 million for  Stinger missiles and other anti-aircraft, anti-armor weapons to help  the valiant, brave Ukrainians. Members of the European Parliament have  also done their part with another $500 million in assistance.   NATO, today, is stronger than at any time since the Cold War. But  there is much more work ahead of us. We must continue to unite the  front against Vladimir Putin with our European allies.   As President Zelenskyy reminded us: The cost of freedom is not free.                            ____________________
