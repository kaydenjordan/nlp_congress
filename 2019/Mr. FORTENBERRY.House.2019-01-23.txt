 Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member, Ms.  Granger, for her indulgence in letting me speak today. Let me thank our  chair, Mrs. Lowey, as well for at least the ability today to have a  discussion.    Mr. Speaker, no one wins in a government shutdown. No one wins if the  border is not secure. That is where we are.   On my way here yesterday, as I was scrambling to get to the airport-- and I live in Nebraska, a relatively small State, so we all kind of  know one another or at least kind of recognize one another. As I  checked in with my boarding pass and showed the TSA agent my ID, he  looked at me and he said: Can you vote for the bill?   Now, given it is the Senate bill that is dominating the headlines,  because it is a reasoned attempt to reach some type of consensus here,  I looked at the TSA agent and I said: Yes, I can. I know this has been  tough. How long can you hold out?   He said: It is tough. I don't want to miss another paycheck, but I  can hold out about 30 days.   He said please. I thanked him for his service. Right now, I would  like to thank all of the people who have come back to work without pay,  who have done their duty, many under some hardship, because they know  it is the right thing to do.   Yet, what is also the right thing to do is to get past this logjam,  this impasse, and to leverage this moment and to actually get an  outcome, a bipartisan outcome, that secures our border.   This weekend, the President, I thought, laid out a reasoned proposal  that included a spectrum of immigration issues, most of which enjoy  robust bipartisan support, including border security. And what do we  need there? Personnel. We need technology, and we need enhanced  barriers.   Now, there is the possibility of some movement on these important  questions of reopening the government and getting the right type of  border security that now sits in the United States Senate. But I  thought Senator Lankford made a good comment as well. He said this  isn't a yes or a no proposition, on that particular bill. It is the  starting point, again, for a reasoned debate about how we find some  consensus.   Mr. Speaker, America is a just and generous Nation, and we have  opened our arms to people who wish to come here and embrace the values,  people who have fled political or economic persecution and want to  rebuild their lives. That is the hallmark of who we are.   But charity cannot flow out of chaos. When you have disorder at the  border, you have an inability to have a just and humanitarian system  that is beneficial to America and to people in need all around the  world.                                time  1445    And that, fundamentally, is what is at issue here today--not  necessarily finding a compromise, but a consensus. A compromise implies  that somebody may win and somebody may lose. Let's all win here. Let's  get the government reopened with the right type of package that  includes robust border security that can make America proud.
