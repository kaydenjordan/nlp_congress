 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 2225) to authorize appropriations for fiscal years  2022, 2023, 2024, 2025, and 2026 for the National Science Foundation,  and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2225         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``National Science Foundation       for the Future Act''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress finds the following:        (1) Over the past seven decades, the National Science       Foundation has played a critical role in advancing the United       States academic research enterprise by supporting fundamental       research and education across science and engineering       disciplines.        (2) Discoveries enabled by sustained investment in       fundamental research and the education of the United States       science and engineering workforce have led to       transformational innovations and spawned new industries.        (3) While the traditional approach to investment in       research has delivered myriad benefits to society, a       concerted effort is needed to ensure the benefits of       federally funded science and engineering are enjoyed by all       Americans.        (4) As countries around the world increase investments in       research and STEM education, United States global leadership       in science and engineering is eroding, posing significant       risks to economic competitiveness, national security, and       public well-being.        (5) To address major societal challenges and sustain United       States leadership in innovation, the Federal Government must       increase investments in research, broaden participation in       the STEM workforce, and bolster collaborations among       universities, National Laboratories, field stations and       marine laboratories, companies, labor organizations, non-      profit funders of research, local policymakers, civil       societies and stakeholder communities, and international       partners.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks  and to include extraneous material on H.R. 2025, the bill now under  consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I rise today in strong support of H.R. 2225, the National Science  Foundation for the Future Act.   The United States has long been a beacon of excellence in science and  engineering. We are at a time of markedly increased global competition  in research and development. However, while we should be cognizant of  our increasing global competition, we must not be constrained by it. To  continue to lead, we must chart our own course.   First and foremost, we must significantly boost funding for science.  For years, we have allowed billions of dollars of excellent research to  go unfunded.   Second, we must fully leverage our STEM talent. We need to empower  more women, people of color, rural students, and other underrepresented  groups to contribute.   Finally, we must ensure the benefits of science are widely shared. We  are at a critical juncture in our Nation's history, and we need to be  more focused on the role of science in our society.   Science and technology are powerful tools for helping solve society's  most pressing challenges. But as this pandemic has demonstrated, some  communities and their needs have long been overlooked. We must give  voice to a wider range of stakeholders in guiding scientific research.   For more than seven decades, the National Science Foundation has  played a critical role in supporting research. Many of the innovations  that have fueled American prosperity and security would not have been  possible without NSF-funded science.   As we look to the agency's future, we must seize this opportunity to  build upon and leverage its strengths. I believe this legislation does  just that.   After a decade of flat funding, H.R. 2225 provides a much-needed  increase in funding. The bill sets NSF on a path for steady,  sustainable growth. The bill addresses challenges at all levels of STEM  education and training. It supports activities and partnerships to  broaden participation in NSF-funded projects.   Finally, this bill establishes a new directorate to accelerate  progress on emerging technologies and advanced research-driven  solutions to societal challenges like climate change and inequality.   This bill is the result of over a year and a half of close,  bipartisan collaboration. The Committee on Science, Space, and  Technology held multiple hearings and markups to inform its  development. We incorporated feedback from dozens of stakeholder  groups, policy experts, and thought leaders. And this is reflected in  the fact that the bill has been endorsed by 50 scientific societies,  universities, and industry associations.   I want to thank Ranking Member Lucas for his partnership in  developing this legislation. I also want to thank his staff, in  particular, Jennifer Wickre and Catherine Johnson, for their  contributions.   And the Science Committee staff on the Democratic side, I would like  to thank Dahlia Sokolov and Sara Barber for all of their hard work on  this bill.   I also want to thank Speaker Pelosi's staff, Kenneth Russell DeGraff  and Reva Price, for helping to get this bill to the floor today.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.                                time  1700     Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Michigan (Ms. Stevens), the chair of the Subcommittee  on Research and Technology.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from Illinois (Mr. Foster).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from California (Ms. Lofgren).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. Ross).    Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for  time, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I simply urge all of my colleagues  to support the National Science Foundation for the Future Act.   It is really time to acknowledge that we did have to do a lot of  extra homework to come to the final portions of this bill, and we did  it collaboratively. We involved the entire scientific community, and we  believe we have done a great job.   I urge all of my colleagues to support this legislation, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 3593) to provide guidance for and investment in the  research and development activities of the Department of Energy Office  of Science, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 3593         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks  and to include extraneous material on H.R. 3593, the bill now under  consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I am very pleased today that we are considering the Department of  Energy Science for the Future Act.   This well-vetted, bipartisan bill will provide the first ever  comprehensive authorization for the Department of Energy's Office of  Science. This office accounts for over half of the Department's  nondefense research and development budget and supports a wide range of  research facilities and activities that are critical to the U.S.  competitiveness and for enabling our clean energy future.   The Office of Science is the Nation's largest supporter of research  in the physical sciences, and it is the lead Federal agency supporting  scientific research for energy applications. H.R. 3593 authorizes  significant, steady, and sustainable growth for the office's wide- ranging research from climate science to quantum science, and  everything in between.   The bill also ensures the office's construction projects and upgrades  to its world-class scientific user facility have the resources they  need to be completed on time and on budget.   H.R. 3593 is a substantial effort in the fight against climate  change. The bill authorizes research to advance the next generation of  clean energy technologies to help us reach our shared goals of  developing energy that is clean, sustainable, reliable, and affordable.  In carrying out these activities, this bill also directs the office to  support the development of a skilled, diverse, and inclusive workforce  for clean energy researchers, scientists, and professionals.   That is why the bill has been endorsed by stakeholders in the  business community, like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce; the academic  community, like the Association of American Universities; major  scientific associations, like the American Physical and Chemical  Societies; and significant environmental organizations like the  Environmental Defense Fund.   This bill is another strong example of the collaborative bipartisan  approach that our committee has taken. Ranking Member Lucas'  collaborative approach has been crucial in getting us to where we are  today.   Before I yield back, I would like to recognize the Committee on  Science, Space, and Technology staff who worked on this bill, and in  some cases for several years now: Adam Rosenberg, Alyse Huffman,  Sangina Wright, and Bill Kallen. I also recognize the efforts of  Ranking Member Lucas' staff in helping us to get where we are today,  including Hillary O'Brien, Jenn Wickre, and Daniel Dziadon.   I strongly urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support  this bill to dramatically improve the Nation's competitiveness and help  lead us all to a brighter future. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of  my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may  consume to the gentlewoman from Wisconsin (Ms. Moore).    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, in closing, let me simply say that we on this committee  know that we are the committee that will determine the future of our  Nation and the standing of the world when it comes to science. And we  have taken our work very seriously. I am grateful to all of the  members. We know we cannot be any better than the people who we involve  and use their talents, and we must do that as well.   Mr. Speaker, I thank all of the members of the committee on both  sides of the aisle for staying with us and working through all that we  know we need to do to come together to look out for the future of our  Nation's scientific enterprise.   Mr. Speaker, I ask all of the persons, my colleagues, to support this  bill and vote ``yes.''   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
