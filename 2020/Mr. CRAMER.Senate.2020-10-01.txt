 Mr. President, I recognize today the city of  Minot, the Minot Air Force Base, and other community members who have  come together to present their youngest citizens a gift they will enjoy  for generations to come.   Groundbreaking will be held on October 7 for the Magic City Discovery  Center, a children's museum that will develop 12 interactive galleries  on math, engineering, technology, science, and art for children up to  14 years old. The musuem will encourage children of all ages to learn  both independently and in groups as they invent, play, discover, and  create.   Making this center a reality has been a significant challenge to its  supporters, and only with many partners could the nearly $14 million in  construction costs be met. A large boost came from the Minot Air Force  Base, which worked with the community to secure a $6.3 million grant  from the Defense Community Infrastructure Pilot Program. This  Department of Defense program helps fund projects that prioritize  quality of life for Active military families. The commanders of the  Minot Air Force Base supported this grant so their more than 1,300  children of military families from kindergarten through fifth grade  have year-round learning opportunities.   I congratulate the city of Minot and Minot Air Force Base on another  successful community partnership. The men and women stationed at the  base perform exemplary work every day critical to the safety of our  Nation. We must do all we can to support them and their families during  their time as North Dakota residents.   North Dakota's quality of life is consistently ranked as one of the  best in the Nation. An excellent example of why we have this high  ranking is the dedication of the citizens of Minot to give their  children a Magic City Discovery Center.
