 Mr. President, for the information of all Senators, we  will plan to take short breaks approximately every 2 hours and a longer  dinner break around 5 p.m.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Pursuant to the provisions of S. Res. 47,  the counsel for the former President has 16 hours to make the  presentation of their case, and the Senate will hear the counsel now.   We recognize Mr. van der Veen to begin the presentation of the case  for the former President.   Go ahead.                            Counsels' Presentation    Mr. Counsel VAN DER VEEN. Good afternoon, Senators, Mr. President.   The Article of Impeachment now before the Senate is an unjust and  blatantly unconstitutional act of political vengeance. This appalling  abuse of the Constitution only further divides our Nation when we  should be trying to come together around shared priorities.   Like every other politically motivated witch hunt the left has  engaged in over the past 4 years, this impeachment is completely  divorced from the facts, the evidence, and the interests of the  American people. The Senate should promptly and decisively vote to  reject it.   No thinking person could seriously believe that the President's  January 6 speech on the Ellipse was in any way an incitement to  violence or insurrection. The suggestion is patently absurd on its  face. Nothing in the text could ever be construed as encouraging,  condoning, or enticing unlawful activity of any kind.   Far from promoting ``insurrection'' against the United States, the  President's remarks explicitly encouraged those in attendance to  exercise their rights ``peacefully and patriotically.'' Peaceful and  patriotic protest is the very antithesis of a violent assault on the  Nation's Capitol.   The House Impeachment Article slanderously alleges that the President  intended for the crowd at the Ellipse to ``interfere with the Joint  Session's solemn constitutional duty to certify the results of the 2020  Presidential election.'' This is manifestly disproven by the plain text  of the remarks.   The President devoted nearly his entire speech to an extended  discussion of how legislators should vote on the question at hand.  Instead of expressing a desire that the joint session be prevented from  conducting its business, the entire premise of his remarks was that the  democratic process would and  [[Page S668]]  should play out according to the letter of the law, including both the  Constitution and the Electoral Count Act.   In the conclusion of his remarks, he then laid out a series of  legislative steps that should be taken to improve democratic  accountability going forward, such as passing universal voter ID  legislation, banning ballot harvesting, requiring proof of citizenship  to vote, and turning out strong in the next primaries. Not only  President--these are not the words of someone inciting a violent  insurrection.   Not only President Trump's speech on January 6 but, indeed, his  entire challenge to the election results was squarely focused on how  the proper civic process could address any concerns through the  established legal and constitutional system. The President brought his  case before State and Federal courts, the U.S. Supreme Court, the State  legislatures, the electoral college, and, ultimately, the U.S.  Congress.   In the past, numerous other candidates for President have used many  of the same processes to pursue their own election challenges. As  recently as 2016, the Clinton campaign brought multiple postelection  court cases, demanded recounts, and ridiculously declared the election  stolen by Russia.   Many Democrats even attempted to persuade the electoral college  delegates to overturn the 2016 results. House Manager Raskin objected  to the certification of President Trump's victory 4 years ago, along  with many of his colleagues.   You will remember, it was Joe Biden who had to gavel him down.

Honestly, it looks like a war zone.         They keep doing it day after day after day.        In fact, our country is a nation of protests. The patriots       were protesters.        Unidentified Speaker. St. John's Church is on fire.        Unidentified Speaker. Can you disavow that was antifa?

Democrats are going to fight like hell.         We are fighting back.         Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  recess for a 15-minute break.   There being no objection, at 1:53 p.m., the Senate, sitting as a  Court of Impeachment, recessed until 2:34 p.m.; whereupon the Senate  reassembled when called to order by the President pro tempore.                      Counsels' Presentation--Continued    The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who seeks recognition?   Mr. Counsel CASTOR. I do, Mr. President.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Mr. Castor is recognized.   Mr. Counsel CASTOR. Mr. President, Members of the Senate, good  afternoon.   It has been my great privilege over the past couple of weeks to lead  this outstanding team of lawyers and dedicated professionals in the  defense of the 45th President of the United States. One of the most  difficult things in leading such a talented group is deciding who is  responsible for what and the strategy and the order in which we will  present our evidence.   You have heard from Mr. van der Veen and Mr. Schoen on the importance  of the First Amendment and the importance of due process of law, and  because I had the opportunity to set out the schedule, I decided that I  would take the last substantive part of the case for myself. You can  take that two ways. The first, perhaps, is the best, and that would be  that it is almost over. The second is that perhaps you have to wait  another hour for it to be over.   The reason why I chose this section--and believe me, it was a very  difficult decision to make because I thought that the other arguments  presented by Mr. Schoen and Mr. van der Veen were outstandingly  researched, thoroughly vetted, and wonderfully and articulately  presented by them. But the critical issue in this case is the very  narrow issue that is charged against the 45th President, and that issue  is, did the 45th President engage in incitement of--they continue to  say ``insurrection''? Clearly, there was no insurrection.   ``Insurrection'' is a term of art defined in the law, and it involves  taking over a country, a shadow government, taking the TV stations  over, and having some plan on what you are going to do when you finally  take power. Clearly, this is not that. What our colleagues here across  the aisle meant is incitement to violence, to riot. So the word  ``incitement'' is the critical case and the critical issue in the case.   Now, the first time that you heard from us, I told you that you would  never hear from our side that what happened on January 6 was anything  other than horrific and that the 45th President of the United States  and his lawyers and his entire team adamantly denounce that violence by  those criminals that occurred in this very Chamber, this very building.   There was a reason why we started our presentation back on Tuesday in  that way, because I did not want the Senators to consider that there  was any challenge to that particular fact. Yet the House managers,  knowing it was not contested at all, chose to spend 14-plus hours  showing you pictures of how horrific the attack on the United States  Capitol was. They spent no time at all in connecting legally the attack  on the Capitol to the 45th President of the United States, which is the  only question that needs to be answered, is, Was Donald Trump  responsible for inciting the violence that came to this building on  January 6?   Now, by any measure, President Trump is the most pro-police, anti-mob  rule President this country has ever seen. His real supporters know  this. He made it clear throughout his Presidency. He made it clear  during the violence this past summer. He made it clear on January 6.  But politics changes things. Politics has created and interposed an  element that should  [[Page S679]]  not be here. It has interposed the element of hatred. And the political  world changes when hatred becomes part of the dynamic.   As we wrote in our answer to the original charging document--and I  hope that this is a phrase that lives on long after we are all departed  and I hope someday this becomes the mantra by which all of us operate  who work for the benefit of the public--that political hatred has no  place in the American justice system and most certainly no place in the  Congress of the United States.   To illustrate the contrast that I am speaking of, we have a video.   (Text of video presentations.)         President TRUMP. I am your President of law and order and       an ally of all peaceful protesters.        Vice President BIDEN. The vast majority of the protests       have been peaceful.        President TRUMP. Republicans stand for law and order, and       we stand for justice.         I want to tell you, Gorsuch, I want to tell       you, Kavanaugh: You have released the whirlwind, and you will       pay the price.        President TRUMP. If we want law and order, we have to have       law and order.        Mr. Cuomo. Show me where it says that protesters are       supposed to be polite and peaceful.        President TRUMP. We believe in safe streets, secure       communities, and we believe in law and order.    Is there truly anyone in this Chamber who disagrees with the words as  spoken by President Trump on that video? Surely not. Surely not.   This contrast and in this context, I ask you to keep that in mind. My  colleagues here--actually, my colleague here, Mr. Raskin, hopes that  you don't. They have used selective editing and manipulated visuals to  paint a picture far different from this truth.   Make no mistake, and I will repeat it now and anytime I am ever  asked, January 6 was a terrible day for our country. The attack on this  building shocked us all. President Trump did not incite or cause the  horrific violence that occurred on January 6, 2021. They know that. We  know the President did not incite the riot because of his plain words  that day, as Mr. van der Veen elucidated on a few moments ago. We know  the President could not have incited the riots because of the timeline  of the events of that day.   We heard a great deal from the House managers about their  prosecutorial bona fides and their ability to analyze evidence, apply  it to statutes, use timelines, and figure out what happened based on  circumstantial evidence and direct evidence and testimony and forensic  analysis. I can't recall any of the House managers who got up that  didn't make some reference to prosecutorial bona fides. Well, I spent  more than three decades locking up killers. And I do know a little bit  about applying facts to the law.    We know that the President would never have wanted such a riot to  occur because his longstanding hatred for violent protesters and his  love for law and order is on display, worn on his sleeve every single  day that he served in the White House. But if we are going to apply the  facts to the statute, it has to be done systematically. It has to be  done with precision, the way a court would expect us to do that.   Let's look at the letter of the law. Again, Mr. van der Veen gave you  an overview of the Brandenburg case and some of the related cases. You  notice that when Mr. Van der Veen listed the elements that he took  verbatim or close to verbatim right out of Brandenburg, they bore no  reference whatsoever to the elements that flashed up by the Democratic  managers the other day repeatedly. He actually used the Supreme Court's  case. He didn't make it up.   Let's look at the letter of the law. The Supreme Court of the United  States, over 50 years ago, laid out a clear test to determine whether  speech is incitement. Under that test, the Brandenburg v. Ohio test,  there are three elements that must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt,  by a preponderance of the evidence--whatever the Senate considers--I  suggest beyond a reasonable doubt.   First, the speech in question must explicitly or implicitly encourage  the use of violence or lawless action. But here the President's speech  called for peaceful protests.   Second, the speaker must intend that his speech will result in the  use of violence or lawless action. And, again, as Mr. van der Veen  pointed out, the President clearly deplores rioters and political  violence and did so throughout his term as President and never  hesitated to express his admiration for the men and women that protect  this country.   Finally, the third element under the Brandenburg test is the imminent  use of violence--imminent use of violence--in other words, right then.  The imminent use of violence or lawless action must be the likely  result of the speech--the likely result of the speech. Well, that  argument is completely eviscerated by the fact that the violence was  preplanned, as confirmed by the FBI, Department of Justice, and even  the House managers--not the result of the speech at all.   Several of my colleagues of the House managers got up and spoke about  the proceeding in the House being like a grand jury proceeding. Well, I  have been in grand jury proceedings. I have run grand juries. In grand  jury proceedings, you call witnesses; you hear evidence; you make  transcripts; you take affidavits; you develop physical evidence; you  hear reports from police officers; you hear forensic analysis from  scientists; in fact, you invite the target of the grand jury to come in  and testify if he or she pleases to be heard by the grand jury.   Which one of those things happened in the House prior to the  Impeachment Article? I don't believe any of them happened. So the  suggestion that what happened in the House was anything at all like a  grand jury investigating a case and referring it for prosecution is  complete nonsense. And if the House managers are trying to fool you  about that, you must ask yourself: What else are they trying to fool  you about?   Let's look more closely at the President's speech. We have mentioned  this lie before, but it is so critical, we need to talk about it again.  The President asked that the attendees at his rally peacefully make  their voices heard.   (Text of video presentation.)         President TRUMP. I know that everyone here will soon be       marching over to the Capitol Building to peacefully and       patriotically make your voices heard.    The managers would have you believe that the President's supporters  usually follow his every word but, in this case, imputing some  imaginary meaning to them while ignoring his most clear instructions.  President Trump said ``peacefully and patriotically make your voices  heard.'' And the House managers took from that ``go down to the Capitol  and riot.'' So you are supposed to put yourselves in the heads of the  people who hear ``peacefully and patriotically make your voices heard''  and conclude that those words do not mean what the President said.   More than that, the President criticized the destruction wrought by  leftwing anarchists and rioters. He told his supporters that they  build; they don't destroy.   (Text of video presentation.)         President TRUMP. If this happened to the Democrats, there'd       be hell all over the country going on. There'd be hell all       over the country. But just remember this: You're stronger.       You're smarter. You've got more going than anybody. And they       try and demean everybody having to do with us. And you're the       real people. You're the people that built this Nation. You're       not the people that tore down our Nation.    Is it possible, listening to those words in the proper cadence  without them being edited or the sound changed so that they are  indistinguishable or sounds as though the crowd is right there, but  listening to it here as you have here, unedited by us--is it  [[Page S680]]  possible that President Trump's disdain for political violence could be  any clearer to the persons listening as he was speaking?   Is it possible his words could have been misunderstood?   I suggest to you that is the possibility.   Now, the House managers said the President told the crowd: ``You have  to get [out] your people to fight.'' The House managers' claim is that  the President of the United States was telling the audience to get each  other to physically fight, but that is not what the President said.   The people who should fight, he said, were Members of Congress. If  they don't fight, what the President said is, what should the rally  attendees do? If Member of Congress wouldn't fight for the principles  they held dear, what was it that the President specifically told his  supporters at that rally he wanted them to do? He wanted them to  support primary challenges.    Now, nobody in this Chamber is anxious to have a primary challenge.  That is one truism I think I can say with some certainty. But that is  the way we operate in this country. When the people of a State want to  change their Representatives and their Senators, they use the electoral  process. President Trump told his listeners that if their Members of  Congress won't fight for their views, then go back home and find others  that will. That is what President Trump said--the people who should  fight were the Members of Congress.   (Text of video presentations.)         Mr. Manager NEGUSE. ``You have to get your people to       fight,'' he told them.        President TRUMP. You have to get your people to fight. And       if they don't fight, we have to primary the hell out of the       ones that don't fight. You primary them. We're going to let       you know who they are. I can already tell you, frankly.    It is pretty stark contrast when you watch that video, isn't it? When  you see the House manager tell you--and I don't know if we're under  oath here, but when I walked into this room, I sure as heck felt as if  I was under oath and felt like I was speaking not only to Senators of  the United States but before the entire world and with God watching.   And a House manager got up here and told you that the President of  the United States, on January 6, 2021, told the crowd that they had to  go and fight. And the implication that they wanted you to draw was that  he was sending them down to Capitol Hill to go and breach the building  and trash the very sacred Halls of Congress.   But we now know that is not at all anything near what the President  said. What the President said was: If you can't get your Members of  Congress to do as you would like them to do, you primary them. That is  the American way.   The first way that the House managers presented and wanted you to  conclude, that is the criminal way. But what the President said was the  American way.   Again, the House managers manipulated President Trump's words. I  can't stand here and pretend to tell you that I know every time from  all those videos that the House managers manipulated what the President  said, put up evidence that was not with the foundation of correctness  and admissibility we expect. I can't tell you that I picked up every  one. I don't think Mr. van der Veen or Mr. Schoen or any of the others  who worked with us can tell you that.   But what I can tell you is there were an awful lot of times. And I  know at least some of you were judges in previous lives. If one of the  lawyers was able to create the impression that one side intentionally  presented false or misleading evidence, that judge would give an  instruction called falsus in uno, falsus in omnibus: False in one  thing, false in everything. In other words, if they are trying to fool  you about one thing, not only might they be trying to fool you in  something else, but under that maxim of the law, you may conclude they  are trying to fool you in everything else.   President Trump was immediate in his calls for calm and respect for  law enforcement. The House managers emphasized President Trump's tweet  in the 6 p.m. hour where he told the crowds:         Go home with love & in peace. Remember this day.    What is it they left out? Well, the House starts their recitation of  what President Trump said as far as the aftermath of when the Capitol  was breached at roughly 6 p.m. What they don't tell you and didn't tell  you--and which you probably don't know because I think I am the first  one to say it in this forum--is at 2:38, President Trump urged  protesters at the U.S. Capitol to stay peaceful:         Please support our Capitol Police and Law Enforcement. They       are truly on the side of our Country. Stay peaceful!    Before we run the graphic, I just want to point out to you, President  Trump's speech ended at 1:11 p.m. So at 2:38 p.m., by the time word  reaches the President that there is a problem down here, he is out  urging people to support the police, stay peaceful, support our Capitol  Police and law enforcement. They are on the side of the country. Stay  peaceful.   At 3:13 p.m., President Trump urged protesters at the U.S. Capitol to  remain peaceful:         No violence. Remember, WE are the Party of Law and Order.       Respect the law and our great men and women in blue.    3:13 p.m.   President Trump's words couldn't have incited the riot at the  Capitol. The day's events make this clear. Let's walk through the  actual timeline.   At 11:15 a.m. police security camera videos show crowds forming at  First Street, near the Capitol Reflecting Pool. This is a full 45  minutes before President Trump even took the stage on January 6. Let me  repeat that. Violent criminals were assembling at the Capitol, over a  mile away, almost an hour before the President uttered a single word on  the Ellipse. You did not hear that fact during the hours and hours of  the House managers' presentation, did you?   When the President spoke, what did he call for? He called for rally  attendees to peacefully and patriotically make their voices heard, for  them to walk down Pennsylvania Avenue to cheer on Members of Congress.   President Trump went on for more than an hour, ending at 1:11. Now,  why is this important? Because of all of the events that I am about to  describe, they all occurred before--before--President Trump's remarks  concluded.   At 12:49 p.m., the first barriers at the U.S. Capitol Grounds were  pushed over, and the crowd entered the restricted area.   At 1:05 p.m., Acting Defense Secretary Christopher Miller received  open source reports of demonstrator movements to the U.S. Capitol.   At 1:09 p.m., U.S. Capitol Police Chief Steven Sund called the House  and Senate Sergeant at Arms, telling them he wanted an emergency  declared, and he wanted the National Guard called.   The point: Given the timeline of events, the criminals at the Capitol  were not there at the Ellipse to even hear the President's words. They  were more than a mile away, engaged in their preplanned assault on this  very building. This was a preplanned assault--make no mistake--and that  is a critical fact.   Watch this.   (Text of video presentation of 2-10-2021.)         Mr. Manager CICILLINE. Does anyone in this Chamber honestly       believe that but for the conduct of President Trump that that       charge in the Article of Impeachment, that that attack on the       Capitol would have occurred? Does anybody believe that?    (Text of video presentations.)         Mr. Blitzer. It was not some sort of spontaneous decision       by a bunch of ``protesters'' to go up to Capitol Hill and       storm Capitol Hill. This was all planned out.        Mr. Tapper. How much of it was planned? How much of this       was strategized ahead of time?        Mr. Perez. They are getting indications, some evidence that       indicates that there was some level of planning.        Ms. Quijano. There appears to be premeditation.        Mr. Muir. An FBI internal report the day before the siege,       warning of a violent war at the Capitol.        Ms. Quijano. The FBI issued a warning of a ``war'' at the       Capitol.        Mr. Colbert. The FBI warned law enforcement agencies about       this specific attack.    (Text of audio presentation.)         Be ready to fight. Congress needs to hear glass breaking,       doors being kicked in.    (Text of video presentations.)         Mr. D'Antuono. We developed some intelligence that a number       of individuals were planning to travel to the DC area with       intentions to cause violence. We immediately shared that       information.  [[Page S681]]         Ms. Herridge. And they pushed out that information through       this JTTF structure.        Mr. D'Antuono. It was immediately disseminated through a       written product and briefed to our command post operation to       all levels of law enforcement.        Unidentified Speaker. The FBI says two pipe bombs       discovered near the Capitol on January 6 were placed there       the night before.        Unidentified Speaker. New video appears to show a person       suspected of planting pipe bombs near the U.S. Capitol the       night before.        Unidentified Speaker. The FBI now says the bombs were       planted the night before the Capitol siege, between 7:30 and       8:30 p.m.        Mr. Muir. They were planted the day before.        Ms. Herridge. It all goes to the idea of premeditation and       coordination among individuals.        Mr. Comey. This was a planned assault of people going after       a castle.    Mr. Counsel CASTOR. So, to answer the question of the House manager,  ``Does anybody believe that this would have occurred but for the speech  of Donald Trump?'' I do.   All of these facts make clear that the January 6 speech did not cause  the riots. The President did not cause the riots. He neither explicitly  nor implicitly encouraged the use of violence or lawless action but, in  fact, called for the peaceful exercise of every American's First  Amendment right to peacefully assemble and petition their government  for redress of grievances. In other words, the Brandenburg standard is  not made out.   The House managers admitted many facts are unknown. Even Speaker  Pelosi admitted not knowing the real cause of the violence when she  called for a 9/11-style Commission to examine the facts and causes that  led to the violence.   (Text of audio presentation.)   On the screen is Speaker Pelosi's call for the 9/11 Commission.   Let's touch now on the second absurd and conflated allegation in the  House managers' single Article.   President Trump's phone call to Georgia Secretary of State Brad  Raffensperger--surreptitiously recorded, by the way--included multiple  attorneys and others on the call. Let me point out the very obvious  fact that the House managers ignored. The private call that was made  public by others cannot really be the basis to claim that the President  intended to incite a riot, because he did not publicly disclose the  contents of the call.   How could he have hoped to use this call to invite his followers if  he had no intent to make the conversation public and, indeed, had  nothing to do with its being secretly recorded?   The House managers told you that the President demanded that the  Georgia secretary of state ``find'' just over 11,000 votes. The word  ``find,'' like so many others the House managers highlighted, is taken  completely out of context. The word ``find'' did not come out of thin  air. Based on an analysis of publicly available voter data that the  ballot rejection rate in Georgia in 2016 was approximately 6.42 percent  and even though a tremendous amount of new, first-time mail-in ballots  were included in the 2020 count, the Georgia rejection rate in 2020 was  a mere four-tenths of 1 percent--a drop-off from 6.42 percent to .4  percent.   President Trump wanted the signature verification to be done in  public. How ca a request for signature verifications to be done in  public be a basis for a charge for inciting a riot?    With that background, it is clear that President Trump's comments and  the use of the word ``find'' were solely related to his concerns with  the inexplicable dramatic drop in Georgia's ballot rejection rates.   Let's examine how the word ``find'' was used throughout that  conversation.   Mr. Trump's first use of the word ``find'' was as follows:         We think that, if you check the signatures, a real check of       the signatures going back in Fulton County, you will find at       least a couple hundred thousand of forged signatures of       people who have been forged, and we are quite sure that's       going to happen.    President Trump also used ``find'' as follows:         Now, why aren't we doing signature, and why can't it be       open to the public, and why can't we have professionals do it       instead of rank amateurs who will never find anything and       don't want to find anything? They don't want to find--you       know, they don't want to find anything. Someday, you'll tell       me the reason why, because I don't understand your reasoning,       but, someday, you'll tell me the reason why, but why don't       you want to find?    President Trump echoed his previous sentiments again in the context  of pursuing a legitimate and robust investigation into the lack of  signature verification for mail-in and absentee ballots.         And why can't we have professionals do it instead of rank       amateurs who will never find anything and don't want to find       anything? They don't want to find anything. You know, they       don't want to find anything. They don't want to find--you       know, they don't want to find anything. Someday, you'll tell       me why, because I don't understand your reasoning, but,       someday, you'll tell me why, but why don't you want to find?        We can go through signature verification, and we'll find       hundreds of thousands of signatures, and you could let us do       it, and the only way you can do it, as you know, is to go to       the past, but you didn't do that in Cobb County. You just       looked at one page compared to another. The only way you       could do a signature verification is to go from one that's       signed on November ``whatever,'' recently, and compare it to       2 years ago, 4 years ago, 6 years ago, you know, or even 1,       and you'll find that you have many different signatures, but       in Fulton, where they dumped ballots, you will find that you       have many that aren't even signed and that you have many       forgeries.    Mr. Trump continued to use the word ``find'' throughout the  conversation, each and every other time in the context of his request  that Mr. Raffensperger undertake a review of signature verifications  and his concerns, generally, with ballot integrity and his reported  electoral deficit. Here are a few examples.         But why wouldn't you want to find the right answer, Brad?       Instead of keep saying that the numbers are right, because       those numbers are so wrong.    Another example:         We think that, if you check the signatures--a real check of       the signatures--going back in Fulton County, you will find at       least a couple hundred thousand of forged signatures of       people who have been forged, and we are quite sure that's       going to happen.    Moreover, there was nothing untoward with President Trump or any  other candidate, for that matter, speaking with the lead elections  officer of the State. That is why the Georgia secretary of state took a  call, along with members of his team, one of whom decided to record it  and release it to the press. The only reason this conversation is being  discussed in this Chamber is because, once again, the media and their  Democratic allies distorted the true conversation to mislead you and  the American public. So we have a complete lack of evidence to the  Article of Impeachment presented by the House managers.   So why are we here?   Politics. Their goal is to eliminate a political opponent, to  substitute their judgment for the will of the voters.   (Text of video presentations.)         Mr. Capehart. Why bother with a Senate trial of Donald       Trump? He's no longer President.        Mr. Pelley. He will be out of office anyway.        Ms. Wallace. Is it to keep him from ever running again?         To remove him from ever running for office       again.         Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that we take a  15-minute recess.   There being no objection, at 3:16 p.m., the Senate, sitting as a  Court of Impeachment, recessed until 3:54 p.m.; whereupon the Senate  reassembled when called to order by the President pro tempore.                             Senators' Questions    The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senate will come to order.   Pursuant to the provisions of S. Res. 47, the Senate has provided 4  hours during which Senators may submit questions in writing directed  either through the managers on the part of the House of Representatives  or counsel for the former President.   The majority leader.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the answers  within the 4-hour question period be limited to 5 minutes each, and if  the questions are directed to both parties, the times be equally  divided; furthermore, that questions alternate sides proposing  questions for as long as both sides have questions.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.    Mr. President, I send a question to the desk.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator will submit it.   The question from Senator Schumer with Senator Feinstein is directed  to the House managers.   The clerk will read it.   The legislative clerk read the question as follows:         Isn't it the case that the violent attack and siege on the       Capitol on January 6 would not have happened if not for the       conduct of President Trump?    The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The House managers have up to 5 minutes.   Mr. Manager CASTRO of Texas. Good afternoon, everybody. To answer  your question very directly, Donald Trump assembled the mob. He  assembled the mob, and he lit the flame. Everything that followed was  because of his doing, and although he could have immediately and  forcibly intervened to stop the violence, he never did. In other words,  this violent, bloody insurrection that occurred on January 6 would not  have occurred but for President Trump.   The evidence we presented in trial makes this absolutely clear. This  attack, as we said, didn't come from one random speech, and it didn't  happen by accident, and that mob didn't come out of thin air.   Before the election, Donald Trump spread lie after lie about  potential fraud--an election, remember, that hadn't even happened yet.  Months before the election took place, he was saying it was rigged and  that it was going to be stolen. All of his supporters believed that the  only way he was going to lose is if the election was stolen, if the  election was rigged.   And when he did lose, he spent week after week inciting his  supporters to believe that their votes had been stolen and that the  election was fraudulent and it was their patriotic duty to fight like  hell to stop the steal and take their country back.   And, remember, this is in the United States, where our vote is our  voice. You tell somebody that an election victory is being stolen from  them, that is a combustible situation.   And he gave them clear direction on how to deal with that.   For example, on December 19, 18 days prior to January 6, President  Trump told them how and where to fight for it. He first issued his call  to action for January 6. This was a ``save the date'' sent 18 days  before the event on January 6, and it wasn't just a casual one-off  reference or a singular invitation.   For the next 18 days, he directed all of the rage he had incited to  January 6; and that was, for him, what he saw as his last chance to  stop the transfer of power, to stop from losing the Presidency. And he  said things like, ``Fight to the death'' and January 6 will be a  ``wild'' and ``historic day.'' And this was working. They got the  message.   In the days leading to the attack, report after report, social media  post after social media post, confirmed that these insurgents were  planning armed violence, but they were planning it because he had been  priming them, because he had been amping them up. That is why they were  planning it.   And these posts, confirmed by reports from the FBI and Capitol  Police, made clear that these insurgents were planning to carry  weapons, including guns, to target the Capitol itself. And yet Donald  Trump, from January 5 to the morning of his speech, tweeted 34 times,  urging his supporters to get ready to stop the steal.   He even, on the eve of the attack, warned us that it was coming. He  warned us that thousands were descending into DC and would not take it  anymore.   When they got here at the Save America March, he told them again in  that speech exactly what to do. His lawyer opened with:         Let's have trial by combat.    That was Rudy Giuliani. And Donald Trump brought that message home.  In fact, he praised Rudy Giuliani as a fighter, and President Trump  used the words ``fight'' or ``fighting'' 20 times in that speech.   Remember, you have just told these people--these thousands of  people--that somebody has stolen your election, your victory; you are  not going to get the President that you love.   Senators, that is an incredibly combustible situation when people are  armed and they have been saying that they are mad as hell and they are  not going to take it anymore.   He looked out to a sea of thousands, some wearing body armor,  helmets, holding sticks and flag poles, some of which they would later  use to beat Capitol Police; and he told them that they could play by  different rules--play by different rules. He even, at one point, quite  literally, pointed to the Capitol as he told them to ``fight like  hell.''   After the attack, you know, we have shown clearly, well, that once  the attack began, insurgent after insurgent made clear they were  following the President's orders. You saw us present that evidence of  the insurgents who were there that day who said: I came because the  President asked me to come. I was here at his invitation. You saw that  of the folks that were in the Capitol that day.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The time has expired.   Are there further questions?    Mr. President, it is my understanding that there are no  further questions on either side.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican leader.    I ask unanimous consent that the time for questions and  answers be considered expired.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.    Now, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that it be  in order for myself and Senator McConnell to speak for up to 1 minute  each and then it be in order for me to make a unanimous consent request  as if in legislative session.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.                            ____________________     Mr. President, in a moment I will ask the Senate to pass  legislation that would award Capitol Police Officer Eugene Goodman the  Congressional Gold Medal.   In the weeks after the attack on January 6, the world learned about  the incredible, incredible bravery of Officer Goodman on that fateful  day.   Here in this trial, we saw new video, powerful video showing calmness  under pressure, his courage in the line of duty, his foresight in the  midst of chaos, and his willingness to make himself a target of the  mob's rage so that others might reach safety.   Officer Goodman is in the Chamber tonight.   Officer Goodman, thank you.   (Applause, Senators rising.)   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican leader.    Leader McConnell.    I just want to say I think we can all agree that Eugene  Goodman deserves the highest honor Congress can bestow. But before we  move to pass this legislation, I want to be clear that he was not alone  that day. The Nation saw and has now seen numerous examples of the  heroic conduct of the Capitol Police, the Metropolitan Police, and the  SWAT teams that were with us on January 6 here in the Capitol,  protecting us. Our heartfelt gratitude extends to each and every one of  them, particularly now as members of the force continue to bear scars,  seen and unseen, from the events of that disgraceful day. Let us give  them all the honor and recognition they so justly deserve.   (Applause, Senators rising.)   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican leader.    Mr. President, as if in legislative session, I ask  unanimous consent that the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban  Affairs be discharged from further consideration of S. 35 and that the  Senate proceed to its immediate consideration.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.   The clerk will report the bill by title.   The legislative clerk read as follows:         A bill (S. 35) to award a Congressional Gold Medal to       Officer Eugene Goodman.    There being no objection, the committee was discharged and the Senate  proceeded to consider the bill.    I ask unanimous consent that the Van Hollen substitute  amendment which is at the desk be considered and agreed to; that the  bill, as amended, be considered read a third time and passed; and that  the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.   The amendment (No. 890) in the nature of a substitute was agreed to,  as follows                  [Purpose: In the nature of a substitute]          Strike all after the enacting clause and insert the       following:       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Officer Eugene Goodman       Congressional Gold Medal Act''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         The Congress finds the following:        (1) On January 6, 2021, the United States Capitol Building       was attacked by armed insurrectionists.        (2) Members of the United States Capitol Police force were       overrun and insurrectionists breached the Capitol at multiple       points.        (3) Around 2:14 in the afternoon, United States Capitol       Police Officer Eugene Goodman confronted an angry group of       insurrectionists who unlawfully entered the Capitol,       according to video footage taken by Igor Bobic, a reporter       with the Huffington Post.        (4) Officer Goodman, alone, delayed the mob's advance       towards the United States Senate Chamber and alerted his       fellow officers to the location of the insurrectionists.        (5) Upon reaching a second floor corridor, Officer Goodman       noticed the entrance to the Senate Chamber was unguarded.  [[Page S695]]         (6) As the mob approached, Officer Goodman intentionally       diverted attention away from the Senate entrance and led the       mob to an alternate location and additional awaiting       officers.        (7) At 2:15 in the afternoon, a Washington Post reporter       from inside the Senate Chamber noted ``Senate sealed'' with       Senators, staff, and members of the press inside.        (8) Officer Eugene Goodman's selfless and quick-thinking       actions doubtlessly saved lives and bought security personnel       precious time to secure and ultimately evacuate the Senate       before the armed mob breached the Chamber.        (9) Amidst a shocking, unpatriotic attack on the Capitol,       Officer Goodman's heroism is recognized not only by Members       of Congress and staff but also by the people of the United       States they represent.        (10) By putting his own life on the line and successfully,       single-handedly leading insurrectionists away from the floor       of the Senate Chamber, Officer Eugene Goodman performed his       duty to protect the Congress with distinction, and by his       actions, Officer Goodman left an indelible mark on American       history.        (11) Officer Goodman's actions exemplify the heroism of the       many men and women who risked their lives to defend the       Capitol on January 6, 2021.       SEC. 3. CONGRESSIONAL GOLD MEDAL.         (a) Presentation Authorized.--The Speaker of the House of       Representatives and the President pro tempore of the Senate       shall make appropriate arrangements for the presentation, on       behalf of the Congress, of a gold medal of appropriate design       to Officer Eugene Goodman.        (b) Design and Striking.--        (1) In general.--For the purposes of the presentation       referred to in subsection (a), the Secretary of the Treasury       (referred to in this Act as the ``Secretary'') shall strike       the gold medal with suitable emblems, devices, and       inscriptions, to be determined by the Secretary.        (2) Image and name.--The design shall bear an image of, and       inscription of the name of, Officer Eugene Goodman.       SEC. 4. DUPLICATE MEDALS.         The Secretary may strike and sell duplicates in bronze of       the gold medal struck pursuant to section 3 under such       regulations as the Secretary may prescribe, at a price       sufficient to cover the cost thereof, including labor,       materials, dies, use of machinery, and overhead expenses.       SEC. 5. STATUS OF MEDALS.         (a) National Medals.--The medals struck pursuant to this       Act are national medals for purposes of chapter 51 of title       31, United States Code.        (b) Numismatic Items.--For purposes of section 5134 of       title 31, United States Code, all medals struck under this       Act shall be considered to be numismatic items.    The bill (S. 35), as amended, was ordered to be engrossed for a third  reading, was read the third time, and passed.   (The bill, as amended, will be printed in a future edition of the  Record.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the trial  adjourn until 10 a.m. tomorrow, Saturday, February 13, and that this  also constitute the adjournment of the Senate.   There being no objection, at 6:29 p.m., the Senate, sitting as a  Court of Impeachment, adjourned until Saturday, February 13, 2021, at  10 a.m.
