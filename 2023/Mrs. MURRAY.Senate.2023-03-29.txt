 Madam President, I rise today to recognize the life and  legacy of disability rights activist, Judy Heumann. Today, I join so  many touched by her advocacy in mourning her passing, remembering her  life, and paying tribute to the contributions she made to the  disability community.   Judy's activism began early in life. As a young child who contracted  polio and used a wheelchair, she was denied the right to attend school  in New York. Later in life, Judy was denied a teaching license after  failing her medical exam due to ``paralysis of both lower  [[Page S1045]]  extremities.'' She sued the Board of Education and went on to be the  first teacher in New York State to use a wheelchair.   Judy served in various capacities throughout multiple Presidential  administrations and was instrumental in the passage of groundbreaking  legislation including the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act,  the Americans with Disabilities Act, and the Rehabilitation Act. She  was the recipient of the Henry B. Betts Award, the Max Starkloff  Lifetime Achievement Award, and was featured in numerous documentaries.   I had the honor of working with Judy throughout my time as ranking  member and chair of the HELP Committee and seeing firsthand how  committed she was to making our world more welcoming and accessible to  everyone. Her tenacity was an inspiration to me, and I am grateful that  I had the chance to learn from her and work alongside her to make this  country more inclusive for all. Her work has improved the lives of so  many across our country. She will be remembered fondly.                            ____________________
