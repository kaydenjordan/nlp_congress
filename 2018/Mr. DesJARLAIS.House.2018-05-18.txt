 Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of the  amendment of Mr. Hollingsworth of Indiana on this issue.   In short, the amendment would allow the Secretary of the Interior to  issue depredation permits to livestock farmers authorizing the taking  of black vultures. This is an issue that has been brought to my  attention by farmers across the entire Southeast, as well, who have all  witnessed black vultures prey on and kill their livestock.  Unfortunately, because black vultures are protected under the Migratory  Bird Treaty Act, farmers are left with little or no recourse of action.   After years of frustration, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service began  issuing depredation permits as part of a pilot program to try to  address this shortage. While this has worked well in my State, it is  clear that our farmers and ranchers need a more permanent fix to this  ongoing problem.   Black vulture attacks on various livestock have already led to  significant economic losses for many, and I encourage my colleagues to  vote ``yes'' on this commonsense amendment.
