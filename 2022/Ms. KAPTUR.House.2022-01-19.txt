 Madam Speaker, I rise today to thank President Joe Biden  and the majority here with some of our Republican friends who passed  the bipartisan infrastructure legislation not long ago.   The Biden administration just announced this morning three-quarters  of a billion dollars of investment in the Great Lakes region--an  awesome amount--to take care of projects that had been sitting on the  shelf for over a quarter century, for the modernization of the Soo  Locks. We could not conduct war without those locks being operational.  And they have sat around with no investment.   God bless Joe Biden for his patriotism to this country, and also for  what is going to happen at Brandon Road Lock, south of Chicago, with  the barrier that will be built so the Asian carp don't get into the  entire Great Lakes and eat up all of our native species.   Three-quarters of a billion dollars in the Great Lakes today; what a  phenomenal intergenerational announcement.   Madam Speaker, I thank all the Members who supported that important  legislation, and I thank Joe Biden, the President of the United States.                            ____________________
