 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge my colleagues to own  up to their bad bill. It is clear this is not what the American people  deserve or what the American people are asking for.   This legislation guts Medicaid. It steals from Medicare. It crushes  our seniors and our working families. And  [[Page H2423]]  just when you thought it couldn't get worse, they went after veterans  and their children.   What's more, this bill means insurance companies won't cover new  mothers, newborn babies, and prescription drugs. The Republicans are  making health care for Americans worse and worse and worse.   The Republicans have secretly wheeled and dealed in back rooms at the  expense of millions of Americans in our great country, while giving tax  breaks to millionaires and billionaires.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to own up to this bill and oppose  it for the sake of the American people.   God bless us.
