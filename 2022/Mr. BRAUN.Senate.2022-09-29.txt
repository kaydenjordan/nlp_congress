 I ask unanimous consent that I, Senator Leahy, and Senator  Schumer be permitted to complete our remarks prior to the scheduled  vote.    Mr. President, I call up my amendment No. 5765 and ask  that it be reported by number.    Mr. President, my home State of Indiana is America's  heartland. I have traveled to every county, listened to businesses,  schools, churches. I think that is where we need to get our cue in  terms of what needs to be done. Farmers, as well, are in the middle of  something they never faced before--probably the toughest job and  business out there. It has never been tougher.   The American people are strong and resilient, but they are  represented by a government here that is not necessarily the same.  Sometimes they get scoffed at, but they live within their household  budgets. State and local governments have guardrails. But, naturally,  they do it anyway because they know you can't borrow money from future  generations and spend it today--bad business plan.   For this reason, I think the U.S. Congress is broken because we have  kept shoving this issue down the road. We haven't done a budget that we  adhered to in nearly 20 years. The last time we did it, we were most  ingenious about how to unravel it--roughly 10 years ago.   When they look at our capital, they see a twisted knot of lobbyists,  corporate interests, and a mountain of debt that just gets higher and  higher.   We now spend over a trillion dollars more each year than we take in,  and, recently, that has gone up to $1.5 trillion. To normalize that  just does not make sense. We are here twiddling our thumbs while our  kids' and grandkids' future goes up in smoke. Every American family is  paying for our failures here.   Congress, as a whole, and particularly this body, seem to have no  interest in turning this big ship away from the rocks. In the past  year, I have brought to the floor four chances to do something. I  offered a complete Federal budget that would match our spending and our  revenues that are historical in nature. Only 34 Senators voted for it.  It would have preserved Social Security, Medicare, and defense, just  bringing it in line with what is sustainable.   I offered an amendment that if we fail to get our budget and  appropriations bills done on time, by the deadline, which is like in a  few days for this year, we don't get paid until we do so. Forty-seven  Senators voted for it--close, but still not there.   I offered an amendment to cut pet projects through earmarks from our  huge spending bill. It only got 35 votes. And we were doing that for  almost 10 years, and now we have actually backslid into that bad  behavior.   I offered an amendment to require a balanced budget, like so many  States have--they live in fiscal sanity--47 votes, short again.   The Framers of our Constitution saw this coming. They had to raise  revenue, especially back then, to do whatever they wanted to do. There  were also checks and balances.   Congress isn't just balanced by the Supreme Court and the President,  but also by the States. Article V of our Constitution gives the States  the power to pick up the slack when Congress refuses to act, where it  doesn't exercise discipline, good behavior, what all of us expect.   I believe the House and the Senate desperately need two things: term  limits--the Founders never imagined people would come here and like  that better than what they did before. Washington and Jefferson hurried  back to their farms and their businesses. That is not the case anymore.   If we keep doing it the way we are, we are going to get increasingly,  increasingly deeper in the hole. With term limits, we get a class of  political entrepreneurs here who have actually done something in the  real world, before they think they can run the biggest business in the  world and deliver such poor results.   If two-thirds of the States petition to call a constitutional  convention, we could take power away from the DC establishment and put  it back in the hands of the American people. You are not going to  believe how close that has come and how close it is currently. But the  swamp, I think, knows it. That is why each time the right number of  petitions have been filed, Congress refused to call the convention.   The last time was as recently as last year. Today, 32 States have  active applications for the convention. We need 34. It was actually at  the level or above until a few States rescinded that.   This plan is extremely popular because it makes sense. It puts  political will and backbone into this place that we don't normally  have. And a recent poll by Trafalgar found that 65 percent of likely  voters agree with that. If you take either term limits or balanced  budgets by themselves, it gets up close to 85 or 90 percent, and, in  this poll, 81 percent of Republicans, 63 percent of Independents--who I  think elect the swing State Senators and the President; so we ought to  be really paying attention to them--and 50 percent of Democrats.   There is no Federal Government body managing this process. It is too  easy for Congress to ignore what the States have done.   My amendment would be very, very simple. It would direct the  Archivist, who has all of these petitions somewhere in a drawer, to  publish them as they come in so all of us can see what the people are  thinking.   We have conveniently just overlooked it or ignored it. It adds what  we should all be for: transparency, having people be able to see what  is going on here, and especially for something like this.   America is the most powerful country in history because we are  founded on the rock of the Constitution. So simple and direct, it can  all be right in here. We need to pay more attention to it.   The Framers were also wise to have a tool for the people and the  States when Congress refuses to act on things so critical. Considering  how broken and dysfunctional this place is currently and the dire  threats we face from our debt and inflation crisis, you would think  now, more than any other time in our country's history, that this would  be at the forefront and we would at least give it to the States to  weigh in and not hide it in a drawer somewhere.    When each one of us swore in as Senator, we didn't swear our  allegiance to our political party. We did it to the Constitution. We  didn't promise to support the Washington establishment. We did it to  the people, to the Constitution.   It is in support of the American people and in defense of the  Constitution that I come here to the floor today. It is not going to be  litigated on the floor today, but I can tell you, for the time that I  am here, I am not going to let the American public forget it.   And we have another critical date in the middle of December, 2\1/2\  months away, and I think that will be a place where it will even be  more important, and I am going to try to make the case in the meantime  that we at least don't keep in a drawer, hidden away somewhere, what  the American people want.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the 200th  anniversary of the founding of Montgomery County, IN, and the unique  contributions that the Montgomery County community has made to the  United States.   This December, Montgomery County celebrates the bicentennial of its  foundation. Montgomery County is a place one could characterize as  quintessentially ``Indiana:'' the mellow bends of Sugar Creek crossed  with covered bridges; the buzzing hometown feel of Crawfordsville; and  the ambitious energy of Wabash college--all hallmarks of Indiana that  make my State such a wonderful place to live. Over two centuries, this  county has steadily grown from a handful of log cabins into a historic  community, contributing greatly to American history and culture.   Consider, for instance, Lew Wallace, a highly accomplished citizen  who spent much of his life in Crawfordsville. Wallace left his career  as a lawyer to fight for the Union in the Civil War, rising to the rank  of general. Later, he served as Governor of the territory of New  Mexico. After completing his service to the United States and returning  to Crawfordsville, Wallace published his highly acclaimed and  influential novel, ``Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ.'' It soon became  the best-selling novel of the 19th century and is still adapted for  stage and film today.   Now, I could not commemorate Montgomery Country without mentioning  its important role in the story of Indiana's favorite sport,  basketball. Indeed, according to many historical sources, Montgomery  County served as the launch pad for the sport of basketball in Indiana.  The first Indiana High School Athletic Association basketball  championship was won by Crawfordsville High School in 1911, and the  following eight Indiana high school basketball champions were located  within thirty miles of Montgomery County. Piggy Lambert, one highly  influential basketball coach from Purdue University, played basketball  at Crawfordsville High School and Wabash College. Even scenes from the  legendary movie ``Hoosiers'' were filmed in New Richmond, cementing  Indiana's relationship with basketball in American culture.   Finally, I want to address Wabash College, my alma mater. The time  that I spent at Wabash College impressed upon me the qualities that  make Montgomery County not only special, but representative of Indiana.  Founded in 1832, on what was then our Nation's western frontier, Wabash  College has produced thousands of influential graduates across many  fields. As president of the student body at Wabash College, I had  plenty of experience to prepare me for my careers in business and  public service.   In closing, I am delighted to honor Montgomery County, and I want to  congratulate the communities of Montgomery County for 200 years of  meaningful contributions to American history and culture. Thank  you.                            ____________________
