 Madam President, I come to the floor today to talk about  the unique partnership between the United States and Switzerland. I had  the opportunity earlier this month to meet with President of  Switzerland Guy Parmelin to discuss the U.S.-Switzerland partnership on  apprenticeship and workforce training. Our meeting came on the heels of  a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing considering the nomination  of Scott Miller to be the Ambassador to Switzerland. My questioning of  Mr. Miller covered many topics, to include the recent decision by the  government of Switzerland and Swiss voters to purchase Lockheed Martin  F-35s as their next-generation fighter jet.   In the following weeks, I have received more information on the  benefits of the F-35 and the incredible opportunity this security  cooperation provides for both Switzerland and the United States. In  fact, prior to making a selection, the Swiss Federal Council completed  a comprehensive analysis and determined that the F-35 offered the  highest benefit, at the lowest cost: $2 billion less than the next  lowest bidder.   In making their choice, the Government of Switzerland and Swiss  voters clearly recognized the value of the F-35, as well as the  superior capabilities the F-35 offers. The deal has my enthusiastic  support, and I appreciate our continued partnership with the Swiss  Government and the Swiss people.
