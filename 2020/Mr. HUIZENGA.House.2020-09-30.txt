 Mr. Speaker, I remind Mr. Bilirakis, everyone knows  that Detroit is actually hockey town.   Mr. Speaker, every day, members in law enforcement put on their  uniform not knowing if they are going to come home, these mothers,  fathers, sisters, brothers, sons, and daughters.   In an era of heightened rhetoric, I stand here today to say thank you  to our women and men in uniform.   Recently, we have seen a rise in attacks against police officers  across the country and even in west Michigan.   This month, officers in Muskegon Heights responded to a domestic  disturbance where two people were shot, one of them murdered.   A police chase ensued when a deputy encountered the suspect driving  the wrong way. When the deputy tried to apprehend the suspect while  driving, he was fired upon.   Multiple departments working together were able to use a police  cruiser to disable the suspect's vehicle.   Unbeknownst to the officers, there was also a developmentally  disabled woman in the backseat who was rescued and brought to safety.   This incredible story follows a weekend where 11 shootings took place  in Grand Rapids.   Despite all this, some of my colleagues still think that defunding  the police is a good idea. I am here to tell you it is not. This will  only hurt community policing initiatives for the very communities that  need it the most.   So, Mr. Speaker, I say thank you to the incredible men and women who  [[Page H5063]]  serve in west Michigan. We stand with you and appreciate your  professionalism, your courage, and your dedication to our community.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume,  and I rise today in opposition to H.R. 6270.   Republicans are unwavering in our support to hold China accountable  for the human rights violations that are occurring in the Xinjiang  Uyghur Autonomous Region, or the XUAR.   We agree with each other on the facts on the ground, from the  oppression that the Uyghurs are feeling, to the forced labor camps.   In fact, Mr. Speaker, I would remind my colleagues that we passed  H.R. 6210 last week, literally last week, on a bipartisan basis to  address these human rights violations.   Moreover, to date, the Trump administration has taken significant  action to punish human rights violators in the region, including recent  sanctions and additions to the Commerce Department's Entity List.   On the other hand, this window-dressing bill, put forth by the  Democrats less than a month before the election and a week after we  actually passed legislation, will not hold any bad actors accountable.   Adding additional mandatory disclosures for public companies is not  the appropriate way to curtail human rights atrocities.   Sanctioning is the most effective way to hold these human rights  abusers accountable.   The framework of this bill is deeply flawed. First, the Securities  and Exchange Commission, the SEC, has no foreign policy expertise. The  SEC's three-part mission is to: one, protect investors; two, maintain  fair, orderly, and efficient markets; and third, facilitate capital  formation here in the United States.   The Treasury and State Department handle the sanctions regime.   We should instead be working with both the State Department and  Treasury to hold these bad actors accountable, not the Securities and  Exchange Commission.   I would point out, Mr. Speaker, that we are working with the State  Department and Treasury.   To be clear, this bill would require the SEC to issue rules regarding  American companies, and only American companies, to disclose whether  they or any of their affiliates directly or indirectly engaged with an  entity or an affiliate of an entity to import not only goods from the  XUAR, but also goods containing materials originating or sourced from  the XUAR.   Now, we all have been talking about Disney a lot and a lot of other  places that have had content from, seemingly, this area.   So now let's look at what this would mean for a manufacturer. Let's  look at what this would mean in so many various areas of our economy.   This means that companies would be required to know if its  affiliates, its suppliers, anyone they may have a relationship with,  are ``indirectly engaged with affiliates of certain companies.''   So you may not be doing something directly, but an affiliate or a  partner of yours may be doing something with an affiliate or a partner  of somebody else that may be dealing and doing some business in that  area.   This is a poorly constructed disclosure regime where a public company  would be required to disclose impossible-to-discern information, and it  would be liable for securities fraud, a very powerful word, if it is  impossible to discern information that is not disclosed correctly.    So think about that. They may not know they are breaking the law,  this law, but they would be held accountable for that.   Further, the bill does not contain a sunset clause, and the  disclosure requirement would apply indefinitely even if behavior in the  region has changed.   This bill's framework has proven disastrous.   Section 1502 of the Dodd-Frank Act mandated disclosures relating to  the use of conflict minerals that originated in the DRC, or the  Democratic Republic of Congo, or an adjoining country. There is an  entire Great Lakes region, they call it, in Africa.   The implementation of section 1502 cost billions of dollars--Democrat  estimates put it at over $7 billion--and the provisions led to  devastating job losses, not here in America, but in Africa.   Mr. Speaker, this bill did not go through regular order either, I  might add.   Committee Republicans have not had the opportunity to make  substantive changes or suggestions, let alone examine the bill's likely  harmful consequences.   So, again, just last week, the House passed H.R. 6210, the Uyghur  Forced Labor Prevention Act, to hold China accountable. That is where  the responsibility lies, with China, not U.S. companies or the  Securities and Exchange Commission.                                time  1130    Today, we are only trying to give a vulnerable Member and other  Democrats who feel the need to ``get tough on China all of a sudden'' a  win--sad, in my opinion.   I urge my colleagues to oppose H.R. 6270, as it will limit  opportunities for everyday investors, reduce the number of public  companies, increase compliance costs on businesses, and may harm,  actually, the Uyghurs themselves who this bill is intending to protect.   Let's go after China. Let's not go after the Uyghurs.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Gonzalez).    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to the time remaining.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. Speaker.   Is it appropriate--    Will the gentlewoman yield for a parliamentary inquiry?    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I consume.   Let me just address the point that was just brought up, Mr. Speaker.   There is a sensitivity to that. There has been an injustice in our  history, there is no doubt, and we need to address that now. Obviously,  it was addressed at the time, but it has been ongoing.   But whether it was the slave trafficking that the chairlady was  talking about or whether it was family members of my wife who were  enslaved by Nazis in work camps or whether they are modern-day slave  labor camps like this with the Uyghurs, this must be stamped out. This  must be stamped out. We are in robust agreement about the problem and  about the issue.   The question here is enforcement and responsibility. So, Mr. Speaker,  I am going to read a quote from the head of the Securities and Exchange  Commission. We heard about moral obligation and those kinds of things.  This is what the head of the Securities and Exchange Commission said:  ``As we all know, the SEC has little or no experience in crafting trade  sanctions or articulating and enforcing human rights policy, two areas  which have not traditionally been within the purview of securities  regulation.''   This is from Mary Jo White, Barack Obama's head of the Securities and  Exchange Commission.   So this is not a partisan issue. This is not a question of whether  you support Uyghur slavery or not. I am offended if our colleagues are  trying to portray it as that. I don't think they are, but that may be  kind of how they are tinting it. And I might refer everybody to the  fact that, last week, we passed a bipartisan bill addressing this very  issue.   But this is about enforcement. This is about the State Department  doing its job. This is about the Treasury Department doing its job,  and, yes, our Financial Services Committee, which has done its job with  sanctions. We are very much a part of that sanction regime with the  Department of the Treasury.   So, please, Mr. Speaker, do not misunderstand, and please don't  misconstrue opposition to this particular bill. Again, we have no  disagreement about the atrocities. We have no disagreement about what  is happening on the ground to the Uyghurs and, frankly, to others.   By the way, if this was about others, we would include others, but it  is narrowed down to the Uyghurs.   So I am hoping and I am praying that this isn't just a political ploy  to look tough on China, finally, but I hope this is really about  helping people, because I know that is why I am here.   So I want to make sure, whether it is a young lady in the Philippians  who is in sex slavery or whether it is a Uyghur in a labor camp or  whether it was my wife's family that was imprisoned by the Japanese in  internment camps in Indonesia or in the Netherlands under the Nazis or  whether it was our brothers and sisters who came here involuntarily as  slaves, we have to recognize the evil and the sinfulness behind this,  as my friend and colleague from Texas had talked about its being  sinful. I wholeheartedly agree.   The question is: How are we going to remediate that and address it?  Unfortunately, the Securities and Exchange Commission is not the right  vehicle for that.   Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, we are hoping to get one more person here  who is on their way, so I continue to reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, we have had a good, robust conversation, and we have  agreed violently here on the problem and on the issue that we need to  address. Again, we have no disagreement about the atrocities against  the Uyghurs. We have no disagreement about what is happening on the  ground and the despicableness of the CCP, the Chinese Government.   Mr. Speaker, I really hope that it is not simply that the Democrats  are wanting to appear ``tough on China'' by pushing through an empty  window dressing bill that hurts U.S. investors and companies but,  unfortunately, simply pays lip service to the Uyghurs with a framework  that has already been proven disastrous.   And I just read a short while ago the quote from Barack Obama's head  of the Securities and Exchange Commission, Mary Jo White, who said that  the Securities and Exchange Commission is not equipped for this. Using  the SEC as social police didn't work with conflict minerals, and it  won't work as we all attempt to protect the Uyghurs.                                time  1200    I would remind my Democrat colleagues, again, that a year ago,  Republicans put forth strong proposals to prohibit taxpayer-backed  financing through the Export-Import Bank from going to the CCP, the  Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese Government. Our proposals had real  teeth in them.   Sadly, the Democrats on our committee rejected this proposal with no  real explanation. So instead, Democrats want to target our securities  laws and make the SEC responsible for foreign policy. In fact,  targeting our securities law is the Democrats' solution for virtually  everything--climate change, outsourcing, conflict minerals, not enough  mustard at the ballpark. It is not the job of the SEC to make sure that  these things are happening. It is our job and Treasury's job and the  State Department's job to make sure that those sanctions are in place.   This bill does not target the problem. Instead, it simply puts, not  just inconvenient duties on the plates of these publicly traded  companies, no, it accuses them of fraud--fraud--over something that is  impossible for them to determine. On top of it, it requires enforcement  from an agency that simply cannot do it.   Sanctioning bad actors is the appropriate and most effective way to  punish human rights abusers, as sanctions hurt the Chinese Communist  Party without hurting the Uyghurs or the American capital markets or  other investors and employees around the world. And ironically,  sanctions cover everyone. If you are a privately held company that is  using materials from a source that is under sanctions, guess what? You  just broke the law. You can't do that.   Now under this, if we are only using the SEC, guess who the SEC  applies to? Publicly traded companies only. So those private companies  could still go along their merry way doing business with those folks.  Yet, these publicly traded companies have this massive burden put on  them, enforced by an agency that says it cannot enforce them. I would  like to see everyone covered, not just these publicly traded companies.   Mr. Speaker, both the House and the administration have taken  meaningful action to combat human rights violators in the Xinjiang  Uyghur Autonomous Region. This includes recent sanctions imposed by the  administration on a number of China's 25-member ruling Politburo and  party secretary of the region, as well as additions to the Commerce  Department's Entity List.   Mr. Speaker, that is why I request my colleagues oppose H.R. 6270,  not because we don't agree on the goal, not that we don't want to make  sure that the Uyghurs are protected, but because using an agency to  enforce the law is the wrong direction to go. We are literally asking  the street department to go be the police department. And whether you  are doing the fire department or the street maintenance, or something  else in the city government, you may be good at that but that doesn't  mean you are a good police department or a good fire department. So  let's not ask the SEC to do that job, the job of the State Department.   Mr. Speaker, this is only going to be hurting those American  investors, those American companies, everyday investors, who are trying  to make sure that they get a reasonable return, yet, have a concern to  protect the Uyghurs  [[Page H5068]]  that, unfortunately, this bill fails to do.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
