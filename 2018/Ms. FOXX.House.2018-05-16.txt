 Mr. Speaker, I am honored to stand before you to recognize  the 64th anniversary of the Supreme Court's landmark decision in Brown  v. Board of Education. Because of the relentless courage of Linda  Brown, her parents, and civil rights leaders, the abhorrent  segregationist policy of ``separate but equal'' education came to an  end.   As a result, millions of children were afforded the educational  opportunities they deserve and their rightful shot at a successful  life.   Mr. Speaker, as an educator, as a lifelong learner, as chair of the  Committee on Education and the Workforce, I believe with all my heart  that  [[Page H3988]]  education is the key to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.   Sixty-four years ago, the end of legal segregation in public schools  recognized that inherent value as well. I honor the courage of those  students who brought about that change.                            ____________________
