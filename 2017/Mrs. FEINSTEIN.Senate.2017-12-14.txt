 Mr. President, I come to the floor today to discuss  the three judicial nominations we are considering this week: Steven  Grasz, for the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals, and James Ho and Don  Willett, both for the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals.   Before I talk about those nominees, I would like to offer some  background on the importance of circuit courts and remind my colleagues  why we have so many judicial vacancies.   The Supreme Court hears between 100 and 150 cases each year out of  the more than 7,000 it is asked to review. But in 2015 alone, more than  55,000 cases were filed in Federal appeals courts.  [[Page S8024]]    These cases range from crime and terrorism to bankruptcy and civil  matters, and the judges who hear these cases will affect millions of  Americans.   So it is extremely important who is confirmed to these lifetime  positions. Federal judges have a tremendous impact on individuals,  businesses, and the law. In a way, circuit courts serve as the de facto  Supreme Court to the vast majority of individuals who bring cases. They  are the last word.   These nominations are very important. That is why it is so concerning  that Republicans for years refused to allow judgeships to be filled.   The simple fact is the rush to fill judicial vacancies is the direct  result of Senate Republicans' historic obstruction of judicial nominees  during President Obama's administration.   During President Obama's last 2 years in office, just 22 judicial  nominees were confirmed. That is the fewest in a Congress since Harry  Truman was President. In contrast, during the last 2 years of the  George W. Bush administration, Senate Democrats confirmed 68 judicial  nominees.   At the end of last year, three circuit court nominees and 20 district  court nominees had been approved by the Judiciary Committee and were  waiting for votes on the Senate floor. Republicans refused to schedule  votes for those nominees, many of whom Republicans themselves voted  for, so they could hold those seats open. Four more circuit court  nominees and 52 district court nominees were pending in committee and  never even received a hearing.   Now, 1 year later, the Senate is voting this week to confirm the  10th, 11th, and 12th circuit court nominees this year. Republicans went  from delaying all nominees to cramming them through at a breakneck  pace.   The 11 circuit court nominees who have already been confirmed are  more than any President in the first year of office since Richard  Nixon.   Two nominees we are considering this week, James Ho and Don Willett,  lay out the Republican playbook.   These seats on the Fifth Circuit have been vacant since 2012 and  2013, even though the Obama White House tried to work with my  colleagues from Texas to fill these seats with consensus nominees.   But once President Trump entered the White House, they wasted no time  in rushing to put conservative judges in those seats.   Don Willett was nominated on October 3, James Ho on October 16.   Just a month later, on November 15, the Judiciary Committee held a  hearing for both circuit court nominees on the same day, and cloture  was filed immediately on both nominations after the committee advanced  them.   The speed at which these judges are being rammed through the process  is stunning.   In fact, on four occasions in the last 6 months our committee has  held hearings for two circuit court nominees at the same time. This  happened only three times in all 8 years of the Obama administration.   This is a problem because it gives Senators less time to review each  nominee's record and less time to ask each nominee questions. Candidly,  it makes it very difficult for us to exercise our constitutional duty  to ``advise and consent.''   We are already seeing the ramifications. Just yesterday, the White  House announced that two of its nominees would not be moving forward.  One nominee, Brett Talley, had already been voted out of the Judiciary  Committee, but we learned of troubling undisclosed information while he  was pending on the floor. This may not have happened if we had  sufficient time and cooperation to fully review these nominees.   In the month of November, the Judiciary Committee had hearings for  five circuit court nominees. I have served on this committee since  1993, and we have never held hearings for five circuit court nominees  in a single month before. That is during a month when we spent a week  at home for Thanksgiving.   Republicans refused to advance seven circuit court nominees last  year, but now we are speeding through the process to fill those seats  with conservative judges. Fairness aside, we should all be concerned  that we are giving lifetime appointments to potentially unqualified  nominees.   Now, I would like to talk about the three nominees we're considering  this week. This week, Steven Grasz was confirmed to the Eighth Circuit.   The American Bar Association has rated 1,755 judicial nominees since  1989, and only two of those have been unanimously rated ``not  qualified'' based on concerns over their impartiality.   One was a nominee for the Fifth Circuit in 2006 who was never  confirmed. The other is Steven Grasz.   Let me repeat that. This week, for the first time since at least  1989, the Senate voted to confirm a nominee who was unanimously rated  as ``not qualified'' by the American Bar Association.   The ABA doesn't rate nominees based on what the evaluators think.  Rather, they review a nominee's written record, talk to the nominee,  and interview many people who have direct personal and professional  knowledge about the nominee.   Here are just two direct quotes from the ABA's review:   ``Mr. Grasz's professional peers expressed concerns about his views  of stare decisis, and questioned his commitment to it.''   ``[A] number of Mr. Grasz's professional colleagues expressed the  view that, in terms of judicial temperament . . . Mr. Grasz is not  `free from bias.' Specifically, they expressed the view that he would  be unable to separate his role as an advocate from that of a judge.''   These are stunning indictments of a man who was confirmed to a  lifetime seat on a circuit court.   Some of my Republican colleagues argue that the ABA is biased. The  numbers just don't bear that out.   Over the last 30 years, during both Republican and Democratic  Administrations, the ABA has rated nearly 1,800 nominees and rated only  two ``not qualified'' based on their temperament.   I voted against Mr. Grasz's nomination and am very concerned that he  was confirmed on Tuesday. He did not have the support of a single  Democratic Senator.   Next I would like to talk about James Ho, nominated to the Fifth  Circuit.   During his time at the Office of Legal Counsel, Mr. Ho wrote a legal  analysis of the scope of the term ``cruel, inhuman, and degrading  treatment,'' which is prohibited under Common Article 3 of the Geneva  Conventions.   Unfortunately, this memo remains classified, and we haven't seen it.   The reason we know this memo exists is because Jay Bybee cited it in  one of the so-called torture memos, which were used to justify torture  and have since been widely discredited.   The Bybee memo also appears to have relied on Mr. Ho's analysis to  argue that because the term ``cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment''  ``appears to . . . have a rather limitless reach,'' conduct that  qualifies as torture should be defined more narrowly than what is  prohibited under international law.   It is this kind of flawed legal reasoning that allowed the U.S.  Government to torture people, and I have argued that no vote should  have taken place on Mr. Ho's nomination until we had access to that  memo.   The Justice Department has provided us access to similar memos  written by nominees for judgeships, so there is no reason to deny us  access to the memo James Ho authored.   I can't possibly vote in favor of a nominee to a lifetime appointment  who may have helped provide the legal basis for torture, and it is a  shame we are voting on this nominee this week.   Finally, I would like to speak about Don Willett's nomination to the  Fifth Circuit.   At his hearing, my first question was about his 1998 comments on a  draft proclamation for then-Governor George W. Bush to honor the Texas  Federation of Business and Professional Women in 1998.   Let me quote from them: ``I resist the proclamation's talk of `glass  ceilings,' pay equity (an allegation that some studies debunk), the  need to place kids in the care of rented strangers, sexual  discrimination/ harassment, and the need generally for better ``working  conditions'' for women (read: more government).''   I asked Justice Willett if these were still his beliefs, and he  refused to answer. I asked again, and again, he refused to answer.  Senator Durbin asked  [[Page S8025]]  the same question, and Justice Willett refused to disavow these  beliefs.   As the National Women's Law Center wrote, ``Mr. Willett's skepticism  of the existence of sex discrimination should disqualify him from the  bench. Litigants coming before Mr. Willett . . . would have reason to  question whether their claims of discrimination, including sexual  harassment and pay discrimination, would be fairly and impartially  heard or, instead, treated as `hype' to `debunk.' ''   I could not support Justice Willett's nomination.    Throughout his career, Mayor Lee broke down barriers  while approaching public service with tremendous skill, efficiency, and  purpose. On behalf of the city of San Francisco, Mayor Lee led the  fight to protect our immigrant communities, build and rehabilitate  affordable housing, and expand investment in public transportation and  critical infrastructure projects, among countless other fights on  behalf of his city.    He was our friend, and we will miss his wise counsel  and fearless leadership. The thoughts of San Franciscans and  Californians are with Mayor Lee's wife, Anita, his daughters, Brianna  and Tania, his family, city leaders, and the people of San Francisco at  this difficult time.                            ____________________
