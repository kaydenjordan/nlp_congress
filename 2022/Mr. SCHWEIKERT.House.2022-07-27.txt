 Madam Speaker, you hear everyone here all say  something nice. We all like telehealth. I am frustrated because I can't  get my head around why we are not going further.   Outside the internal political theater, those of us who have worked  on this legislation since the day we got here and then all of a sudden  wake up one day and it is a different bill with someone who I have  never even heard of working on it, God bless. The majority gets to do  things like that.   We want a change in the price of healthcare. Can we come together and  unleash technology? Telehealth is more than just looking at the phone  and doing FaceTime or now talking. It is the wearable. It is the thing.  It is the thing you lick.   There is technology with which we could be crushing the price of  healthcare, and instead, we are doing little incremental steps here.   There are a couple of problems with the bill the Democrats decided to  bring to the floor. It is for 2 years. We compromised to 4. If you want  capital investments in the technology, you have to give us at least 4.  It should be permanent.    There is also something in here that is just frustrating. You missed  the language on health savings accounts. You have 32 million people now  who functionally are not going to have access to be able to use those  accounts for their telehealth.   Madam Speaker, there is just a frustration here because we all talk  pretty about this, and then we are unwilling to do the things that  could potentially help us all by disrupting the price of healthcare and  increasing access, maybe making people's lives better. Instead, it just  became more political theater. We should be ashamed of ourselves.   Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of the  amendment in the Record immediately prior to the vote on the motion to  recommit.    Madam Speaker, if I came to the body and said the  bill we had all been working on, H.R. 8489--when you have someone like  Lloyd Doggett and someone like me, and we are actually working  together, we are working on some of the antifraud provisions, program  integrity provisions, you actually had something this body was doing  where we weren't beating the crap out of each other. It was something  that actually might be good for people in the country. Instead, we  turned it back into another opportunity for political gamesmanship.   It is my intense disappointment because it is our language,  substantially something I have worked on for years, that was grabbed  for the pandemic. We all know it expires the day the pandemic is  declared over. It is time to take this opportunity--I know there is an  army of lobbyists out there that despise telehealth because it changes  the populations that walk in the threshold. To hell with them. Let's  finally do what is right.    Madam Speaker, I have a motion to recommit at the  desk.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Madam Speaker, one of the reasons and one of the  focuses for tonight's presentation is I am just frustrated because of  the silliness that not only has become this body but even when you  listen to the White House, Madam Speaker.   So the White House is terribly concerned that on Thursday we will get  the latest statistics from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. I believe it  is on second quarter GDP. GDP now is the Atlanta Fed calculator. It is  a wonderful app if you want to look at it.   It is basically saying: Hey, we may be negative, and when we were all  in high school they said that two consecutive quarters of negative GDP,  well, that is a recession. Technically it is not. Yes, there is a  committee that decides it. That is what we argue about.   Has this place lost its mind?   So the press cycle becomes: Oh, are we in recession or not?   It is not, technically. If it goes negative it will be a recession.  But isn't this horrible that we are talking about this?   Let's just pretend and stop worrying about it and actually let's try  something unique.   Could we actually talk about what is happening to people, what is  happening to the country, what is happening to the budgets, the debt  and the deficits, the actual thing that will either make or break  society, which will make people's lives more miserable or more  prosperous?   Because right now we are in avoidance of all the big things.   But we do have some great virtue signaling bills. I mean, I had the  blessing earlier today of my telehealth bill being stolen from me and  handed to another Member because, well, we needed the politics.   Hey, good job, majority.   But I have to give Democrats credit. They have done some amazing  things in, what, their 16, 17 months of absolute control, when they won  the House back in the 2018 election.   So this is a chart I have had here multiple times. Yes, it is all  beaten up. The number is from, functionally, the 2021 CBO numbers. A  couple of hours ago we got the updated numbers.   For anyone wanting to know why I am using tape, apparently it is  against House rules for me to reach over and use a big marker and write  on the boards.   But the number we had been operating with is in, functionally, 29  years we are going to have $112 trillion of debt in today's dollars-- not inflation-adjusted dollars, but in today's dollars--and it is  almost all Medicare and Social Security. The rest of the budget is in  balance.   A couple hours ago--and I have only made it through the first dozen  pages of the new CBO report, and you can get it online, Madam Speaker,  it is only 90 pages--we moved from $112 trillion last year to-- congratulations to the Democrats, they got us to $138 trillion--$138  trillion of borrowing in the next 30 years in today's dollars.                                time  1930    Now, the reality, we are never going to get there. We will blow up  before that. But this talk, the virtue signaling, the insanity of this  place, well the Democrats are getting in; we are going to pay for  everything. We are going to do policies that are fiscally sensible.   Well, okay. Congratulations. CBO just actually took us from $112  trillion to $138 trillion on the math. It is just stunning. Does anyone  around this place give a damn?   And maybe I am a little on the cranky side. You know, I had a miracle  happen about 3 weeks ago. I was at home, and the phone rings, and my  little girl's birth mom had a little boy; so now I have a little boy.  So my wife and I, we have a 30-day-old baby at home, so there hasn't  been a lot of sleep.   And I am holding this little guy, and I am going, he is only 30 years  old when this happens. And the economy most likely blows up long before  then.   Does anyone here care about the next generation? Does anyone here  care about your own retirement?   You have got to understand how fast the numbers are rotting away from  us. But at least we are going to have a debate for the next couple of  days of are we in recession or not recession.   Well, technically two consecutive quarters are not technically a  recession; and the White House cares a lot about that because we know  that it is about the message and virtue signaling as the economy around  us is burning down.   And I am going to show you some numbers here. Could we try something  new? How about let's go back to a type of misery index? How miserable  are our constituents? How miserable is America and the public?   And we are going to look at some slides here that show you just how  much of people's wages have been stripped from them.   So a simple slide, and this is from the new CBO, from a couple of  hours ago. We did our best to put it together, and it is not going to  make a lot of sense. But basically, what I am trying to show is, $138  trillion of borrowing in today's dollars. That is a pretty steep curve.  Every bit of this steepness here that you see here is Social Security  and Medicare.   How many of us here are willing--I am the senior Republican, I am the  ranking Republican over Social Security. We are busting our humps to  try to come up with a bipartisan way to save the program, in a  functionally--in a decade.   If you are on Social Security, you are going to have a quarter of  your Social Security check disappear. Let alone, we expect, just  because of inflation, your copay on your Medicare is probably going to  more than double.   The number of our brothers and sisters who will be seniors at the end  of the decade, who will be moved into poverty because of what the  Democrats have done this last year and a half; does anyone care about  them?   And then, this is the stuff we have been able to start to pull out  from the CBO numbers that should start to scare this place half to  death. If you start looking at what they call the alternative  scenarios, and that is actually when inflation or interest rates have  small variances, and the speed that, if you actually go to the baseline  scenario, but if you actually start to go to a scenario over there  where interest rates are just 2 percent, 3 percent higher than the  predicted average, you actually get in a line here in about 20, 25  years, every dime of tax receipts, every dime of tax receipts just pays  interest.   There is no more government. There is no more military. There is no  more medical research. There is no more education. There is no more  Social Security and Medicare.   How many of you are going to spend your August going home and telling  townhalls how you are going to protect Social Security and Medicare,  but you are not willing to actually talk about the real math?   It is real. This isn't Republican or Democrat; it is math. And this  place has basically become a math-free zone.   And look, this is a chart I bring up here all the time because it is  nice and simple and graphic. 77 percent in 2001, was mandatory. Okay.  This is Social Security and Medicare. These are things we put on  formula. We don't vote on any of this.   Well, about 10 percent of our budget is defense; unlike, I had a  Democrat just last week saying oh--no, defense is 10 percent of our  spending. The entire budget that we, functionally, truly vote on,  discretionary is now to 13. And guess what? This is the `21. The new  numbers, the mandatory now is about 80 percent of all of our spending.  [[Page H7246]]    Discretionary, if you adjust for inflation, has basically been flat  for a decade. There is some stuff we vote on substantially because of  what Republicans did when we still had control here. We flattened out  discretionary spending.   But unless we are going to tell the truth of what is going on here-- we are getting old as a society. Last year was our lowest fertility  rate in U.S. history.   And once again, in 10 years, people on Social Security are going to  be taking one hell of a cut. How many people here, when the political  class is back in the home district this August, will stand up and talk  about what they intend to do to save the program?   So now, let's talk about the current misery. This is what the left's  policies have brought to people. Earnings lost due to inflation--and  let's use the Phoenix/Scottsdale area because that is where I live.  That is my home. That is who I am here to protect.   And let's just use the since August 2020 date so it is nice and  simple. You, functionally, have just lost 1.9, almost 2 months of your  labor. So you are, functionally, almost--in the Phoenix area, inflation  has been so high, you are almost working for 2 months, and you are  getting no compensation. You, functionally, have had the value of your  labor stripped. You have lost a couple of months.   If I make some of the adjustments, you start to realize you will get  to work for about 57 days. You get to go 57 days for free.    So instead of me standing in front of you and saying well, the  Phoenix has had 12.3 inflation, and if I use CPIW, with the other  adjustment which adjusts food and fuel, it is 13.1.   Screw talking about the percentages. Congratulations. Even if you are  part of the population that has had wage hikes, if I take the average  wage hike in my community, you are, functionally, working at least a  month to a month and a half for free, and this has been done to you in  less than a year and a half.   Does anyone care about the working people? The people that get up in  the morning, the retired couple, the young couple that is trying to put  their home together to maybe 1 day be able to afford a house?   I have no idea how people are surviving out there. And does this  place--we are going to have a debate on whether we are technically in a  recession or not because that is our talking point for the week.   And look here, I am going to give you two boards here, just to try to  understand; and we have been trying to adjust, so let's just use  something like healthcare support occupation. And this is just the loss  of purchasing power just due to fuel prices. And I even rolled the fuel  price back down.   You, functionally, lose, every month, 4 days of labor. You start to  think about what these costs mean. So let's use that's even bigger.   Let's actually use--this one I love. Does anyone recognize this? This  is our congressional calendar. You know, this is the days we are here  supposed to be doing the people's work.   Take a look, functionally. Come down here. You will notice a couple  of months with Xs on it. Those are days of labor you lose. You may get  your paycheck, but it has no new purchasing power. Actually, it has  lost purchasing power because of inflation.   Anyone watching C-SPAN today, how many of you heard people come  behind these microphones and actually demonstrate they care about you?  They care about your savings, your retirement, your future, the future  of my kids, your kids.   The average working person in my community--because I represent the  community with the highest inflation in America--has lost 40 days of  their labor. Their purchasing power has been stripped from them in a  year.   And I am going to get a little geeky for a second. Do you know where  the value has gone? You do realize inflation, basically, benefits  debtors, and crushes workers and savers.   Okay. Who is the biggest debtor in the world? We are. The United  States is the biggest debtor in the world. We are basically--one of the  wink and nods that are going on, I believe, with the administration and  the majority here is oh, inflation is bad, wink, wink, nod, nod.   But it is really reducing the value of the debt in real dollar terms,  because inflation is a tax transfer from you to the debt because it  devalues the borrowing by deflating the value of your purchasing power.   So we strip purchasing power from you, but by doing that, when we pay  back the debt, when we pay back the debt, the debt is paid back by  inflated dollars. It is a tax.   So when the left actually promises--when the President promises, we  are not going to tax anyone under $400,000; the hell you are not.   And in my community, you, functionally, have just taxed everyone 12.3  percent, new additional tax this year. You stripped that value from  them. And the wink, wink, nod, nod, fancy economists, basically  realized, hey, but we devalued the debt by that much. So you have got  the stealth tax.   And now you start to realize why America is poorer today. So the  Democrats get elected. We just went through 2018, 2019, first quarter  of 2020, one of the miracle moments of this country. We closed income  inequality.   Wages were growing. Inflation was flat. Poor people became less poor.  The working poor become more prosperous. The middle class became  substantially more prosperous. Wages were up, what, several thousand  dollars in real purchasing power. Every dime of that is gone.   And look, I am friends with a couple of the Democrats, and they  despise these floor speeches because it is so uncomfortable to hear  that their policies have almost been dystopian in destruction. But it  is math and at some point the math will win.   And the fact of the matter is, all the progress this economy, this  society, the closing income inequality, the reduction of food  insecurity, it is all gone. In a year and a half of, functionally,  Democrat control, it is all gone.   You are poorer today than you were the day they were elected. And all  that progress we made in that '18, '19, the beginning of 2020, from the  tax reform, the regulatory reform, it has all been stripped from you.    But yet, we are going to sit here and argue about, oh, are we in  recession? Oh, is it two quarters? No, you are not technically.   We will do anything around here to either virtue signal or avoid real  issues, while people are getting crushed.   We have got to stop the whining, the small ball around here, and  start doing something that makes people's lives better.   And yes, I can go out and snip all of the nice headlines talking  about, oh, it is not a recession. Oh, you know, God willing, don't  think we are going to go into a recession.   Okay. Fine. Let's pretend God's willing. Let's pretend we are not in  a recession. Let's remove that word.   How could we then pretend--could we just pretend--you are willing to  virtue signal on everything else. Are you willing to pretend we  actually care about people, care about the economy, care about the  future, care about the debt and the country collapsing because of the  rate we are borrowing?   And there are other things in the data that let us know, if you are a  data geek, and you actually sit and watch the financial news channels,  and the talking heads, and the spokespeople from the White House, you  are not being told the truth.   And how do you make public policy when it is the political theater is  the only thing that matters?   It is the spin. We have become an Orwellian body. We should be  ashamed of ourselves.   I am the senior Republican for also the Joint Economic Committee, as  well as being the ranking member, the senior Republican over Social  Security.   We have been holding Joint Economic hearings instead of doing what we  used to do, where the left would have their economists; the right would  have their economists; we would bring in really professional people,  and we would try to understand what was going on and how we could make  society healthier, wealthier.   Instead, we are going to bring in people and we are going to talk  about the economics of whatever the pop culture--gun violence today, or  we are going to talk about--we don't do real stuff anymore. We are  basically writing people's campaign brochures now.  [[Page H7247]]                                     time  1945    This is really important because unless we as a body can get the  incentives right to get up labor force participation--I know these are  geeky terms but our brothers' and sisters' participation in the  economy, I do not believe we can get the productivity back where we  have to be to take on inflation, to start to stabilize the economy in  the future.   We have a problem here. This should have been the trend line.  Something is going on. We have millions of our brothers and sisters who  have disappeared.   Of course, you have a great unemployment number. We have great  unemployment numbers. They are really low, except we have millions of  people who disappeared. They are not participating.   Once again, it is spin through not telling the truth about the math.  Now, it gets even darker and more misleading. I am sorry to be geeking  out, but you do realize we have multiple agencies, multiple groups that  do the calcs of what is unemployment, what is labor force  participation, and who is participating in the economy, and there is  some crazy divergence going on out there.   There is something called the establishment survey. That is what you  get every week, every month on this month's unemployment--we have  everyone working. Except at the very same time, there is something  called the household survey, and that is showing numbers that have  hundreds of thousands of people who have moved into unemployment.   How is that possible? How is it possible that two government surveys  in the same sample times are starting to produce such divergence in the  numbers?   I would love to tell you that I know, but I haven't had time to dig  into this. But there is something going on there. There is some noise  within our economy, yet we are all pretending.   This is the talking point the left keeps giving you. Well, we are not  in recession. Look at the employment data, except, also, I need you not  to look at the household survey because that number is going in the  wrong direction.   Remember, how does the Federal Reserve take on inflation? They break  the economy. They break the labor markets. They raise interest rates  like they did today. And the dirty secret is, oh, I don't think we will  drive it into recession--wink, wink, nod, nod.   Of course they will. That is how it works. They need to break the  wage-price spiral, which is real and has begun. You all know what the  wage-price spiral is, right? Prices go up, so I have to pay my workers  more. Well, if I pay my workers more, I have to raise my prices. Well,  if I raise my prices, I have to pay my workers more. Well, if I pay my  workers more, I have to raise my prices. You end up in this ratcheting  effect, and we are in that right now.   A couple of months ago, we would have a debate on the floor with a  couple of my more geeky colleagues, and they would still want to try to  say, oh, inflation is transitory. No. It is structural now. It is built  into everything you are buying.   Fuel prices go up here, but eventually, the distillates from that  fuel that are in that mug that holds the milk that you go buy is now in  the components of production. It is structural.   That is a real problem because we are trying to do some of the math  about what happens, God forbid, if we have substantially higher than  normal inflation for a year. God forbid it is 1 year, 2 years, 3 years,  even if they start to knock it down, and there you bring the Fed in.   What is the Fed doing right now? They are jacking up interest rates.  They are making your life more miserable. They are functionally trying  to put you out of work.   They need to raise unemployment. They need to create the elasticity  in the employment markets. So, all of a sudden, that wage-price  spiral--you are willing to work for less because you need the job. But  you already see the data right now of how many of our brothers and  sisters are just trying to maintain their life.   Their rent has gone up. They are using their credit cards. Now, their  credit cards are going to get substantially more expensive because  interest rates are going up. Now, we are actually seeing articles that  the Treasury may have to write checks to the Federal Reserve.   One day, I will do a whole Fed presentation on how it actually works.  But when they raise interest rates, they are actually raising interest  rates on what they are willing to pay on bank deposits. Therefore, they  are paying interest on the bank deposits.   The Federal Reserve needs to get cash to pay a rate of return on the  bank deposits, and they get that from the Treasury, which is a little  crazy, but that is how it works.   You start to think about the math. I know these are just statistics,  but they are also people. They are people, and this place has just  become cruel.   I guess the virtue signaling here is only done when it is a good line  for a brochure, and I know it is half an hour of talking about economic  data, but these are people.   We are trying to do a breakdown right now of how seniors survive. You  do realize how many of our seniors, even with the Social Security COLA  that may be over 8 points, their copay on healthcare--because,  remember, some of the healthcare inflation has been double baseline  CPI. Many seniors now have to pay 20 percent of that, so they are  bleeding.   The COLA for Social Security doesn't keep up with actual inflation,  and it is also a lagger. I won't walk through the table, but understand  we are trying to do the math here of how many of our seniors basically  are moving into poverty, and we are trying to do something latitudinal  over a decade. By the end of the decade, what population has just this  cycle of inflation done?   On Thursday, when the second quarter GDP number comes out, and the  White House and Democrats say, ``Oh, we are not in recession. It is not  a technical recession,'' how many of them are going to get behind a  microphone and say, ``I don't care whether we are in recession or not.  I care about seniors who are about to become poverty-stricken.'' How  many are going to say, ``I care about the family that is having trouble  surviving.'' Where is the empathy in this place? Does anyone care?    We make public policy by feelings, by virtue signaling, not by a  calculator, and I accept I sound like an accountant on steroids. It is  my sin. But these are people.   We are going to sit here, and we are going to fuss like crazy over  little symbolisms. We are going to fight over the naming of a post  office.   At the same time, someone is going to go home and realize they have  to figure out whether they can pay the air-conditioning bill or be able  to have enough gas to drive down to the food bank. There are ugly  things happening out there, and it doesn't need to happen.   We as Republicans have some ideas to stop it. It may not completely  stop inflation, but at least it would help. The brain trust on the  other side, the idea is, well, let's send them a check. That is what  caused the problem.   Please, can you have some folks that actually showed up for their  basic economics class be the ones making public policy here? Let's stop  hurting people. This isn't partisan. This is our job.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
