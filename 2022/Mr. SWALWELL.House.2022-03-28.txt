 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for her continued  leadership in this area and the gentleman from Oregon for his support.   Mr. Speaker, this legislation plainly says and will plainly make so  that the sun will never set on justice for victims of homicides and  their families seeking closure.   I want to thank the chairman and ranking member for their unanimous  support of my bill, H.R. 3359, the Homicide Victims' Families' Rights  Act of 2021. I really appreciate the majority leader and the Speaker  for allowing this measure to be considered before the floor today.   I also want to thank my co-lead on this legislation, former Federal  prosecutor, Congressman  Mike McCaul from Texas, for his dedication to  bringing justice to victims of unsolved homicides. His perspective,  having served in the Federal courts, brought with him a wealth of  knowledge on criminal investigations at both the State and Federal  level.   I also want to acknowledge former Assistant United States Attorney  from the District of Columbia, Glenn Kirschner, who worked with my  office, after spending many years serving as a prosecutor in the  District of Columbia to detail the pain and suffering that far too many  families face when they see their loved ones' cases go unsolved. Mr.  Kirschner's expertise has been invaluable as I drafted this legislation  to ensure no victim is forgotten.   I also have relied upon my own experience as a prosecutor, knowing  that no jury verdict, no criminal sentence can bring back to life a  lost loved one. However, I have been in the courtroom when a guilty  verdict is delivered in a murder case and I have seen the closure that  the families experience when that occurs for them.   I have also met with a number of families where they have not yet  seen their family member's killer brought to justice. There is a marked  difference. This revitalizes the review and reinvestigation processes  for cold case homicide files. Upon request by a loved one or a family  member 3 years after a case goes cold, my legislation requires a  complete reexamination of the file and accompanying evidence, new or  renewed interviews with potential subjects and witnesses and other  methods to identify possible missteps.                                time  1715    Improvements in technology, resources, and evidence-based techniques  will also better equip law enforcement agencies with tools they need to  review files under a novel lens, one that would assist in identifying  new leads and witnesses to solve crimes and obtain justice that  victims' families and loved ones so rightfully deserve.   It also assists investigators in homicide cases that serve important  underserved communities such as Native Americans on Indian  Reservations, Federal law enforcement officers killed in action, U.S.  citizens who are murdered abroad, or homicides that take place on  Federal land and the high seas.   It will also serve as a crucial model for the States to look at a  Federal law that could inspire in their own States, the ability to  adopt a local Homicide Victims Bill of Rights.   This law enforcement with additional disaggregated and detailed  information about cold case homicides that will assist agencies across  State lines to help triangulate homicide trends and investigate and  identify new leads. Valuable information, combined with existing  commitments toward finding justice for unsolved murders, has led to  full endorsements of my bill by both advocacy groups and law  enforcement associations alike.   The need for this bill is great. And every year, countless homicides  leave mothers and fathers without children, spouses widowed, and sons  and daughters without parents. The crimes spare no one, whether it is  the unfortunate victim, or the family member who is left with lasting  shock, turmoil, and grief. And after all, murder never discriminates,  nor does it prioritize.   Special care is especially needed for cold case crimes. The FBI  Uniform Crime Report estimates 250,000 homicides cases are unsolved.  And as of today, we have more than 3,000 unsolved homicide cases right  here in our own Nation's Capital. The number of unsolved homicides that  eventually attain cold-case status increases each year by an average of  6,000.   That is why I am urging my friends on both sides of the aisle to  swiftly pass H.R. 3359, and to join our colleagues on the Judiciary  Committee who unanimously supported the passage of this legislation.
