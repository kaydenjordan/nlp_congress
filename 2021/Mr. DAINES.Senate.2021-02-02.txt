 Madam President, today I have the honor of  recognizing Sarah Moyer of Yellowstone County for serving her community  in a time of need.   When schools were shut down in March due to the COVID-19 pandemic,  hundreds of children who rely on school for getting their meals were  sent home. Sarah saw the need to feed her community and did not  hesitate to jump in. Her business, Project Lunch, started to make  healthy lunches available to anyone in need. By the end of the summer,  Sarah and her volunteers had delivered over 21,800 lunches right to the  front doors of Montanans--a truly remarkable act of service for her  neighbors.   Her dedication to her fellow Montanans does not stop there. Heading  into 2021, Sarah opened a pay-what-you-can restaurant in downtown  Billings that employs Montanans who are struggling to find employment  elsewhere. The community rallied behind Sarah and donated time,  equipment, and resources to help get this restaurant started. Her goal  for this project is to create a place for folks to give back and  support their neighbors. Sarah has brought her community together,  inspired volunteers, helped those in need, and started a legacy of  service.   I am thankful for Sarah's dedication and heart for the Billings  community. She has truly shown us all what it means to put service  above self.                            ____________________     Madam President, today I have the honor of  recognizing my good friend Chuck Roady of Flathead County.   It is hard to imagine where the Montana timber industry would be  right now were it not for the leadership of Chuck. The last few decades  haven't been easy on the timber industry or the communities that rely  upon it for good paying jobs. Yet, throughout his career, Chuck has met  these challenges head-on, fighting tooth and nail to protect timber  jobs and advocate for the proper management of our forests.   Growing up, Chuck loved the outdoors and wanted to find a job that  would allow him to be in the woods. After graduating from the  University of Idaho College of Forestry, he worked for various timber  companies across the Pacific Northwest. In 2003, he became lands and  resources manager for F.H. Stoltze Land and Lumber Company in Columbia  Falls, MT. The Stoltze Mill employs more than 130 hard-working  Montanans.   From the beginning of his time with Stoltze, Chuck became a leading  voice in the community for our timber industry and proper forest  management. Chuck's approach is to build bridges and find common ground  amongst groups with different interests. His work has brought people  together to find solutions that benefit the mills, the communities that  depend on them, and our forests.   Chuck has been a leader on timber issues on the national stage as  well. He was a founding member of the Federal Forest Resource Coalition  and served as its chair. In this role, he successfully worked to  elevate forest management issues to the forefront of our national  debates, making real progress along the way. He has given us all a  reason to be optimistic about the future.   I thank Chuck for his years of service to this cause and wish him all  the best in his retirement.                            ____________________     Madam President, today I have the honor of  recognizing Mike, a Montana ranch dog who was crowned this year's  runner up for Farm Dog of the Year.   As a dog dad to Ruby, Reagan, and Jessie, I know the important role a  dog plays in life. Dogs are there for us through the good and the bad,  and they are always happy to see you. Our four-legged friends are a  source of laughter and always make for a good hunting partner.   In Montana, our dogs take on another role. They become a trusty ranch  hand for many. Tim Feddes, a rancher from Manhattan, knows just how  important it is to have a hard-working cow dog. That is exactly why he  thought Mike, his border collie, should have a shot at American Farm  Bureau's 2021 Farm Dog of the Year Contest.   Out of hundreds of furry applicants, an expert panel chose Mike to be  crowned as the runner-up for Farm Dog of the Year. Mike is a special  dog that takes his job seriously and makes life on the ranch a little  bit brighter.   It is my honor to recognize Mike on this incredible accomplishment.  He has represented ranch dogs everywhere, and especially in Montana,  with pride.                            ____________________
