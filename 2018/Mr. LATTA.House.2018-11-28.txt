 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 6032) to direct the Secretary of Commerce to conduct a study and  submit to Congress a report on the state of the internet-connected  devices industry in the United States, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 6032         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``State of Modern Application,       Research, and Trends of IoT Act'' or the ``SMART IoT Act''.       SEC. 2. STUDY AND REPORT ON INTERNET OF THINGS.         (a) Study.--The Secretary of Commerce shall conduct a study       on the state of the internet-connected devices industry       (commonly known as the ``Internet of Things'') in the United       States.

(2) Internet-connected device.--The term ``internet-      connected device'' means a physical object that--        (A) is capable of connecting to the internet, either       directly or indirectly through a network, to communicate       information at the direction of an individual; and        (B) has computer processing capabilities for collecting,       sending, receiving, or analyzing data.       SEC. 3. NO ADDITIONAL FUNDS AUTHORIZED.         No additional funds are authorized to be appropriated to       carry out this Act. This Act shall be carried out using       amounts otherwise authorized.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  insert extraneous materials in the Record on the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 6032, the State  of Modern Application, Research, and Trends of IoT Act, or the SMART  IoT Act.   Earlier this year, the SMART IoT Act was unanimously approved by the  Digital Commerce and Consumer Protection Subcommittee and the full  Energy and Commerce Committee.   I would like to thank Chairman Walden for his support of this  bipartisan legislation. I also want to thank Representative Welch for  his leadership as the original cosponsor of the SMART IoT Act and the  many bipartisan members of the Energy and Commerce Committee for  cosponsoring this bill.   Representative Welch and I have been working together on these issues  for years, including as co-founders of the Internet of Things Working  Group in the 114th Congress.   Today marks an important step towards maximizing the full potential  of Internet-connected devices, more commonly known as smart devices.   Almost any physical object can be transformed into a smart device  with microchips, sensors, and wireless communications. Once  transformed, these smart devices connect through a network to share,  exchange, and analyze data to gather insights used to solve problems or  enable new capabilities.   IoT solutions will benefit consumers and businesses by improving  productivity, efficiency, and much more. Whether we are talking about  advancements to automobiles that will improve roadway safety and save  lives or smart-city applications that will improve services for  residents, one thing is clear: We have the chance to benefit from a  more connected world.   Because of the vast benefits of IoT, we are seeing significant  economic impacts across a number of industries. By 2025, it is  projected that the total economic impact of IoT could reach $11.1  trillion. This includes value increases annually of up to $2.5 trillion  in the healthcare sector, $2.3 trillion in manufacturing, $300 billion  in infrastructure, $100 billion in agriculture, and $50 billion in  vehicle use.   To realize these benefits, we must ensure the Government does not get  in the way. Throughout numerous meetings over the years, we heard from  many stakeholders. What became clear is that it is difficult to know  who is doing what, both in the Federal Government and also in the  private sector.   A lack of collaboration and dialogue presents the problem of creating  unnecessary barriers to innovation and commonsense policy, something we  cannot afford to do if we want to unleash the power of IoT in the  United States. We must equip ourselves and industry with information  about what Federal, public-private, and self-regulatory efforts are in  place or under way.   This is why we developed the SMART IoT Act. The SMART IoT Act directs  the Secretary of Commerce to create a compendium to answer that very  question: Who is doing what? At the Federal level, this is what will  help promote interagency discussions and avoid conflicting or  duplicative obligations or regulations that may slow innovation and  progress.   At the industry level, this will help innovators and businesses know  how entities are developing, using, and promoting use of IoT solutions.  It will also highlight industry-based efforts to self-regulate and  provide all stakeholders with a resource to facilitate communication  and information sharing.   The SMART IoT Act is a critical first step to future IoT policy  efforts. It provides important information that will foster Federal  collaboration and streamline private industry efforts.   We have an obligation to do what we can to promote American  competitiveness and technological advancements that benefit Americans  in an environment where other countries are trying to overtake the  United States in technical innovation.   Mr. Speaker, again I thank Chairman Walden, Representative Welch, and  [[Page H9676]]  all of the bipartisan cosponsors of H.R. 6032, the SMART IoT Act. I  urge all my colleagues to support H.R. 6032, and I reserve the balance  of my time.    Mr. Speaker, again, I urge support of H.R. 6032, and I  yield back the balance of my time.
