 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize our letter  carriers in southwest Ohio and across the country.   These folks keep our communities connected. They deliver everything  from birthday cards to magazines, Social Security checks, and  lifesaving medication. They are also facing more and more threats and  violence.   Hundreds of letter carriers across the country have been assaulted on  the job. Earlier this week, in southwest Ohio, there were two armed  robberies of letter carriers within 12 hours. Thankfully, they are both  expected to fully recover, but this has to stop.   We need to protect our letter carriers from these assaults. That is  why I have sent requests to the Postmaster General urging him to deploy  enhanced training and safety measures and to the Attorney General  urging the Department of Justice to prosecute these crimes to the  fullest extent of the law.   Mr. Speaker, I thank our letter carriers across the country for their  service. We will keep working with our colleagues in Congress to fight  for them.                            ____________________
