 Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to call up H.R.  471, the PAUSE Act, to protect all Americans from Biden's border  crisis.    Mr. Speaker, many times, we have heard President Biden  and his administration say that the crisis we are facing at our  southern border is seasonal. There is nothing seasonal about 1 million  illegal aliens crossing our southern border in 6 months. There is  nothing seasonal about 400,000 illegal alien got-aways going undetected  into our country.   The crisis at our southern border is the direct result of President  Biden overturning successful policies put in place by Donald Trump.   First, Biden halted the construction of the border wall. Then, he  rescinded the remain in Mexico policy. Now, he is taking aim at one of  the final remaining Trump policies, title 42, which allows law  enforcement to expel illegal aliens who pose a health risk.   The Department of Homeland Security predicts that as many as 12,000  to  [[Page H4388]]  18,000 illegal aliens will cross our southern border per day if title  42 is lifted--18,000 illegal aliens in 1 day. In 3 days, that would be  greater than the population of Pennsylvania's capital city,  Harrisburg--in less than 3 days. In a little more than a day, it would  be greater than the population of Williamsport, Pennsylvania, the  largest city in Pennsylvania's 12th Congressional District.   If President Biden removes title 42, it goes beyond bad judgment. It  is reckless, and it will turn the crisis into chaos at our southern  border.    That is the executive branch, homeland security.
