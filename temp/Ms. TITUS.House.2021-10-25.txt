 Madam Speaker, I rise to celebrate the life and remember  the accomplishments of Congressman James H. Bilbray. Jim was a native  son of Nevada who served as a judge, a university regent, and a State  legislator before being elected to the House of Representatives from  Nevada's First District where he served from 1987 to 1995.   Congressman Bilbray was a man ahead of his time. He was an early  environmentalist before going green was considered cool. His  legislation to protect Red Rock Canyon preserved a special place for  future generations. His legacy will live on in the magnificent  formations, Native American petroglyphs, and iconic wildlife and flora  and fauna found there.   Madam Speaker, I ask now that the House observe a moment of silence  in his honor.                            ____________________
