 Madam Speaker, from their health outcomes to their  unemployment income, from their education rate to their incarceration  rate, Black men and boys are disproportionately impacted by government  policies.   It is not that Black men and boys are falling behind. It is that they  have never been ahead.   For centuries, government policies have redlined Black men and boys  into a lower social status than their White counterparts. This is an  institutional problem.   Yesterday, I joined with many of my colleagues at the House Triangle  to stand in support of Congresswoman Frederica Wilson's bill to create  the Commission on the Social Status of Black Men and Boys.   We were joined by young men who want nothing more than to live the  American Dream free of discrimination. This country owes them that.   H.R. 1636 will bring together experts to tackle the wide range of  issues that have kept Black men and boys behind for hundreds of years.  It will mark the beginning of the end of racial disparities that have  kept communities across the country down.   Madam Speaker, I am proud to support it.                            ____________________
