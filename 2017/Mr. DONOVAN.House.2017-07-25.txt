 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 2182) to require the Comptroller General of the United  States to submit a report to Congress on the alternatives for the final  disposition of Plum Island, including preservation of the island for  conservation, education, and research, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2182         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Plum Island Preservation       Act''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress finds the following:        (1) The Federal Government has owned Plum Island, New York,       since 1899.        (2) Since 1954, the Plum Island Animal Disease Center has       conducted unrivaled scientific research on a variety of       infectious animal-borne diseases, including foot-and-mouth       disease, resulting, most recently, in the development of a       new cell line that rapidly and reliably detects this highly       debilitating disease of livestock.        (3) Over 62 years, the Center has had a strong, proven       record of safety.        (4) $23,200,000 in Federal dollars have been spent on       upgrades to, and the maintenance of, the Center since January       2012.        (5) In addition to the Center, Plum Island contains       cultural, historical, ecological, and natural resources of       regional and national significance.        (6) Plum Island is situated where the Long Island Sound and       Peconic Bay meet, both of which are estuaries that are part       of the National Estuary Program and are environmentally and       economically significant to the region.        (7) The Federal Government has invested hundreds of       millions of Federal dollars over the last two decades to make       long-term improvements with respect to the conservation and       management needs of Long Island Sound and Peconic Bay.        (8) In a report submitted to Congress on April 11, 2016,       entitled ``National Bio- and Agro-Defense Facility       Construction Plan Update'' the Department of Homeland       Security noted that the new National Bio- and Agro-Defense       Facility under construction on such date in Manhattan,       Kansas, is, as of such date, fully paid for through a       combination of Federal appropriations and funding from the       State of Kansas.       SEC. 3. REPORT REQUIRED ON FINAL DISPOSITION OF PLUM ISLAND.         Not later than one year after the date of the enactment of       this Act, the Comptroller General of the United States shall       submit to Congress a report containing the following:        (1) The alternatives for the final disposition of Plum       Island, including the transfer of ownership to another       Federal agency, a State or local government, a nonprofit       organization, or a combination thereof for the purpose of       education, research, or conservation.        (2) With respect to each such alternative final       disposition, an analysis of--        (A) the effect such disposition would have on the island's       resources;        (B) the remediation responsibilities under such       disposition;        (C) any future legislation necessary to implement such       disposition;        (D) the possible implications and issues, if any, of       implementing such disposition;        (E) the costs of such disposition, including any potential       costs related to the transition, hazard mitigation, and       cleanup of property that would be incurred by a recipient of       the property under such disposition; and        (F) the potential revenue from such disposition.       SEC. 4. SUSPENSION OF ACTION.         No action, including any pre-sale marketing activity, may       be taken to carry out section 538 of title V of division D of       the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2012 (Public Law 112-74;       125 Stat. 976) until at least 180 days after the report       required by section 3 has been submitted to Congress.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include any extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2182, the Plum Island  Preservation Act, sponsored by my colleague from New York (Mr. Zeldin).   This bill requires the Government Accountability Office to review the  alternatives for the final disposition of the Department of Homeland  Security's Science and Technology Directorate's Plum Island Animal  Disease Center, commonly known as Plum Island.   Since 1954, Plum Island, located in Suffolk County, New York, has  served the Nation in defending against accidental or intentional  introduction of foreign animal diseases, including foot-and-mouth  disease. However, Plum Island's facilities are aging and nearing the  end of their life cycle.   That is why in 2005, DHS announced that the work being conducted on  Plum Island would be moved to a new Federal facility in Kansas. Plum  Island will continue to operate until the National Bio and Agro-Defense  Facility is fully operational and a complete transition has been made  in 2022 or 2023.   This raises the question of what will happen to Plum Island once its  activities are fully transferred over to the  [[Page H6240]]  new facility. The Department looked at this issue and, in June of 2016,  released a report that reviewed several options for the final  disposition of Plum Island.   This bill simply requires GAO to review and analyze these  alternatives to ensure all necessary information was taken into account  before the Department decides how to move forward with the final  disposition of Plum Island. Specifically, GAO is to analyze the  effects, possible implications and issues, and potential costs and  revenue for each disposition.   Finally, H.R. 2182 suspends the sale of Plum Island until GAO  completes this thorough review and analysis of alternatives.   My friend, Representative Zeldin, introduced H.R. 2182 with strong  bipartisan support. H.R. 2182 is very similar to a bill that passed the  House by voice vote last May.   In conclusion, this bill ensures that there is adequate consideration  of all the options for the disposition of the island.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to join me in supporting this bill,  and I reserve the balance of my time.           House of Representatives, Committee on Transportation and             Infrastructure,                                     Washington, DC, July 25, 2017.      Hon. Michael McCaul,      Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman McCaul: I write concerning H.R. 2182, the       Plum Island Preservation Act. This legislation includes       matters that fall within the Rule X jurisdiction of the       Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure.        In order to expedite floor consideration of H.R. 2182, the       Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure will forgo       action on this bill. However, this is conditional on our       mutual understanding that forgoing consideration of the bill       would not prejudice the Committee with respect to the       appointment of conferees or to any future jurisdictional       claim over the subject matters contained in the bill or       similar legislation that fall within the Committee's Rule X       jurisdiction. I request you urge the Speaker to name members       of the Committee to any conference committee named to       consider such provisions.        Please place a copy of this letter and your response       acknowledging our jurisdictional interest in the       Congressional Record during House Floor consideration of the       bill. I look forward to working with the Committee on       Homeland Security as the bill moves through the legislative       process.            Sincerely,                                                      Bill Shuster,      Chairman.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                  Committee on Homeland Security,                                      Washington, DC, July 25, 2017.      Hon. Bill Shuster,      Chairman, Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure,           Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Shuster: Thank you for your letter regarding       H.R. 2182. I appreciate your support in bringing this       legislation before the House of Representatives, and       accordingly, understand that the Committee on Transportation       and Infrastructure will not seek a sequential referral on the       bill.        The Committee on Homeland Security concurs with the mutual       understanding that by forgoing a sequential referral of this       bill at this time, the Committee on Transportation and       Infrastructure does not waive any jurisdiction over the       subject matter contained in this bill or similar legislation       in the future. In addition, should a conference on this bill       be necessary, I would support your request to have the       Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure represented on       the conference committee.        I will insert copies of this exchange in the Congressional       Record during consideration of this bill on the House floor.       I thank you for your cooperation in this matter.            Sincerely,                                              Michael T. McCaul,                                                           Chairman,                                    Committee on Homeland Security.     Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  distinguished gentleman from New York (Mr. Zeldin), the sponsor of the  bill.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I, once again, urge my colleagues to  support H.R. 2182.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
