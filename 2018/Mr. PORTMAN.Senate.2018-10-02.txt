 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I come to the floor to talk about a few  good things that have happened in Washington this week. At a time when  people are looking at Washington and wondering whether things are  getting done, let me just suggest, on the floor this week, we are going  to pass landmark legislation that will deal with a crisis we have in  our States--every single one of us--and that is the opioid issue. I  will talk about that in a minute.    Thank you.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, today I wish to congratulate the YWCA for  160 years of service dedicated to supporting women, girls, and their  families across the United States.   Throughout its storied history, YWCA has been committed to  eliminating racism, empowering women, and freedom and dignity for all.   YWCA has been at the forefront of many critical social movements,  including civil rights, women's empowerment, gender-based violence  prevention, and more. Additionally, it is the largest network of  domestic violence and sexual assault service providers in the country,  reaching more than half a million women and girls annually.   Serving a total of more than 2 million women, girls, and their  families each year, with 210 local associations across 46 States and  the District of Columbia, this organization's impact is vast, but its  focus is local.   In Ohio, there are 14 YWCA associations, and I am proud of the work  they do in my State. I have worked to help YWCA's important mission  through my legislation to combat sex trafficking, help those gripped by  addiction--particularly mothers and children--get the care they need,  improve prisoner reentry, allow kids aging out of foster care to more  easily access Federal support for housing, and more.   YWCA breaks barriers and empowers women to help them live up to their  God-given potential. Congratulations on your 160 years of improving the  lives of women and girls--and on many more to come.                            ____________________
