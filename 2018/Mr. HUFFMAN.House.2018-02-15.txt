 Madam Speaker, from the mighty redwoods to the headlands  and beaches of the Golden Gate National Recreation Area in my bay area,  backyard to the ancient sequoias of Yosemite, to the scorching deserts  of Death Valley, we know our national parks are worth protecting.   Parks not only protect nature and wildlife but our history, too. And  they are economic engines supporting thousands of jobs. But Donald  Trump's dirty budget and infrastructure scam would bulldoze right  through this American success story.   Trump is proposing a 7 percent cut to the National Park Service,  meaning even less maintenance and visitor services, and a 17 percent  cut to the Department of the Interior overall, while giving Secretary  Ryan Zinke free rein to continue his drilling spree on our public  lands.   These cuts, combined with Trump's ongoing effort to hike entry fees  for working families, threaten access to these places that drive  millions of visitors to our communities and small businesses each year,  while generating hundreds of millions of dollars in economic activity.   Underfunding our national parks puts visitor access at risk. We  should reject this budget and work together.                            ____________________
