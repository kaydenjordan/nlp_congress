 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the students,  faculty, staff, families, and community around Marjory Stoneman Douglas  High School who lost 17 of their own 3 weeks ago today.   I rise to join the entire community of Parkland and millions of  Americans all across the country, Democrats and Republicans, who are  saying enough is enough. The time for action is now.   We cannot allow partisan politics to get in the way of taking  meaningful action in areas where both parties agree and that have the  support of most Americans across this country. Here are a few examples:   Both Democrats and Republicans support legislation I have cosponsored  to ban bump stocks.   Both Democrats and Republicans support legislation to close the  loophole exploited by the Sutherland Springs, Texas, shooter last year.   Both Democrats and Republicans support legislation to uphold Second  Amendment rights and strengthen the National Instant Criminal  Background Check System.   Now is the time for us to come together and to take meaningful action  towards responsible, commonsense gun safety reform.                            ____________________
