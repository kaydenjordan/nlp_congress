Madam President, I would like to take the  opportunity to express my appreciation to Nadia for her hard work as an  intern in the Senate Republican Conference. I recognize her efforts and  contributions to my office, as well as to the State of Wyoming.   Nadia is a native of Maryland. She is a student at American  University, where she studies psychology and communication: film and  media arts. She has demonstrated a strong work ethic, which has made  her an invaluable asset to our office. The quality of her work is  reflected in her great efforts over the last several months.   I want to thank Nadia for the dedication she has shown while working  for me and my staff. It was a pleasure to have her as part of our team.  I know she will have continued success with all of her future  endeavors. I wish her all my best on her next journey.                            ____________________
