 Madam Speaker, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, there are several contributing factors to why nursing  mothers may choose not to breastfeed and pump milk when returning to  work. They include inflexible work schedules that make nursing and  pumping breast milk regularly difficult; the lack of accommodations to  pump and store milk; and concerns regarding support from supervisors  and colleagues to pump milk.   In addition to these factors, women of color and low-income women  often experience the need to return to work shortly after giving birth,  in many cases earlier than 12 weeks, and they face additional barriers  such as racial discrimination and bias whether intentional or not.   This is why I am proud to offer my amendment to H.R. 3110, the PUMP  for Nursing Mothers Act, the underlying bill that protects vulnerable  workers by expanding access to breastfeeding accommodations in the  workplace.   This important piece of legislation advances our goals of equity in  the workplace, and my amendment seeks to strengthen this bill by  directing the GAO to conduct a study on the racial disparities that  exist in access to pumping breast milk in the workplace.   This amendment will also require that GAO submit a report to Congress  on the results of this study with recommendations to address any  disparities.   Employers can begin to address these barriers by offering private  lactation rooms, or nursing rooms, for both breastfeeding and pumping  with proper cleaning and storage facilities such as a table, sink, and  small refrigerator, providing employees with adequate pump breaks,  allowing flexible work schedules, and guaranteeing paid family leave.   In fact, we can look to my home State of Washington as a prime  example of how to lead on this issue. In 2019, the State legislature  passed and signed into law House Bill 1930, which goes one step further  than the current Federal law by expanding pump break rights to include  both salaried and hourly employees, requiring employers to provide a  private space for pumping that isn't a bathroom, and allowing mothers  to get pump breaks for up to 2 years after birth. Washington is also  one of the very few States that provides people with up to 12 weeks  paid parental leave after the birth or adoption of a child.   Yet, despite current Federal law, strong State-level protections such  as the ones in Washington, and the gains that have been made in this  area by employers in different sectors across our Nation, racial  disparities in the workplace still exist for women wishing to pump. My  amendment aims to close this gap and equip Congress with the data it  needs to create meaningful solutions.   We must ensure that women and mothers everywhere and from all  backgrounds have the support they deserve in the workplace.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment and the  underlying bill, the PUMP for Nursing Mothers Act, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from  A Better Balance.                                                 September 23, 2021.      Re The PUMP for Nursing Mothers Act (H.R. 3110).         Dear Representative: On behalf of A Better Balance, I write       to express our strong support for the PUMP for Nursing       Mothers Act (``The PUMP Act''; H.R. 3110) because no one in       this country should have to choose between feeding their baby       and earning an income for their family. The PUMP Act will       mean millions of workers, excluded under current law, will       have adequate break time and space to express milk at work.       The PUMP Act will further the health of our nation's parents,       babies, and economy. Affording protections to workers so they       can pump milk to feed this country's children should be a       priority for every member of Congress. We urge every member       to support this bipartisan legislation and vote yes on the       PUMP Act.        A Better Balance is a national legal advocacy organization,       using the power of the law to advance justice for workers, so       they can care for themselves and their loved ones without       risking their economic security. We founded A Better Balance       fifteen years ago because we recognized that a lack of fair       and supportive work-family laws and policies, or more       broadly, a ``care crisis'' was harming a majority of workers,       particularly women, especially Black and Latina women, in       low-  [[Page H5813]]       wage jobs. In the case of nursing parents, too often, parents       return to work without the supports they need to continue       expressing milk at work and are forced to choose between       giving up breastfeeding and maintaining their employment.        As I shared with the House Education and Labor Committee in       my March 2021 testimony:        We hear over and over again on A Better Balance's free       legal helpline, new mothers returning to the workplace face       unfair treatment because their employers refuse to provide       them with the time and space needed to express breast milk,       forcing them to choose between a paycheck and providing       breast milk for their child. Some workers reduce their       schedules, are terminated, or are forced out of the       workplace, foregoing vital income and familial economic       security because their workplaces are so hostile to their       need to express milk. Others simply stop breastfeeding       altogether, sometimes even before entering the workplace,       perceiving (typically correctly) the challenges as       insurmountable. Too many who continue in their jobs struggle       with harassment, health repercussions, and dwindling milk       supply to feed their babies. These challenges face many new       working parents, but disproportionately low-wage working       mothers of color. These harsh workplace conditions for       breastfeeding parents represent a fundamental unfairness and       inequity in our legal system--and reinforce the stereotype       that motherhood and employment are irreconcilable.        One worker who recently called A Better Balance's helpline,       Sarah, is a certified medication assistant at a large long-      term care facility in Kansas. Despite having thousands of       employees, her employer disparaged her and put up roadblock       after roadblock when she needed to pump at work, telling her       once ``I gave my baby the bottle--I couldn't imagine having a       baby attached to me.'' After her supervisor berated her for       needing to pump, and she attempted to find a space in the       office to pump to no avail because a co-worker walked in,       told her to ``hurry up'', and refused to leave the room,       Sarah resorted to pumping in her car just once a day. Even       then, her supervisor came to the parking lot to try and stop       her from pumping. Because she was only allowed to pump once a       day, she frequently became engorged and suffered painful       clogged milk ducts. Meanwhile, at least of six Sarah's co-      workers took smoke breaks multiple times a day without       comment or issue. The contrast is startling and deeply       upsetting.        Sarah is not alone in her struggle. I also shared Izabel's       story with the committee:        Izabel, a dental assistant in North Carolina, was fired       shortly after submitting a doctor's note requesting three 15-      minute pumping breaks during her shift. Prior to submitting       the note, she had requested pumping breaks and her employer       told her she could only pump once per day during her lunch       break--which did not medically meet her breastfeeding needs--      even though there were roughly three other dental assistants       working in the office who could have helped her with her job       duties while she took breaks. Although likely covered by the       2010 Break Time for Nursing Mothers Act, because of the law's       limited enforcement, Izabel's ability to get her job back or       be made whole were extremely limited.    Beastfeeding Has Myriad Benefits for Parents & Babies But, As We Know    Firsthand, Too Many Workplaces Lack Adequate Protections for Workers         Breastfeeding is increasingly common among American       parents. According to a recent study by the United States       Centers for Disease Control and Prevention survey, more than       84 percent of infants born in 2017 were breastfed for at       least some amount of time. The U.S. Dietary Guidelines for       Americans and the American Academy of Pediatrics recommend       exclusive breastfeeding for about 6 months, and continuing       breastfeeding while introducing complementary foods until a       baby is 12 months old or older. At the same time, more than       half of working parents return to their jobs before their       babies are three months old; twenty-five percent of workers       return within just two weeks of giving birth. This means that       working parents who wish to continue breastfeeding will need       to pump milk on a regular basis upon returning to work in       order to continue feeding their children and to avoid serious       health consequences. However, many parents returning to work       find it incredibly challenging to pump because they are not       provided with adequate break time or space to do so. This may       explain why, although 84 percent of infants born in 2017       breastfed for some period of time, only slightly more than 58       percent were still breastfeeding at six months.        The health benefits of breastfeeding are numerous. As I       outlined in my testimony:        Research shows that breastfeeding has substantial health       benefits for both mothers and babies. Breastfeeding protects       babies from acute illnesses, such as infections and diarrhea,       which can be serious especially in very young and vulnerable       babies like those born preterm, as well as from longer-term       conditions like childhood obesity and asthma. Likewise, as       Nikia Sankofa, the Executive Director of the U.S.       Breastfeeding Committee, made clear in testimony before the       House Subcommittee on Health, Employment, Labor, and Pensions       and the Subcommittee on Workforce Protections in January       2020, the health benefits for mothers who breastfeed are       significant, and include lower risk of breast cancer and       heart disease. Medical consensus urges breastfeeding infants       for at least their first year of life in order to achieve       these health benefits.       Current Federal Law Leaves Behind Millions of Lactating Workers         In 2010, Congress passed the Break Time for Nursing Mothers       Act as part of the Affordable Care Act. The law amended       section 7 of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (29 U.S.C.       207) and affords workers ``reasonable break time for an       employee to express breast milk for her nursing child for 1       year after the child's birth each time such employee has need       to express the milk'' and ``a place, other than a bathroom,       that is shielded from view and free from intrusion from       coworkers and the public, which may be used by an employee to       express breast milk.''        While groundbreaking, the 2010 law has three critical       problems: 1) it excludes millions of workers; 2) it has       inadequate remedies for employees whose rights have been       violated; and 3) it lacks clarity around breaks and       compensation.        1. Current law excludes millions of nursing parents. The       2010 law is housed in the overtime provisions of the Fair       Labor Standard Act (``FLSA'') which means that those workers       exempted from overtime--nearly nine million women of       childbearing age--are also excluded from the law's       protections. These millions of workers, including       transportation workers, executive, administrative and       professional workers, and many others, have no federal right       requiring their employer to provide them break time and space       to express breast milk. As I emphasized in my testimony,       ``There is no principled reason why these employees should be       denied the law's protections: each industry is fully capable       of standard or innovative solutions to ensure their employees       do not have to choose between breastfeeding and their jobs. .       . The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' Office on       Women's Health maintains an extensive and detailed website       describing how various industries, such as restaurant and       retail, can provide lactation break time and space, including       video testimonials, employer best practices examples, and       other resources. In 2021, there is simply no excuse not to       meet the needs of breastfeeding workers.''        2. Current law has inadequate remedies for workers who       experienced violations. Given the current law's placement in       the overtime provisions of the FLSA, the remedy for       violations of the Nursing Mothers law is misaligned.       Currently, the available remedy is to pay a worker any       overtime owed to them. As I explained to the Education and       Labor Committee in March,        ``Such a remedy makes sense in the context of overtime: an       employee who works forty-five hours in a week without       overtime pay should be compensated with the missing payment       to be made whole. For a breastfeeding worker who has been       denied time and space to pump, however, this remedy is       nonsensical. A breastfeeding worker who is told she cannot       clock out to pump has been denied an unpaid break. Therefore,       she has no entitlement to payment and the law's contemplated       remedy--compensation for wages--is meaningless to her . . .       These weak enforcement mechanisms are antithetical to the       goal of ensuring that breastfeeding workers can get the       timely accommodations they need to continue breastfeeding and       keep their jobs''        3. Current law lacks clarity regarding pumping breaks and       compensation. Under current law, pumping breaks that are not       taken during a paid break do not need to be paid. However,       often, workers who are pumping may clock out but will still       take phone calls, emails, or other work requests while       pumping, and are then denied compensation for their time       worked while pumping. Because the language in the law says       that breaks may be uncompensated, confusion persists and       violations can occur when employers continue to require       employees to work while taking an unpaid pumping break.   The PUMP Act Would Close Gaps in the Law, Provide Appropriate Remedies     for Employees, and Give Clarity Around Compensation. Alternative                   Proposals Fall Well Short of This Goal         The PUMP Act will close the gaps in current law and extend       the 2010 law's protections to nearly nine million employees       who are currently uncovered, including nurses, teachers, and       software engineers. Corporate leadership, coupled with       employees, advocates, and government agencies, have already       devised innovative, affordable, and flexible solutions for       nearly every workplace environment. In addition, the       Committee on Education & Labor also added language at the       bill markup requiring the U.S. Department of Labor to work       with the Department of Health and Human Services to build out       guidance for employers.        The legislation will also provide employers additional       clarity as to when break time can be unpaid, and will provide       remedies that are already available for other FLSA violations       if a worker's rights are violated. At the Education & Labor       Committee mark-up of the bill, the Committee also added       language ensuring fairness for employers by requiring       employees to inform their employers about inadequate space to       express breast milk 10 days before they file suit for       violating the requirement. The PUMP Act will benefit workers       and business alike, as there are well-recognized bottom-line       benefits for employers  [[Page H5814]]       in providing break time and space for lactating employees,       such as reduced absenteeism, lower healthcare costs, and       greater recruitment and retention. This is why the U.S.       Chamber of Commerce supports this legislation.        At the Committee markup, the minority introduced an       Amendment in the Nature of a Substitute, and subsequently, a       bill which mirrored that substitute amendment. Now, there is       an attempt to include this language again as a substitute       amendment to this bill. Although encouraging to see members       voice support for break time and space, this substitute       amendment does not afford the protections that breastfeeding       parents need because it does not address the two main       problems that the PUMP Act is addressing. The alternative       bill continues to exclude millions of workers from break time       and space protections and continues to leave workers with no       meaningful remedies. Supporting the alternative bill and not       the PUMP Act is hollow at best and offensive to working       parents who need real protections.        The PUMP Act will finally close the gaps in the law that       have left too many working parents without the ability to       pump at work and thrust into the painful position of choosing       between breastfeeding and their job. Congress has the       opportunity to right a fundamental wrong and pass the PUMP       Act. We urge you to support nursing parents in a meaningful       way and pass the PUMP Act.            Sincerely,                                                     Dina Bakst,                                          Co-Founder & Co-President,                                                  A Better Balance.     Madam Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume  to the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. Carolyn B. Maloney).    In closing, Madam Speaker, I urge all of my  colleagues to support this amendment that benefits all of us regardless  of our political affiliation. This is a bipartisan bill, it deserves  our support as well as the amendment, and I yield back the balance of  my time.
