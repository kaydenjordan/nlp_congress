 Madam President, I wish to pay tribute to a true  Michigan and American legend: the Dean of the House and my longtime  friend, Congressman John D. Dingell.   Congressman Dingell ably represented his district for 59 years, the  longest tenure of any Member in history. However, his service to our  Nation started long before that.   He was there on the House floor as a page on December 8, 1941, to  hear President Roosevelt declare that the bombing of Pearl Harbor was  ``a day which will live in infamy.'' Three years later, he joined the  Army to fight against Nazi Germany. He would have been in the Battle of  the Bulge if he hadn't been hospitalized with meningitis Later, he was  3 days away from shipping out to the Pacific Theater to take part in a  ground invasion of Japan when the atomic bombs were dropped.   So John Dingell proved his patriotism long before he joined Congress  in 1955, following the death of his beloved father, who preceded him as  Representative for Michigan's 15th Congressional District.   When he joined Congress, there was no Interstate Highway System.  Alaska and Hawaii were not yet States, and Medicare and Medicaid did  not exist yet. In fact, he helped vote these lifesaving programs into  law.   Congressman Dingell was not merely a witness to history. He was a  maker of it. His original family name, translated into Polish, meant  ``blacksmith.'' That was fitting because this was a man who hammered  out our Nation's laws, forging a stronger union that could weather the  challenges of the future.   Perhaps his most courageous vote occurred in 1964, in favor of the  Civil Rights Act. Advisers told him that vote would destroy his chances  at reelection; yet Congressman Dingell had faith in his constituents,  and he refused to compromise his principles for the sake of political  survival.   Healthcare was one of his passions, one that he inherited from his  father. John Dingell, Sr., introduced a bill for universal healthcare  in 1945 and continued to fight for it till the end of his life.   John Dingell, Jr., adopted that cause from his first day as his  father's successor. He always believed that every American should have  access to healthcare, and he never stopped working to make that goal a  reality.   As a boy, he lived through America's Great Depression, and as a  Congressman, he helped to overcome America's Great Recession.   He witnessed the rise of the automobile industry and saw how those  unionized workers built America's middle class. Then he led efforts  with me and others in the Michigan delegation to make sure that  American autos and American workers could compete on an even playing  field.   While scientific consensus was still forming about how pollution  threatened our air, land, and water, John Dingell wrote the Endangered  Species Act in 1973 and the major expansion of the Clean Air Act in  1990.   He led our efforts to create the first national wildlife refuge in  North America and teamed up with me and my friend and former colleague,  Senator Levin, to make the River Raisin Battlefield a national park.   John Dingell loved Michigan. He understood the connection our people  have to manufacturing, to agriculture, and to the land and our Great  Lakes.   Even during the years he spent chairing the House Energy and Commerce  Committee, when Congressman Dingell was one of the most powerful  Members of Congress, you could still find him riding atop a Ford  Mustang convertible at Dearborn's Memorial Day Parade or at a booth at  the Monroe County Fair.   The people of his district never doubted his dedication. That is why  they would still put ``Dingell for Congress'' signs on their lawn, long  after his district boundaries had changed. If a piece of Southeast  Michigan was ``Dingell Country'' once, then it was Dingell Country  forever.   This was not a man eager to retire; he loved his job too much. He  considered it an enormous privilege, one that gave meaning and purpose  to his life. He fought for his constituents until his health prevented  him from fighting anymore.   And he felt great pride and his constituents felt great comfort  knowing that the district would remain in the hands of his beloved  wife, Debbie, who was his closest confidant for more than 40 years and  understood him better than anyone.   I know that all of us are sending her and their family and many  friends our love and support at this time.  [[Page S1272]]    He certainly had many, many friends. He gained a whole new generation  of fans through his always-pithy Twitter account, and I am going to  miss reading his take on the news of the day.   Up until the very end, he was constantly evolving, charging boldly  into the future, driven by a very simple principle: ``We are put on  this earth to help people.'' That was just what he did.   John D. Dingell, Jr., claimed to be the ``luckiest man in shoe  leather.'' I have to say that Michigan and America were very lucky too.                            ____________________
