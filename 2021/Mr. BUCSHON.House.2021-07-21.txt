 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to the bill in  its current form. I support the efforts to address dangerous, high  levels of PFAS in our drinking water systems and other areas of our  environment. That is why I submitted a bipartisan amendment with Mr.  Schrader that would simply exempt PFAS used to manufacture medical  devices and drugs that are approved by the FDA. It was a very limited  amendment.   Polytetrafluoroethylene, or PTFE, seen in the graph on the board  behind me, is used to treat atrial septal defects, most of the time in  young children. Thanks to great advancements in medical technology like  this procedure, it is now done in an outpatient setting, rather than  open-heart surgery. For years, I did open-heart surgery on people with  ASDs, and now they can repair them with a device. This is one device  that could be banned.   Vascular grafts to repair aneurysms or bypass blocked arteries are  another example. I implanted hundreds of these type of devices in  patients. The fact of  [[Page H3776]]  the matter is, it has been shown over and over that PTFE in devices  poses no risk to people or to our environment. The bill in its current  form fails to consider that fact and jeopardizes patient access to  lifesaving drugs and devices, leaving physicians and patients with no  viable alternative or an inferior alternative. Would anyone want to be  treated with an inferior alternative when we are unnecessarily banning  the best treatment? I would argue no.   Unfortunately, my commonsense, bipartisan, lifesaving amendment was  not made in order. I hope this bill does continue to move through the  legislative process and that we can work to address this issue. I urge  a ``no'' vote on this bill.
