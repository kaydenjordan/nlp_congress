 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.   I thank Representatives  Bobby Scott and Susie Lee for their  leadership on this important resolution. I rise to support H.J. Res. 76  which blocks Secretary DeVos' attempts to undermine the much-needed  borrower defense rule.                                time  1015    The original rule was implemented in 2016 to cancel the debt of those  students defrauded by their colleges. The Secretary's replacement rule  is shameful. It would cancel only 3 percent of the student loans that  result from school misconduct.   While totally unacceptable, the Secretary's actions are nothing new.  The for-profit college industry has been exploiting students for  decades, and I have been fighting them back for just as long.   As an assemblywoman in California, I authored one of the Nation's  first laws regulating for-profit schools. As a Congresswoman, I passed  the 85/15 rule, which limited the amount of Federal funding for-profit  colleges receive from taxpayers.   In 2015, when the for-profit Corinthian Colleges closed down after  years of fraud and misconduct, I was one of the Members of Congress to  endorse and support the Corinthian 100, a group of former students who  refused to pay back loans accrued while attending Corinthian.   This Congress, I continue fighting for students. Last year, the House  Financial Services Committee held two hearings examining the student  loan crisis. Last month, the committee approved three bills that will  provide strong student borrower protections, including for those harmed  by for-profit colleges.   Congress should not stand idly by while Secretary DeVos tries to make  it easier for students to get defrauded by for-profit schools.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this resolution.
