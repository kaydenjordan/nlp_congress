 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, yesterday former CIA Director John  Brennan testified in the House Intelligence Committee that he had  growing concerns about Russian interference in the final months of the  2016 election, adding that an investigation into potential collusion  between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin was well founded. He issued  very strong words.   Coming from a very careful civil servant from the intelligence  community, Mr. Brennan's testimony should further compel Congress and  the special counsel to pursue the full truth. What Mr. Brennan said was  happening gets at the very core of our democracy, the free and fair  election of our representatives. Americans of all political stripes  should be outraged by what Putin and the Russians did during the 2016  elections. As former Director Brennan said, in America, ``we cherish  the ability to elect our own leaders without outside interference or  disruption.''   So, again, I expect that the Senate Intelligence Committee will  continue its bipartisan investigation into these events. I expect that  Special Counsel Mueller will help us all get to the bottom of this. We  must make sure he is not interfered with.   Finally, I expect this body will hold up a high standard for the next  FBI Director. He or she should be someone who is nonpartisan and  independent, a Director's Director, a prosecutor's prosecutor, not a  politician of either party.   Amidst all of the furor, we cannot lose sight of the most serious  part of  [[Page S3105]]  this investigation: the scope of Russian interference in our elections  and whether they colluded with representatives of an American campaign  in the process. That is very serious stuff--very serious. We must  pursue that investigation with vigor no matter who might stand in the  way of it.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on the budget, yesterday morning the  Trump administration released their 2018 budget. The document is  stunning in its cruelty. It takes a sledgehammer to the middle class,  the working poor, while lavishing tax breaks on the very wealthy.   They may not have intended it, but the Trump budget is a compilation  of all the broken promises this President made to working Americans. In  his budget, President Trump has broken promise after promise after  promise to working people without any shame, without any remorse,  without any explanation.   The President promised to increase infrastructure investment, but his  budget actually cuts more money from infrastructure programs than the  new money it puts in. The President's proposal to slash American  infrastructure investments is a job-killing 180-degree turn away from  his repeated promise of a $1 trillion infrastructure plan.   President Trump's campaign promises on infrastructure are crumbling  faster than our roads and bridges. I want to ask the Trump  administration: How can we expect that you are going to be real about a  trillion-dollar infrastructure plan when your budget cuts  infrastructure dramatically--right now? Don't you think it adds up? To  us, it does. It makes us very dubious of any attempt to do  infrastructure by this administration. We hope we are wrong, but the  budget is a document that tells where the real truth is in terms of  administration beliefs. They sure as heck, by this budget, don't like  infrastructure.   The President has said that education is the civil rights issue of  our time, but the Trump budget calls for over $3.2 billion in cuts to  higher education, eliminates programs that forgive loans for public  service jobs like teachers and doctors, and eliminates subsidized loan  programs that help lower the cost of college. College students of  America, look at the President's budget and see if he is on your side.  He sure as heck isn't.   The President said he would ``save Social Security, Medicare, and  Medicaid without cuts. Have to do it.'' Those are his words. But the  Trump budget slashes Social Security by $72 billion and cuts Medicaid  by hundreds of billions, in addition to the more than $800 billion  TrumpCare cuts took from Medicaid already in the House bill. All in  all, it is a $1 trillion broken promise on Medicaid.   Remember, America, Medicaid is a program that affects the poor. That  is a good thing. But much of the money goes to help the middle class,  elderly people in nursing homes, and families fighting opioid  addiction. So the bottom line is this is another broken promise to the  middle class that Trump made in the campaign.   The budget breaks promise after promise after promise the President  made to what he called the forgotten America, the working men and women  of America. Well, this budget forgot the forgotten American.   In addition, the Trump budget depends on fantasy math to make all the  numbers work. Most budgets make assumptions, and they all stretch the  math a little bit, but the Trump budget takes a quantum leap into a new  dimension of budgetary fairy tale.   Not only does the Trump budget assume unrealistic growth as a way to  balance the budget in 10 years--no economist, liberal or conservative,  thinks we can achieve 3 percent growth in the near term--but the Trump  budget double counts and double dips in a way we have never seen in any  budget before. The Trump budget includes the assumption they will pass  ``deficit-neutral tax reform.'' In order for their massive tax cut to  be deficit-neutral, they need to assume the economy grows fast enough  to make up for lost revenues. But at the same time, the Trump budget  assumes that growth will pay for tax cuts and help pay down the  deficit--both.   Take the estate tax as an example. President Trump has proposed  eliminating the estate tax in tax reform. Yet the Trump budget assumes  that the government will take in more than $300 billion in estate taxes  over the next 10 years. In other words, part of the budget says that we  are getting rid of the estate tax, and part of the budget says that  $300 billion the estate tax brings in is counted toward balancing the  budget. I have never seen anything like it. If an accountant did this,  my guess is--I don't know accounting standards in detail--they would be  kicked out of the accounting profession.   In short, as Benjamin Applebaum in the New York Times points out:  ``President Trump is proposing to balance the federal budget in part by  simultaneously increasing estate taxation and eliminating estate  taxation.''   Let me read that again. This is a reporter for the New York Times,  not some politician of a political party: ``President Trump is  proposing to balance the federal budget in part by simultaneously  increasing estate taxation and eliminating estate taxation.''   The gall, the nerve, and the facts-be-darned attitude in this budget  are appalling. What they said on the estate tax is a complete  contradiction. The government cannot take in money from a tax that no  longer exists. Where are our fiscal watchdogs on the other side of the  aisle when they do stuff like this?   Everyone knows Presidential budgets contain some degree of  flexibility, but what the Trump budget does is a quantum leap that  would make an accountant blush, if they could stay in their profession  after doing this. The budget is a total fantasy, a deeply unserious  proposal to Congress. Members of both parties are right to reject it,  and I applaud many of my Republican colleagues for speaking out against  this proposal.   Again, what will happen--my guess--is that Democrats and Republicans  will ignore the Trump budget because it is so harsh on the middle class  and because it is such an accounting nightmare. We will do our own  budget, and we will probably produce something pretty good for the  American people, as we did in 2017--as long as Donald Trump and the  White House stay out of it.                            ____________________     Finally, Mr. President, a word on healthcare: The  Republican attempts to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act,  combined with the Trump administration's refusal to commit to making  key cost-sharing payments that help keep healthcare costs low for  working Americans, have created great uncertainty in our healthcare  system. This uncertainty has already caused insurers to flee the  marketplace or propose rate increases for next year.   A spokesman for America's Health Insurance plans--that is the  insurance industry's main group; again, it is not a politician--said:         We need swift action and long-term certainty [on the cost-      sharing program]. It is the single most destabilizing factor       in the individual market, and millions of Americans could       soon feel the impact of fewer choices, higher costs and       reduced access to care.    My Republican colleagues, remember, if you continue to allow the  President to do this, if we don't make cost sharing permanent, the  system will deteriorate, and guess whose back it will be on? Yours, my  Republican friends. You are in charge. And when people get a bad  healthcare bill, you can blame anyone you want. You are in charge. Fix  it.   Refusing to guarantee the cost-sharing payment is nothing short of  sabotage, and the repeated attempts to pass TrumpCare will only make  things worse.   The White House ought to step up and say once and for all that they  will continue to make the cost-sharing payments permanently, and  Republicans in Congress ought to drop their repeal efforts and,  instead, work with us on stabilizing the market and improving our  healthcare system.   Now, today the Congressional Budget Office will release its analysis  of the House Republican healthcare bill--TrumpCare. I remind my  colleagues how unusual it is for a CBO score to come out nearly 3 weeks  after a bill has passed. It is like test driving a brand new car 3  weeks after you have  [[Page S3106]]  already signed on the dotted line and paid the dealer in full.   Republicans in the House were so worried about how bad the CBO score  might be, they rushed TrumpCare through--no hearings, no debate, no  score. Never mind that this legislation remakes one-sixth of our  Nation's economy. It has life-and-death consequences for millions of  American families.   Republicans were haunted by the ghost of CBO scores past, so they  went ahead without one.   When the CBO analyzed the first version of TrumpCare earlier this  year, it concluded that 24 million fewer Americans would have health  insurance if it became law. We also learned the bill would gut  Medicaid, crush seniors with higher premiums, and would increase out- of-pocket expenses for Americans of all ages with higher deductibles  and copays.   Given that there were few differences between the first and second  versions of TrumpCare, we can expect that today's CBO analysis will  likely show many of the same grave consequences as the first one. Only  now, of course, TrumpCare includes a new amendment that allows States  to opt out of the requirement to cover people with preexisting  conditions. It is hard to imagine such an amendment would make CBO's  score any better than the last, and it could certainly raise a lot of  new questions.   Does the deal the Freedom Caucus got with the second version of  TrumpCare violate the rules of reconciliation? Will the House have to  change the bill and take yet another vote on TrumpCare? We know they  don't want to do that.   We also don't know the answer to these questions, and we may not know  the answers even after seeing today's CBO analysis. But all of these  open questions demonstrate how reckless it was for Republicans to vote  on this bill without properly vetting it first.   I yield the floor to my good friend, the senior Senator from Vermont,  the former and hopefully future Senate President pro tempore.                            ____________________
