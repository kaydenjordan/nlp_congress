 Madam Speaker, the Supreme Court is poised to make one of  the most consequential rulings for women and their bodies in over a  generation. For nearly 50 years, women have come to rely upon the  precedent of Roe v. Wade and the freedom to make their own reproductive  decisions without government interference in our personal lives. Now  our freedoms are under attack as the Court considers a case asking for  Roe v. Wade to be overturned.   As an adoption attorney for 25 years, I worked with more than 300  birth mothers making the most difficult and personal decision of their  lives. They consulted family, loved ones, and doctors, but not one  birth mother looked to the government to make that choice for her.   Earlier this year we passed the Women's Health Protection Act,  legislation to codify the constitutional right to safe, legal abortion.  Regardless of the Court's decision, we must make this bill law to  permanently protect the reproductive freedoms of women across this  land.                            ____________________
