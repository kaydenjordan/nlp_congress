 Madam Speaker, today, I recognize the legacy of service  and leadership of Michael Pollack, a resident of Arizona's Fifth  Congressional District. I join him in celebrating his 50th year as  president and founder of Pollack Investments, which specializes in  commercial restoration and renovation projects, specifically long-term  investments in shopping centers and other multi-tenant locations.   In his industry, many developers will look at a property that has  fallen into disrepair and see only a building ripe for destruction. In  his own words, Michael sees ``each real estate project as an  opportunity to enhance the fabric of Arizona's cities one development  at a time.''   Whether refusing to take advantage of those affected by the housing  crash or working with tenants to make it through the COVID era without  closing their doors, Michael has always remained focused on protecting  the overall economic and social health of our cities and their  residents.   Michael's enduring legacy is one of inspiration, renewal, and  compassion. He set new standards in his industry and community. He has  made an immeasurable impact on the lives of countless Arizonans.   On behalf of Arizona's Fifth Congressional District, I thank Michael  for inspiring others with his unwavering commitment to making our  communities better than he found them, one development at a time. I pay  homage to Michael Pollack and congratulate him.                            ____________________
