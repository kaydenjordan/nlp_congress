 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, the Russian assault on Ukraine continues  unabated. Each morning seems to bring a fresh horror. In the last few  days alone, we have seen the Russians bomb an arts school where as many  as 400 civilians had taken cover. We have seen the bombing of a theater  where an estimated 1,300 women and children and the elderly were  sheltered--not a military target, a theater providing shelter to  civilians, to children--a theater that was clearly labeled with the  word ``children.'' That is right. On the pavement outside, in large  white letters, visible in satellite images, was the word ``children''  written in Russian.   So it is pretty impossible that the Russians didn't know what or who  they were bombing. But they bombed anyway.   And this is just one example of the depravity of the Russian siege of  Mariupol, which has largely destroyed this port city. Residents in  Mariupol are without electricity, without running water, at times  without food. As important as words are, they fail when it comes to  describing the horrors that Ukrainians are experiencing, the inferno  that so many of them now exist in on a daily basis.   As we go about our lives in peace and security, most of us have no  notion of what it means to live where air raid sirens have become  commonplace, where bombed-out buildings line the streets you used to  walk on, where crossing a road or leaving a building at the wrong  moment can mean your death. The pictures convey some of the horror--the  postapocalyptic streetscapes, the buildings gray with ash, the gaping  holes in apartment blocks and businesses--images akin to the bombed-out  cities seen in old World War II photographs, the total destruction of  once vibrant places.   Mariupol is perhaps the foremost example of the devastation Russia  has wrought. The last EU diplomat to leave that city summed up the  situation in stark words on Sunday:   [[Page S1276]]              What I saw, I hope no one will ever see. Mariupol will       become part of a list of cities that were completely       destroyed by war.    ``What I saw, I hope no one will ever see. Mariupol will become part  of a list of cities that were completely destroyed by war.'' We don't  have to look far for the source of these horrors; they can be  attributed to one man, to Vladimir Putin.   To achieve his vision of a Russian Empire, he has laid waste to the  country of Ukraine; thousands of lives sacrificed, on both sides,  because he wants Ukraine, because he thinks Ukraine should be part of  Russia. It doesn't matter that the people of Ukraine have made it  unmistakably clear that they are their own people and a sovereign  nation willing to lay down their lives for their freedom. Putin wants  Ukraine, and he is apparently willing to destroy Ukraine to get it.   All this evil, all this destruction, so many--so many--human lives  wasted all because of one man's fixation on a Russian Empire. More than  3.3 million refugees have fled Ukraine, including at least 1.5 million  children, and around 6.5 million Ukrainians are internally displaced.  That amounts to roughly one-quarter of Ukraine's population forced from  their homes. And the numbers continue to grow.   Last week, President Zelenskyy addressed Congress. In powerful words,  he outlined a situation in Ukraine and asked for additional help as  Ukrainians battle for their country. I am proud that the United States  has provided Ukraine with substantial military assistance and has put  in place strong sanctions against Russia, including sanctioning the  lifeblood of the Russian economy, which is the Russian energy sector.   But, Mr. President, we have to do more. However much current  sanctions have hit the Russian economy, Putin is still prosecuting his  war of aggression in Ukraine, and so we have to do more. We have to  send the message, unequivocally, that Russia will be an outcast from  the free world until it withdraws from Ukraine.   There are additional sanctions the United States can put in place,  and we need to immediately get to work unleashing American energy  production so we can provide energy to our allies in Europe and lessen  their dependence on energy from Russia. Every dollar--every dollar-- that goes to purchase Russian energy is a dollar that Russia can use to  finance its war of aggression.   The United States has correctly banned Russian oil and gas imports;  now we need to help our allies in Europe permanently divest themselves  of their reliance on Russian energy. Congress needs to act immediately  on legislation to suspend Russia's favorable trading status. Membership  at the World Trade Organization should be limited to countries that  don't launch unprovoked wars on their neighbors. We also need to  continue our shipments of arms to Ukraine. And the President needs to  find a way to further enhance Ukrainian air defenses, whether that  involves sending the S-300 air defense systems that President Zelenskyy  asked for, or armed drones, or facilitating the transfer of MiG  aircraft from NATO countries to the Ukrainian Air Force, or all of the  above.   Russia is currently unleashing devastation from the skies of  Ukrainian cities, and we need to find a way of helping Ukrainians to  reduce or eliminate that threat.   Finally, we need to make sure that while we are sanctioning Russia on  the one hand, we are not enriching it on the other with things like an  Iran deal that could see Russia benefit to the tune of $10 billion.   The people of Ukraine are not waiting for anyone to come and save  them. They are fighting with everything they have to save their  country, but they are asking for our help. They need arms and resources  and humanitarian assistance to sustain their fight against Russian  forces that are increasingly showing less and less restraint. And they  are relying on us--on us--on our shared belief in freedom and self- determination, on our shared commitment to human liberty.   The Ukrainian people know what they want to be and that is a free  people in a free country, and they have the will to stay in this fight.  They just need our help. Let's not let them down.
