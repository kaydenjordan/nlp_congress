 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Jenny  Gentry, who has been selected as the 2023 recipient of the Legacy of  Leadership Award from the Girl Scouts of Historic Georgia.   The Legacy of Leadership Award honors a woman who is a Girl Scout  alum and has made a significant impact in the local community.   A native of Atlanta, Jenny made Savannah her home after graduating  from college. She joined JPMorgan Chase in May 2019 on the commercial  banking team covering the Savannah area and surrounding communities.   Since moving to Savannah, Jenny has been active in the community,  serving on a number of civic and nonprofit boards. She is currently the  board chair for Goodwill Southeast Georgia and has previously served as  the board chair of the Savannah Area Chamber of Commerce, YMCA of the  Coastal Empire, and United Way.   Jenny also serves on the Savannah Community Foundation Board, as well  as the Chatham-Savannah Homeless Authority.   I thank Jenny for her continued dedication to the Savannah community  and congratulate her on the well-deserved honor.                            ____________________
