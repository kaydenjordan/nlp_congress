 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   H.R. 132, sponsored by Congressman Tom Cole of Oklahoma, conveys two  buildings and two acres of land of the federal Arbuckle Project to the  Arbuckle Master Conservancy District in Oklahoma. The district has  operated and maintained the project for decades, and completed  repayment of its capital costs for the project in 2012.   While non-controversial, legislation is necessary in order to  facilitate this and other Bureau of Reclamation title transfers. Under  current law, these buildings and land remain in federal ownership until  legislation is enacted to transfer the title to the District. Mr.  Cole's bill achieves this objective.   This title transfer is a win-win for the District and the federal  government. The District will no longer be subject to certain federal  paperwork requirements and the federal government will be relieved of  all future liability and financial responsibilities associated with  these facilities and land.   I urge adoption of the measure, which overwhelmingly passed the House  on a bipartisan basis in the last Congress.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Webster of Florida). The question is on  the motion offered by the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Webster) that the  House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 132.   The question was taken.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds  being in the affirmative, the ayes have it.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further  proceedings on this motion will be postponed.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to take from the  Speaker's table the joint resolution (S.J.

General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous materials on the bill under consideration.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Colorado?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 648, sponsored by the gentlewoman from Wyoming (Ms.  Cheney), allows the State of Wyoming to increase the active storage  capacity for the Fontenelle Dam and Reservoir located in southwest  Wyoming. The bill allows the State to enter into agreements with the  Federal Government to study, design, plan, and perform construction  activities to accomplish this goal. Wyoming will pay for any and all  costs associated with these activities.   This bill, which passed the House without objection in the last  Congress when it was sponsored by our former colleague Cynthia Lummis,  simply empowers Wyoming to better utilize its Colorado River water  allocation through improved water storage at no cost to the Federal  Government. I urge my colleagues to support this commonsense bill.   Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the measure, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to the  gentlewoman from Wyoming (Ms. Cheney).    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to the  gentlewoman from Wyoming (Ms. Cheney).

The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 267         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Martin Luther King, Jr.       National Historical Park Act of 2017''.       SEC. 2. MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR. NATIONAL HISTORICAL PARK.         The Act entitled ``An Act to establish the Martin Luther       King, Junior, National Historic Site in the State of Georgia,       and for other purposes'' (Public Law 96-428) is amended--        (1) in subsection (a) of the first section, by striking       ``the map entitled `Martin Luther King, Junior, National       Historic Site Boundary Map', number 489/80,013B, and dated       September 1992'' and inserting ``the map entitled `Martin       Luther King, Jr. National Historical Park Proposed Boundary       Revision', numbered 489/128,786 and dated June 2015'';        (2) by striking ``Martin Luther King, Junior, National       Historic Site'' each place it appears and inserting ``Martin       Luther King, Jr. National Historical Park'';        (3) by striking ``national historic site'' each place it       appears and inserting ``national historical park''; and        (4) by striking ``historic site'' each place it appears and       inserting ``historical park''.       SEC. 3. REFERENCES.         Any reference in a law (other than this Act), map,       regulation, document, paper, or other record of the United       States to ``Martin Luther King, Junior, National Historic       Site'' shall be deemed to be a reference to ``Martin Luther       King, Jr. National Historical Park''.    The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from  Colorado (Mr. Tipton) and the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Brown) each  will control 20 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Colorado.                                general leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous materials on the bill under consideration.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Colorado?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous materials on the bill under consideration.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Colorado?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 267, introduced by Congressman John Lewis,  redesignates the Martin Luther King, Junior, National Historic Site in  the State of Georgia as the Martin Luther King, Jr. National Historical  Park. It also authorizes the National Park Service to include the  Prince Hall Masonic Temple in the historical park's boundaries.   The Prince Hall Masonic Temple long served as the headquarters of the  Southern Christian Leadership Conference. This well-known civil rights  organization was cofounded by Dr. King, who also served as its first  president. Including the Prince Hall Masonic Temple within the unit's  boundaries will allow the National Park Service to provide technical  assistance to the building's owners with regard to repairs,  renovations, and maintenance that will preserve its historic integrity.   Our Nation's historic sites and historical parks provide us with the  unique opportunity to share the very spaces in which the generations  before us lived and worked. At these sites, Americans are able to  metaphorically walk in the footsteps of our Nation's Founders and of  those who followed them and perfected their vision for our country. At  this time of division in our country, it is important to be able to  look back at leaders like Martin Luther King, Jr., who promoted unity  and the dignity of the human person.   Congressman Lewis' bill before the House today will expand  opportunities for Americans to learn about the legacy of Dr. King and  other icons of the civil rights movement. I urge adoption of this  legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no additional speakers, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no additional speakers, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.   Mr. JODY B. HICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I take great pleasure that  we may come to the floor today to celebrate and recognize the  remarkable legacy of Martin Luther King, Jr. King is characterized by  modeling his life after Jesus Christ in order to live a life dedicated  to the service of others, whether that be preaching the Gospel to his  congregation at Ebenezer Baptist Church, or to the pursuit of justice  and equality.   Mr. Speaker, my home state of Georgia has the great honor of  preserving King's legacy at the Martin Luther King, Jr. National  Historic Site. And today we have the opportunity under the leadership  of my friend and fellow Georgian, John Lewis, to pass H.R. 267, the  Martin Luther King, Jr. National Historical Park Act, to re-designate  the site as a National Historic Park.   I strongly believe that this site meets and exceeds the requirements  for re-designation as a National Historic Park and fully support my  friend in his effort. Mr. Speaker, I'd like to thank Congressman Lewis  for leading this legislation. As a cosponsor of this bill, a member of  the Committee on Natural Resources, and as a fellow Georgian, I offer  my strongest support and encourage my colleagues to vote in favor of  H.R. 267.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the  gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Tipton) that the House suspend the rules  and pass the bill, H.R. 267, as amended.   The question was taken.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds  being in the affirmative, the ayes have it.    Mr. Speaker, I object to the vote on the ground that a  quorum is not present and make the point of order that a quorum is not  present.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further  proceedings on this question will be postponed.   The point of no quorum is considered withdrawn.                            ____________________
