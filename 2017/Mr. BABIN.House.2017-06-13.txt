 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2581, the Verify  First Act, which will put important safeguards in place to ensure that  federal tax dollars are not fraudulently used to pay for illegal  immigrants to enroll in Obamacare.   Right now, the federal government provides Obamacare premium tax  credits to individuals before fully making sure that these individuals  rightfully qualify for these benefits.   For example, the federal government has wrongfully issued hundreds of  millions of dollars in tax credits to individuals without first  verifying their immigration status. After the money goes out the door,  the Internal Revenue Service must attempt to track down these  individuals to recoup the money.  [[Page H4883]]    Last year the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Government  Affairs reported that more than $750 million in taxpayer dollars went  to 500,000 people who did not meet the qualifications for those  benefits.   H.R. 2581 addresses this issue by requiring that the Social Security  Administration, the Department of Homeland Security and the Department  of Health and Human Services to certify that an individual is a  citizen, national, or legal immigrant before they receive a health care  tax credit.   Given that our nation is nearly $20 trillion in debt, we cannot  afford to hand out hundreds of millions of dollars in Obamacare tax  credits to individuals who do not qualify.   This bill is a common-sense measure that puts the interests of  hardworking taxpayers first and ensures that health care dollars will  be directed only at those who are eligible.   I hope that the Senate will soon take up and pass this commonsense  bill.
