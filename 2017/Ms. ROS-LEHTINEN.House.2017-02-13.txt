 Mr. Speaker, I am so honored that the gentleman  from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer) is here to listen to this important 1 minute,  as he always does.   Israel Bonds recently hosted its annual award ceremony at the  Fontainebleau Hotel located in Miami Beach, in my congressional  district.   For over 30 years, Mr. Speaker, Israel Bonds has honored members of  the Jewish community from all over the country who have made an  incredible impact on the U.S.-Israel relationship and who have helped  make Israel's economy one of the world's strongest.   I have had the privilege of working with Israel Bonds over the years  and the many individuals who helped make its mission such a success.   One of those individuals, who I know is a friend of the gentleman  from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), Alex Halberstein, was honored with the  Israel69 Award for his commitment to strengthening the economy of the  democratic Jewish State of Israel.   Mr. Speaker, Alex is the chairman of Israel Bonds for south Florida.  Alex and his wife, Monique, are deserving of such a high honor. I  congratulate them both for such a tremendous achievement.                            ____________________
