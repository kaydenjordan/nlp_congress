 Mr. Speaker, today, I rise in opposition to President  Biden's student loan scam and urge my colleagues on both sides of the  aisle to vote to override President Biden's veto of H.J. Res. 45, which  would overturn this ridiculous misuse of taxpayer dollars and transfer  of wealth from the working class to our country's most wealthy and  educated citizens.   Mr. Speaker, middle Tennessee is home to many hardworking, blue- collar workers who do everything they can to provide for their families  and live within their means. Many of them made tough decisions to  forego attending college to pursue careers in skilled trades like  becoming an electrician, a plumber, or carpenter, each valuable skill  sets and careers that keep our communities running and provide services  we could never live without.   In fact, 66 percent of the folks in Tennessee's Sixth Congressional  District have no college degree. This, along with those who responsibly  took out student loans and paid them back, means that an estimated  759,000 people whom I represent are ineligible for the Biden  administration's proposed student loan giveaway.   To put this into perspective, the total population of Tennessee's  Sixth Congressional District is 768,525. A whopping 98.7 percent of  folks whom I represent will never see a penny of the billions being  wasted on this ill-guided proposal. What is even worse is that it will  cost the folks of my district an estimated $1.53 billion, or almost  $2,000 per individual.   At a time when the U.S. national debt has surpassed $32 trillion for  the first time in our country's history, meaning that each citizen owes  almost $100,000 of the national debt, the last thing Americans need,  and that Tennesseans need, is another 2,000 in debt to pay for other  people's decisions to pursue college degrees.   Mr. Speaker, when we debated this legislation on the floor  previously, I said that America is a country built on the idea of  freedom. Freedom does not mean freedom from individual responsibility,  but freedom from unreasonable constraints. By forcing Tennesseans to  foot the bill for the college degrees of wealthy lawyers and doctors in  New York and California, President Biden is chipping away at our  freedom.   Back home in my district, where the median household income is  $57,373, President Biden's student loan bailout will cost almost an  entire paycheck for the hardworking folks of Tennessee's Sixth  District.    Now, Mr. Speaker, I encourage the President and those who support  this transfer of wealth from blue-collar folks of Tennessee to coastal  elites to take a visit to my constituents and tell them this news that  their hard-earned paychecks will be going to some of the most well- educated and wealthy Americans in our country.   I have a feeling that a lot of folks who support this policy would  have a hard time going door-to-door taking paychecks away from people  without college degrees so that those with college degrees can reap the  rewards and benefits of the President's policy.   Mr. Speaker, let's call this proposal what it is: An election-year  gimmick that has no chance of ever becoming law through the normal  procedures of being passed by the House and the Senate. Even some  Democrats understand this policy is just plain wrong and that is why  they joined Republicans to pass this legislation, which would have  stopped this proposal in its track.   Now is our chance to override the President's veto. Let's hope more  commonsense and fiscally responsible Democrats will join us to send a  message to the President to reverse course on this disastrous decision.    Mr. Speaker, President Biden's and Secretary Mayorkas'  handling of our southern border has made every State, including my home  State of Tennessee, a border State. Now, illegal immigrants are being  housed in public schools, threatening our children's ability to learn.   House Republicans are denouncing this heinous action by passing H.  Res. 461, which condemns the use of public school facilities to house  illegal immigrants.   Housing illegal immigrants at public schools diverts resources from  students already suffering from historic learning loss. Additionally,  schools with summer programs or activities will now be forced to  consider the additional security threat housing illegal immigrants at  their facilities poses.   Mr. Speaker, if the Biden administration would work with Republicans  to secure the border, this wouldn't be happening. However, since it is,  we must condemn it, which is why I urge Members to join me in  supporting H. Res. 461.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from New Jersey for  yielding me time tonight.   Mr. Speaker, this weekend, on June 24, marks one whole year since the  landmark Supreme Court decision that overturned Roe v. Wade. As we look  back and celebrate this occasion as a win for all those that believe in  the sanctity of life from the moment of conception, I can't help but  wonder how many lives have been saved just since this decision.   Of course, there is still more work to be done, but I am forever  thankful for those across our great country, including in my home State  of Tennessee, who helped achieve this victory. From those who have  traveled and continued to travel to our Nation's Capital every year  since 1974 to march for life, to the many volunteers and professional  counselors who provide caring services to mothers at crisis pregnancy  centers all across the country, this was truly a national movement.   Showing great insight at the time, our Tennessee State legislature  took decisive action prior to the Dobbs v. Jackson decision to outlaw  most abortions the moment this decision was returned to the States.   I couldn't be prouder of our State of Tennessee, which has become a  leader in the pro-life movement in recent years.   Now innocent, unborn children have the legal protection they so  desperately needed. I believe we must continue our efforts to protect  children from gender mutilating surgeries, the horrid sexualization of  our children's classrooms and libraries by drag queen performances on  public property, and to protect the ability of women to play sports  against other women.   As a Christian, a father, and a husband I will always stand up for  what is right for our families and fight back against the left's attack  against our conservative Christian beliefs. Just like with Roe v. Wade,  I believe we will be victorious.   Mr. Speaker, I ask all Members present in the Chamber to join me in a  moment of silence for those millions of unborn babies who lost their  chance to live out the life God meant them to have to the horrid  practice of abortion.
