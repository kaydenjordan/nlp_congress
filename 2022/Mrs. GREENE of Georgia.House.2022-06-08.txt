 In 1990, our schools became gun-free school  zones, and on September 6, 1990, when I was 16 years old, my high  school went on lockdown because one of the students at my school  brought three guns to school in a duffel bag on the school bus, brought  the guns into our school, and proceeded to take control of our high  school. And he was the only person in the school who had guns. That is  why that happened.   There was no one to protect us who had a gun that day. The only  person with guns was the very mentally ill, upset teenager who had  brought guns to school that day to kill other students. I know that  fear. As a matter of fact, I think I am the only Member of Congress  that that has actually happened to.   I am also a mom. I have dropped off my kids at school for years,  wondering would this happen at my children's school. Would they face a  terrible fate like the poor children in Uvalde? This should never  happen to our children, and I can't help but point out to all of us  here, while we are debating how to protect our kids in school and we  are debating our Second Amendment gun rights, I want to point out that  we are all so privileged to be in this building being protected by  armed guards with guns who are protecting our lives.   It is shocking to me that this body of Congress won't do the same  thing for children in schools all over America because we know one  thing works. We know that a gun is a tool, and it is a weapon that can  be used to defend yourself or defend others. We are all lucky enough to  have that privilege, but our schoolchildren aren't.   If we really want to be serious about protecting our kids here in  America, we will repeal the Gun-Free School Zones Act, and we will put  into action real legislation that protects children in schools  everywhere, all over America, with good guys with guns, the same way we  are being protected.
