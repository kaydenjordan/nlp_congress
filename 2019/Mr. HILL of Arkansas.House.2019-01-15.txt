 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize Tommy  May and his inspirational example of leadership throughout his life and  courage in battling ALS.   May served in Vietnam in the United States Marine Corps before  returning home to the University of Arkansas and the Walton College to  earn his degree in business. He would go on to establish a remarkable  banking career, eventually becoming president and CEO of Simmons First  National Bank in 1987.   In 2005, May was diagnosed with ALS, also known as Lou Gehrig's  disease, becoming one of about 20,000 people living with that disease  in the United States. Although statistics show that the average  survival time is only 3 years, May has survived far longer, continuing  his leadership for more than a decade at Simmons First National Bank  and at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences.   Since his diagnosis, he has helped spearhead a new effort at UAMS to  speed up research on the disease. He has been recognized for those  efforts by the university. My friend's example of perseverance and  courage in continuing to live his life on his own terms is one that all  Americans and Arkansans can admire.
