 Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the outstanding service and  retirement of one of California's finest, Cathedral City Police Chief  George S. Crum, Jr. Chief Crum is an exceptional leader in the  community, dedicating his life to public service for over three  decades.   He started his career 30 years ago as a police officer with the  Fullerton Police Department. His commitment to keeping our citizens  safe earned him many promotions over the years, from sergeant, to  lieutenant, and, eventually, captain of the Fullerton Police  Department. He was appointed as police chief of the Cathedral City  Police Department on December 10, 2014, and recently retired on  November 2, 2017.   Throughout his career, his dedication to community engagement has  helped to ensure justice and build a strong community. He is a member  of numerous organizations that promote safety throughout California,  including the Riverside County Law Enforcement  [[Page H8605]]  Administrators Association, the Coachella Valley Association of  Governments, and the California Police Chiefs Association.   Not only has he been a strong leader in law enforcement across the  region, Chief Crum is also a leader in molding the minds of our  students. He was an instructor at Fullerton College for nearly 20  years, and he is currently a Public Safety Academy instructor at  College of the Desert in the valley. He serves as a mentor to the next  generation of law enforcement leaders in our region, inspiring them to  serve their own communities.   I am so humbled to have worked with him over the years to keep the  public safe, and I am proud to call him a friend. It has also been my  honor to work with him on legislation to provide robust benefits to the  families of public safety officers killed in the line of duty.   Chief Crum has given so much to the community over the years, and I  have a feeling this will continue even in his retirement.   So on behalf of my wife, Monica, and the entire 36th Congressional  District, I want to thank Chief Crum; his wife, Rebecca; and his  children, Dylan and Madison, from the bottom of my heart, for their  service and sacrifice to keep our communities safe.   While we are sad to see him retire, I wish him and his family the  best during his well-deserved retirement.                  Recognizing Pete M. Ortiz on Veterans Day     Mr. Speaker, this week, on Veterans Day, we honor those who  have bravely served in our Nation's military. Our veterans served with  incredible selflessness; they served with great courage; and they  served with sacrifice, often leaving behind spouses, children, and  loved ones to keep our Nation safe and to protect the freedoms we hold  so dear. For this, our veterans and their families have earned our  respect and our deep debt of gratitude.   On Veterans Day, we take a moment to pause and reflect on their  service. So today, I want to recognize the life of one of my district's  finest members, Pete M. Ortiz.   Mr. Ortiz passed away on September 14, 2017, at the age of 76. He  came from a family that has committed themselves to serving our country  in uniform for generations. Since World War II, over 50 members--50  members--of the Ortiz family have bravely served in our Armed Forces,  putting their lives on the line to protect our freedoms.   Following his family's legacy, Mr. Ortiz honorably served in the Army  National Guard from 1956 to 1960. He was awarded the Marksman Badge and  Pistol Bar, an honor presented to soldiers with high marksmanship  skills. I was proud to help obtain and personally present him with  these medals for his distinguished service.   Mr. Ortiz was also a beloved member of the Coachella Valley. Not only  was he a carpenter and avid fisherman, he was part of a unique desert  skydive team, the Desert Skydivers of Coachella.   All those who knew him remember his zest for life and devotion to  family. One of his greatest joys was getting his entire family together  for a barbecue. His family remembers his masterful skills for grilling,  especially carne asada, and his dream of one day opening his own taco  stand.   To his wife, Patricia, and children, Pete, Tina, Sherry, and Sally,  your father was an example to us all. His bravery, selflessness, and  courage in the military are an inspiration challenging us to better  serve our own communities. His adventures and curious spirit are a  reminder to us all to live life to the fullest and enjoy the people and  places that bring us joy.   So on behalf of my wife, Monica, and my daughters, Sky and Sage, we  honor the service and legacy of Mr. Ortiz and his entire family.   From the bottom of our hearts, we thank all of our veterans for their  dedication and sacrifice for our country as we honor their service this  Veterans Day.                            ____________________     Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 3043, the  Hydropower Policy Modernization Act, which undercuts Federal-Tribal  treaty and trust obligations. In fact, parts of this bill specifically  eliminate protection for Tribes and ensure that dams and other  hydropower projects do not harm Tribal fisheries, livelihoods, or  violate treaty rights.   This is unacceptable. Not only does this undermine Tribal  sovereignty, but it flies in the face of our moral and legal obligation  to protect Tribal treaties, land, and resources under the Federal trust  responsibility.   I am especially disappointed that the majority had the opportunity to  fix this issue, yet walked away from the table. Even though I brought  this up as an issue to fix in committee, the majority rushed this bill  through committee for a House vote without adequately addressing Tribal  concerns.                                time  1430    Furthermore, the majority refused to make in order my amendment,  meaning they denied the fix to empower Tribes to set reasonable  conditions on hydropower projects to protect their reservation and  resources. In fact, the letter sent by Democratic Ranking Member  Pallone requesting a hearing to allow Tribal input and Tribal  participation on this particular issue was left unanswered.   So I say this to those Republicans who do support Tribal sovereignty  and self-determination: You can still fix this issue and improve the  Federal hydropower licensing process, simultaneously, while still  protecting Tribal treaty rights, by supporting the Rush substitute  amendment.   Join the Democratic Rush amendment that includes language to empower  Tribal governments to determine when a project may harm their Tribe.  Without this fix, this bill undermines Tribal governments and harms  resources and lands, therefore, putting energy profits above Tribal  treaty rights.   I urge my colleagues to take a stand. Do not ignore your  responsibility to Tribes when it matters most. Support the Democratic  substitute amendment sponsored by Representative Rush that preserves  the responsibility of the Federal Government to honor treaty  obligations and protect Tribal resources.
