 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, on Friday, the chairman of the Judiciary  Committee, Chuck Grassley, sent a letter to the George W. Bush Library  requesting only a small portion of Judge Kavanaugh's records.  Traditionally, letters from the Senate Judiciary Committee requesting  the records for a Supreme Court nominee have been bipartisan and  complete. When Democrats were in the majority, we joined with the  Republican minority to request all--not some, all--of Elena Kagan's  White House documents. When Democrats were in the majority, we joined  with the Republican minority to request all--not some--of Judge  Sotomayor's documents. At Republicans' insistence, that included  documents from 30 years ago, when she served as a board member of the  Puerto Rican Legal Defense and Education Fund, because they had  questions about her views on certain of those issues. It was a request  that we thought stretched a little far, but we went along for the sake  of transparency and openness. So this idea that it should be only the  legal records is totally undone and gainsaid by what they requested of  Judge Sotomayor.   Now the Republicans are in the majority, and the shoe is on the other  foot. Chairman Grassley, unfortunately, has broken with all precedent  and refused Democratic requests for Judge Kavanaugh's full record. He  sent a letter to the Archivist at 5 p.m. Friday--that is usually a time  when people do things they don't want people to catch wind of--making  such a request.   My Republican colleagues know that this was wrong. That is why they  sent it so late on a Friday, hoping to bury it. This letter makes it  clear that Republicans intend to block the Senate and the American  people from access to the bulk of Judge Kavanaugh's White House  records.   So the question looms: What are they hiding? What are they afraid of?  Why wouldn't they grant the kind of openness to records that America  prides itself on? Why wouldn't they grant a request for openness of  records when we are going to vote on someone who will have huge power  over the lives of average Americans for a whole generation? Why  shouldn't we see what that record is about before we vote?   In this letter, Senate Republicans are requesting only documents from  2 of the 5 years that Judge Kavanaugh was in the White House--only  documents from his time in the White House Counsel's office, not as  Staff Secretary. But Staff Secretary was the most senior job in the  White House the nominee held. In Judge Kavanaugh's own words, the  position of Staff Secretary was hugely influential in his career. He  worked there during a time of great controversy.   Over the weekend, the New York Times reported, for instance, that as  Staff Secretary, Brett Kavanaugh likely oversaw President Bush's  controversial signing statements on torture. By his own account, he was  involved in President Bush's decision to select a Supreme Court  Justice. Why the heck that is not relevant to choosing him as a Supreme  Court Justice is beyond explanation. They can't give an explanation;  they just want to rush it through.   There is no good reason to argue that Judge Kavanaugh's time as Staff  Secretary isn't relevant to understanding what kind of Justice he might  be. Yet, Senate Republicans requested none--absolutely none--of the  records from this period in Kavanaugh's career. What are they hiding?   Worse yet, here is what we learned Friday, amazingly: The documents  we are going to receive are being screened by a partisan lawyer with  ties to President Trump and Steve Bannon. That is right. The lawyer who  is going over these documents, who is screening them, not only has ties  to President Trump but also to Steve Bannon, one of the most partisan  people this administration has ever seen.   My Republican friends are checking all the boxes on the obstruction  list--hiding documents, collaborating with political operative lawyers,  and then causing the process to slow down so that there is as little  time for the American people to review the documents as possible. A  bipartisan letter should have been sent 2 weeks ago.   When Democrats were in charge, that is what we did. We didn't tell  the Republican minority: You can have this request and not that.  Senator Grassley says: Well, there was never a White House Counsel, a  White House Secretary. What is the difference?   As Republicans, they requested Judge Sotomayor's records for the  Puerto Rican Legal Defense and Education Fund 30 years earlier. We  didn't say: That is a difference. Every request was granted. Why are  they not being granted now? They are hiding something is what many  people would say.   I hope my colleagues will bring these political games to an end, for  the sake of our country, for the sake of comity, and for the sake of  bipartisanship. Our Republican friends talk a game of bipartisanship  but never seem to act it out. And they invoke a double standard: What  was good for them when they were in the minority is not good for us  while we are in the minority.   The Senate and the American people deserve access to the full records  from the man who has been nominated to a lifetime appointment in such a  powerful position as Justice of the Supreme Court. I hope my colleagues  on the Republican side will bring these games to an end.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on Britt Grant, the new nominee for the  Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals--Britt Grant, throughout her career,  has expressed views far outside the mainstream. When you read this  list, you will say: How did they come up with someone so on the fringe?  She is not someone who is a mainstream conservative, but way out there.   As solicitor general, she defended a law that made it illegal for  doctors to perform an abortion after 20 weeks of pregnancy and assisted  on an amicus brief arguing that defining marriage as between a man and  a woman does not violate the Constitution's guarantee of equal  protection.   She worked on a brief for the Supreme Court that defended a Georgia  prosecutor's decision to strike Black jurors based on their race. She  led Georgia's challenge to DACA, even though 85, 90 percent of all  Americans are for DACA.   Before becoming Georgia's solicitor general, she argued against the  Affordable Care Act, assisted on an amicus brief defending Indiana's  defunding of Planned Parenthood, urged the Supreme Court to gut the  Voting Rights  [[Page S5443]]  Act, and argued to strike down the Affordable Care Act's contraception  coverage mandate.   So from reproductive rights to civil rights to gun safety, name a  partisan legal case from the past 5 years, and there is a good chance  that Britt Grant has been involved, taking up a fringe legal argument-- way out of the American mainstream--to weaken well-established rights  and overturn precedent in pursuit of an ideological objective.   I would also like to bring to my colleagues' attention that in  speeches and in handwritten notes--even with this extreme record--Judge  Brett Kavanaugh has repeatedly praised Britt Grant's record. In fact,  Kavanaugh called Britt Grant ``a superb solicitor general of Georgia.''  That is someone with these extreme views.   Judge Kavanaugh's ringing endorsement of Britt Grant's record may  serve as a window into his own judicial philosophy. It makes you  wonder: What, exactly, does Judge Kavanaugh agree with her on so that  he would call her so many laudatory things?   Does he agree with Britt Grant that a woman's constitutional,  guaranteed freedom to make her own reproductive choices should be  curtailed, even though an overwhelming majority of Americans support  Roe? Does he believe, like Britt Grant, that States should be able to  define marriage as only between a man and a woman, even though the  Supreme Court has declared things the other way? Does he believe, like  Britt Grant, that insurers shouldn't have to provide contraceptive  coverage?   Britt Grant is the kind of lawyer Judge Kavanaugh, in his own words,  considers ``superb.'' Maybe that is why they both ended up on the same  short list of 25 potential out-of-the-mainstream court nominees--out of  the mainstream because they were vetted by the Heritage Foundation,  which believes that the government should not be involved in  healthcare, and by the Federalist Society, whose leader's goal is to  repeal Roe v. Wade, even though 71 percent of Americans are against  that repeal.   Whether you are a Democrat or a Republican or Independent, you should  want a better process for choosing judges. The American people deserve  judges from the legal mainstream who will interpret the law rather than  make it, who will respect and defer to precedent unless there is a darn  good reason not to--not just folks picked off some list prevetted by  extreme conservative groups that don't represent what a majority of  Americans think, and they probably don't even represent what a majority  of Republicans think. But the Republican majority has been advancing an  assembly line of nakedly partisan, ideological judges like Britt Grant.  That Judge Kavanaugh has praised her record so roundly is concerning.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
