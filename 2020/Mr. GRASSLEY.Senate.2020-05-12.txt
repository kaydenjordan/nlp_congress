 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to address the  Senate for 1 minute in morning business.    COVID-19, as we all know, has thrown a wrench into  America's corners of commerce and manufacturing, in addition to  threatening lives and the loss of lives. The unprecedented effort to  stop the spread has shut down life as we know it, closing schools,  movie theaters, gyms, salons, and restaurants in a hysterical approach  to it.   I always say we have had pandemics before, but never have we shut  down the government, shut down Congress the way we have. Our moves have  disrupted our food supply chain and pulled the rug out from underneath  our economy. Yet, across my home State, Iowa businesses and industries  stepped up to the plate. Ethanol plants, local distilleries, and others  teamed up to produce hand sanitizers for hospitals, nursing homes, and  local law enforcement. Others retooled their factories and redirected  their workforce to sew masks and produce face shields and other  supplies to replenish personal protective equipment for our frontline  workers. Across Iowa, businesses have shown there is nothing halfway  about the Iowa Way.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________     Madam President, today I come to the floor to salute  and thank our Nation's law enforcement officers during this year's  National Police Week. It is notable that this week dedicated to the  brave men and women in blue is in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic.   I am grateful to all who are working on the front lines right now,  whether they are doctors and nurses or teachers and grocery store  clerks. We are grateful to all of them, including a lot of jobs that I  haven't even mentioned.   But this week, we have the unique opportunity just to settle on one  group of people and thank them in a special way during National Police  Week, and that is our police officers. Now, more than ever, we  appreciate their service and dedication. Being a police officer isn't  just a job. I am in public service, but I haven't been a police  officer. I think it is fair to assume that they put their lives on the  line more than most of us who are Members of the Senate.   It is not just a job. It is a calling. Each officer has answered that  call and is dutifully serving during these very trying times that we  call this virus pandemic. For that, I am--and, I am sure, everybody  is--forever grateful.   I am particularly thankful for the men and women in blue who serve my  fellow Iowans. I would also like to recognize the officers who serve in  Washington, DC, the Capitol Police, meaning those who serve here on the  Hill. They work to ensure our safety and protection, not only from  criminals but also from a virus that has drastically changed the way we  work in the Senate to serve our constituents, the American people, and,  for me, the people of Iowa. Thank you to the policemen on Capitol Hill  here for your selflessness and dedication.   COVID-19 knows no boundaries and has, unfortunately, affected  hundreds of police officers. As of May 11, 101 officers have died in  the line of duty from the virus. We must continue to honor members of  the law enforcement community who have made the ultimate sacrifice. The  circumstances of loss are a little different now but no less heroic or  devastating.   As a Senator, my actions often speak louder than my words. So I am  pleased to show the members of the law enforcement community how much I  support and appreciate you through legislation. Every year, during  Police Week, the Senate advances various bills focusing on the needs of  the police community. This year is no different. To that end, I  recently introduced a bipartisan bill with the title of Safeguarding  America's First Responders Act. This bill addresses the unfortunate  reality of officers' exposure to COVID-19.   To ensure benefits through the Public Safety Officer Benefits  Program, my bill creates a presumption that if a first responder is  diagnosed with COVID-19 within 45 days of their last day on duty, the  Justice Department will treat it as a line-of-duty incident.   Loss of a family member in the line of duty isn't only emotionally  devastating, but it also means lost wages in tough times. This bill  recognizes the challenges posed by the pandemic and better ensures that  officers' families will get the financial help as promised to other  police officers who are killed in other ways in the line of duty. This  bill enjoys wide support from multiple law enforcement groups and a  group of bipartisan cosponsors here in the Senate.   The Senate is considering two other police bills that I support.  Police officers have demanding jobs and experience events that often  impact their mental health. The next bill is named the Confidentiality  Opportunities for Peer Support Counseling Act, or we call it COPS  Counseling Act, for short. This bill builds off the recommendations  provided by the Justice Department in their recent report on law  enforcement mental health and wellness issues.   Specifically, the bill provides confidentiality to Federal law  enforcement officers by restricting individuals who participate in peer  support counseling sessions from disclosing communications arising out  of these sessions. With that privacy, we encourage more people to get  the help they might need.   Peer support programs serve as a valuable role in providing mental  health care to law enforcement and first responders. But as I have  indicated, confidentiality concerns have left these programs and these  professionals underutilized. This bill also encourages best practices  for officers and for first responders on peer support programs across  the country.   I want to thank Senator Cortez Masto for leading this bill and  teaming up with me on this important issue.   Lastly, I am proud to cosponsor Senator Hawley's bill, with a title  of Law Enforcement Suicide Data Collection Act. This bill seeks to  address mental illness and increasing suicide numbers among law  enforcement by requiring the FBI to open a voluntary data collection  program to track suicides and attempted suicides within local, Tribal,  State, and Federal law enforcement. By providing accurate and detailed  information on these issues of suicide, more effective prevention  programs can be implemented.   I urge my colleagues to support all three of these bills. Passing  them into law is one way of saying a big thank-you to the brave men and  women who serve us so selflessly in law enforcement. We owe them a debt  of gratitude, particularly during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.                            ____________________     Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Senate proceed to legislative session for a period of morning business,  with Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes.    Mr. President, Iowa is home to 88,000 family farmers.  These farmers make up the economic foundation of our rural communities,  and farmers are the leaders who make up the councils and the school  boards across our State. So when we see economists estimate a 20- percent drop in livestock and grain producers' revenue due to COVID-19,  it isn't just our farmers who are concerned; it is our whole State.   In the CARES Act, we provided USDA with $24.5 billion to address this  loss in revenue; however, we know that even with this funding, the  supply chain disruptions from COVID-19 will force some agriculture  producers to miss payments, and ultimately some will be forced to sell  their family farms.   The consequences of COVID-19 shutdowns have injected uncertainty that  we haven't seen since the farmer crisis of the 1980s.  [[Page S2381]]    During my time in the Senate, I have always tried to be a vocal  advocate for the importance of a safe, affordable, and secure supply of  food. But now our country's food supply chain is facing disruptions  never envisioned before. As processing plants have shut down due to  employees being sick, the supply chain disruptions are being felt by  farmers and, of course, by consumers.   I ought to tie the two together because it is so important. The old  saying that we are only nine meals away from a riot--we haven't had  that in the United States yet, and I hope we don't have it, but when  you see short supplies of toilet paper and people fighting over toilet  paper in the supermarket, it wouldn't surprise you that they would  fight more for food.   With as much as 40 percent of the slaughter capacity at our packing  plants down for the past month, beef prices have doubled for the  consumer. That has caused meat shortages in fast food chains, and  grocery stores across the country have been forced to limit meat  purchases per consumer.   If that is not bad enough, at the same time, livestock producers with  livestock that is ready to sell have been turned away by meat  processors. Even if producers are lucky enough to sell, the prices they  are getting are well below the cost of production, and they are losing  money on every animal they sell.   I have received a large volume of calls and emails from Iowans and  member organizations expressing concern that the current discrepancy  between high shelf prices and increased losses for cattle producers  just doesn't make any sense. I share the concerns of these farmers, and  I take their claims of market manipulation very seriously.   President Trump is on top of this issue, and this past week, he  echoed a request that I made of the Attorney General last month to  examine the current structure of the beef meatpacking industry and  investigate potential market and price manipulation. Holding the four  large meatpacking companies accountable is the least we can ask of  Federal officials, and I thank President Trump for talking to Barr  about that as well.   The fact is, over 80 percent of the feedlot cattle in the United  States are slaughtered by the four largest meatpacking companies: Tyson  Foods, JBS, Cargill, and No. 4, National Beef. Because these companies  control a large percentage of slaughter and processing capacity in the  United States, they have the unique ability to influence the price of  live cattle. They use tactics such as bottlenecking processing speeds,  importing foreign meat, utilizing private forward-formula contracts,  and piling up meat in cold storage to delay the need to purchase live  cattle from the family farmer.   I am glad the President asked the Department of Justice to look into  these schemes to see if any of this behavior is illegal--the same  request I made to Barr about a month ago.   Independent producers will always struggle with negotiating prices  when there are only four large, multinational corporations that control  prices; however, in Iowa, it is a little different. Our producers sell  50 percent of their cattle through negotiated cash prices. This allows  for market transparency so that producers know the market price of  cattle, and the price more accurately reflects the cost the producers  incur when raising livestock. However, this isn't the case across the  entire United States, as more than 80 percent of all cattle are sold  through formula contracts and/or the cattle futures market. These  private contracts don't allow for price transparency and hide the true  value of production from the rest of the marketplace.   It happens that this is not a new problem. In fact, 18 years ago, I  introduced a bill with former Senator Feingold from Wisconsin that  would have helped producers gain leverage by mandating that a  percentage of a packer's weekly slaughter come from a negotiated cash  price. I introduced that bill every Congress until 2009, but, sadly, at  that time, not enough of my colleagues saw the need for a transparent  marketplace.   That need is much more obvious today because conversations across the  country have started to shift, and people's opinion about four big  meatpackers controlling 80 percent of the market--it looks like more of  a problem when farmers are losing a lot of money when they sell their  cattle and the price for the consumer goes up at the supermarket.  Lawmakers have begun to realize that in order to have a sustainable  supply of meat in our country, we need to restore transparency in the  marketplace and protect the market from collapsing when there is a  supply chain disruption.   Let me repeat something I said at the beginning--nine meals away from  a riot and people fighting about who is going to buy the last roll of  toilet paper in the supermarket. We can't let that same thing happen  with food, so today I come to the floor to submit my bill to foster  efficient markets and increase competition and transparency among  packers that purchase livestock from our producers. The only change to  that Feingold-Grassley bill is to increase the amount of mandated  negotiated cash trade to 50 percent from the original 25 percent in  that bill that Feingold and I cooperated on. This change is needed to  increase price discovery for producers across the country.   I am proud to lead this effort with Senator Tester of Montana and  will work with my colleagues in the Senate and particularly those on  the Senate Agriculture Committee to make sure this bill becomes law.  Without significant action by Congress, our independent beef producers  will not be able to stay in business. I believe the time to act is now.  Failure to act is failing our independent producers.   If there is one silver lining that could come out of COVID-19, it may  be that consumers will start to understand where their food comes from.  Food does not come from grocery stores; it comes from the tens of  thousands of farmers and independent producers who bust their backs day  and night to ensure families across the country have an adequate supply  of food.   Farmers are 2 percent of the population who provide for the other 98  percent, and they even provide for more than 98 percent of Americans--a  lot of it is exported   I urge my colleagues to support my legislation being introduced today  and do right by the producers who provide the food that we all eat.                                  ______                                         By Ms. COLLINS (for herself, Mr. Menendez, and Mr. Grassley):   S. 3703. A bill to amend the Elder Abuse Prevention and Prosecution  Act to improve the prevention of elder abuse and exploitation of  individuals with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias; to the  Committee on the Judiciary.
