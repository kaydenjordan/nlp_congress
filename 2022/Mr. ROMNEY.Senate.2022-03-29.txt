 Madam President, I rise today to recognize a  remarkable Utahn who recently announced his retirement after a long and  fruitful career for our great State. David Ure will conclude his civil  service following his tenure as director of the Utah School and  Institutional Trust Lands Administration, SITLA.   David's career in public service began with his election to the Utah  House of Representatives in 1993. A dairyman and rancher by trade, he  successfully balanced his legislative responsibilities with his  livelihood, an accomplishment underscored by his Summit County's 1996  Rancher of the Year award. As a legislator, David was instrumental in  guiding many pieces of legislation to the Governor's desk, and after  spending more than a decade in the statehouse, he continued his public  service on the Summit County Council before joining the SITLA board of  trustees.   In 2016, Governor Herbert appointed David to serve as SITLA's  director. The independent State agency, created to generate funds for  Utah's schoolchildren and other trust beneficiaries, flourished under  David's stewardship. In this role, he led the agency's operations and  administrative functions, including a myriad of energy initiatives and  real estate development projects. During David's tenure as director,  SITLA's trust grew by 40 percent and added over a billion dollars to  the significant benefit of Utah's public education system, State  institutions, and communities in need.   David has also served on a number of important State boards,  including the Weber Basin Conservation District, Intermountain  Healthcare board of trustees for the Heber Valley Hospital, the Park  City Chamber of Commerce, and the National Association of State Trust  Lands.   Thank you, Dave, for your outstanding career of public service to  Utah. Your accomplishments will continue to yield positive outcomes for  individuals, families, and communities across the State, and they will  brighten the lives and livelihoods of generations untold.                            ____________________
