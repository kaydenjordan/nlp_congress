 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I have crossed through and beyond 150  ``Time to Wake Up'' speeches. People sometimes ask me how I come up  with the material. It is actually easy, even week after week after  week, because it only takes reading the news. If we look back at the  headlines and dubious milestones of 2016, we find plenty to talk about.   Last year was hot. NASA and NOAA are expected to certify later this  month that 2016 was the hottest year in recorded history, exceeding the  previous record set by 2015 and the previous record set by 2014. What  this means is, 2014, 2015, and 2016 have each succeeded the last as the  three hottest years on record.   The United Nations World Meteorological Organization found that the  world was 1.2 degrees Celsius or over 2 degrees Fahrenheit warmer in  2016 than it was before the Industrial Revolution and the dawn of wide- scale fossil fuel use.   We are careening closer and closer to the 2-degree Celsius mark which  scientists say brings, to quote Donald Trump in 2009, ``catastrophic''  and ``irreversible'' climate effects.   In 2016, climate change continued to make some places almost  unrecognizable. Up north in the Arctic things got bizarre. Thermometers  spiked in mid-November to almost 35 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than  normal, with a 37-year low in the nearby sea ice. The peaks were about  50 degrees above normal, and around Christmas it actually rose above  freezing at the North Pole. Imagine, the snow was actually beginning to  melt at the North Pole just as Santa was loading his sleigh with  Christmas gifts.   In the tropics, undersea forests of once colorful coral stood bone  white as the Great Barrier Reef experienced the greatest bleaching and  coral die-off on record. What happens is that the superwarm water  stressed the corals. That forces them to expel the tiny algae that  lives symbiotically with the coral, providing them their food, and that  is what gives coral reefs their beautiful color and their life. When  the algae go, the coral structures turn ghostly white. They often do  not recover.   It is not just the Great Barrier Reef. My clips today included a  story from Japan, whose biggest coral reef has just been determined to  be 70 percent dead.   The researchers in Australia found severe bleaching throughout the  Great Barrier Reef. The Guardian reported in March that ``93 percent of  the 3,000 individual reefs [had] been touched by bleaching, and almost  a quarter . . . [had] been killed by this bleaching event.''   By November, around two-thirds of the northern portion of the Great  Barrier Reef had died, with some atolls suffering complete devastation.  Warming is at the heart of that catastrophe.   We also know from the physical laws of thermal expansion that as  ocean water warms, it does something else. It expands. The oceans also  are taking in melting water from our shrinking glaciers. Together,  those factors are causing sea levels to rise worldwide. Last year, the  Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences predicted that at our  current pace, over 90 percent of the world's coastal areas will  experience almost 8 inches of sea level rise by 2040. Year 2040 is not  that far away. On the Atlantic coast of the United States, it will be  more than 15 inches. By 2040, a house that you bought on the coast  today could be literally underwater before you paid off your 30-year  mortgage. The real estate business is starting to take notice.   Zillow, the online real estate marketplace, has released a tool for  users to show how potential sea level rise by 2100 would affect the  over 100 million U.S. homes in its database. Around 1 in 50 homes in  the United States, or just under 2 million properties, will find their  ground floors underwater by 2100 if we don't get ahead of this. Thirty- six U.S. cities would be considered ``completely lost''--those are  their words--``completely lost,'' and another 300 cities would lose at  least half their homes. This doesn't even include commercial or public  properties.   Government-backed mortgage giant Freddie Mac is girding for broad  losses from climate-driven flooding. ``The economic losses and social  disruption may happen gradually,'' it wrote in an April 2016 report,  ``but they are likely to be greater in total than those experienced in  the housing crisis and Great Recession.''   Let me say that again. The economic losses ``are likely to be greater  in total than those experienced in the housing crisis and Great  Recession.''   The report says some of the effects of climate change may not even be  insurable and, unlike our 2008 housing crash, owners of homes that are  subsumed by rising seas would have little expectation of their homes'  values ever returning and, therefore, little incentive to continue to  make mortgage payments through the crisis, and that, in turn, adds to  steeper losses for lenders and insurers.   Remember that Donald Trump signed, along with his children, this  full-page ad in the New York Times in 2009. Here is what it said,  speaking as Americans:         [W]e must embrace the challenge today to ensure that future       generations are left with a safe planet and a strong economy.       . . .    He said to the President in this advertisement:         We support your effort to ensure meaningful and effective       measures to control climate change, an immediate challenge       facing the United States and the world today.    It went on:         Please don't postpone the earth. If we fail to act now, it       is scientifically irrefutable--    Let me repeat his words--       scientifically irrefutable that there will be catastrophic       and irreversible consequences for humanity and our planet.    That is what Donald Trump and his family said in a 2009 ad,  ``catastrophic and irreversible.''   We have been warned.   President-Elect Trump also pledged to ``drain the swamp'' here in  Washington of corporate insiders and special interests. But we don't  see that. We see an alligator pack of climate deniers, oil executives,  and Koch brothers flunkies nominated to fill his Cabinet, his White  House, and his executive agencies.   The Koch brothers, Exxon, and other special fossil fuel interests  stand on one side. On the other side stand our military, our National  Labs, and NASA.   Let me put in a little footnote on NASA. They have a rover driving  around on the planet Mars right now. Do you think their science might  be OK? And, on the other side, also, I think, is every university in  the United States of America. That is the choice: The fossil fuel guys,  led by the Koch brothers and ExxonMobil, and the whole array of phony  baloney front groups that they have stood up to try to mask their hand,  or the virtually complete science establishment of the world, every  Nation, our military, our National Labs, and all of our universities.  Who are you going to believe?  [[Page S230]]  The ones with the huge conflict of interest or the people who know what  they are talking about?   Well, too many people in this room have made the wrong choice, but we  need to fix it.   In Rhode Island, some good things happened last year. After over 8  years of work, we have the Nation's first offshore wind farm. Thirty  megawatts, five turbines came online in December 2016--the Block Island  Wind Farm. I am proud of Deepwater Wind for getting it done. I am proud  of Rhode Island for establishing a process for siting an approval that  is now a national model. It is part of a transformation that happened,  emphasized in 2016, and that was jobs in the renewable energy industry  taking off.   At the end of 2016, we had 400,000 wind and solar jobs, and by 2020,  that number is expected to be 600,000. As employment climbs in these  industries, costs for renewable technologies continues to drop compared  to fossil fuels.   Last year we saw new records for electricity generation from  renewable sources. Texas wind generation hit a record 15 gigawatts in  December of last year, meeting 45 percent of the State's power needs,  with 18,000 megawatts installed and another 5,000 megawatts under  construction.   In Iowa, MidAmerican Energy is planning to add 2,000 megawatts of new  wind by 2019. Once installed, 85 percent of the energy MidAmerican  generates will be renewable.   We continued to make real progress internationally in 2016 as well.  Earth Day was the signing ceremony for the historic Paris climate  agreement. Nearly 200 nations pledged to reduce their greenhouse gas  emissions. By October, we met the threshold for ratification of that  agreement, when over 55 countries officially joined, and the agreement  was fully adopted in November.   Just this week, over 630 companies and major investment firms, with a  combined 1.8 million employees and $1.15 trillion in annual revenue,  called on President-Elect Trump, us in Congress, and global leaders to  continue to participate in and implement the Paris Agreement to  ``create jobs and boost U.S. competitiveness.''   This is the business community saying that the Paris Agreement will  create jobs and boost U.S. competitiveness.   Signatories included food giants General Mills, Kellogg's, Campbell's  Soup, and Mars; apparel companies VF Corporation, Nike and Levi's; and  other corporate heavy weights like Monsanto, DuPont, Intel, and Johnson  & Johnson.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the ``Business Backs Low- Carbon USA'' letter be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my  remarks.   I sure hope President-Elect Trump will heed this call from the  leaders of the business community.   Closing word: Secretary of State Kerry, in addition to providing  great leadership through this, has also started doing something that I  know is precious to him and that is important to me and many of our  colleagues; that is, to give oceans the global attention they deserve.  In September, more than 90 countries convened here in Washington for  the Our Ocean Conference. Nations, nonprofit organizations,  foundations, and big corporations all came together pledging over $5  billion for marine conservation and committing to protect more than 1.5  million square miles of ocean. Secretary Kerry secured the legacy of  the Our Ocean Conference by locking in hosts for the conference for the  next 3 years.   So 2016 was a year of worsening climate effects but also of  heartening climate action. The dramatic changes taking place in the  Earth's climate are now undeniable, but so is the growing spirit of  action among men and women of good conscience across the United States  and around the world. One can hope that 2017 will be the year when we  in this Chamber finally wake up.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                       Business Backs Low-Carbon USA         Dear President-elect Trump, President Obama, Members of the       US Congress, and Global Leaders:        We, the undersigned members in the business and investor       community of the United States, reaffirm our deep commitment       to addressing climate change through the implementation of       the historic Paris Climate Agreement.        We want the US economy to be energy efficient and powered       by low-carbon energy. Cost-effective and innovative solutions       can help us achieve these objectives. Failure to build a low-      carbon economy puts American prosperity at risk. But the       right action now will create jobs and boost US       competitiveness. We pledge to do our part, in our own       operations and beyond, to realize the Paris Agreement's       commitment of a global economy that limits global temperature       rise to well below 2 degrees Celsius.        We call on our elected US leaders to strongly support:        1. Continuation of low-carbon policies to allow the US to       meet or exceed our promised national commitment and to       increase our nation's future ambition        2. Investment in the low carbon economy at home and abroad       in order to give financial decision-makers clarity and boost       the confidence of investors worldwide        3. Continued US participation in the Paris Agreement, in       order to provide the long-term direction needed to keep       global temperature rise below 2  deg.C        Implementing the Paris Agreement will enable and encourage       businesses and investors to turn the billions of dollars in       existing low-carbon investments into the trillions of dollars       the world needs to bring clean energy and prosperity to all.        We support leaders around the world as they seek to       implement the Paris Agreement and leverage this historic       opportunity to tackle climate change.        22 Designs, 3P Partners, 3Sisters Sustainable Management,       LLC, 475 High Performance Building Supply, 900 Degrees       Neapolitan Pizzeria, Abt Electronics, Abundance Food Coop,       Acer America Corporation, Active Minds LLC, Addenda Capital,       adidas Group, Adobe, Inc., Aegis Renewable Energy Agrarian       Ales, AjO, Akamai Technologies, Inc., Allagash Brewing       Company, Allianz, Allumia, AlphaFlow, Inc., Alta Ski Area,       Altiz Orchard, Amalgamated Bank, AMD, Ameresco, Inc.,       American Outdoor Products, Inc., Amherst College, Amicus GBC,       LLC, Anchor, Ankcrom Moisan Architects, Annie Card Creative       Services, Annie's, Inc.
