 Madam Speaker, I thank Congresswoman Cammack for yielding.   Madam Speaker, our great Nation is blessed with dedicated law  enforcement officers who wake up every morning to maintain law and  order, keep communities safe, and answer the call when criminals  strike. Yet, their sacrifice has been met with radical calls from the  left to defund the police, and also horrific attacks from those people  who believe in defunding the police.   In 2021 alone, there were 346 officers shot in the line of duty,  including 63 tragic deaths. Additionally, there was almost a 50 percent  increase in police officer murders last year, totaling 73 deaths from  violent criminals who have no respect for law and order.   These startling statistics represent the highest number of law  enforcement officers who were murdered since the terror attacks of  September 11, 2001.                                time  2140    This violence isn't just sequestered to major cities either. It is  happening all across the United States. Unfortunately, my home  district, Georgia's Ninth, a district that is primarily rural, knows  this harsh reality all too well.   Back in November of last year, Jackson County, my home county, lost  both a mother and a heroic police officer, Deputy Lena Marshall. After  responding to a domestic call that escalated to a violent shootout,  Deputy Marshall's life was taken while serving to keep Georgians safe.   Any act of criminal violence is an assault on justice, which is why  we must provide our brave men and women in blue with the community  support, the resources, and especially the political backing needed to  adequately respond to surging crime across our Nation.   Those in political office show both ignorance and cowardice when they  side with criminals and, thereby, undermine those who serve and  protect.   May God protect our courageous law enforcement officers who put their  lives on the line each and every day, and God bless the fallen heroes,  like Deputy Marshall, who made the ultimate sacrifice while protecting  the communities they serve.
