 Mr. Speaker, I was excited to see the House take  action to promote racial justice this last week. Under the leadership  of Karen Bass, the Congressional Black Caucus, and the Democratic  leadership, we put forth a comprehensive effort to deal with the crying  need that we are hearing demands in the street for more racial justice  in America.   The House has acted. There are many provisions there that are going  to make a big difference in terms of being able to balance the scale  and protect the interests particularly of minority Americans.   Unfortunately, there is one area that remains unaddressed. Perhaps  one of the darkest hours in the assault on people of color is Richard  Nixon's war on drugs. Nixon's cronies have cynically admitted that it  was targeted directly towards people of color and young people. The  phony war on drugs contradicted the advice that President Nixon got  from his own Blue Ribbon Commission on how to handle cannabis in our  country.   Instead, the goal was to criminalize, to amp up enforcement, and was  specifically targeted toward people of color and young Americans. This  has been admitted by John Ehrlichman, who was assistant to President  Nixon for domestic policy. They calculated this would be a way to curry  favor from the voters, be able to demonize  [[Page H2598]]  and target the young and people of color.    Unfortunately, that war on drugs continues to this day. Last year,  there were tens of thousands of young people of color, particularly  Black Americans, who were caught in the net of law enforcement with  citations or arrests for something that the majority of Americans now  think should be legal.   Indeed, the majority of Republicans think marijuana should be legal.  And action has been taken in State after State, usually with a vote of  the people; that is the case in my State of Oregon, California,  Arizona, and Nevada, where the decision has been made by voters that  this mindless prohibition against marijuana makes no sense. Ten States  have completely legalized adult use. Over 33 have legalized medical  cannabis. And then you take some of the specialized legislation that  deals with children with extreme seizure disorders for whom an extract  of cannabis is the only thing that gives these children relief from  that torture of dozens, sometimes hundreds of seizures a day. Overall  47 States have acted to legalize cannabis in some form.   With the House leadership in Democratic control, we have taken key  steps. We passed the Safe Banking Act with overwhelming bipartisan  support. 321 Members voted for the legislation that would extend  banking services to this large and growing sector of our economy. It is  one of the other elements that is languishing in the Senate, but it  demonstrates that broad bipartisanship support.   In the House Judiciary Committee, the MORE Act, under the leadership  of Chairman Jerry Nadler working with the Cannabis Caucus, has produced  legislation that has been approved by the Judiciary Committee with a  bipartisan vote. I am pleased to note that it incorporates many of the  provisions of Barbara Lee's Marijuana Justice Act, which was endorsed  by the CBC with over 60 percent majority.   It is time for us to take the next step. These needless traffic stops  sometimes start with looking for a broken taillight, as law enforcement  are involved with fishing expeditions looking for marijuana. Too often  it catches young people, especially young people of color in the net.  Indeed, they don't target White Americans who use cannabis at the same  rate. It is targeted specifically against people of color. Too often  those interactions with law enforcement lead to tragic results.   It is time for the House to act to end this failed policy of  prohibition, protect young Black lives and be able to fully legalize  cannabis by passing the MORE Act. We can do this quickly and easily,  and I hope we do.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I am proud of the rapid action that  the House took--$3 trillion approved on a bipartisan basis with the  Senate. And we have moved forward with the HEROES Act, another $3  trillion that is pending action. We fixed the PPP to better meet the  needs of small businesses, but one area needs special attention.  [[Page H2599]]    Madam Speaker, over 500,000 independent restaurants with 11 million  employees are going to face catastrophic consequences this year. In  April alone, one-half of the unemployed, 5.5 million people, were from  the independent restaurants area. Without special, tailored Federal  help, we are going to see 85 percent of them disappear for good.   Madam Speaker, I am pleased to have introduced, on a bipartisan  basis, the RESTAURANTS Act, H.R. 7197, which would establish a $120  billion fund tailored to provide assistance for independent  restaurants.   I strongly urge my colleagues to talk to their independent  restaurants, the cornerstone of a vital community. If we act now, we  can save them yet this year, a vital element in each and every one of  our communities.   Madam Speaker, the H.R. 7197, the RESTAURANTS Act, will provide  massive support at a time when it is needed.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I listened to my colleagues cry out  for a bipartisan cooperation and progress. I listened to them talk  about somehow having promises not kept.   Think for a moment. My colleagues--the promise of Donald Trump and  the Republicans to replace and enhance the Affordable Care Act. They  are going to eliminate it, and they are going to replace it with  something better.   No, they could not do it.   They have been assaulting the Affordable Care Act since the moment it  was passed and they got their hands on part of the political control.   They fought to protect Big Pharma so that we have this corrupt  bargain where Americans have to pay the highest prescription drug  prices in the world in order to bribe pharmaceutical companies to  continue research. And they wouldn't unless Americans pay more than  anybody else in the world--including, in many instances, people who  can't afford their prescription drugs. That corrupt bargain needs to be  rejected.   Madam Speaker, now we are hearing, I think, starkly, the difference  between Republicans and Democrats--night and day--that active sabotage  of the Affordable Care Act, today with the Republican attorneys general  and the full weight of the Trump administration to try again to repeal  it in its entirety.   Madam Speaker, our legislation would increase coverage for 4 million  people. You know, it is interesting watching people fight against the  efforts of the Trump administration and the Republicans to deny them  coverage. Almost one-half million people figured out a way to apply,  demonstrating the need in the time of coronavirus.   Madam Speaker, my Republican friends have nothing to offer. They have  no plan. The Trump administration only wants to destroy the Affordable  Care Act at a time when it is more important than ever.   Madam Speaker, I strongly urge approval of this package.
