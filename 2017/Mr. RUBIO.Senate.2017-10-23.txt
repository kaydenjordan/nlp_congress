 Thank you, Madam President.   I thank the senior Senator from Florida on this issue. I want to  elaborate on it a little further. Any time we ask the taxpayers of this  country to step in and help a private industry, it is important and  incumbent on us to justify why. The amendment he just made that we have  been working to get included in what is before the Senate obviously  deals with agriculture at large, and he described some of the different  industries in Florida that have been hurt in agriculture and some of  the crops in Florida that were impacted by the storm.   The reason I want to focus my attention on citrus is not because we  don't care about the other industries that were damaged, but citrus is  in a unique and precarious place. I want to describe it to people who  may not be as familiar with this as those who live in Florida and see  it all the time.   First, I would say that one of the signature issues in the campaign  and in politics today is the desire to make more and produce more in  the United States; the idea that somehow, because of these changes in  the global economy, we have lost significant industries to other  countries, and we talk about that primarily in manufacturing, but we  also talk about it in technology and things of this nature. I don't  think  [[Page S6709]]  we should leave agriculture out of that conversation. If we want there  to be agriculture in the United States, then we have to deal with each  of those crops and the unique challenges they face. We most certainly  want to have agriculture in the United States.   A lot of people don't identify Florida as an agricultural State. It  is better known for its tourism and being one of the largest places  where people move to be in warm weather and not have State income tax,  but Florida is a large agricultural State. I encourage people to look  at the numbers. If you have spent any significant time in Florida, it  is not just something we put on our license plates and not something we  call ourselves in our heritage, it is real now. Tens of thousands and  hundreds of thousands of jobs across the supply chain and entire  communities are sustained by the presence of agriculture. In the case  of citrus, the overwhelming majority of growers are actually families  who have had these operations for sometimes two or three generations  and are trying to stay afloat.   You look at this and ask: What is this industry doing wrong to be  under these circumstances? Yes, they had a storm, but why can't they  rebuild like everybody else? Two things. First, citrus in Florida was  already facing an extraordinary challenge. It wasn't a better orange or  better grapefruit that some other countries are doing than we are. It  is a disease called citrus greening that didn't just blemish the fruit  the way the canker did, but it killed the trees. You have a significant  number of growers who are on the borderline of being out of business  because unlike--and I am not diminishing other people's losses here, on  the contrary--but unlike a manufacturing plant that gets wiped out by a  storm, where you put the new machine in and in 6 months you are up and  running, that is not the way it works with citrus.   The time between when you plant the new tree and produce fruit is 4  to 5 years, and you have to stay afloat in between. They are already  facing that. So that already has them on the brink of catastrophe, and  they have been working very hard to get around and design scientific  solutions. They have made some advances, thanks to the work at the  University of Florida, but they are not there yet. In the process, they  have been hurting already.   You heard about the production figures and how low they have gotten,  and here comes the storm. The first thing it does is knock all the  fruit off the trees. When we flew over these groves, all we saw on the  ground was fruit all over the place. As those familiar with agriculture  know, once that fruit gets in the floodwater, it can't be sold, and you  can't do much with it. The fruit continued to fall over the days to  come.   On top of everything else they were facing, they lost this year's  crops. A lot of these fields were flooded, so they were sitting in feet  of water. That kills the trees, and they will continue to lose trees in  the weeks to come.   Put yourself in the position of the grower who has to say: I have  already lost everything for this year. I lost a bunch of trees that I  will not have next year or the year after that. I was facing citrus  greening. Do I really want to replant or has the time come to sell my  land for some other use, development, or has the time come for me to go  into another crop or has the time come to declare bankruptcy? This is  the life challenge of American agriculture families in the State of  Florida.   Look, I hope very much that in November we are going to be here next  month and we are going to pass a new bill and it will have this money  in there and it will be fantastic, but we know how this place works,  and I don't know why we wouldn't do it now. Do we truly want to keep  American businesses in America? This is a great example of an  opportunity to do it.   It is not an industry that benefits from anything extraordinary from  the government. They are literally on the verge of going away unless we  help them sooner rather than later. We have the entire Florida  delegation in the House in favor of it, and they couldn't get it in the  House bill. You have both Senators here for it. It can't be a part of  this because if we change it, it goes back, and we lose time.   No one can tell you why it is not in there, no one can tell you why  they are against it being in there, but it is not in there. Sometimes  you start to wonder, and you guess why people look at this process and  shake their heads.   Unfortunately, it looks like this has been foreclosed. Obviously,  Senator Nelson moved forward and made that motion and it was objected  to so it will not be a part of this package, but I hope we think about  these men and women and families who own the groves. How do you explain  it to them and what happens if it goes away? What happens if we lose  this industry? It will not just hurt Florida, I think it hurts the  country. I think it sets a precedent for other crops that might be  threatened by floods in the future.   I hope this can be reversed, and I am hopeful we will deal with it in  November, but if we don't, I just want everyone to understand what this  means. This is not hyperbole. This industry is in a lot of trouble. I  am not telling you that the amount of money we are asking for alone  will save them, but without it, sooner rather than later, I feel we  will lose not just Florida citrus, but I feel we will lose something as  a key part of the State's heritage and a key crop for the country, and  we will depend more than ever on foreign imports to feed our people  with this problem.   With that, I yield the floor.                                Cloture Motion    The PRESIDING OFFICER. Pursuant to rule XXII, the Chair lays before  the Senate the pending cloture motion, which the clerk will state.

The PRESIDING OFFICER. By unanimous consent, the mandatory quorum  call has been waived.   The question is, Is it the sense of the Senate that debate on the  motion to concur in the House amendment to the Senate amendment to H.R.  2266, an act to amend title 28 of the United States Code to authorize  the appointment of additional bankruptcy judges; and for other  purposes, shall be brought to a close?   The yeas and nays are mandatory under the rule.   The clerk will call the roll.   The legislative clerk called the roll.
