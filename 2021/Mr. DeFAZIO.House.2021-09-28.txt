 Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Pelosi), the Speaker of the House.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 30 seconds. The gentleman  once again conflates, confuses, confabulates. The bill before us is a  bipartisan bill from the Senate, $550 billion of new spending on top of  the expected income. It is not $3.5, $4.5, $5 trillion and doesn't  include all those other things. It does include roads, bridges,  highways, transit, water, wastewater, drinking water, lead pipes,  ports, airports, and broadband, which I think his constituents want.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from South Carolina  (Mr. Clyburn), the majority whip.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), the majority leader.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, we could have perhaps had a bipartisan bill out of the  House, except for the unified rejection of climate change on the other  side of the aisle.   Transportation is the largest single emitter of CO2  pollution in the country. This is a critical threat to our country, to  the world, and we have to deal with it.   The bill we wrote and passed would have dealt with that very  meaningfully and moved us into 21st century infrastructure. This bill  contains some of those elements that even the Republicans on this side  would not support. EV charging, nope, not in their bill. Electric  buses, nope, not in their bill. Electric school buses, nope, not in  their bill. None of those things were in their bill.   In fact, their alternative, which they didn't even offer on the  floor, by the way--so they don't really have an alternative--was $350  billion for highways, status quo, with an increase in spending. No  changes in policy except for the one, Rodney Davis' thing, which is in  the Senate bill, to gut NEPA. Then, transit flatlined over 5 years, and  rail, zero--goose egg, zero.                                time  1245    No wastewater, no reconnecting communities, no drinking water, no  lead pipes. And by the way, every billion we spend on wastewater or  drinking water creates 20,000 good-paying jobs. No broadband in their  bill. And the list goes on and on.   So we don't have a real alternative on that side of the aisle. And  should they help to vote this down, they oppose it, then they have no  answer. The answer is a continuing resolution, status quo, funding,  flat funding.   Not dealing with the 400,000 bridges in America that need substantial  repair or replacement. The 40 percent of the National Highway System  which has deteriorated to the point where it has to be rebuilt from the  roadbed up. The $100 billion-dollar backlog in transit, a decrepit rail  system--we just had a derailment; people died--and they are going to  put zero dollars into rail in their bill.   Wastewater systems that back up into basements or flow into rivers,  and water mains that burst, I mean, we have to deal with these things.  It didn't used to be partisan. The problem is we also believe in  dealing with climate change, and they can't admit to climate change  because Donald Trump says it's a myth. And you can't defy Donald Trump  on that side of the aisle. That is very, very sad.   At least these 19 Republican Senators nodded toward it. They included  money for EV charging, electric buses in the bill--at least a little  tiny nod. They did take up our mandatory greenhouse gas reduction  program. They did take out our critical fix-it-first principles, but we  will improve on the bill with new, novel programs in the reconciliation  process yet to come and deal with some of those issues, deal with the  greenhouse gas reductions, deal with more transit, more rail, more  wastewater--in different ways. Drinking water, lead pipes, all those  things will be in the reconciliation bill yet to come.   But plain and simple, the bill before us today is the infrastructure  bill, the only option.   Mr. Speaker, I thank all my staff. There are too many to list in the  time that I have remaining, so I include in the Record a list of their  names.                                 Conclusion         Before I conclude, I want to take a moment to thank my       staff--especially those who drafted the INVEST in America       Act. They have spent countless days, nights and weekends       working on a transformational surface transportation bill       over the past two years.        I wish we were considering that bill today. But, without       their hardwork and dedication we wouldn't be here and about       to deliver for the America people the most significant       investment in our nation's infrastructure in decades.                     Subcommittee on Highways and Transit         Helena Zyblikewcyz-Staff Director        Jackie Schmitz        Garrett Gee        Brittany Lundberg        Chris Bell        Zan Guendert         Subcommittee on Railroads Pipelines and Hazardous Materials         Auke Mahar-Piersma-Staff Director        Andrea Woehbler        Frances Bourne        Katherine Ambrose    Mr. Speaker, they did an absolutely phenomenal job  putting this whole package together--twice, two Congresses. Real  legislative process on this side of the Hill. Even though the  Republicans lost, they participated in the process--not so much on the  other side. Some day we might get back to regular order.   Mr. Speaker, I conclude and urge my colleagues to vote in favor of  this legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.
