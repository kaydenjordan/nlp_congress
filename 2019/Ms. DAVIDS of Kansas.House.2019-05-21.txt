 Madam Speaker, today we come together to  celebrate 100 years since the United States House passed the 19th  Amendment prohibiting the government from denying the right to vote on  the basis of sex.   It was a milestone in the evolution of women's suffrage, but the hard  work of making sure that all women could vote continued long after its  passage.   Women still had to fight to build a system where Native Americans,  African Americans, Asian Americans and all women of color could not  only register to vote but could actually cast their ballot.   In 1924, when Native Americans were granted U.S. citizenship, we took  a big step toward Native American women's suffrage. And in 1964 when  the Voting Rights Act was passed, we took another step in breaking down  obstacles that prevented Black women and other women of color from  voting.   The history of women's suffrage, like the history of our Nation, is  complex, but it is a history that we must acknowledge and that we  absolutely need to reckon with, because we know that people all over  this country today still face voter suppression.   So let's take this opportunity to celebrate this historic day but let  us also recognize the full movement for women's suffrage has continued  long after, and let's recommit to making sure that every citizen in  this country can exercise their constitutional right to vote and  participate in our democracy.                            ____________________
