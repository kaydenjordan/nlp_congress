 Mr. President, today I wish to recognize Judge  Hardy McCollum, probate judge and chairman of the Tuscaloosa County  Commission, who retired earlier this month after 42 years of honorable  service. Judge McCollum will be long remembered for his remarkable  career and his dedication to the rule of law.   A native of Tuscaloosa, Hardy grew up selling peanuts, popcorn, and  programs at Denny Stadium, which is now known as Bryant-Denny Stadium.  Following graduation from Tuscaloosa High School, Hardy married his  high school sweetheart, Juanita. They both went on to earn their  degrees from the University of Alabama.   Following college, Hardy began working in Tuscaloosa and serving as  an active member of the the U.S. Junior Chamber of Commerce, commonly  known as the Jaycees. He has always told me that his first political  experience was campaigning for me in the 1970 Alabama State Senate  race.   In his first run for office in 1976, Hardy was elected to the  position of probate judge. Following his initial election, he was  reelected to six more 6-year terms, serving in the esteemed role from  1977 to 2019, a total of 42 years.   During his time as probate judge and chairman of the Tuscaloosa  County Commission, Hardy also served as president of the Association of  County Commissions of Alabama, the National Association of Counties  Transportation Steering Committee, and the National College of Probate  Judges. Additionally, he held the role of chairman of the West Alabama  Planning and Development Council, the Governor's Committee on  Employment of the Handicapped, and the University of Alabama Commerce  and Business Administration Executive Society.   Outside of his professional career, Hardy has volunteered over the  years with the Boys and Girls Club of America, Boy Scouts of America,  and United Way. He also served as chairman of the Heart Association and  the Alabama Institute for Deaf and Blind Foundation.   Another noteworthy accomplishment in Hardy's career is that he has  been the longest serving probate judge in the State of Alabama, and at  the time of his first election in 1976, he was the youngest probate  judge in the State. His dedication and service have been immensely  valued in the State and will be greatly missed.   It is with great pleasure that I join Hardy's family and friends in  recognizing his accomplishments. Our State and community have been  fortunate to have a leader like Hardy McCollum, and I wish Hardy the  very best as he transitions into the next chapter of his life.                            ____________________
