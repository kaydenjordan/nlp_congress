 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the public service  of Carolann Garafola, mayor of Warren Township, New Jersey, as she is  honored by the Somerset County Federation of Republican Women as the  recipient of the Millicent Fenwick Award for Outstanding Public  Service.   Carolann's service as a public official began on the Warren Township  planning board 30 years ago. She then became the township  committeewoman for that township, a post she has held for 20  consecutive years, 6 as mayor.   Carolann began her professional career working with special needs  children in Glen Rock, New Jersey public schools, and is currently in  her fifth year as executive director of Mt. Bethel Village in Warren,  an apartment community for adults with autism, developmental  disabilities, and traumatic brain injuries.   The Millicent Fenwick Award for Outstanding Public Service is awarded  to a woman who serves in the tradition of the late Congresswoman  Fenwick, one with a strong work ethic, high integrity, and a  willingness to assist those in need.   I congratulate Mayor Garafola on this well-deserved recognition.                            ____________________
