 Mr. Speaker, northwest Pennsylvania has  a rich history and vibrant, diverse economy. Its winding trails,  beautiful landscapes, recreational and educational opportunities, and  thriving communities make Venango and Crawford Counties especially  captivating places to live, to work, and to visit.   Many of these attractions are centered around one common theme, the  world's first commercial oil well. Colonel Drake successfully drilled  this well in 1859, triggering the first oil boom and establishing the  oil region as ``the valley that changed the world.''   His efforts not only made northwestern Pennsylvania the energy  powerhouse that it is today, but it also sparked a cultural revolution  that came as a result of the booming economy.   We are tremendously proud of our history and heritage in northwest  Pennsylvania. We still celebrate these communities that bloomed from  Colonel Drake's innovative idea today, and Drake Well continues to have  a tangible impact on the area's economy.   In 2004, Congress designated the region as a national heritage area.  There are only 49 of these areas across the country that are designated  as places where natural, cultural, and historic resources combine to  form a cohesive, nationally important landscape.   The Oil Region National Heritage Area was the Nation's 25th national  heritage area, and it celebrates the birth of the petroleum industry.   The region is honored to have this important designation, but without  action, it will sunset next year. That is why I introduced the Oil  Region National Heritage Area Reauthorization Act.   The heritage area's coordinating entity, the Oil Region Alliance of  Business, Industry, and Tourism, has taken a grassroots, community- driven approach to heritage, conservation, and economic development.   Through public-private partnerships, national heritage area entities  support historic preservation, natural resource conservation,  recreation, heritage tourism, and educational projects. These  partnerships foster pride of place and an enduring stewardship ethic.   The Oil Region Alliance focuses on heritage development, economic  development, and tourism destination marketing. All three of these  areas have been successful, and, from 2005 to 2015, the ORA has been  able to invest more than $6.8 million in heritage development projects,  invest more than $6.7 million in economic development activities, and  attract nearly 240,000 visitors annually. They have done an excellent  job using innovative methods to stimulate the local economy, using a  mixture of both Federal and private funds.    Last month, I was with my colleague Congressman  Mike Kelly at the  home of the legendary investigative journalist Ida Tarbell. Born in  Pennsylvania at the onset of the oil boom, Tarbell is best known for  her 1904 book, ``The History of the Standard Oil Company.''   The ORA recently completed a full restoration of Ms. Tarbell's home,  ensuring that it would be preserved for generations to come.   Congressman Kelly and I announced the Oil Region National Heritage  Area Reauthorization Act at the Tarbell House as an example of why this  designation is important. Our bill would extend Federal funding  authorization of our heritage area through 2026.   Extending this funding is crucial for the ORA to continue its mission  of preserving the Oil Region's history, stimulating the local economy,  and allowing others to appreciate the beauty and the culture of Venango  and Crawford Counties.   The ORA's efforts give us the ability to appreciate the rich history  of northwestern Pennsylvania and understand the impact that our  communities have had on American culture today. While the Tarbell home  restoration is just one of the ORA's projects, they have completed  countless other projects to support our communities, educate the  public, and help local businesses grow and thrive.   I urge my colleagues to cosponsor this legislation, which will  directly impact northwestern Pennsylvanians and preserve our rich  heritage for all Americans.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  congratulate the Clearfield Presbyterian Church on its 200th  anniversary.   First organized in 1818, groups of worshippers met in private homes  and places of public gatherings. That same year, Hugh Jordan and  Archibald Shaw were ordained and installed as ruling elders. In 1825,  the Reverend Gary Bishop was called to be a pastor of the church, and  he served from 1826 to 1834.   The first church was erected in 1841, but it was removed in 1867 to  build the new stone church. It was dedicated in 1869, and the cost  exceeded $41,000. The church was known for its 150-foot steeple, which  was the highest in the community.   This Sunday, September 9, the church will celebrate two centuries of  delivering the good news of Jesus Christ to members of its  congregation, both near and far.   Mr. Speaker, generations of Pennsylvanians have gathered in this  beautiful church to hear the Word of the Lord. On this special  occasion, I both congratulate and pray for the Clearfield Presbyterian  Church, its leaders, and the entire congregation, both past and  present.                            ____________________
