 Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the House's guest chaplain  for the day, John Vernon, who comes to us from High Point, North  Carolina.   John is an ordained minister in the Wesleyan Church and currently  serves as chairman of the board of directors of the Wesleyan Christian  Academy.   Beyond the Wesleyan Church, John also serves as lead chaplain for the  High Point Police Department, where he has served faithfully for 18  years. Within the last year, John has taken on the role of lead  chaplain for the High Point Fire Department.   John and his wife, Kim, will celebrate 37 years of marriage together  this year. They have two sons, Travis and Kyle, and two wonderful  daughters-in-law, Stephanie and Hillary. We are glad to have Kim, Kyle,  and Hillary joining us in the gallery.   Among John and Kim's greatest joys in their lives is spending time  with their three granddaughters, Sadie, Millie, and Nora.   I want to thank Chaplain Vernon for his service and for opening the  House in prayer this morning. We are honored and privileged that he and  his family call High Point home.                            ____________________
