 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mark  Butler and his service to the State of Georgia as our Commissioner of  Labor.   Mark has dedicated his entire life to serving the great State of  Georgia. He served in the Georgia State House of Representatives for 8  years, where he had the distinct honor of being my suitemate.   In January 2011, Mark became Georgia's ninth Commissioner of Labor,  and the first Republican to head the department.   Since Mark's first election, he has implemented many programs  designed to improve the agency's relationships with employers,  jobseekers, and Georgia's future workforce.   In 2013, he formed the Business Service Unit. This program was  designed to foster mutually beneficial relationships with Georgia's  employers and economic developers.                                time  1030    In 2014, he developed the Labor Department's newest program,  Customized Recruitment. This program bridges the gap between employers  and job seekers.   A committed public servant, statesman, and friend, I thank Mark for  his leadership and his hard work.                      Recognizing and Honoring Jon Burns     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and  honor my friend, Jon Burns, for becoming the new Speaker of the Georgia  State House of Representatives.   Jon has dedicated his entire life to serving the great State of  Georgia. He was elected to the Georgia State House in 2004. During his  first session in the Georgia State House, Jon and I were suitemates.  Since then, I have enjoyed getting to know Jon and his family and he  has become a dear friend.   In 2015, Jon was chosen to serve as the Georgia House majority leader  and would eventually be elected as the 74th Speaker of the Georgia  House of Representatives. During his time in the State legislature, Jon  has worked to bring environmentally balanced economic development,  world-class healthcare, quality education, and improved education to  Georgia.   There is no one more deserving of the speakership than Jon Burns. I  look forward to seeing all that he can accomplish and wish him a long  and successful tenure.   On behalf of myself and the First District of Georgia, I thank him  for all he does.              university of georgia's community engagement award     Madam Speaker, I rise today to congratulate  the University of Georgia's Archway Partnership on their recent award,  the C. Peter Magrath Award for Community Engagement.   This award is the highest award for public service bestowed by the  national Association of Public and Land-grant Universities. The  University of Georgia's Archway Partnership is nationally recognized  for the resources and expertise it provides to rural communities.   Since its founding in 2005, the program's partnership has attracted  hundreds of faculty and over 1,500 students to help Georgia communities  secure more economic development opportunities. Programs like these are  critical to ensuring that all areas of the State, rural and urban, can  grow and take advantage of their unique situations.   They also give students the opportunity to face real-world problems.  From economic development to preventative healthcare to broadening  access and more, this partnership works to solve the most pressing  issues of our time.   Additionally, this award comes with a $20,000 prize, which will be  used to broaden the scope of what the partnership can take on.   Mr. Speaker, I commend Jere Morehead on his leadership at the  university and in this program. I am proud of the work that the faculty  and students at my alma mater have done to build up the rural  communities around our State.   On behalf of the entire First District of Georgia, I thank them for  their efforts.                          recognizing thiago almada     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Thiago  Almada as the first Major League Soccer player to win the World Cup.   Thiago was on the Argentinean team that won a thrilling 4-2 penalty  shoot-out over France to win the World Cup. Argentina's win gave Lionel  Messi his first World Cup trophy, which has eluded his storybook  career.   When he is not representing Argentina, Thiago plays for Georgia's  Atlanta United. During the 2022 season, Thiago started 25 of 29 games  and scored six goals. He also had 12 assists and 77 on-target scoring  attempts. In  [[Page H119]]  2022, he was named the MLS Newcomer of the Year.   During the World Cup, Thiago made one appearance playing 6 minutes  against Poland in the Group C finale. At just 21 years old, Thiago has  a long career ahead of him.   Congratulations, Thiago. Continue to make Georgia proud.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the  recently crowned 2023 College Football National Champions, the Georgia  Bulldogs.
