 Madam Speaker, I rise today to sound the alarm  about the ongoing efforts to pass voter suppression laws across our  Nation and in my home State of Texas.   Republicans have made it a priority to pass so-called ``election  integrity bills.'' These misnamed bills are solely aimed at limiting  access to the ballot box, particularly in urban counties like mine in  Harris County.   In the 2020 election, Harris County saw record turnout despite the  ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. We implemented drive-through voting,  authorized voting sites to stay open until 10 p.m., and several  locations were open for 24 hours. Hundreds of thousands of voters used  these options to exercise their constitutional right without  endangering themselves or their loved ones.   Now, Republicans in the State legislature are trying to ban and limit  these measures under the false premise of ``election integrity.''   Madam Speaker, I strongly urge the Senate to pass H.R. 1, which would  expand access to the ballot box and prohibit restrictions on drive- through voting for members of my community and all the voters across  Texas.   Voting is a right that should be encouraged, not restricted.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I am here today to express my  support for this very important piece of legislation. This is simple;  it is much needed; and it is just a commonsense bill.   For my friends across the aisle who think that this is some  intellectual exercise, that we are trying to find some mandate, or that  we need to listen to the front lines, well, I am here to tell you what  happens on the front lines.   It was not yesterday; it was when I was a geriatric social worker. We  had  [[Page H1861]]  received a report of a street child taking care of a senior, and there  was concern about the senior and the street child.   I went to the door to make an assessment. I knocked on the door, and  I was greeted by a Saturday night special right in my face, as a social  worker just trying to do my job. She kept saying: ``You ain't gonna  take my baby. You ain't gonna take my baby.'' I was scared, scared, and  scared, never having had a gun to my face.   Madam Speaker, I am sure you know what I am talking about because you  have probably had similar experiences.   I was a social worker just trying to make an assessment to see if  this senior needed help at home. I had nothing to do with trying to  take her child away, but she confused me for a child welfare worker.   This is what can happen. It has happened to me. It happens today. As  Representative Stevens pointed out, it happened at 2 a.m. this morning,  not to a social worker but to a FedEx worker. We must do something to  make sure that we can protect workers and that we end workplace  violence.   This is a small step. It is not an intellectual exercise. It is real.  I am speaking personally, and I am here to stand with social workers  across America to make sure that we do everything we can to make their  workplace safe and that everyone is protected.
