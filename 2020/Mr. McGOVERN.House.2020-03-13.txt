 Mr. Speaker, we have once again been called to respond  to a crisis.   In the past, we have faced national security threats and natural  disasters. But today, it is something radically different: A pandemic.   What started half a world away has now spread to more than 100  countries, including the United States. Layoffs have begun, schools  have cancelled classes, and large gatherings have been banned.   The impacts of this virus are cascading across society. People's  health is at risk. And for many their economic reality has changed  overnight.   People need to get tested. Quarantined workers are wondering how they  will pay their bills. Healthcare workers are putting their own health  at risk. And children are missing their school lunches.   They need help.   They need help now.   The coronavirus knows no border. It knows no political party. And Mr.  Speaker, our response shouldn't either.
