 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to legislative session and be in a period of morning business,  with Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President. A vibrant and independent media and public  access to accurate information are critical to the functioning of any  democracy. A free press is so important that our Founding Fathers  explicitly guaranteed that right in the First Amendment of our  Constitution, and the United Nations defined press freedom as a  fundamental human right in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.  But today--as democracies worldwide are facing growing challenges from  authoritarian leaders, censorship, and disinformation campaigns-- foreign journalists are facing unprecedented dangers that put their  profession, and their lives, at risk.   The nature of threats against journalists is shifting. While the  number of journalists killed in war zones continues to drop, the number  of journalists killed or targeted in countries at peace continues at  historically high levels. Fifty journalists were killed because of  their work in 2020, and 68% of these deaths occurred outside of  conflict zones. Most of those who perpetrate attacks are never held  accountable. Worldwide, there was complete impunity in 86% of cases of  murdered journalists occurring between September 2019 and August 2020.  In addition, the number of journalists imprisoned remains at  historically high levels, with nearly 400 behind bars as of December  2020. And authoritarian governments are using the COVID-19 pandemic as  a pretext for censorship, restricting reporters' freedom of movement,  and harassing them.   The legislation I am introducing today with Senator Graham marks  World Press Freedom Day by honoring journalists not only with words but  with action. It builds on the Daniel Pearl Freedom of the Press Act,  signed into law in 2009, to take concrete steps to ensure the wellbeing  of journalism as a profession, and of individual journalists  themselves. This legislation creates a new fund for programs to help  keep foreign journalists safe, whether they are operating in dangerous  environments or need to be re-located for their safety, and authorizes  $30 million for this purpose. It uses existing funding to help nations  prevent, investigate, and prosecute crimes against journalists  overseas. It creates a new non-immigrant visa category to allow  journalists in danger to come to the United States. And it creates a  Coordinator for International Press Freedom at the State Department to  serve as a focal point for advancing the right to freedom of the press  and freedom of expression abroad.   I am proud to join Senator Graham in this effort to ensure that the  free press that we value so highly in the United States is protected  and promoted around the world, and I look forward to working with my  colleagues to ensure that this legislation is swiftly considered by the  Senate.   Thank you, Mr. President.                                  ______                                         By Mr. KAINE (for himself and Ms. Baldwin):   S. 1496. A bill to require the Secretary of Health and Human Services  to fund demonstration projects to improve recruitment and retention of  child welfare workers; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor,  and Pensions.    Mr. President. As we work to support American families,  stimulate the economy, bolster small  [[Page S2363]]  businesses, protect health care workers, and sustain our industries,  investing in child welfare is imperative to supporting these efforts.  The coronavirus pandemic has further highlighted that the development  of a robust, well-trained, and stable child welfare workforce is  central to improving outcomes for children and families across the  United States. The existence of such a workforce is essential to a  child welfare agency's ability to carry out the responsibilities with  which they have been entrusted. Child welfare work has been shown to be  physically and emotionally challenging, as demonstrated by recent  studies into the impact of secondary traumatic stress (STS) on child  welfare professionals. The multitude of challenges inherent in child  welfare work, combined with relatively low compensation and work  benefits, make these careers difficult to sustain, resulting in high  rates of turnover and professionals who are more susceptible to burnout  and compassion fatigue.   For the past 15 years, child welfare turnover rates have been  estimated between 20 percent and 40 percent. In 2017, Virginia reported  a turnover rate of 30%, while Washington State reported a turnover rate  of 20% and Georgia reported a turnover rate of 32%. These high rates of  turnover detract from the quality of services delivered to children and  families and result in an estimated cost of $54,000 per worker leaving  an agency.   More needs to be done to ensure that individuals pursuing careers in  child welfare receive appropriate training and support to improve the  sustainability of their important, yet demanding work. Maintaining a  high-performing, engaged, and committed workforce is vital to providing  families with the quality supports they need to stabilize, reunify, and  thrive. Research suggests that positive child welfare outcomes depend  largely on the capacity and competence of the child welfare workforce.   This is why I am pleased to introduce today the Child Welfare  Workforce Support Act with my colleague Senator Baldwin. This bill  directs the Secretary to conduct a five-year demonstration program for  child welfare service providers to implement targeted interventions to  recruit, select, and retain child welfare workers. This demonstration  program will focus on building an evidence base of best practices for  reducing barriers to the recruitment, development, and retention of  individuals providing direct services to children and families. Funds  will also be used to provide ongoing professional development to assist  child welfare workers in meeting the diverse needs of families with  infants and children with the goal of improving both the quality of  services provided and the sustainability of such careers. Investing  resources in determining what practices have the greatest impact on the  successful recruitment and retention of child welfare workers will  assist in developing an evidence-base for future federal investment in  this space.   I hope that as the Senate considers reauthorizing the Child Abuse  Prevention and Treatment Act that we consider the Child Welfare  Workforce Support Act and recognize the vital role that child welfare  workers play to improve outcomes and protect our most vulnerable  infants and children.                                  ______                                         By Mr. KAINE (for himself and Ms. Baldwin):   S. 1497. A bill to amend the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act  to ensure protections for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and  queer youth and their families; to the Committee on Health, Education,  Labor, and Pensions.    Mr. President. According to the Department of Health and  Human Services (HHS), lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer  (LGBTQ) youth are at an increased risk for experiencing maltreatment  compared to non-LGBTQ youth. Because of limited exposure to mandated  reporters as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the unfortunate truth  is that the maltreatment that some youth experience have experienced  has gone unrecognized and underreported. Research prior to the pandemic  demonstrated that LGBTQ youth were more likely to experience physical  abuse by a parent or guardian when compared to their heterosexual  peers. Risk for harm of vulnerable youth also extends far beyond  physical safety. LGBTQ youth are at a disproportionately high risk for  depression, suicidal ideation and suicide, and self-harming behaviors,  with rates of attempted suicide of around 2 to 10 times those of peers.   These risks for maltreatment often times result in LGBTQ youth  entering the child welfare system. Studies have found that, ``LGBT  young people are overrepresented in child welfare systems, despite the  fact that they are likely to be underreported because they risk  harassment and abuse if their LGBT identity is disclosed.'' This  overrepresentation of LGBTQ youth in the foster care system raises  concerns about issues in the child abuse and prevention space.  Additional research is needed to understand the risk of abuse among  LGBTQ youth, particularly those identifying as transgender. This  information will yield invaluable information to be used in developing  targeted prevention strategies to reduce the rates of adverse childhood  experiences of LGBTQ individuals.   This is why I am pleased to introduce the Protecting LGBTQ Youth Act  with my colleague Senator Baldwin. Our bill amends the Child Abuse  Prevention and Treatment Act and calls for HHS and other federal  agencies to carry out an interdisciplinary research program to protect  LGBTQ youth from child abuse and neglect and improve the well-being of  victims of child abuse or neglect. This legislation also expands  current practices around demographic information collection and  reporting on incidences and prevalence of child maltreatment to include  sexual orientation and gender identity.   Additionally, the bill opens existing grant funding opportunities to  invest in the training of personnel in best practices to meet the  unique needs of LGBTQ youth and calls for the inclusion of individuals  experienced in working with LGBTQ youth and families in state task  forces. Improving data collection and disaggregation will provide  greater insight into the circumstances LGBTQ youth face in the home  that, when left unaddressed, lead to entry into the child welfare  system. This improved data-driven understanding can then be used to  develop appropriate and effective primary prevention practices to  decrease the risks faced by LGTBQ youth, and will be pivotal in our  understanding of abuse and neglect following the pandemic.   I hope that as the Senate moves to reauthorize the Child Abuse  Prevention and Treatment Act we consider the Protecting LGBTQ Youth Act  to better inform our collective understanding of the risks faced by  LGBTQ youth and the best ways to protect them.                                  ______                                         By Mr. DURBIN (for himself and Mr. Blumenthal):   S. 1500. A bill to permit Amtrak to bring civil actions in Federal  district court to enforce the right set forth in section 24308(c) of  title 49, United States Code, which gives intercity and commuter rail  passenger transportation preference over freight transportation in  using a rail line, junction, or crossing; to the Committee on Commerce,  Science, and Transportation.    Mr. President. While cancer is the leading cause of death  by disease among children past infancy, childhood cancer and other rare  pediatric diseases remain poorly understood. According to the National  Cancer Institute, an estimated 15,590 children and adolescents under  the age of 19 will be diagnosed with cancer, and 1,780 will die of the  disease in the United States in 2021.   This is why I am pleased to be introducing the Gabriella Miller Kids  First Research Act 2.0 with Senators Jerry Moran, Mark R. Warner, and  Bill Cassidy. The legislation provides a new source of funding for the  National Institutes of Health's (NIH) Gabriella Miller Kids First  Pediatric Research Program (Kids First) by redirecting penalties  collected from pharmaceutical, cosmetic, supplement, and medical device  companies that break the law to pediatric and childhood cancer  research. The bill is named in honor of Gabriella Miller, a Leesburg,  Virginia resident who died from a rare form of brain cancer at the age  of 10. Gabriella was an activist and worked to raise support for  research into childhood diseases like cancer until her death in October  of 2013.   The Gabriella Miller Kids First Research Program has supported  critical research into pediatric cancer and structural birth defects  and has focused on building a pediatric data resource combining genetic  sequencing data with clinical data from multiple pediatric cohorts. The  Gabriella Miller Kids First Data Resource Center is helping to advance  scientific understanding and discoveries around pediatric cancer and  structural birth defects and has sequenced nearly 20,000 samples thus  far. While Congress has appropriated $12.6 million for the Kids First  program annually since Fiscal Year (FY) 2015, this legislation would  make additional funding streams available to appropriators to further  support pediatric and childhood cancer research.   Gabriella Miller was a passionate activist and fighter. In 2014, I  was a strong champion of the Gabriella Miller Kids First Research Act,  which established the Ten-Year Pediatric Research Initiative at the NIH  and authorized $12.6 million per fiscal year through FY23. We honor  Gabriella's memory by continuing her work in making sure pediatric  disease research is a priority. This bipartisan legislation would  provide a critical source of funding to improve research in pediatric  cancer and diseases, and I urge my colleagues to support it.'                            ____________________     Mr. President.
