 Mr. President, it is alarming to know that voter  suppression, which we have worked for decades to overcome, is not a  ghost from our past. Suppression efforts are resurfacing--and surging-- in State legislatures across the country. Voter roll purging, out-of- the-way polling stations, and needless barriers to accessing the ballot  box are underway and under consideration in jurisdictions across the  country. It cannot stand.   Under the guise of election integrity, even in the wake of the most  secure election in our Nation's history, proponents of these  suppressive movements make no effort to hide their targets: African  Americans, Latino Americans, college students, low-income voters, the  list goes on.  [[Page S5924]]    Those who do not feel compelled to push against these voter  suppression need a lesson in history. Thankfully, a July 27 column in  the Washington Post by Norman Lear offers just that insight. Penned on  the occasion of his 99th birthday, this decorated American war hero,  one of our Nation's Greatest Generation, recalls the pain and betrayal  felt by African-American war heroes who fought for democracy abroad,  only to be excluded from it at home. He reminds us that it took decades  of relentless activism to give millions of minority American voters and  others a real voice by finally giving them a vote.   And most importantly, he urges all Americans to fight now to protect  the right to vote, the very right that gives democracy its name. This  is a call to action. Voting suppression cannot stand. From the For the  People Act to my own bipartisan John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement  Act, named for another icon of the voting movement, this Senate has a  real opportunity to stand for democracy. I will work in good faith with  any member of the Senate, regardless of party, to find a path to  passing and enacting that important bill bearing John Lewis's name.  Efforts to restore the Voting Rights Act have always been bipartisan.  There is no reason it shouldn't be bipartisan again now.   To echo Norman's words, the right to vote isn't about party or even  politics. It is about our system of self-government and the notion that  a government of, by, and for the people is worth protecting in a world  where authoritarianism and tyranny are still forces we are reckoning  with. I ask unanimous consent that Norman Lear's opinion piece, titled  ``Norman Lear: As I begin my 100th year, I'm baffled that voting rights  are still under attack,'' be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                 [From the Washington Post, July 27, 2021]    As I Begin My 100th Year, I'm Baffled That Voting Rights Are Still                                Under Attack                              (By Norman Lear)         I woke up today at the start of my 100th year as a citizen       of this beautiful, bewildering country. I am proud of the       progress we've made in my first 99 years, and it breaks my       heart to see it undermined by politicians more committed to       their own power than the principles that should bind us       together. Frankly, I am baffled and disturbed that 21st-      century Americans must still struggle to protect their right       to vote.        I am a patriot, and I will not surrender that word to those       who play to our worst impulses rather than our highest       ideals. When the United States entered World War II, I       dropped out of college to fight fascism. I flew 52 missions       with a crew in a B-17, dropping bombs 35 times. Unlike so       many others, I returned from that war safely, to another 70-      plus years of life, love, family, failure and triumph.        It's very likely that I owe my ass and all those decades of       human experience to that Black and Brown squadron of Red Tail       P-51 fighter pilots known as the Tuskegee airmen. When we saw       their red tails coming to escort us, we all felt a bit safer.        Yet when these courageous men returned to the United       States, they returned to racism, segregation and       discrimination. Their heroism did not shield them from the       indignities and violence of Jim Crow. I can only imagine the       depth of the betrayal the airmen must have felt, but it did       not prevent many of them from accomplishing great things.        I think often of the congresswoman Barbara Jordan. She will       always be remembered for declaring during President Richard       M. Nixon's impeachment hearings, ``My faith in the       Constitution is whole; it is complete; it is total.'' Even       now, it gives me chills to think of her saying that, as a       Black woman, in the face of her own experiences of prejudice       and her full knowledge of our history.        I believe Jordan's faith in the Constitution, like my       continued faith in our country, was grounded in the faith,       love and hope of all the people who have struggled for the       past 230 years--including millions who rallied for racial       justice this past year--to make the Constitution's promises       real for all of us.        After we defeated fascism overseas, it took 20 more years       to pass the Voting Rights Act and Civil Rights Act at home.       Now, headlines seem drawn from the past: States target Black       voters with voter-suppression bills. Federal voting-rights       laws blocked in the Senate by a filibuster. Racial and       religious nationalism, nativism and authoritarianism are       seemingly on the rise everywhere. It is deeply discouraging       to this member of what has been called ``the Greatest       Generation.''        But do you know who else was part of the Greatest       Generation? Rosa Parks, Fannie Lou Hamer and Thurgood       Marshall. And think of the greatness demonstrated by       generations that followed us: Jordan, the Rev. Martin Luther       King Jr. and John Lewis, and millions of not-famous people       who risked everything to claim the right to vote.        To legislators getting between people and the ballot box,       and to senators who are standing in the dishonorable       tradition of those who filibustered civil rights legislation,       I say this: You may pass some unjust laws. You may win       elections by preventing or discouraging people from voting.        But you will not in the end defeat the democratic spirit,       the spirit that animated the Tuskegee airmen to whom I owe my       life, the spirit that powers millions of Americans who give       of themselves to defend voting rights, protect our       environment, preserve peaceful pluralism, defeat       discrimination, and expand educational and economic       opportunity.        The right to vote is foundational to addressing all these       issues. It is at the heart of everything I have fought for in       war and in peacetime.        To senators who are willing to sacrifice the right to vote       to some outdated notion of bipartisanship and Senate       tradition, I almost do not know what to say. On the scale of       justice, this is not even a close call. Do what's right.        Protecting voting rights should not be today's struggle.       But it is. And that means it is our struggle, yours and mine,       for as long as we have breath and strength.                            ____________________     Mr. President, after decades of civil war, famine, and  political instability, after millions were killed and millions more  became refugees, many hoped that independence and a peace agreement in  South Sudan would usher in a period of stability and progress.   Some South Sudanese refugees who had resettled in the United States  returned to South Sudan to aid in rebuilding. Unfortunately, peace was  fleeting and the past decade of independence has been marred by  continued violent ethnic conflict, widespread hunger, and ongoing  disputes between rival politicians that have cared more about their own  ambitions than the South Sudanese people. Despite several power sharing  agreements, promises of unity and reconciliation, and a goal to seat a  full Parliament in 2020, the rivalry between President Salva Kiir and  Vice President Riek Machar has stoked tensions between the Dinka and  Nuer ethnic groups and neglected public infrastructure and basic  services. On August 2, almost a year past the promised deadline, an  incomplete Parliament was sworn into office, with 62 members absent due  to disagreements over the power-sharing arrangement.   The people of South Sudan cannot wait another decade for progress.  They cannot wait for politicians to argue over control while their  children go hungry, while they sink deeper into poverty, while they  worry that the next outbreak of violent conflict might send them  fleeing for their lives. Recently, the People's Coalition for Civil  Action launched an effort to mobilize all South Sudanese people,  whether living within the country or abroad, and demand political  change. In a declaration, they said they ``have had enough of war,  enough of corruption, enough of insecurity, enough of economic  hardships, enough of public neglect and leadership failure.'' They  admonished the administration of President Salva Kiir, which has  completely failed to fulfill its most basic responsibilities to provide  security and stability for its citizens.   Just days later, the South Sudanese National Security Service--NSS-- arrested two of the leaders of the movement, Augustino Ting Mayai and a  former State Governor, Kuel Aguer Kuel, for signing the declaration.  The NSS shut down the Sudd Institute, a think tank involved in the  creation of the People's Coalition for Civil Action, and issued arrest  warrants for Rajab Mohandis and Abraham Awolich, two other signatories  of the declaration, who have gone into hiding. This suppression of  dissent is not new in South Sudan. Weak and paranoid new leaders often  resort to projecting strength by arresting civil society leaders,  journalists, and political rivals, and over the years, this has become  President Kiir's trademark. This most recent transparent attempt to  silence his own citizens for nothing more than demanding that he keep  his promises and do his duty has not gone unnoticed by the rest of the  world.   President Kiir may not know that Abraham Awolich was one of the now- famous Lost Boys, who as a child survived the civil war that killed  most of  [[Page S5925]]  his family, endured malnutrition, and escaped attacks by rebel groups  seeking child soldiers, only to find himself alone in a refugee camp.  He eventually was resettled in the United States, arriving in Vermont  in 2001, graduating from the University of Vermont, becoming an  American citizen, and going on to get his master's degree. He was my  constituent for many years, and I am very proud of the work he did as a  member of the South Sudanese diasporic community who returned to his  native country to help rebuild. President Kiir may not have known that  Abraham was my constituent or that I will always consider him my  constituent. So I call upon him now to immediately release Kuel Aguer  Kuel and Augustino Ting Mayai, to cancel the arrest warrants for Rajab  Mohandis and Abraham Awolich, and end the repression of civil society  leaders, journalists, and dissidents.   I want to read into the Record a quote from Abraham Awolich's  statement at the launch of their movement. What he said is instructive  to every citizen of every democracy around the world. He said, ``In the  last 10 years the people of South Sudan have been dormant, they have  not been challenging the status quo in the Republic of South Sudan and  we cannot expect to have a democratic country without active  citizenship.''   President Kiir has an opportunity now, with a new Parliament seated  and the seeds for an active and engaged citizenry sown, to show true  leadership. He has no time to waste, or he will risk wasting his  country's future and losing the support of the United States.                            ____________________
