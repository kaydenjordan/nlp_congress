 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Madam Speaker, this week's Consumer Price Index report indicates that  we just reached a 40-year high in June. This kind of inflation is a tax  on every American and a threat to our middle-class families.   As a result of Democrats' reckless, trillion-dollar inflationary  spending, hardworking Americans are taking a pay cut, and failed relief  plans have caused unprecedented financial challenges to the U.S.  economy, hitting the American taxpayers the hardest.   Some of my friends on the other side of the aisle blame the inflation  on the war in Ukraine, but Americans faced sharp, rising inflation long  before Russia invaded Ukraine.   Now, additional price increases across the board continue to eat away  at the paychecks of this Nation's workforce, making it even harder to  achieve the American Dream for millions of Americans.   I am sure many of my colleagues can relate when I say I have  conversations back home with folks who are struggling to afford  everyday essentials, including baby formula and fuel, that continue to  be in short supply.   President Biden and the Democrats' lack of concrete solutions are  falling short. The President's first action upon taking office was to  end construction of the Keystone XL pipeline and issue a moratorium on  new oil and gas permits on Federal lands.   His most recent efforts to court oil deals with our hostile  counterparts in Saudi Arabia are futile. In fact, it was embarrassing  today.   Increasing America's energy independence is the best way to alleviate  the pressure Americans feel at the gas pump. This means producing more  American energy, not less. Restoring American energy production here at  home will make our country more prosperous and secure while lowering  the price at the gas pump.   I recently cosponsored the American Energy Independence from Russia  Act which would reopen the Keystone XL pipeline, increase our natural  gas production and exports, encourage energy and mineral development on  foreign lands, and prevent needless regulation on domestic oil and gas  production.   However, those across the aisle have consistently blocked this  legislation for a total of seven times. Seven times.   This war on affordable energy production is the main culprit for both  the high gas prices and skyrocketing food prices. Given the current  economic climate, it is critical that Congress thoroughly consider how  legislation will contribute to future inflation.   For this reason, I cosponsored the Informed Lawmaking to Combat  Inflation Act. This would require the Congressional Budget Office to  provide an inflation estimate for major pieces of legislation so that  Members of Congress can be best informed about how these spending bills  will impact inflation.   I also supported the implementation of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act  which lowered tax rates for all Americans and simplified our tax code.  We must continue efforts to lower taxes, not raise taxes, especially at  a time like this.                                time  1600    We should take this opportunity to make the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act tax  cuts permanent. The President's inflation crisis is already costing the  American U.S. household $6,000 as they encounter the skyrocketing cost  of goods.   The American people deserve commonsense solutions that will help ease  the economic burden. Future generations of Americans depend on the  financial decisions made today. I will keep fighting for real relief  for hardworking Americans and am focused on legislation that supports  the middle class and allows hardworking Floridians and others to keep  more of their paychecks, allowing families to better save for college,  invest in their retirement, and spend more time with their loved ones.
