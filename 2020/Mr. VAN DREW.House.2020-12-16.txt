 Madam Speaker, I would like to recognize Coho Brewing  Company in Cape May Court House in south Jersey. Coho was founded by  Karen Buckingham in January 2019, inspired by her passion for craft  beer.   The brewery's interior design is inspired by all our law enforcement  and first responders. Karen hosted fundraisers and cornhole tournaments  to raise money for the State police and K-9 units. Each of Coho's beer  cans has a  [[Page H7226]]  blue line in honor of our first responders. She has also turned part of  her tasting room into a brew-tique, which gives clothes and goods to  those in need.   Madam Speaker, I thank Karen for all she does for the south Jersey  community and for our first responders,   God bless Karen, God bless America, and God bless our first  responders.                            ____________________
