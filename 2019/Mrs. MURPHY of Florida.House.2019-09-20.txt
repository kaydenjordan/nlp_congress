 Madam Speaker, I rise to honor the  extraordinary life and enduring legacy of Richard Swann, a constituent  of mine who recently passed away.   Richard's life was overflowing with action and accomplishment, trial  and triumph, and above all, family and friendship. Richard lost his  childhood sweetheart and beloved wife, Doris, too young, but he poured  his energy into his work, into his 4 children and 12 grandchildren, and  into his large and loyal network of friends.   Richard was a wise lawyer, a farsighted businessman, a real estate  developer, and an influential player at the highest levels of American  and Florida politics. Richard was a proud Orlando native and foresaw  the city's potential before nearly anybody else. Richard did as much as  any man to transform Orlando into the wonderful place it is today.   Richard was best known as a champion of the political causes and  candidates he cared about. He was committed to the concept of  responsible and engaged citizenship.   At the service celebrating Richard's life, his granddaughter Caroline  read an excerpt from Teddy Roosevelt's speech, ``The Man in the  Arena.'' Richard never sat on the sidelines. He was always in the  arena, striving valiantly and daring greatly.   Richard was a pillar of our central Florida community. He will be  deeply missed by all of us who had the honor to call him a friend.                            ____________________
