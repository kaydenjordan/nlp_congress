 Mr. President, like so many of us here, I have been  watching and listening to my colleagues speak on the floor about the  Judge Kavanaugh nomination for several days.   Like so many of my colleagues, I want to commend Senator Collins of  Maine for her thorough, detailed, and eloquent remarks yesterday.  Sometimes a Member gives a speech that we know will always be  remembered because of its thoroughness, its seriousness, its  thoughtfulness, and statesmanlike quality. I think we all are in  agreement that that happened yesterday with Senator Collins. I also  want to highlight the remarks of my very good friend Senator Murkowski  last night. While we voted differently yesterday and we will most  likely do so again in a few hours, she made some important points,  particularly regarding some of the issues surrounding this confirmation  process as it relates to our great State of Alaska. I very much  appreciate her friendship, and, like so many, I know this process has  been difficult for her, and she talked about that last night. In fact,  for millions of Americans and, no doubt, for thousands of Alaskans, the  process to confirm Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the U.S. Supreme Court has  been a searing one--certainly for Judge Kavanaugh and his family and  for Dr. Christine Blasey Ford and her family, and for this Senate  family, it has been a difficult period. It has also evoked very  traumatic memories of experiences that far too many women in Alaska and  America have had--far too many. I am hopeful that in the aftermath of  all this, we can go through a much needed period of healing.    As you know, the advise and consent responsibility of the Senate is a  solemn one, one of the most important responsibilities we have here.  The process I went through in order to cast my vote for Judge Kavanaugh  has been extensive and thorough and, I believe, fair, which is what I  believe my constituents back home in Alaska demand of me.   After the President announced Judge Kavanaugh's nomination, I read  hundreds of pages of decisions that he authored. I listened to the  views of Alaskans and continued to do so up until yesterday, those who  we were in favor, those who opposed.   In my first meeting several weeks ago with Judge Kavanaugh, we  discussed at length and in great depth his viewpoint on a variety of  national and Alaska-focused legal issues.   Now that wasn't the first time I had met Judge Kavanaugh. In fact, I  had known him back when we served together in the Bush Administration.  I knew him as an honest and dedicated public servant, and I actually  followed his career as a judge on the DC Circuit Court of Appeals.   The lengthy meeting in my office convinced me that he is someone who  will interpret the law and the Constitution as written. He understands  the importance of separation of powers and federalism and holds a  healthy skepticism regarding the expansive power of Federal agency, and  he is a strong protector of the Second Amendment. These are all issues  that are very important to my constituents and that they care deeply  about, which is why I focused on these issues in my discussions with  Judge Kavanaugh in my office several weeks ago. I was convinced then  and remain so that he is well qualified to be a Justice on the U.S.  Supreme Court.   As we all know, after a number of these meetings--several weeks, in  my case, after meeting with Judge Kavanaugh--two issues arose that I  took very seriously. The first was a claim that, if confirmed, Judge  Kavanaugh would not fully recognize or respect the rights of Alaskan  Native people and the U.S. Government's trust responsibilities to them.  This is very important to constituents of mine. The Alaska Federation  of Natives, a very important group back home in Alaska that represents  the Native people of my great State, wrote a memo speculating how Judge  Kavanaugh, if confirmed, would threaten unique laws and programs for  the Alaskan Native people.   The second issue that arose, of course, which we have been debating  here and the country is fully aware of, was the allegation that Judge  Kavanaugh sexually assaulted Dr. Ford in 1982 when she was 15 and he  was 17. Like many Senators, I put my heart and soul investigating such  claims, particularly given how important both of these issues were to  my constituents, and I want to address each of these in turn.   The memo of the Alaska Federation of Natives, or AFN, as we call it  back home, was focused on concerns stemming from an amicus brief  written by Judge Kavanaugh 18 years ago, when he was a private  attorney, in a case dealing with indigenous Hawaiians before the  Supreme Court called Rice v. Cayetano, in which the U.S. Supreme Court  in a 7-to-2 opinion essentially agreed with Judge Kavanaugh's position.   Alaska Natives make up roughly 20 percent of my State. They are  incredible Americans--patriotic, hard-working, a beautiful culture--and  their legal and sovereign rights, which are based on the U.S.  Constitution and Federal statutes, have been extremely hard-fought,  including in this body, over decades. Such rights are fundamental to  the health and well-being of Alaska Natives in my State.   After the AFN legal memo and similar letters and op-eds were  published back home, in Alaska, I sent them to the White House for  Judge Kavanaugh's review. I then spoke directly to him about these  issues. He reiterated to me in a thoughtful and thorough discussion  that the legal rights of Alaska Natives, to include Tribes and regional  and village corporations, are very clear and well established in the  law, which is actually different from the situation of indigenous  Hawaiians. Therefore, the views expressed by the Supreme Court in the  Cayetano opinion, which limit the rights of Native Hawaiians, do not  extend to Alaska Natives and are not applicable legally in any way in  Alaska. This is because Congress has repeatedly and explicitly  recognized the rights and the Tribal status for Alaska Natives,  including the Federal Government's trust responsibility, while,  unfortunately, in my view, Congress has not done the same for Native  Hawaiians.   Senator Murkowski was on the floor last night. I am going to talk a  little bit about that, but I think the Alaska delegation has always  tried to be supportive of the Hawaiian Nation in this regard, and we  continue to be, but, legally, they are very different.   In response to a question for the record to Judge Kavanaugh released  by the Senate Judiciary Committee, Judge Kavanaugh unequivocally  endorsed this point. He stated--this is his language:         The Supreme Court has recognized that Congress has the       ability to fulfill its treaty obligations with Native Alaskan       Regional and Village Corporations and American Indian       Tribes through legislation specifically addressed to their       concerns. Unlike indigenous peoples of Hawaii, Congress       has explicitly recognized in statute that ``Indian Tribe''       includes any recognized Indian or Alaska Native tribe,       band nation, pueblo, village or community. . . . Native       Alaskans are Indian Tribes and therefore enjoy all the       relevant rights and benefits that come in their trust       relationship with the United States.    In my conversations with Judge Kavanaugh about Alaska Native legal  issues, he also reiterated a point emphasized by Chief Justice Roberts  in the recent Supreme Court case called the Sturgeon case that because  of Federal statutes like the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act and  the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act, Congress has  repeatedly made clear that Alaska is different in many  [[Page S6681]]  ways from the lower 48, and he recognized and told me as part of this  confirmation process that many legal issues involving my State need to  be viewed through that lens.   To be perfectly clear, if I believed or saw evidence that Judge  Kavanaugh's views were somehow opposed to or hostile to Alaska  Natives--a very important population of my State that happens to  include my wife and my three daughters and my mother-in-law--I would  not support his confirmation. I told Judge Kavanaugh this directly, but  that I was also satisfied with his response after we had this  discussion--a deep, detailed discussion about these issues.   Importantly, Senator Murkowski came to the same conclusion in her  discussions with Judge Kavanaugh and she said as much in her remarks  last night.   Of course, there is another allegation, a claim that I want to talk  about this afternoon--the allegation that has been the focus of much  attention here in the Senate regarding sexual assault, which I likewise  took extremely seriously.   I respect very much Dr. Ford's bravery and sincerity in coming  forward to testify in front of the Judiciary Committee. I am convinced  that she went through a traumatic experience that has left deep wounds.  I also applaud the bravery of the men and women who have called and  written and visited my office to share their experiences in this  regard. So much of this has been very painful for so many to revisit  these episodes.   As I repeatedly stated, any allegation--all allegations--of this kind  of conduct should be seriously looked at. So I undertook the due  diligence that my constituents expect of me and that is required in the  Senate's important advise and consent role. I watched the Senate  Judiciary hearing on this issue gavel to gavel. I read every piece of  information available, including all of the interviews conducted under  the penalty of perjury by the Senate Judiciary Committee investigators.  I read text messages, threads, witness statements, letters between the  Committee and lawyers who have been involved, and confidential  committee documents. I supported and read the professional and thorough  supplemental FBI report recently submitted to the Senate which looked  deeper into this allegation and spoke to additional witnesses in  relation to it. Most importantly, I met with and heard from hundreds of  Alaskans who have suffered from sexual abuse and domestic violence.  Many flew thousands of miles--most on a moment's notice--to come to my  office to meet with me and Senator Murkowski. I applaud their bravery  and their passion. So much of this process has been painful for them.   Alaska is an amazing State. I come down to the floor all the time to  talk about its majesty and beauty and our wonderful people, and I  believe that in my soul. But one area where we are not so great or  wonderful or majestic is this. My State has the highest rates of sexual  assault and domestic violence in the country, by far, in almost every  category. It is a horrible, horrible thing, and it impacts so many  families in the Last Frontier, horribly.   Throughout my public career in Alaska, I have worked to combat sexual  assault and domestic violence by putting more offenders in jail,  bringing more resources to survivors, including much needed legal  services, and raising awareness of this heinous problem by working to  change the culture of violence, which is too pervasive in my State. We  have a lot more work to do on this issue in Alaska and across America,  including on our college campuses, and I applaud Senator Gillibrand for  her leadership in this area and many other Senators as well.   The allegations by Dr. Ford have been difficult and wrenching here in  the Senate to address. One thing is clear to me. Her allegations had  been taken seriously, as they should have been.   Mr. President, I have a summary from the Judiciary Committee on its  investigation into these and other allegations that I would ask  unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:            Summary of Senate Judiciary Committee Investigation                          (as of October 4, 2018)                                  Background         The Senate Judiciary Committee has engaged in a thorough       and robust investigation of allegations raised against Judge       Kavanaugh. Throughout the last month, Committee staff members       have collected statements, letters, and calls from       individuals around the country. The reports range from       substantive allegations of sexual misconduct, to short       messages to senators passing along internet rumors and       theories.        Committee staff continue to work tirelessly to pursue any       and all substantive leads. In the course of the continuing       investigation, staff members have spoken with 35 individuals,       a task that requires extensive work during nights and       weekends. More than 20 Committee staffers have contributed to       the investigative efforts. The Committee has not received any       evidence that would corroborate the claims made by Dr. Ford,       Ms. Ramirez, Ms. Swetnick, or anybody else.                           Allegations and Subjects       Ford Allegations        In response to Dr. Ford's allegations, Committee staff       repeatedly requested an opportunity to interview Dr. Ford,       but her lawyers repeatedly refused. Committee staff offered       to fly to California or any other location to interview Dr.       Ford. But as Dr. Ford explained at her hearing, she was not       clear that this offer had been made.        The Committee thus reopened the hearing on Judge       Kavanaugh's nomination.        During the additional hearing day (Day 5), the Committee       solicited more than 8 total hours of public testimony under       oath from Dr. Ford and Judge Kavanaugh.        In connection with the hearing, the Committee collected 24       pages of evidence from Dr. Ford in two productions. The       Committee also received Judge Kavanaugh's calendars.        The Committee also received a statement, submitted under       penalty of felony, from Dr. Ford's ex-boyfriend, who cast       serious doubt on the credibility of some of Dr. Ford's       testimony before the Committee.        Notably, he stated that he had not known her to have any       fear of flying or related claustrophobia and that she had       previously provided advice to someone on how to successfully       take a polygraph, directly contradicting her hearing       testimony.        Despite repeated requests by the Chairman, Dr. Ford still       has not supplied several key items, including the charts from       her polygraph examination, any recording of her polygraph       examination, and the therapy notes that she claimed       corroborated her story. Dr. Ford has not provided these       therapy notes to the Committee, even though she shared these       same notes with the media.        In addition to conducting the hearing, the Committee       obtained statements from the three individuals who Dr. Ford       identified as being present at the 1982 gathering: PJ Smyth,       Leland Ingham Keyser, and Mark Judge (who submitted two       statements).        Each person denied having any knowledge of the alleged       gathering. Ms. Keyser stated that she does not even know       Judge Kavanaugh and does not recall ever meeting him. And Mr.       Smyth and Mr. Judge each said they had never witnessed Judge       Kavanaugh engage in conduct of the kind described by Dr.       Ford.        The Committee contacted a total of 15 former classmates of       Judge Kavanaugh and Dr. Ford. The Committee also received       several statements, signed under penalty of felony, that       support Judge Kavanaugh's explanation of terms in his high       school yearbook.        Finally, prior to Day 5 of the hearing, the Committee staff       conducted a transcribed telephone interview with Judge       Kavanaugh regarding Dr. Ford's allegations. The Minority       staff refused to attend.      Ramirez Allegations        In response to the allegations from Ms. Ramirez, the       Committee contacted Ms. Ramirez's counsel 7 times seeking       evidence to support the claims made in The New Yorker. Ms.       Ramirez produced nothing in response. Ms. Ramirez's counsel       refused the Committee's request for an interview. Committee       staff nevertheless pursued the investigation. Staff       interviewed 5 witnesses with relevant information. Committee       staff also investigated the public statements of 3 other       individuals and found they had no knowledge of the alleged       event.        Prior to Day 5 of the hearing, Committee staff conducted a       transcribed telephone interview with Judge Kavanaugh, subject       to penalty of felony. He denied Ms. Ramirez's allegations.       Minority staff attended the interview under protest and       refused to participate.      Swetnick Allegations        In response to allegations by Ms. Swetnick, the Committee       requested evidence on 6 occasions from her. Ms. Swetnick       refused the Committee's request for an interview. Despite       this obstruction, Committee staff attempted to pursue the       investigation by interviewing 12 witnesses who claimed to       have relevant information. Committee staff obtained two sworn       statements from individuals with knowledge of Ms. Swetnick's       character and allegations.        Prior to Day 5 of the hearing, Committee staff also       interviewed Judge Kavanaugh on these allegations on two       separate transcribed telephone interviews, subject to penalty       of felony--both before (when Ms. Ramirez's allegations were       also discussed) and after Ms. Swetnick was identified by       name.  [[Page S6682]]       Judge Kavanaugh denied Ms. Swetnick's allegations, asserting       that he does not even know Ms. Swetnick. Minority staff       attended the interview under protest and refused to       participate.      Anonymous Allegation from Colorado        In response to an anonymous allegation claiming Judge       Kavanaugh pushed his girlfriend against a wall in a violent       and sexual manner in 1998, Committee staff obtained a sworn       statement from the woman dating Judge Kavanaugh at the time.       She unequivocally denied that this incident ever took place.        Committee staff also questioned Judge Kavanaugh on these       allegations during a transcribed telephone interview, subject       to penalty of felony. Like his then-girlfriend, he denied       that the incident ever took place. Minority staff attended       but refused to participate in the interview.      Allegations by Others        The author of one allegation recanted in a public Tweet.       The Committee referred the individual to the FBI for possible       violations of 18 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 1001 (materially false       statements) and 1505 (obstruction of congressional-committee       proceedings). Committee staff questioned Judge Kavanaugh       about the allegation during a transcribed telephone       interview, subject to penalty of felony. He unequivocally       denied the allegation. Minority staff attended but refused to       participate in the interview.        A second allegation was completely anonymous. Committee       staff questioned Judge Kavanaugh about the allegation during       a transcribed telephone interview, subject to penalty of       felony. He unequivocally denied the allegation. Minority       staff attended but refused to participate in the interview. A       woman has subsequently begun contacting Senate offices,       claiming to be the author of the anonymous letter. Even       though there are doubts about the authenticity of her claim,       Committee staff is investigating.                                  Conclusion         The Committee's investigation, like the FBI supplemental       background investigation, has found that there is no       corroboration of the allegations made against Judge       Kavanaugh.     This report shows a staff of over 20 members of the  Judiciary Committee literally working around the clock for weeks on all  leads--any lead that came in on these serious allegations. These  investigators have the authority of the law. When people speak to them,  if people speak to them and lie, they commit perjury. They spoke to  more than 35 individuals, pursuing any and all substantive leads. This  is in addition to the FBI report.   I want to commend Chairman Grassley for this serious and diligent  work in this regard and the work of the Committee. It wasn't  highlighted a lot, but it is very serious work. A lot of it is detailed  here.   Two important points stand out from this work. First, the Committee  has not obtained or received any evidence that would corroborate the  claims made by Dr. Ford. They talked to and tried to pursue leads in so  many different areas. Dr. Ford's allegations were investigated  respectfully and thoroughly by this Senate Judiciary staff and the FBI.  As I mentioned, she certainly had courage in coming forward.  Nevertheless, these allegations were not corroborated.   Four people Dr. Ford claims were present had no knowledge or memory  of any such event, and the others the FBI asked about the alleged  incident had no knowledge either. One of them was a lifelong friend of  Dr. Ford's. Leland Kaiser said she didn't even know Judge Kavanaugh. As  you know, all these statements were made under the penalty of perjury.   Another important point from the Judiciary Committee summary--again,  I would suggest people take a look at it given the seriousness of the  allegations and the seriousness of the investigation--that has not been  picked up on is that the minority staff of the committee, those  representing my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, refused to  participate in most of these investigations, sometimes not attending  any interviews at all, and when they did, they refused to ask  questions. This is truly a mystery to me.   One of the constant refrains and arguments--and I am saying it has  been in good faith from my colleagues on the other side of the aisle,  which continues today--is the need for more investigations into the  allegations against Judge Kavanaugh. They have been making that  argument very regularly. Yet when you read what happened in the  committee, they have refused to take part in almost any part of the  intensive ongoing investigations from the Judiciary Committee staff  investigators of which there are 20. They have been working on this  diligently.   I am not a member of the Judiciary Committee, but it is my  understanding that this is a very significant break from past  bipartisan investigations that have almost always occurred on the  Judiciary Committee for every other previous Supreme Court nominee, so  I am not sure why this happened. Perhaps one of my colleagues can  explain it, but it does make one wonder. Where does this leave us?   As Alaska's former attorney general and now as a Senator, I strongly  believe in ensuring perpetrators of sexual assault pay a very serious  penalty. I oversaw prosecutors who put such criminals away for decades  and even indicted an alleged rapist according to his DNA sequencing in  order to hold the statute of limitations for such a crime when we  couldn't physically locate the alleged perpetrator.   I also believe in the presumption of innocence, the sacrosanct and  fundamental American principle, whether in a criminal trial, a Senate  committee hearing, or the court of public opinion.   I am convinced due process should apply as much to the Senate's  advice and consent responsibility as it should in a court of law. If we  lose this basic concept of fairness, then we risk doing irreparable  damage to the very foundation of our democracy and core conceptions of  American justice and even liberty. We do not want a system of guilty  until proven innocent in America. Such a principle can lead to  incentivizing false accusations that do lasting damage, especially when  coupled with breathless media reports that repeat verbatim such  charges.   Unfortunately, we have seen this phenomenon during this confirmation  process. Now, I am not referring to the allegations of Dr. Ford, which  were taken seriously, but in the aftermath of her allegations, some  horrendous, and what appear to be patently false, claims were made  against Judge Kavanaugh. Such false allegations do tremendous damage to  the accused and his or her family, but just as bad, they also risk  undermining the credibility of true victims and true survivors of  sexual assault. This is something that has been overlooked, I believe,  in these discussions.   One of the most disheartening aspects of this confirmation process  has been how some of my Senate colleagues and members of the media were  so quick to publicly embrace some of the most outrageous and incredible  claims made against Judge Kavanaugh, like, for example, he participated  in the drugging and raping of women as a teenage boy. A senior Member  of the Judiciary Committee referenced this sickening allegation in her  opening statement in one of the hearings. The immediate damage to the  accused and to his family by such a charge which reverberated across  the Nation was obvious. Less obvious but perhaps more damaging--as so  many are in the long run--is how such false claims undermine the  ability of true victims and real survivors with real claims of sexual  assault to get justice, to be believed.   I certainly hope this is not one of the outcomes of this  dysfunctional confirmation hearing process, but it underscores how and  why the entire system of American justice and fairness can be  undermined if we abandon the presumption of innocence.   Finally, I again want to thank and applaud so many of the women in  particular, including so many Alaskans, who flew to DC, who have spoken  out about this nomination, and have shared stories about their very  difficult experiences with assault. I know from being in meetings with  them and hearing from them and listening and reading, that this process  has brought fresh and painful and difficult memories for so many. I  want them to know that from the bottom of my heart, I am committed more  than ever to work on combating these horrible crimes in domestic  violence and trying to change the culture in our Nation to one of  respect.   Indeed, if there is a silver lining to come out of this contentious  confirmation process, it is that the awareness and commitment to do  more to combat these horrible crimes has been heightened. I have heard  this from many of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle in the past  few days--including Senators Murkowski, Collins, Harris, and  [[Page S6683]]  Klobuchar--and I am certainly committed to working with all of them to  make this happen.   At the same time, I do not agree with some of the comments made on  the floor that a vote in favor of Judge Kavanaugh is somehow condoning  sexual assault or somehow not believing all survivors. As Senator  Collins stated yesterday, nothing could be further from the truth. A  bipartisan majority of Senators, men and women, are likely to vote for  Judge Kavanaugh in a few hours. To mark all of them as somehow not  caring about the broader issue of sexual assault in America is not only  untrue and an affront to them but undermines the larger cause of  working together to combat this issue.   I do not believe this is a binary choice. This is not and should not  be a Republican-versus-Democratic issue. This is actually an American  epidemic, and, frankly, it should be viewed more as an American male  issue. The men are the ones who are committing the vast majority of the  abuse, and we need to work together in this body and across the country  to be united to stop it.   I will be voting to confirm Judge Kavanaugh as the next Associate  Justice on the Supreme Court, but on this broader topic that I have  been discussing this afternoon, our country has a lot of healing and a  lot of work to do. I am certainly ready to do my part in that regard  with all of my Senate colleagues, Republican and Democratic.   I yield the floor.
