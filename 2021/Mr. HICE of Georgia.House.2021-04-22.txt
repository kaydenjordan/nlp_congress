 Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member for  yielding.   I don't even know where to begin to respond to what we just heard. To  imply that Washington, D.C., has no representation is absolutely false.  It does have local representation. It also has a Delegate right here in  the House of Representatives and has electoral votes for Presidential  elections, things that no other city in this country has.   This H.R. 51 flies in the face of what our Founders intended. They  never wanted the seat of our government to be a State, and they  specifically framed the Constitution to say so. Yet, what the Democrats  really are trying to do, that they will not admit, is gain even more  representation by creating a city-state whereby they get two more  Senators.   Again, this is absolutely against what our Constitution and our  Founders intended, and this ought to be soundly rejected, permanently  rejected.
