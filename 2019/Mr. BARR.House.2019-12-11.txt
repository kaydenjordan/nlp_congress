 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of a unique and  special man and my good friend, U.S. Marine Corporal, Retired, Matthew  Bradford. Matthew is stepping down as veterans outreach coordinator in  my district office.   Matthew, who grew up in our district in Winchester, Kentucky,  enlisted in the United States Marine Corps when he graduated from high  school, and he was assigned to the 2nd Battalion, 3rd Marines, Echo  Company, 2nd Platoon.   He was deployed to Iraq in 2006, and on January 18, 2007, he suffered  catastrophic injuries as a result of the detonation of an improvised  explosive device. His severe injuries left him totally blind, and he  lost both of his legs.   Matthew persevered, and he learned to overcome and adapt from his  injuries. In 2010, Matthew became the first blind double amputee in  history to reenlist in the Marine Corps.   On behalf of a grateful nation, I thank him for his service, his  sacrifice, and his patriotism.   Matthew Bradford is a very determined individual. After his service  with the Marine Corps ended, he married his ``Warrior Princess,''  Amanda. Together, they have three children.   Through hard work and determination, Matthew graduated from the  University of Kentucky.   Matthew found his purpose in motivating and encouraging others to  overcome difficult obstacles. He spends a great deal of his time  speaking to groups and individuals and participating in challenging  athletic events, including marathons, skydiving, surfing, hunting, and  climbing 7,000 feet up Mount Rainier.   Matthew came to work in the Sixth Congressional District office in  the spring of 2017, serving first as a college intern, then as my  national security fellow, and, lastly, as our veterans outreach  coordinator.   In his work in our district office, Matthew has been a strong  advocate for veterans. He worked with our veterans coalition, and it  has grown tremendously under his leadership.   Matthew has worked on many outreach initiatives, including our  Facebook page, and has worked diligently to improve the lives of  America's veterans. His work with veterans has made quite a difference.   His passion, his humor, and his determination will be greatly missed  in our office, but his life's work in service to his community and the  Nation will surely continue.   Matthew has earned many honors, including the Purple Heart medal, the  George Van Cleve Military Leadership Award, the Gary Sinise Hope for  the Warriors Award, and induction into the Kentucky Veterans Hall of  Fame. He  [[Page H10026]]  was also invited by President Trump to attend the 2018 State of the  Union Address.   In his position in the Sixth District office, he has earned the  respect of all of his coworkers and all of the constituents with whom  he has interacted. He leaves a lasting legacy as a servant leader.   I am honored to call Matthew a loyal and trusted friend. I wish him  all the best as he moves on to other interests.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Corporal Bradford for his friendship, for his  tireless work on behalf of the people of the Sixth District, and his  outstanding service to the country.                              Two-State Solution     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to acknowledge the United States  most important strategic ally in the Middle East, the nation of Israel.    Last week, the House voted on and nearly passed, along mostly  partisan lines, a nonbinding resolution reinforcing the failed two- state policy that has been pushed on both the Israeli and Palestinian  people since the signing of the failed Oslo Accords. I opposed that  resolution.   The truth is we need a new way of thinking about the path toward a  lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East. The idea that  politicians from outside of Israel can impose a top-down forced  division of Arabs and Israelis is nonsense.   Rhetoric about a negotiated two-state resolution is not credible when  it is promoted by those who criticize Israel's settlements within the  Biblical homeland of the Jewish people. Current Israeli settlements  established through peaceful means extend the reach of freedom and  democracy, while the proposed ejection of Jews from settlements has a  record incongruent with peace.   The 2005 Israeli withdrawal from Gaza has been a disaster for  Palestinians, allowing terrorist groups like Hamas and PIJ to take over  and terrorize that strip of land and its citizens.   I have personally been to Judea and Samaria, and I have witnessed  Jews and Arabs working together, side by side, in private enterprise,  seeing that peace is possible.   When stability exists under the rule of law, under the freedom and  security offered by the State of Israel, businesses thrive, families  earn a living, and freedom and democracy expand--all things that I  encourage my colleagues to consider.                            ____________________
