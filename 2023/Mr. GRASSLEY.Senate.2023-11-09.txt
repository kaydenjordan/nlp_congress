 I ask for the yeas and nays.    Madam President, recently, I had the opportunity to  meet with a group of religious leaders from Ukraine. They represented  multiple Christian denominations, plus Islam and Judaism. They spoke of  the role faith is playing in the resilience and determination we have  seen from the Ukrainian people.   One of the religious leaders who spoke to me was Dr. Ivan Rusyn. He  is president of the Ukrainian Evangelical Theological Seminary. His  seminary trains evangelical ministers from various Protestant  backgrounds. It was hit by six Russian rockets when Russia invaded.   Dr. Rusyn lives in Bucha, and we all see that as being infamous by  the atrocities that were committed against civilians by the Russian  occupiers and also some of those people being brought before the world  court for inhumane treatment. In fact, Russian soldiers even occupied  Dr. Rusyn's home.   Under the Soviet Union, Ivan and his family had to practice their  faith in secret because evangelicals were imprisoned if caught.   In today's Ukraine, he and fellow Ukrainians are free to practice  their faith. In fact, he told me that the relief work his seminary has  been doing since the full-scale invasion has been bringing more and  more people to the church.   Dr. Rusyn is a humble, soft-spoken man with a clear and powerful  message. He said that in the midst of war, it is sometimes hard to feel  the presence of God, but in coming to the United States with this  delegation and meeting people who care about the suffering of the  Ukrainian people, he felt God's presence more than ever. His strong  faith in God and his deep concern for his fellow Ukrainians impressed  me.   Dr. Rusyn also told me about the persecution of his counterparts in  the Russian-occupied areas of Ukraine. That is about 20 percent of  Ukraine. Religious leaders are kidnapped, and evangelicals are singled  out for persecution just like in the days of the old Soviet Union. A  Ukrainian priest among the group told me that most of the faith leaders  sitting in my office are on Putin's hit list to be singled out for  persecution or death if they fall into the hands of the Russian  military.   Under Vladimir Putin, Russia has passed a law as recently as 2016  requiring all religious organizations and churches to be registered  with the Russian Government. The law bans what the law calls  ``missionary activities'' like preaching, like praying, like  disseminating religious materials outside of officially approved sites  within Russia.   According to a special report by the Institute for the Study of War,  Russia has used this 2016 law to prosecute American Baptists and  Pentecostal missionaries operating in Russia and also to outlaw most  Mormon missionary work and to burn foreign-distributed Bibles not  properly registered with the state.   According to this report by the Institute for the Study of War, the  Russian state has also persecuted Seventh-day Adventists, Jehovah's  Witnesses, Roman Catholics, Presbyterians, Methodists, Lutherans, and  Orthodox church groups that are not affiliated with the Russian state.   Russia's Prosecutor-General's Office declared four evangelical  Christian groups as ``undesirable'' organizations as recently as 2021.  Now, that effectively had banned these organizations from operating  within Russia.   Russian authorities in occupied Melitopol raided a Ukrainian  evangelical pastor's home in August 2022 and accused the pastor of  being associated with the same undesirable organizations that Russian  authorities banned in Russia in 2021.   The former head of Russian-occupied Donetsk declared in May of 2015  that Ukrainian Orthodox Church members, Greek Catholics, and  evangelical Christians were ``sectarians'' and that occupation  authorities would only recognize the Russian Orthodox Church,  Catholicism, Islam, and Judaism.   The Russian Orthodox Church plays a role in the Russian state that is  hard for Americans to understand. Most importantly, with all the  killing going on in Ukraine, the head of the Russian Orthodox Church  has blessed that war by particularly saying Putin is doing the right  thing.   In our country, we know, under our Constitution, the Founding Fathers  prohibited the establishment of a state church and enshrined a right to  the free exercise of religion in the First Amendment. This was done to  allow religion to flourish independent of our government.   Now, by contrast and great contrast, the Russian Orthodox Church has  always been not just a state church but an instrument going back as far  as the tsars of Russia. Under the Soviet Union, it became an instrument  of the KGB, the Russian secret police.   In fact, the current patriarch of the Russian Orthodox Church was a  KGB agent. As I have indicated already in these remarks, that  individual has blessed this war, and with his being a KGB agent, it is  no wonder he is so close to Putin, who also worked for the KGB. That  same Russian patriarch has vocally, as I am saying again, supported the  brutal invasion and has told Russian soldiers they will be absolved of  all sins should they die in the Ukraine military operation.    Because the Russian Orthodox Church acts as a tool of the Russian  state, many Orthodox churches in Ukraine have joined the restored  Independent Orthodox Church of Ukraine. Some church officials in  Ukraine who remained loyal to Moscow have been documented to act as  agents of influence and espionage on behalf of the Putin regime, so  naturally some have been arrested by Ukrainian authorities.   One Ukrainian Orthodox priest who was captured by the Russian  military shortly after the full-scale invasion back in February 2022  tells how his captors tortured and interrogated him, demanding to know  what part of the Ukrainian secret service he worked for--you know,  assuming that they do in Ukraine like they do in Russia: that the  church might be part of some government scheme to narrow freedoms or  whatever, for that matter. These Russians assumed that because their  priests are tied to a successor to the KGB, Ukrainian priests, then,  must be agents of the Ukrainian state, which is not the case.   The Ukrainian Government also canceled a lease with the Russian- affiliated Orthodox Church at the Kyiv Lavra Monastery--a national  historic landmark owned by the Ukrainian state right there in the  center of the capital of Ukraine, Kyiv. The lease cancelation led to  false reports of the Ukrainian Government's persecuting Christians.  However, 2 weeks after the Russian-aligned church officials left, a  member of my staff visited this same monastery and received a blessing  from a Ukrainian Orthodox priest. So I can confirm that Christian  services are still performed there; only now it is in the Ukrainian  language.   Incidentally, the former Russian Orthodox head priest at the  monastery  [[Page S5445]]  was apparently nicknamed ``Mercedes'' because he collected Mercedes  cars. That is not the hobby you would expect of a lot of spiritual  leaders.   Putin likes to pretend that Russia is some kind of defender of the  Christian faith, but in reality, Russia is one of the most secular  countries in the world.   The Soviet Union, as we know, was an atheist state, so most countries  that share a Soviet past have lost much of their religious life. That  is doubly true in Russia, where, according to a 2018 Pew Research poll,  only 7 percent of the people attend weekly church services, only 18  percent of Russians pray daily, and only 16 percent feel that religion  is very important in their lives.   By comparison, in Ukraine, these people are significantly more  religious than Russians, with well over twice as many people attending  weekly services at 17 percent, with 30 percent of the Ukrainians  reportedly praying daily, and with 23 percent saying that religion is a  very important part of their lives.   Russia has been designated by our own State Department as a ``country  of particular concern'' and, according to that designation, is  ``engaging in and tolerating systematic, ongoing, and egregious  violations of religious freedom.''   By contrast, Ukraine has religious freedom, and there is no state  church, so it is no wonder that Ukrainians are more active in their  faith.   I was encouraged by Dr. Rusyn's account of his own growing ministry.  He also said he has contributed chaplains from his seminary to the  military since the full-scale invasion--something that was not  previously a tradition of Orthodox countries. As a result, evangelicals  are particularly well represented as military chaplains. Now, I am sad  to say, one of his students has already been lost while serving as a  chaplain at the frontlines.   I am going to go back to this report by the Institute for the Study  of War that I referenced earlier.         [T]he most common victims of Russian religious persecution       after Ukrainian Orthodox are Protestants, particularly       evangelical Baptists. Protestants of all denominations were       the victims of 34 percent of the reported persecution events       that [the Institute on the Study of War] observed. Baptists       made up 13 percent of victims--the largest single group after       Ukrainian Orthodox. . . . Russian forces' persecution of       Protestants is most intense in southern Ukraine. Protestants       were the victims of 35 percent and 48 percent of the reported       persecution events in occupied Kherson and Zaporizhia oblasts       respectively. Protestants suffered two-thirds of the reported       repression events in occupied Mariupol City.    The Institute for the Study of War report also cited an incident  where Russian troops ``commandeered a Kherson-based Ukrainian  evangelical Baptist educational institute from March-November of 2022  and established a garrison and crematorium there to cremate killed  Russian soldiers. The institute's rector stated that Russian soldiers  repeatedly harassed the Baptists, calling them `American spies,'  calling them `sectarians,' and [calling them] `enemies of the Russian  Orthodox people.' One Russian officer reportedly told workers at the  institute, `Evangelical believers like you should be completely  destroyed . . . a simple shooting would be too easy for you. You need  to be buried alive,' and another Russian soldier reportedly said, `We  will bury [Baptist] sectarians like you.' Russian soldiers raided and  closed another Baptist Church . . . in September 2022. Congregants  reported that armed Russian soldiers interrupted their worship service  and stated, `Your feet will not be here after referendum. We have only  one faith, Orthodoxy.' ''   Nearly 500 religious sites and spaces were damaged, destroyed, or  looted during the first year of the Russian invasion. People of faith  in Ukraine are suffering. Dr. Rusyn's ask of Americans is a simple  thing: ``Please hear our cry.''   Toward the end of my meeting with the Russian faith leaders, the  rabbi in the group made another ask of me. He said the Ukrainians need  our prayers. This was echoed by other Ukrainian faith leaders in my  office.   I agreed to keep the Ukrainian people in my prayers. I ask that my  fellow Americans of faith also surround the Ukrainian people in prayer  at this very difficult time. And I pray that they feel the very real  presence of God amidst their suffering.   I yield the floor.
