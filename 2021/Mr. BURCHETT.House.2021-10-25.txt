 Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Wagner for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, the Congressional Gold Medal, as we all know and have  heard, is Congress' highest medal. It is the least we can do for the 13  brave servicemembers killed during our withdrawal from Afghanistan back  in August.   One of those 13, Army Staff Sergeant Ryan Knauss, was from Corryton,  Tennessee, in my congressional district. As a matter of fact, I live in  Corryton, and his family, they are neighbors of mine.   His grandfather called me shortly after and described the scene. We  have all seen it in movies, but he, unfortunately, had to live it. The  car pulls up. The Army officers get out and, in fact, inform his family  that his grandson had perished in Afghanistan.   Mr. Speaker, I have heard that story many times because my mama  endured that very same thing when she was a young girl in Cheatham  County, Tennessee, and her brother, Roy, had died fighting the Nazis.  So it is in my head pretty thick, sir.   Of course, he was killed while helping complete strangers, and that  is what he loved to do. He loved helping folks.   When Staff Sergeant Knauss succumbed to his injuries after the  attack, he became the final American military  [[Page H5853]]  casualty from the war in Afghanistan. We were all devastated by this  loss, but our community is very strong.   Mr. Speaker, on September 11, they held a great local tribute to this  fallen hero at Gibbs High School, on the football field. And on  September 21, I also attended his funeral as he was laid to rest at  Arlington National Cemetery.   Today, we honor him and 12 fellow heroes further by passing this  legislation. The true heroes in this country are the men and women of  our Armed Forces. They are the ones who keep us free. Their patriotism  and bravery have kept us safe every day.    Madam Speaker, back in 2020 when the coronavirus  vaccines were developed under the Trump administration, Joe Biden and  progressive Democrats trashed them in the media. As you can see from  these  [[Page H5856]]  quotes, they were extremely skeptical about the effectiveness of  coronavirus vaccines when Donald Trump was in charge.   Of course, when Biden became President, the vaccine suddenly became  entirely effective and highly encouraged. But Jen Psaki still  maintained in July that mandating these vaccines is ``not the Federal  Government's role.''   But now President Biden is forcing millions of Americans to choose  between keeping their jobs or getting the vaccine. My office is flooded  daily with calls from constituents who risk losing their livelihoods  because of this administration's mandate. Apparently, protecting  Americans' freedoms to make their own healthcare decisions is too much  to ask.   So far Joe Biden's Presidency has been defined by his out-of-touch  agenda. A vaccine mandate is not what Americans want and is  inconsistent with our national values, Madam Speaker.   Tennesseans value freedom from government tyranny. That is why we  elect leaders like Governor Billy Lee and members of the Tennessee  General Assembly, who are fighting outrageous vaccine mandates.   Our country prospers when elected leaders protect Americans'  constitutional rights and freedoms. Unfortunately, this is a radical  concept to President Joe Biden.                            ____________________
