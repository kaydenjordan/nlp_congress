 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 7, the No  Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act.   Madam Speaker, barring the use of certain Federal funding for  abortion is not a new concept. The Hyde amendment has, more or less,  called for this ban for 40 years, but the Hyde amendment is not  permanent and must be reintroduced every year for it to go into effect.  As such, it has been reformed from time to time, and, sooner or later,  I believe it will cease to be implemented; so it is time to make the  Hyde amendment permanent law. It is long overdue.   Madam Speaker, this bill we are debating is not about man versus  woman; it is not about liberal versus conservative; H.R. 7 is not about  taking away the rights of a woman. It is about protecting the rights of  the unborn because, at the end of the day, this is what this comes down  to. Who knew something so obviously and so morally right would be so  controversial?   I ask my colleagues to support this bill as we protect the lives of  those who cannot speak for themselves.   In God we trust.                            ____________________
