 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 4909,  the STOP School Violence Act, which includes my bipartisan legislation  to increase access to emergency panic buttons in the classroom.   I want to thank Mr. Rutherford for his bill before us today, and my  friend from Illinois (Mr. Schneider) for partnering with me on the  school safety language we had included in this bill.   As a father and a grandfather, I know firsthand how important it is  that our Nation's children have a safe environment to grow and learn.  As a former first responder, I know that response time is vitally  important during any emergency situation. This bill makes it much  easier for schools to increase their security and provide lifesaving  technology to contact first responders immediately when violence or any  other emergency occurs.   We already have panic buttons to protect our investments at our  banks. Well, there is no greater investment in the country than our  children. We should be doing the best to protect them, too, and this  legislation is a step in the right direction.  [[Page H1563]]    Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support this legislation.
