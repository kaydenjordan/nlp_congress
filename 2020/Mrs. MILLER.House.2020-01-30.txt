 Madam Speaker, I rise today in remembrance of the 75th  anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz Concentration Camp.   I grew up in a Jewish community, alongside children of Holocaust  survivors. It was something that was so real and so close. Following  the liberation of Auschwitz and the devastation of the Holocaust, we  must never forget the tragedy that happens when religious persecution  goes unchecked.   We need to remember the six million heartbreaking deaths of our  Jewish brothers and sisters around the world to ensure that they are  never forgotten. We must teach our next generation about the horrors of  the Holocaust to ensure that it will never happen again.   We must speak out, now and forever, against religious oppression,  against anti-Semitism, and against radical extremism.   We have all been taught the Golden Rule and we all should live by it.                            ____________________
