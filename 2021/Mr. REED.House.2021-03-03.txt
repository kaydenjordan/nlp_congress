 Mr. Speaker, I rise today on an issue that is so important  to so many of the people from my district, and that is election  integrity.   I am confident in the integrity of our democracy, but the fact  remains that over 59 percent of Americans do not have confidence in the  integrity of our election process.   Time and time again, I have worked across the aisle with my  Democratic colleagues to try to come together on commonsense reforms to  address the issue of election integrity, and the issue that I am  passionate about today is the question of voter ID.   Mr. Speaker, the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Bishop) and I had  an amendment that we asked to be considered and debated on this floor  to say that funds under this bill would not go to States that did not  have a voter ID law in place. A simple reform to make sure that we have  voter ID cards issued across America is a simple, commonsense integrity  measure for our election systems to make sure that our votes count and  the people casting the votes are those individuals who are registered  to make that vote.   We have IDs in America for simple things like buying alcohol, renting  a car, and going into your grocery stores to get food stamps. We issue  government IDs for EBT cards. There are simple ways to make sure that  people have access to identification so that they could perform one of  the most fundamental civic duties and fundamental rights that we have,  and that is to vote.   To ask an individual to have an ID is a simple measure, and my  Democratic colleagues did not allow us to have that debate and have an  open, honest conversation.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to vote ``no'' on these amendments  and continue to work with us to ensure that the election integrity of  our country is safe and secure.
