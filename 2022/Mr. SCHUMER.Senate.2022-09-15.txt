 Madam President, last night, as most Americans were in  bed asleep, freight rail companies and unions representing tens of  thousands of workers secured a tentative agreement that will keep the  trains running on time and keep our economy moving. And the best part  is that union leadership representing tens of thousands of railway  workers, who have worked themselves to the bone over the course of the  pandemic, seem to have secured the higher pay and better working  conditions for their members. Railway workers have earned that pay and  those benefits through blood, sweat, and tears, and I hope it will make  it easier for other workers in future negotiations to secure stronger  benefits.   This is exactly the sort of outcome that will keep our economy going,  our supply chains running, and, most importantly, our workers well- taken care of. The episode is a reminder of an evergreen truth that  people underappreciate even now: Workers are what make the wheels of  our economy turn--in this case, literally.   I want to thank President Biden and Secretary Walsh, who was  steadfast and dedicated, and in a word that we have used for our Senate  caucus, he persisted and persisted and persisted. I want to thank every  single union representative and railworker who negotiated in good faith  to reach this outcome.    I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I thank my colleagues from Oklahoma and  Nebraska for letting us go forward.   In a few moments, I will file cloture on a measure that will get the  Senate to approve the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol.   This important amendment, which already has been agreed to by 120  countries, will affirm our Nation's commitment to curb the use of  dangerous hydrofluorocarbons, HFCs. These hypertoxic chemicals are  regularly found, unfortunately, in everyday appliances from air  conditioners to refrigerators.   In December of 2020, we passed the AIM Act, which took a drastic step  to limit HFCs and was one of the most significant climate  accomplishments ever, of course, until we passed the Inflation  Reduction Act a month ago.   HFCs need to be dealt with as soon as possible because they are  thousands--thousands--of times more damaging to our atmosphere than  carbon dioxide. So this is a very important opportunity for the Senate  to make official America's intention to phase these dangerous chemicals  out of use.   Approving this amendment will require two-thirds of the Senate.  Reducing our country's use of HFCs has been a bipartisan priority in  the past, so both parties should work together to accelerate passage of  this measure.   Also, I will file on the nomination of Judge Florence Pan to serve as  a circuit court judge for the D.C. Circuit, one of the most important  judicial appointments we can make. After the Supreme Court, the D.C.  Circuit Court of Appeals is the most important Federal court in the  country with jurisdiction over cases involving Congress and the entire  executive branch. The judges who preside on the D.C. Circuit must be  individuals of high character, unassailable qualifications.   A few months ago, we elevated someone who meets these standards when  confirming Michelle Childs to the bench, and we intend to do it again  with Judge Pan's nomination.   Looking ahead, confirming even more of the President's judicial  nominees will be a priority for the Senate.                            ____________________     Madam President, I move to proceed to executive session  to consider Calendar No. 1067.    Madam President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.    Madam President, I move to proceed to legislative  session.    Madam President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.    I ask unanimous consent that the mandatory quorum calls  for the cloture motions filed today, September 15, be waived.    I ask unanimous consent that the filing deadline for  first-degree amendments to Calendar No. 2, Treaty Document No. 117-1 be  at 4 p.m. on Monday, September 9.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  consider the following nominations en bloc: Calendar Nos. 1066, 1141,  1142, 1143, 1144; all nominations on the Secretary's desk in the  Foreign Service; that the Senate vote on the nominations en bloc  without intervening action or debate; that the motions to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table; and that the President be  immediately notified of the Senate's action.    I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to  legislative session and be in a period of morning business with  senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    I ask unanimous consent that the Secretary of the Senate  be authorized to request the House of Representatives to return the  papers on S. 1198; further, upon receipt of the bill from the House,  the Senate's actions on September 8, 2022, with respect to S. 1198, be  vitiated; that the Senate then proceed to the immediate consideration  of S. 1198; that the committee-reported substitute be withdrawn, the  Tester substitute amendment at the desk be considered and agreed to;  the bill, as amended, be considered read a third time and passed, and  the motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table,  all without intervening action or debate.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the Committee  on the Judiciary be discharged from further consideration, and the  Senate now proceed to S. Res. 755.    I ask unanimous consent the resolution be agreed to, the  preamble be agreed to, and that the motions to reconsider be considered  made and laid upon the table.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed immediately to consideration of S. Res. 767, which was  submitted earlier today.    I further ask that the resolution be agreed to, the  preamble be agreed to, and the motions to reconsider be considered made  and laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the Senate  proceed to the consideration of S. Res. 768, submitted earlier today.    I ask unanimous consent the resolution be agreed to, the  preamble be agreed to, and that the motions to reconsider be considered  made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate.    And, finally--I thank again my colleagues from Oklahoma  and Nebraska--I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate completes  its business today, it adjourn until 3 p.m. on Monday, September 19,  and that following the prayer and the pledge, the morning hour be  deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date, the  time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the day,  and morning business be closed; that upon the conclusion of morning  business, the Senate proceed to executive session to resume  consideration of the Pan nomination; further, that the cloture motions  filed during today's session ripen at 5:30 p.m.; finally, that if any  nominations are confirmed during Monday's session, the motions to  reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table and the President  be immediately notified of the Senate's action.    If there is no further business to come before the  Senate, I ask that it stand adjourned under the previous order,  following the remarks of Senators Lankford and Sasse.    I yield the floor.
