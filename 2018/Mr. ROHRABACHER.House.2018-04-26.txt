 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I want to thank Congressman DeFazio  and, of course, Chairman Shuster for their hard work that they put into  this.   Unfortunately, my amendment, as it indicates, is that a large part of  the job that I would have hoped that would have been accomplished by  the FAA reauthorization was not done in a way that handles what is, in  my area, the most significant problem. There are a great many  provisions there. But my amendment today, which I am advocating today,  seeks to correct one area that has been given underwhelmingly little  treatment in this legislation, and that is called: correcting the  problems of air noise over our neighborhoods.                                time  1500    My amendment, the amendment we are discussing at this point, will  ensure that aircraft transitioning from flight over ocean to flight  over land be no lower than is absolutely necessary for safety.   Many times over our coastal communities, planes are flying much lower  on approach, after taking off, and briefly climbing back over the ocean  and then over the land.   There is no reason that some aircraft need to be at 1,600 feet when  other aircraft can safely fly at 3,500 feet. This amendment will  correct that problem. It will require those aircraft that are coming  over the ocean and onto land and into some flight pattern in our local  airports and nationally in those airports, that they fly at the highest  altitude that is safe in this situation.   Unfortunately, I have had four amendments that were not permitted  that would have corrected the noise problem altogether and it would  have said that we would have then been able to address it.   The reason it wasn't addressed as the bill was being prepared is that  this legislation and the regulations of the FAA say that safety will be  the first priority, efficiency will be the second priority, and then  community impact on those communities below have third priority.   Well, the fact is there is no reason why--number one, safety does  have to be first, we know that--but there is no reason why the  excessive noise and the impact of noise and pollution on the cities  below a landing area or a taking-off area should not have more  consideration than simply the efficiency of the airlines to save a few  minutes.   I am very upset that those amendments that would have corrected this  problem--number one, all we have to do is make sure that we are  mandating the right priorities for the FAA; that efficiency is less  important than the communities that are being flown over, because every  day, those people have to experience noise and pollution due to the  fact that they live near an airport.   So those amendments, however, were not made in order, and I would  officially hope that we can deal with that later, but that is a great  disservice to those people around the country who are suffering  excessive noise that didn't need to happen.   So this amendment goes far enough in terms of an issue like that, but  we should be solving the problem by changing the priorities and  mandating that all airplanes, when they are flying over populated  areas, the people who they are flying over have to be given  consideration by making sure that that plane is flying at the highest  altitude that is safe.   Unfortunately, as I say, the amendments that I offered that would  have mandated that actually were not made in order.   This amendment will come to grips a little bit on this issue, but we  had an opportunity here to change and to solve one of the basic  complaints that are being made throughout our country by American  citizens when dealing with air traffic.   When we are here, our job isn't just to watch out for the airliners.  That is not it. We have to be considerate about the American people,  and especially those people whose homes are there underneath the flight  patterns.   That is not what has happened in this legislation, and I am very  disturbed about it, because I had five amendments that would have  solved this problem once and for all, would have been fair to the  airlines, would have made sure we were safe, that people were safe, but  at the same time, we would see that the American people who live  underneath these flight paths were treated fairly and that their  families were not put at risk by excessive noise and by pollution that  comes from airlines flying overhead.   Mr. Chair, I ask for my amendment to be accepted, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.
