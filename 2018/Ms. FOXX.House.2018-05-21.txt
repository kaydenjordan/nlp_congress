 Mr. Speaker, I rise to applaud President Trump for issuing  the Protect Life Rule, delivering on his promise to ensure that the  government is not involved in the abortion business--either directly or  indirectly.   When Title X was created in 1970, Congress intended for these funds  to go toward family planning programs, explicitly barring abortion  providers from receiving funds by stating: ``None of the funds  appropriated under this title shall be used in programs where abortion  is a method of family planning.''   Since then, the will of Congress and those we represent has been  undermined as Title X funds have routinely contributed to employee  salaries, facility costs, and medical supplies for abortion providers.   The Protect Life Rule is a victory for the majority of Americans who  are fundamentally opposed to taxpayer-funded abortion without  decreasing funding for other Title X beneficiaries, and I stand by our  pro-life President's decision.                            ____________________
