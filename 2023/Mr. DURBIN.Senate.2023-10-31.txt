 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, last night, I announced that the Senate  Judiciary Committee, which I chair, will vote to subpoena Harlan Crow,  Robin Arkley, and Leonard Leo--two billionaire megadonors and one of  their enablers--who sit at the center of the ethical crisis currently  gripping the U.S. Supreme Court.   This vote is the next step in the committee's ongoing investigation  on the ethics of the Supreme Court. It comes only after Mr. Crow  refused to comply with committee requests and Mr. Leo and Arkley  outright stonewalled the committee in the exercise of our  constitutional authority.   For years--years--reports of ethical misconduct by individual  Justices on the Court have raised serious concerns; but over the past  year, a series of investigative reports have brought the long-simmering  issue to a boil. Story after story has emerged about lavish gifts and  luxury trips that Supreme Court Justices shamelessly accepted and  failed to disclose. The reported behavior is unworthy of anyone in  public office, and it has led to an historic loss of public confidence  in the Supreme Court.   Some background here is necessary. Harlan Crow is a billionaire and a  Republican megadonor. He first met Justice Clarence Thomas in the mid- 1990s after Thomas's confirmation to the Supreme Court. Not long after  they met, Crow began to shower Justice Thomas with lavish gifts,  flights on his private jet, invitations to an all-male, invitation-only  private club, and a $19,000 Bible that once belonged to Frederick  Douglass.   We know about these initial gifts because Justice Thomas listed them  and disclosed them on the financial disclosure forms he was required to  submit under Federal law, but those disclosures abruptly stopped in  2004, almost 20 years ago, after a Los Angeles Times report questioned  their propriety.   We have since learned that Justice Thomas since continued to receive  gifts from Crow that are staggering in both their number and value-- from additional flights on Crow's private jets to nearly annual stays  at Crow's luxury camps and private clubs, to vacations on Crow's  superyacht. Justice Thomas simply stopped disclosing these gifts to the  American people.   But Harlan Crow is not the only billionaire bankrolling the lavish  lifestyle of a Supreme Court Justice, and Justice Clarence Thomas is  not the only Justice to accept improper gifts.   Let's turn to Robin Arkley. In 2008, Arkley hosted Justice Samuel  Alito in his luxury fishing lodge in Alaska. There, Alito fished, flew  on the lodge's bush planes, and enjoyed wine costing upwards of $1,000  a bottle--$1,000 a bottle. Justice Alito included none of this on his  financial disclosure--nothing.   That 2008 luxury fishing trip was arranged by a man named Leonard  Leo. Leo has been a longtime leader of the  [[Page S5239]]  conservative Federalist Society and other far-right organizations. He  is the key architect of the rightwing campaign to take over the Federal  courts, facilitating relationships between political donors and  Justices, championing conservative political causes, and wielding a  shadowy network of influence over Federal and State judges.   How can a Supreme Court Justice accept such lavish gifts, let alone  fail to disclose them to the American people? The answer is very  simple: The Supreme Court of the United States, the highest court in  the land, does not have an enforceable code of conduct. Unlike  employees of the executive and legislative branches--virtually all of  them--unlike Members of Congress and all other Federal judges, the nine  Supreme Court Justices alone decide for themselves what conduct is and  is not appropriate.   More than 11 years ago, I asked Chief Justice Roberts to adopt a  binding code of conduct for all Supreme Court Justices. I have renewed  that request repeatedly this year, including last month when I sat  literally physically next to the Chief Justice and spoke at the  Judicial Conference. Some Justices have now publicly joined the call  for an ethics code. I do believe the majority of the Justices on the  Supreme Court are embarrassed by these disclosures and want this to  come to an end.   So far, Chief Justice John Roberts and the Court have failed to do  anything. In the face of the Supreme Court's failure, the Senate  Judiciary Committee has exercised its constitutional right and duty to  investigate this ethical crisis in order to craft and advance  legislation to address it.   Beginning in May, the committee has sent letters to a number of these  billionaires, activists, and organizations connected to the undisclosed  gifts and travel. I am sorry to say I happen to believe that we have  just seen a small amount of the lavish gifts that have gone to the  members of the Court. Thanks to the investigative efforts of  journalists, as well as the Senate Finance Committee, we have  discovered some of these things, but, sadly, I believe there is much  more out there.   We are seeking details about what exactly has been given to these  Supreme Court Justices as well as how certain individuals and groups  that have business before the Court gained such enormous access to the  private lives of these Justices. Getting this information is critical.   While there has been reporting on the Justices' ethical failures, I  am sorry to say that there is more information out there we need to  find.   Just last week--listen to this--the Senate Finance Committee revealed  that yet another wealthy benefactor, Anthony Welters, had forgiven a  $267,000 interest-only loan to Justice Thomas to purchase a luxury RV.  Justice Thomas failed to disclose that.   So you understand what happened: The Justice, who seems to fancy  these RVs, had his eye on one that cost over a quarter of a million  dollars. Mr. Welters agreed to loan him the money to buy the RV.  Justice Thomas made one annual payment of interest on that debt, and  then the debt was forgiven. And so the RV is his, a gift from Mr.  Welters.   While the loan itself had been the subject of prior reporting, it was  only through the Finance Committee's investigation--and the cooperation  of Mr. Welters, let me add--that the favorable terms of the loan and  its ultimate forgiveness came to light. In contrast to Mr. Welters'  willing cooperation, Leonard Leo, Harlan Crow, and Robin Arkley--more  of these fawning billionaires--have produced no substantive response  and have otherwise stalled the Judiciary Committee's investigation.   Instead, their responses offer a host of baseless arguments that  ignore the committee's constitutional authority to inform its  legislative efforts. Their defensive and dismissive response make you  wonder, What are they trying to hide?   I am not going to stand idly by as these fawning billionaires, with  interests before the Court, use their immense wealth to buy private  access to the Justices and then deny the Senate Judiciary Committee  information to which we are lawfully entitled. That is why the  committee will vote to authorize subpoenas to these individuals.   This has been a long battle for many of us, and my colleague Senator  Whitehouse has shown extraordinary leadership on this issue as well.   Eleven years ago, it came to my attention that the Supreme Court just  didn't have a code of conduct. How can we justify this? Nine Justices  on the highest Court in the land, no code of conduct. What about the  other Federal judges? They are bound by a code of conduct. If the  Justices on the Supreme Court merely assumed the same code of conduct,  with some modifications, we would at least say they are making a step  in the right direction, but they ignored it, and they resisted it. In  fact, Justice Alito and Justice Thomas have been belligerent when they  have been confronted with these issues; that it is no one's business  but their own as to what they do with their private lives.   Unfortunately, when you accept a post in public service, that is not  the case. Our private lives become part of that public service. And  certainly, if there is any suggestion of a conflict in a situation  where individuals--billionaires--who have an interest before the Court  are buying access and time with these Justices, that is certainly  relevant to our work in the Senate Judiciary Committee.   Mr. President, as a member of the committee, you understand we have  gone through this process very deliberately and patiently and slowly  and reached a point where we believe subpoenaing this information is  the only way to get the facts before the American people.   I am hoping that this is successful; I hope that it becomes  bipartisan; and I hope that we bring to this Court the type of  reputation which it has enjoyed over the years.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, today, the Senate will vote to confirm  Judge Matthew James Maddox to the U.S. District Court for the District  of Maryland.   A native Marylander, Judge Maddox received his B.A. from Morgan State  University and his J.D. from Yale Law School before clerking for Judge  Gerald Bruce Lee on the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of  Virginia. Following his clerkship, Judge Maddox worked as an associate  at Holland & Knight LLP, where he primarily represented business  clients in civil litigation, regulatory compliance, and risk management  matters. He then completed a second clerkship with Judge Andre Davis on  the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. Judge Maddox spent  the bulk of his legal career working in public service as an assistant  U.S. attorney in the District of Maryland. Last year, he was appointed  by the judges of the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland  to serve as a magistrate judge. The American Bar Association  unanimously rated Judge Maddox as ``well qualified,'' and his  nomination is strongly supported by his home state Senators, Mr. Cardin  and Mr. Van Hollen.   With significant experience in both criminal and civil matters and a  proven dedication to equal justice under law, Judge Maddox will serve  the District of Maryland with distinction.   I am proud to support his nomination.    I announce that the Senator from Georgia (Mr. Ossoff) is  necessarily absent.    Mr. President, interesting in our democracy: two  different political parties and two different attitudes toward  registration and voting.   Many of us on this side of the aisle believe that expanding the  number of voters makes the democracy stronger. So does President Biden.  His Executive order was a message to the Agencies: Help where you can  to help with voter registration and to make sure that voting is  accessible to Americans across the board.   Example: They decided that VA health facilities would be registration  sites for disabled veterans. Does that sound like some radical idea? It  sounds to me like common sense.   That is the kind of thing we should support, and I urge my colleagues  to vote against this amendment.                          Vote on Amendment No. 1243     I announce that the Senator from Virginia (Mr. Warner) is  necessarily absent.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  privileges of the floor be granted to the following interns of Senator  Kelly for today: Alison Bonn, Emmeline Farwell, Alexandra Parker, and  Jesus Rendon-Silva.
