 Mr. Speaker, tonight, President Biden will give his  address on the state of our Union. His version of the facts will sound  wonderful but stand in stark contrast to the true state of the Union  for many Americans today.   Unmentioned in his speech will be the fact that over a third of  American households have forgone basic expenses to afford their energy  bill, the highest energy costs in 15 years.   President Biden will say the state of our Union is strong, but the  American people know better. That is why Republicans in the House are  following our Commitment to America, a series of commonsense solutions  to our most pressing issues.   In just a few short weeks, House Republicans have used our new  majority position to hold China accountable, defund the Biden IRS army,  protect our Strategic Petroleum Reserve, and bring accountability to  overreaching Federal Government agencies.   When it comes to a union that is truly strong, House Republicans  stand ready to deliver.                            ____________________
