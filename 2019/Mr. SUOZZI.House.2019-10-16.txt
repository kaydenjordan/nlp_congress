 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the life and  legacy of Lieutenant Detective Giuseppe ``Joe'' Petrosino, who, 110  years ago, was assassinated in Sicily while investigating organized  crime. He was the first NYPD officer killed overseas in the line of  duty.   Born in Padula, Italy, in 1860, Petrosino arrived in America as a  teenager. In 1883, he joined the NYPD and became the first Italian- language speaker in the department's history. Lieutenant Petrosino was  a passionate crusader against organized crime, and he eventually rose  to lead the Italian Squad, an elite group of officers tasked with  taking down organized crime groups in the city.   While on a special mission to infiltrate the Italian Mafia in Sicily,  Lieutenant Petrosino was assassinated. His memory still lives on.  Today, the Lieutenant Petrosino associates in New York, Padula, and  Sicily continue to preserve his values and dedication to the NYPD.   We welcome the delegates of the Lt. Det. Joseph Petrosino Association  in America to the Capitol and thank them for all they do to sustain his  memory of this New York City police detective and great American.   Fighting crime requires the sacrifice of an untold number of men and  women in blue. We thank them and their families for putting themselves  in harm's way on our behalf.                            ____________________
