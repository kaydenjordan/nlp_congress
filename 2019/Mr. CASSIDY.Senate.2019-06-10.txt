 Mr. President, I rise today in celebration of  First Lieutenant John Stillmon Willis, Jr.'s 100th birthday and to  speak on his extraordinary life and accomplishments. Mr. Willis has  served his Nation honorably, and put his life on the line for the  values that we hold dear as Americans. For this, we are forever  grateful.   Mr. Willis was born on June 2, 1919, and was raised in Doyline, LA.  He attended Louisiana State University from 1937-1940 and graduated  with a degree in agronomy. Shortly after the bombing of Pearl Harbor,  Mr. Willis, a member in the army infantry reserve as a lieutenant in  the U.S. Army, volunteered for pilot training. He was then transferred  to the Army Air Corps, in grade, as a second lieutenant, and assigned  to the 452nd Bomb group in Deopham Green Airbase in Atleborough in  Norfolk, England. While there, he piloted a B-17 Flying Fortress and  hit strategic targets in Germany and supported ground forces across  Europe after the D-Day invasion. He would later be promoted to first  lieutenant. After the fighting stopped, Mr. Willis credited the  survival of his crew and himself to the fact that the ``good Lord has  his arms around them.''   After the war, he worked in his father's lumber business for 20  years. Mr. Willis would go on to marry Lillian Mae Life and have one  daughter, Martha Lou Willis, who gave them 3 grandchildren. The  Willises enjoyed a beautiful 54 year marriage. Mr. Willis worked for  another 20 years at his father-in-law's business, Webb Hardware, in  Minden, LA. Mr. Willis recently celebrated his 100th birthday at St.  John's Episcopal Church in Minden, where he has been a lifelong member.   It is because of his long list of accomplishments and beautiful life  that we celebrate First Lieutenant John Stillmon Willis Jr.'s 100th  birthday. We honor and thank him for a lifetime of service to our State  and country and wish him the happiest of birthdays.                            ____________________
