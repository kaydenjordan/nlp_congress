 Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the chairman for  yielding, and I want to thank my colleague, Ms. Underwood, for her work  on this very important issue.   For nearly a year now, we have watched with growing horror and  outrage as the cruel and inhumane combination of xenophobia, malicious  policy from the White House, and indifference to people in need has  built into a crisis at our southern border.   We have let this come to a point where children have died, children  fleeing violence and persecution and horrors in their home countries  seeking to come here, the land of opportunity and promise, children we  separated from their parents and loved ones, children that we failed  entirely here on our soil and in our custody.   We cannot allow that to continue, and this measure that we are taking  up today will take important steps to address gaps in medical screening  at the border so that we don't fail any more children. It pushes us to  find new ways to handle the unique needs of health screening at the  border, with special emphasis on children and vulnerable groups.  [[Page H8037]]    Just as importantly, it mandates implementation of an e-record system  so that we are not letting anyone slip through the cracks.   An e-record system is not something we have never heard of before.  What has happened at the border thus far, including the tragic deaths  of the children, those mentioned by my colleague like Jakelin Caal  Maquin and Felipe Gomez Alonzo, is proof that we are not doing enough,  and that is not because we can't.   I am grateful to Ms. Underwood for stepping up to ensure we do more,  and I urge all of my colleagues to support this important bill and its  passage.
