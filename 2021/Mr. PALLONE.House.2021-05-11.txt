 Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 433) to establish a grant program for family community  organizations that provide support for individuals struggling with  substance use disorder and their families.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 433         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Family Support Services for       Addiction Act of 2021''.       SEC. 2. FAMILY SUPPORT SERVICES FOR INDIVIDUALS STRUGGLING                     WITH SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER.         Part D of title V of the Public Health Service Act (42       U.S.C. 290dd et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the       following:       ``SEC. 553.

Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 433.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I rise today in support of H.R. 433, the Family Support Services for  Addiction Act of 2021.   Addiction and substance use disorder are complex, yet diagnosable,  treatable diseases. Families can play a significant role in helping an  individual find treatment. Yet, there isn't a one-size-fits-all  approach to making sure that loved ones receive the care they need and  deserve. This, of course, can be a challenge to more than just the  individual; it is a challenge to families as well.   Madam Speaker, families across the United States are doing all they  can to seek care for those they love. In fact, data from the Substance  Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration reminds us that nearly  20 million Americans live with a substance use disorder. Unfortunately,  only a fraction of those Americans receives treatment.   H.R. 433, the Family Support Services for Addiction Act, builds upon  congressional efforts, such as the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery  Act, the 21st Century Cures Act, and the SUPPORT for Patients and  Communities Act, to help close the treatment gap and get Americans on  the road to recovery.   Part of paving a smooth road to recovery is providing evidence-based  guidance for families and connecting them with other community support  systems, which can dramatically influence an individual's trajectory.  That is exactly what this bill sets out to do.   The bill would authorize the Secretary of Health and Human Services  to award grants to family community organizations that would work to  develop, expand, and enhance evidence-based family support services.  These family community organizations would be able to use these grants  to reduce stigma around substance use disorder and build connections  between families and providers, and foster care services and other peer  support services.   I commend the lead sponsors of this legislation, Representatives  Trone and Meuser, and their staff, for advocating for additional  support for families.   I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. I hope the Senate  will act on it swiftly.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to  the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Trone), the author of this bill.    Madam Speaker, I have no further speakers, I am prepared  to close, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time for  the purpose of closing.   Madam Speaker, I am sure we will notice as we go through the  suspension calendar today that we have a number of bills that deal with  addiction and behavioral health issues. This is Mental Health Month  that we are observing today, and this is one of the bills that is a  very important part of this group.   Madam Speaker, I urge support on a bipartisan basis, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 1475) to address mental health issues for youth,  particularly youth of color, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1475         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

SEC. 203. TECHNICAL CORRECTION.         Title V of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 290aa       et seq.) is amended--        (1) by redesignating the second section 550 (42 U.S.C.       290ee-10) (relating to Sobriety Treatment And Recovery Teams)       as section 553; and        (2) by moving such section, as so redesignated, so as to       appear after section 552 (42 U.S.C. 290ee-7).     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in  [[Page H2163]]  which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous  material on H.R. 1475.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1475, the Pursuing  Equity in Mental Health Act.   We have long known that people of color experience inequities in  healthcare in the United States. While we have made progress to close  these gaps in recent years, including with the passage of the  Affordable Care Act, people of color in America continue to experience  inequities in care and worse health outcomes compared to White  Americans.   These long-term trends are rooted in several social determinants that  are often driven by structural discrimination and institutionalized  racism, which has created systemic health inequity. The tragic result  of these long-term trends is that people of color are more likely to  suffer from underlying health conditions; have a much harder time  getting access to care; and when they do, they are far more likely to  experience bias, discrimination, and poor health outcomes.   The Congressional Black Caucus' Emergency Task Force on Black Youth  Suicide and Mental Health reiterated these points in a report last  Congress that raised concern about the increasing rates of suicide and  mental health trends among Black children.   The bill before us today, H.R. 1475, is aimed specifically at  addressing equity in mental health. It is a comprehensive approach to  address increasing suicide rates and mental health disorders amongst  Black youth. The bill would invest resources into better understanding  racial and ethnic minority mental health disparities, improve outreach  and support for racial and ethnic minorities, and expand provider  support for students of color entering the mental health workforce.   Madam Speaker, I am hopeful that this bill will help reduce the  inequities in mental health.   Before I conclude, I would like to thank my colleague, Representative  Bonnie Watson Coleman, and her staff for leading this important  legislation. She, of course, is in the district immediately next to me  and a longtime supporter of these causes. So this is a bill that is  significant, and I do want to thank the Congresswoman for being the  sponsor.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the bill, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, first, let me say that Congresswoman  Bonnie Watson Coleman has, for years both here and in the State  legislature and beyond, gone after issues that many of us have  neglected or been unwilling to address. Maybe because they are  controversial or whatever. She is always out there looking to help  those people who are distressed or don't have someone to look out for  them.   Madam Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to the  gentlewoman from New Jersey (Mrs. Watson Coleman).    Madam Speaker, I, too, urge my colleagues to support  this very important bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 586) to amend the Public Health Service Act to provide best  practices on student suicide awareness and prevention training and  condition State educational agencies, local educational agencies, and  tribal educational agencies receiving funds under section 520A of such  Act to establish and implement a school-based student suicide awareness  and prevention training policy.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 586         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,  [[Page H2164]]            SECTION 1.

SEC. 3. EFFECTIVE DATE.         The amendments made by this Act shall only apply with       respect to applications for assistance under section 520A of       the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 290bb-32) that are       submitted after the date of enactment of this Act.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 586.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I rise in support of H.R. 586, the Suicide Training and Awareness  Nationally Delivered for Universal Prevention Act of 2021, or the  STANDUP Act.   For the last decade, suicide has been the second leading cause of  death in the United States for young Americans between the ages of 10  and 24. Since 2007, the number of suicides for this group has nearly  tripled.   We are witnessing notable disparities within this youth suicide  crisis as well. Data tells us that young Black Americans, ages 5 to 12  years old, are twice as likely to die by suicide as compared to their  White peers. Suicide rates for American Indian and Alaska Native  teenagers between the ages of 15 and 19 are 60 percent higher than the  national average for all teenagers. Additionally, among the more than  77,000 youth reporting suicidal ideations, over one-third of them are  identified as LGBTQ.   This data makes clear that more must be done to help those  struggling. We can and must act now to help equip students and the  community around them to identify risk factors, because oftentimes, it  is the students who are the true eyes and ears of each campus. We can  help provide them with effective tools so they can play an active role  in preventing suicide or self-harm.   H.R. 586 would encourage schools to expand evidence-based suicide  awareness and prevention training to students. It would also require  this training as a condition of receiving funds under the Substance  Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration's Project AWARE grant  program.   The STANDUP Act, Madam Speaker, would also support technical  assistance resources for schools and encourage the collection and  reporting of data to track implementation of these policies and  practices.   Research shows that training students on suicide prevention makes an  impact on student suicide rates and improves a student's willingness to  seek help or help a peer. Much of this training is already taking place  across thousands of schools nationwide, but STANDUP will help ensure  that this good work is expanded to more schools across the country.   For these reasons, I stand up in support of the STANDUP Act. I thank  the lead sponsors, Representatives Peters and Bilirakis, and the many  bipartisan supporters of this legislation for their work on this  critical issue.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill. I hope the  Senate will act swiftly to pass it after we have taken action. I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I have no additional speakers at this  time.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I urge support on a bipartisan basis for  this bill. I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 721) to amend the Public Health Service Act to revise and  extend projects relating to children and to provide access to school- based comprehensive mental health programs, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 721         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Mental Health Services for       Students Act of 2021''.       SEC. 2. AMENDMENTS TO THE PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE ACT.

Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 721.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I rise today in support of H.R. 721, the Mental Health Services for  Students Act of 2021.   Mental illness, Madam Speaker, affects millions of Americans. With  youth in particular, research shows that half of all lifetime mental  illness begins by the age of 14. According to the Centers for Disease  Control and Prevention, about three in four children between the ages  of 3 and 17 suffer from depression and anxiety, and nearly half have  behavioral problems. In fact, data from Mental Health America shows  that youth between the ages of 11 and 17 are now at higher risk of  moderate to severe anxiety and depression.   For many students, schools are a critical place to get mental health  or behavioral health support, and now with added public health  concerns, economic pressures, online learning, and the social isolation  that comes with these things, experts worry about the added  repercussions we will see on the well-being of students across the  country.   This data, and the effect of the pandemic, make clear that we must do  more to invest in preventative mental and behavioral health services  and training in schools to give our kids and teens a brighter future.  The American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on School Health  recognized the increasing mental health needs of children and  adolescents when it said, ``School-based mental health services offer  the potential for prevention efforts as well as intervention  strategies.''   Madam Speaker, H.R. 721 does just that. This bill would support  comprehensive mental health programs at schools across the Nation by  encouraging partnerships between State and local educational agencies  and mental health providers. Funding would be made available through  the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. This  funding would support prevention screening, treatment, and development  of evidence-based programs for social, emotional, mental, and  behavioral issues among students. H.R. 721 would also help us better  understand the student, family, and educational outcomes of services  provided to the students.   I want to thank the lead sponsors of this bill, Representatives  Napolitano and Katko, for their leadership and tireless work.   Madam Speaker, it is critical that we support preventative mental and  behavioral health services and training in schools for our kids and  teens, particularly at a time when mental health risks are exacerbated  by the COVID-19 pandemic.   I urge my colleagues to support this bill. I reserve the balance of  my time.    Madam Speaker, I have no additional speakers at this  time. I reserve the balance of my time.  [[Page H2167]]         Madam Speaker, as my colleague from Kentucky points out,  with these bills today, we are trying to reach out and deal with these  mental and behavioral health problems in various settings. In this  case, it is the school-based setting, which I think is one of the most  effective.   So for that reason, I would ask my colleagues to support this  legislation. I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 2877) to amend the Public Health Service Act to direct the  Secretary of Health and Human Services to develop best practices for  the establishment and use of behavioral intervention teams at schools,  and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2877         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I rise today in support of H.R. 2877, the Behavioral Intervention  Guidelines Act.   Madam Speaker, behavioral intervention teams are multidisciplinary  teams that support students' mental health and emotional well-being by  detecting patterns, trends, and disturbances in behavior, and by  conducting outreach to students who are unable to manage distress in  healthy and constructive ways. These teams are already active in some  educational settings, such as Wichita State University, Southern  Connecticut State University, and Rochester Institute of Technology.   This bill requires the Substance Abuse and Mental Health  Administration to develop best practices for schools that have or want  to have behavioral intervention teams. These best practices would cover  the proper use of these teams and how to intervene and avoid  inappropriate use of mental health assessments and law enforcement.  These best practices would then be required to be posted publicly on  the Department of Health and Human Services website. HHS would also  help to provide technical assistance to entities implementing these  best practices.   We know that three in four children between the ages of 3 and 17 with  depression also have anxiety. Anxiety and depression are the top two  mental health concerns among college students as well. Unfortunately,  recent  [[Page H2168]]  data found that over 80 percent of young people with mental health  needs did not receive the care that they needed.   Young people in crisis should be able to access the care they need or  be able to find support from peers who can direct them toward  appropriate services. This bill helps bridge that gap.   The champions of this legislation, Representatives Ferguson, Peters,  Burgess, and Panetta, worked together to help provide these behavioral  health prevention tools to schools and colleges around the country, and  I applaud them for their bipartisan effort.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I urge support for this bill. This is  just another tool to help provide behavioral services--in this case, to  schools and colleges around the country. I think it deserves our  support.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 1260) to amend the Public Health Service Act to establish a  grant program supporting trauma center violence intervention and  violence prevention programs, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1260         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Bipartisan Solution to       Cyclical Violence Act of 2021''.       SEC. 2. GRANT PROGRAM SUPPORTING TRAUMA CENTER VIOLENCE                     INTERVENTION AND VIOLENCE PREVENTION PROGRAMS.         Part P of title III of the Public Health Service Act (42       U.S.C. 280g et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the       following new section:       ``SEC. 399V-7.

Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 1260.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Trauma is a pressing public health epidemic. In 2016 alone, trauma  accounted for more than 29 million emergency department visits and 39  million physician office visits in the United States.   Tragically, homicide is the leading cause of death for Black males  between the ages of 1 and 24 and the second leading cause of death in  Hispanic males in the same age group. Regardless of race, of the people  who survive a single violent trauma, it is estimated that up to 45  percent will experience a second violent trauma.   This is where H.R. 1260 steps in to provide critical data-driven  interventions. The Bipartisan Solution of Cyclical Violence Act directs  the Department of Health and Human Services to establish a grant  program for specified trauma centers and nonprofits to establish or  expand intervention or prevention programs related to intentional  violent trauma.   These programs, Madam Speaker, help identify patients at risk of  repeat violent injury and connects them with hospital and community- based resources. The bill bridges tragedy with hospital-based violence  intervention programs by providing intensive case management to people  who have experienced at least one violent trauma. These programs have  been shown to successfully reduce injury recidivism and help those at  risk for violence live safer lives.   I commend my colleagues, Representatives Ruppersberger and Kinzinger,  for spearheading this initiative.   Again, I urge my colleagues to support this important bipartisan  bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I also urge my colleagues to support this  bill. Again, this one, dealing with intervention for violent traumas,  is part of this package today.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 1205) to authorize the Secretary of Health and Human  Services, acting through the Director of the Center for Mental Health  Services of the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services  Administration, to award grants to implement innovative approaches to  securing prompt access to appropriate follow-on care for individuals  who experience an acute mental health episode and present for care in  an emergency department, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1205         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

SECURING APPROPRIATE FOLLOW-ON CARE FOR ACUTE MENTAL                     HEALTH ILLNESS AFTER AN EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT                     ENCOUNTER.         The Public Health Service Act is amended by inserting after       section 520J of such Act (42 U.S.C. 290bb-31) the following       new section:  [[Page H2170]]            ``SEC. 520J-1. SECURING APPROPRIATE FOLLOW-ON CARE FOR ACUTE                     MENTAL HEALTH ILLNESS AFTER AN EMERGENCY                     DEPARTMENT ENCOUNTER.         ``(a) In General.--The Secretary may award grants on a       competitive basis to qualifying health providers to implement       innovative approaches to securing prompt access to       appropriate follow-on care for individuals who experience an       acute mental health episode and present for care in an       emergency department.        ``(b) Eligible Grant Recipients.--In this section, the term       `qualifying health provider' means a health care facility       licensed under applicable law that--        ``(1) has an emergency department;        ``(2) is staffed by medical personnel (such as emergency       physicians, psychiatrists, psychiatric registered nurses,       mental health technicians, clinical social workers,       psychologists, and therapists) capable of providing treatment       focused on stabilizing acute mental health conditions and       assisting patients to access resources to continue treatment       in the least restrictive appropriate setting; and        ``(3) has arrangements in place with other providers of       care that can provide a full range of medically appropriate,       evidence-based services for the treatment of acute mental       health episodes.        ``(c) Use of Funds.--A qualifying health provider receiving       funds under this section shall use such funds to create,       support, or expand programs or projects intended to assist       individuals who are treated at the provider's emergency       department for acute mental health episodes and to       expeditiously transition such individuals to an appropriate       facility or setting for follow-on care. Such use of funds may       support the following:        ``(1) Expediting placement in appropriate facilities       through activities such as expanded coordination with       regional service providers, assessment, peer navigators, bed       availability tracking and management, transfer protocol       development, networking infrastructure development, and       transportation services.        ``(2) Increasing the supply of inpatient psychiatric beds       and alternative care settings such as regional emergency       psychiatric facilities.        ``(3) Use of alternative approaches to providing       psychiatric care in the emergency department setting,       including through tele-psychiatric support and other remote       psychiatric consultation, implementation of peak period       crisis clinics, or creation of psychiatric emergency service       units.        ``(4) Use of approaches that include proactive followup       such as telephone check-ins, telemedicine, or other       technology-based outreach to individuals during the period of       transition.        ``(5) Such other activities as are determined by the       Secretary to be appropriate, consistent with subsection (a).        ``(d) Application.--A qualifying health provider desiring a       grant under this section shall prepare and submit an       application to the Secretary at such time and in such manner       as the Secretary may require.

Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 1205.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1205, the Improving  Mental Health Access from the Emergency Department Act.   I would like to begin by recognizing a member of our committee,  Representative Ruiz, and his staff for their work on this important  legislation. As an emergency room physician himself, Dr. Ruiz knows  firsthand the needs of both the medical professional and patients in  the ER.   Among those increasing needs is support for mental health services.  Research has shown that one in every eight emergency department visits  in the U.S. is related to a mental health issue. And since 2009, mental  health emergency room visits have substantially increased, most of  which is driven by adolescents and young adults. This is especially  concerning given the recent report from the Government Accountability  Office that found emergency department visits for suicide attempts from  mid-March to mid-October 2020 were up 26 percent from 2019.   Now, this bill would help to provide increased access to care for  people who report to an emergency department for acute mental health  episodes. Under the bill, the Secretary of Health and Human Services is  authorized to award grants to support innovative approaches for  providing follow-on care for individuals treated in the emergency  department for acute mental health issues. This includes increasing the  number of inpatient psychiatric beds and alternative care settings,  supporting a patient's transition to appropriate mental health  services, or the use of tele-psychiatric support or other remote  psychiatric consultation methods.   Madam Speaker, emergency departments can sometimes feel like a  stressful place, especially for people in crisis. However, they are  often the last remaining safety net in many communities. We know that  follow-up care for people with mental illnesses is linked to fewer  repeat emergency room visits and improved mental and physical health.  So let's do our part to support the emergency room staff and patients  in need by passing this bill today.   Madam Speaker, again, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 1205, and  I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, again, we are trying with these series of  bills today to address mental and behavioral health problems, and this  one deals with the emergency room. So that is very important, and I  would urge my colleagues to support it on a bipartisan basis.  [[Page H2171]]    Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 1324) to amend the Public Health Service Act to establish a  program to improve the identification, assessment, and treatment of  patients in hospital emergency departments who are at risk of suicide,  and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1324         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H.R. 1324.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1324, the Effective  Suicide Screening and Assessment in the Emergency Department Act.   The COVID-19 pandemic has caused tremendous suffering in our country  over the past year and has negatively impacted the mental health of so  many Americans. In fact, rates of mental health disorders, like  depression and anxiety, that may lead to suicide have gone up almost  fourfold.   According to the National Centers for Health Statistics, over 44,000  people died from suicide last year. However, these numbers may not  fully reflect the deaths that occurred secondary to despair from the  pandemic. Suicide is the second leading cause of death for people  between the ages of 10 and 34, impacting children and people in the  prime of their lives.  [[Page H2172]]    We also saw this during the pandemic with a spike in suicide deaths  for first responders. For example, who can forget the story of Dr.  Lorna Breen, an emergency room physician in New York, who dedicated  herself to fighting the pandemic, but then tragically died from suicide  after experiencing extreme burnout?   To counter these unnecessary deaths, we need to provide more  resources to our providers on the front lines of emergency departments  across the country. It is particularly important that we focus on those  with limited resources, including Critical Access Hospitals, facilities  serving Native Americans, and emergency departments in communities with  high rates of suicide.   Resources for healthcare providers in the emergency department are  important since they are often in the position of providing for  patients at the highest risk for suicide with approximately 10 percent  of emergency department patients presenting for treatment of suicidal  ideations. Unfortunately, almost 40 percent of patients visiting an  emergency department following a suicide attempt will go on to  reattempt suicide within a year.   Madam Speaker, this bill will assist emergency departments by  providing better training to emergency healthcare providers,  establishing policies to improve identification and treatment of  individuals at risk for suicide, employing additional behavioral health  professionals, and improving access to care for patients.   I thank Representatives Bilirakis and Soto and their staff for their  tireless effort on this bill. Again, bipartisan.   Madam Speaker, suicide deaths are a preventable tragedy that  negatively impact families and loved ones and rob us of young people in  the prime of their lives. So whatever we can do to prevent this is  going to be so important.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 1324, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I also urge support for this bill. Again,  this is dealing with trying to alert potential problems or potential  for suicide in the emergency department, a very important part of this  package.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 1480) to require the Secretary of Health and Human Services  to improve the detection, prevention, and treatment of mental health  issues among public safety officers, and for other purposes, as  amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1480         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H.R. 1480.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the Helping Emergency  Responders Overcome Act, or the HERO Act.   As we have learned over the past year, not all heroes wear capes.  There are heroes in our communities working to save the lives of  countless Americans, including our emergency responders, firefighters,  healthcare workers, and hospital personnel, who, to this day, continue  to battle COVID-19.   Unfortunately, despite their heroic efforts, evidence suggests that  suicide, depression, and substance abuse disorder are significant  issues facing public safety personnel and medical providers. Those on  the front lines of the COVID-19 pandemic have witnessed previously  unimaginable conditions that are traumatizing for even the most  resilient public safety and medical personnel.   Madam Speaker, prior to COVID-19, it was estimated that 30 percent of  first responders develop behavioral health conditions, including, but  not limited to, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder, as  compared with 20 percent of the general population. Tragically, a 2018  study found that public safety officers were more likely to die by  suicide than professionals in other lines of duty.   So this bill will help inform and support prevention and treatment  strategies for addressing behavioral and mental health issues among  public safety officers. The legislation would require the development  of a data system to capture the incidence of suicides among this  population, while also facilitating the study of successful  interventions to reduce suicide among these frontline health workers.   The bill also includes efforts to enhance behavioral health and  wellness programs for healthcare providers, such as providing financial  assistance to entities that establish behavioral health programs  targeted to these populations. By utilizing the new data system,  improved research, and programmatic findings, the Department of Health  and Human Services will develop best practices and resources for  addressing PTSD in these frontline workers.   I want to commend Representative Bera, I know he spoke before during  the 1 minute Special Orders on this bill, and also Congressman  Fitzpatrick, for putting forward this bipartisan legislation.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to help those heroes by  supporting the HERO Act today, and I reserve the balance of my time.           House of Representatives, Committee on Science, Space,             and Technology,                                       Washington, DC, May 4, 2021.      Hon. Frank Pallone, Jr.,      Chairman, Committee on Energy and Commerce, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Pallone: I am writing you concerning H.R.       1480, the ``Helping Emergency Responders Overcome Act of       2019,'' which was referred to the Committee on Energy and       Commerce and then to the Committee on Science, Space, and       Technology (``Science Committee'') on March 2, 2021.        As a result of our consultation, I agree to work       cooperatively on H.R. 1480 and in order to expedite       consideration of the bill the Science Committee will waive       formal consideration of this legislation. However, this is       not a waiver of any future jurisdictional claims by the       Science Committee over the subject matter contained in H.R.       1480 or similar legislation. I ask for your support of my       request to name members of the Science Committee to any       House-Senate conference that may consider this bill.        Additionally, thank you for your assurances to include a       copy of our exchange of letters on this matter in the       Congressional Record during floor consideration thereof.            Sincerely,                                             Eddie Bernice Johnson,      Chairwoman.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                Committee on Energy and Commerce,                                        Washington, DC, May 7, 2021.      Hon. Eddie Bernice Johnson,      Chairwoman, Committee on Science, Space, and Technology,           Washington, DC.        Dear Chairwoman Johnson: Thank you for consulting with the       Committee on Energy and Commerce and agreeing to discharge       H.R. 1480, the ``Helping Emergency Responders Overcome Act'',       from further consideration, so that the bill may proceed       expeditiously to the House floor.        I agree that your forgoing further action on this measure       does not in any way diminish or alter the jurisdiction of       your committee or prejudice its jurisdictional prerogatives       on this measure or similar legislation in the future. I would       support your effort to seek appointment of an appropriate       number of conferees from your committee to any House-Senate       conference on this legislation.        I will ensure our letters on H.R. 1480 are entered into the       Congressional Record during floor consideration of the bill.       I appreciate your cooperation regarding this legislation and       look forward to continuing to work together as this measure       moves through the legislative process.            Sincerely,                                                Frank Pallone, Jr.,                                                          Chairman.     Madam Speaker, this one, of course, deals with trying to  address behavioral mental health amongst public safety officers, and  that is obviously a very important part of this package.   Madam Speaker, I would urge unanimous support for the bill, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 2862) to require the Secretary of Health and Human Services  to conduct a national suicide prevention media campaign, and for other  purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2862         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H.R. 2862.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2862, the Campaign to  Prevent Suicide Act.   Suicide, Madam Speaker, continues to be one of the leading causes of  death in the United States. Last year alone, we lost more than 44,000  people to suicide deaths, placing a heavy toll on the families and  friends of victims, as well as on our communities.   To help prevent suicides, we have created a lifeline that people can  call when they are in crisis to get the help they need. This suicide  prevention hotline has been available since 2004 through funding we  have provided to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services  Administration, and the call-in line has taken millions of calls since  its inception.   Unfortunately, the call-in line was started as a 10-digit number that  is hard to remember, and this could potentially be preventing essential  access to support for those in crisis. In 2018, the National Suicide  Hotline Improvement Act was passed with the goal of launching a new 3- digit number similar to 911 that is easy to remember during a time of  crisis.   The Federal Communications Commission is now finalizing the process  to launch this new 3-digit call-in line, 988, next year. Now we need to  ensure people are aware of the new 3-digit number through a marketing  of 988.   H.R. 2862 provides this essential next step in communicating the new  lifeline number to the public, and will also evaluate the effectiveness  of the marketing to better understand how best to reach communities in  need.   Madam Speaker, suicide deaths are a preventible tragedy, and this  call-in line has the potential to help people in crisis and to save  lives, but we need to educate people about this important resource.   Madam Speaker, I want to commend the lead sponsors of this  legislation, Representatives Beyer and Kinzinger, and their staff, for  their tireless work on this bill.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the bill, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, as my colleague from Kentucky explained,  this is a very important piece of legislation to make people aware of  this 988 number to prevent suicide.   Madam Speaker, I would urge my colleagues on a bipartisan basis to  support this bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 2981) to amend the Public Health Service Act to ensure the  provision of high-quality service through the Suicide Prevention  Lifeline, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2981         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

(c) Recommendations.--The report required by subsection (a)       shall include recommendations for improving the Suicide       Prevention Lifeline, including recommendations for       legislative and administrative actions.       SEC. 6. DEFINITION.         In this Act, the term ``Suicide Prevention Lifeline'' means       the suicide prevention hotline maintained pursuant to section       520E-3 of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 290bb-      36c).     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H.R. 2981.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2981, the Suicide  Prevention Lifeline Improvement Act.   We have spoken a lot about suicide prevention today and recognize  that this is an issue we have to address to save the lives of Americans  who are in the prime of their life. And we have tens of thousands of  people dying every year from suicide, and millions of people struggling  with mental health issues, many of which have been exacerbated by the  COVID-19 pandemic.   Fortunately, the Federal Government provides dedicated funding for a  lifeline that people can call when they are in crisis, and we have  recently made major investments in improving this lifeline by changing  it to a 3-digit number, 988. That change is in the works now, Madam  Speaker.                                time  1545    This bill will increase support for the National Suicide Prevention  Lifeline to ensure that those who make the call are able to get high  quality crisis service. The lifeline's network has now over 170 local  call centers that answer millions of calls every year. However, we need  to provide additional funding so this lifeline can respond to  increasing demands. The legislation will also enhance coordination of  services as well as data sharing while extending the capacity for local  communities to provide services.   This bill, Madam Speaker, will ensure that the lifeline has the  sufficient level of resources needed to provide high quality services  for people who are reaching out for help.   Again, I want to commend the lead sponsors of this bill,  Representatives Katko, Beyer, and Napolitano, and their staff for their  tireless work on this bill.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 2981, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I have no additional speakers, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    In closing, Madam Speaker, this, again, is a bill to try  to improve the lifeline and the use of the new 988 number. I urge its  support, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 2955) to authorize a pilot program to expand and intensify  surveillance of self-harm in partnership with State and local public  health departments, to establish a grant program to provide self-harm  and suicide prevention services in hospital emergency departments, and  for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2955         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 2955.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2955, the Suicide  Prevention Act. This is among several bills being considered today that  is specifically aimed at suicide prevention. The reason for these  legislative efforts is that suicide is a devastating and preventable  tragedy that strikes far too many Americans; and there is legitimate  reason for us to be concerned that this preventable cause of death may  become worse as we fully uncover the impact of the pandemic on American  lives. We know that more people than ever are suffering from mental  health issues, and suicide is unfortunately a devastating consequence  of untreated mental illness.   So we have to act now to better understand the risk factors for  suicide and self-harm, train providers on how to better manage  patients, and improve our ability to detect suicide deaths and self- harm in our communities. This bill does each of these things.   The Suicide Prevention Act, introduced by Representatives Stewart and  Matsui, will enhance collection and sharing of important data while  also providing funding for programs that train and equip emergency  department personnel in how to prevent suicide.   The bill also enables surveillance of self-harm to inform better  health strategies aimed at prevention, Madam Speaker. It also supports  emergency departments to better screen and treat high-risk patients,  and it also calls for development and deployment of best practices in  suicide prevention for all healthcare providers.   So, in closing, we know that suicide is one of the leading causes of  preventible death in the United States--particularly for young people-- and we have to act. I commend the work of the sponsors of this bill,  Representatives Stewart and Matsui, in creating this important bill. I  look forward to passing the bill today, and I hope that the Senate will  act on it swiftly.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the bill, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    In closing, Madam Speaker, again, this bill is part of  our strategy in prevention. I urge my colleagues to support it on a  bipartisan basis, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 768) to amend the Controlled Substances Act to clarify the  process for registrants to exercise due diligence upon discovering a  suspicious order, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 768         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Block, Report, And Suspend       Suspicious Shipments Act of 2021''.       SEC. 2. CLARIFICATION OF PROCESS FOR REGISTRANTS TO EXERCISE                     DUE DILIGENCE UPON DISCOVERING A SUSPICIOUS                     ORDER.         (a) In General.--Paragraph (3) of section 312(a) of the       Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 832(a)) is amended to       read as follows:        ``(3) upon discovering a suspicious order or series of       orders--        ``(A) exercise due diligence;        ``(B) establish and maintain (for not less than a period to       be determined by the Administrator of the Drug Enforcement       Administration) a record of the due diligence that was       performed;        ``(C) decline to fill the order or series of orders if the       due diligence fails to resolve all of the indicators that       gave rise to the suspicion that filling the order or series       of orders would cause a violation of this title by the       registrant or the prospective purchaser; and        ``(D) notify the Administrator of the Drug Enforcement       Administration and the Special Agent in Charge of the       Division Office of the Drug Enforcement Administration for       the area in which the registrant is located or conducts       business of--        ``(i) each suspicious order or series of orders discovered       by the registrant; and        ``(ii) the indicators giving rise to the suspicion that       filling the order or series of orders would cause a violation       of this title by the registrant or the prospective       purchaser.''.        (b) Regulations.--Not later than 1 year after the date of       enactment of this Act, for purposes of section 312(a)(3) of       the Controlled Substances Act, as amended by subsection (a),       the Attorney General of the United States shall promulgate a       final regulation specifying the indicators that give rise to       a suspicion that filling an order or series of orders would       cause a violation of the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C.       801 et seq.) by a registrant or a prospective purchaser.        (c) Applicability.--Section 312(a)(3) of the Controlled       Substances Act, as amended by subsection (a), shall apply       beginning on the day that is 1 year after the date of       enactment of this Act. Until such day, section 312(a)(3) of       the Controlled Substances Act shall apply as such section       312(a)(3) was in effect on the day before the date of       enactment of this Act.       SEC. 3. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS.         The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 768.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 768, the Block,  Report, And Suspend Suspicious Shipments Act of 2021.   Since 1999, more than 841,000 Americans have died from a drug  overdose. In the early years of this epidemic, many of these deaths  involved prescription opioids. Then in 2010 we began seeing dramatic  increases from heroin-involved deaths, and now we are seeing a third  wave, Madam Speaker, involving synthetic opioids like illicitly  manufactured fentanyl.   In those earlier years, Americans across the country became addicted  to opioids. Many of those opioids were prescribed to patients to treat  pain. However, throughout the years, we have discovered that many of  these opioids were diverted through a system meant to prevent  diversion.   The Drug Enforcement Administration requires entities that  manufacture or distribute controlled substances to register and report  their activities through ARCOS, a system meant to track the  manufacture, distribution, and dispensing of these substances. In this  system, registrants are also expected to disclose suspicious orders of  controlled substances such as orders of unusual size, orders deviating  from a normal pattern, or orders of an unusual frequency.   H.R. 768 will improve reporting and action on suspicious orders by  clarifying the responsibilities of drug manufacturers and distributors  when discovering a suspicious order. The legislation also requires that  this discovery be reported to DEA, which will help all entities to  better identify suspicious activity and root out bad actors.   This is a commonsense bill that will make clear the responsibilities  for all entities in our supply chain, and hopefully help to deter  opioid diversion and trafficking.   I commend the lead sponsors of this legislation, Representatives  Dingell and McKinley, and their staff, for their work on this bill.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the bill, and I  reserve the balance of my time.                                          House of Representatives,                                      Committee on the Judiciary,                                        Washington, DC, May 5, 2021.      Hon. Frank Pallone, Jr.,      Chairman, Committee on Energy and Commerce,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Pallone: This is to advise you that the       Committee on the Judiciary has now had an opportunity to       review the provisions in H.R. 768, the ``Block, Report, And       Suspend Suspicious Shipments Act of 2021,'' that fall within       our Rule X jurisdiction. I appreciate your consulting with us       on those provisions. The Judiciary Committee has no objection       to your including them in the bill for consideration on the       House floor, and to expedite that consideration is willing to       forgo action on H.R. 768, with the understanding that we do       not thereby waive any future jurisdictional claim over those       provisions or their subject matters.        In the event a House-Senate conference on this or similar       legislation is convened, the Judiciary Committee reserves the       right to request an appropriate number of conferees to       address any concerns with these or similar provisions that       may arise in conference.        Please place this letter into the Congressional Record       during consideration of the measure on the House floor. Thank       you for the cooperative spirit in which you have worked       regarding this matter and others between our committees.            Sincerely,                                                    Jerrold Nadler,      Chairman.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                Committee on Energy and Commerce,                                        Washington, DC, May 7, 2021.      Hon. Jerrold Nadler,      Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Nadler: Thank you for consulting with the       Committee on Energy and Commerce and agreeing to be       discharged from further consideration of H.R. 768, the       ``Block, Report, And Suspend Suspicious Shipments Act of       2021,'' so that the bill may proceed expeditiously to the       House floor.        I agree that your forgoing further action on this measure       does not in any way diminish or alter the jurisdiction of       your committee or prejudice its jurisdictional prerogatives       on this measure or similar legislation in the future. I would       support your effort to seek appointment of an appropriate       number of conferees from your committee to any House-Senate       conference on this legislation.        I will seek to place our letters on H.R. 768 into the       Congressional Record during floor consideration of the bill.       I appreciate your cooperation regarding this legislation and       look forward to continuing to work together as this measure       moves through the legislative process.            Sincerely,                                                Frank Pallone, Jr.,                                                          Chairman.     Madam Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to  the gentlewoman from Michigan (Mrs. Dingell), who is the author of this  bill and oftentimes presents to the House commonsense action plans on  important issues.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   I appreciate my colleague from Kentucky referencing the investigation  that was done that led to this bill and other legislation. Many times,  I think the public doesn't realize that our committees do a lot of  investigative work that leads to important legislation. This is  certainly an example.   Again, I thank Mrs. Dingell, in particular, because this is something  that I think will help us with the supply chain and, hopefully, deter  opioid diversion and trafficking.   Madam Speaker, I urge bipartisan support, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 1629) to amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act with  respect to limitations on exclusive approval or licensure of orphan  drugs, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1629         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

SEC. 3. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS.         The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 1629.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I rise in support of H.R. 1629, the Fairness in Orphan Drug  Exclusivity Act. The legislation will close a loophole in the orphan  drug program to ensure generic drugs can come to market and are not  unfairly blocked by their brand competitors.   This bill, which passed the House by a voice vote last Congress,  takes steps to address two crises: one, the soaring cost of  prescription drugs; and, two, the ongoing opioid crisis. It deserves  our bipartisan support once again today.   The Orphan Drug Act has been successful in driving research and  discovery of new therapies to treat and even cure rare diseases. The  law incentivizes the development of these therapies, including by  awarding 7 years of market exclusivity and two pathways for  manufacturers to receive these incentives.   Under the first pathway, orphan drug status may be awarded when  manufacturers develop drugs approved to treat diseases with patient  populations of 200,000 or fewer. Under the second pathway, through the  rarely used cost recovery pathway, they may receive orphan drug status  if drug research and development costs are not expected to be recouped  by sales of the underlying drug.   Now, under certain circumstances, a manufacturer may also get  additional rounds of exclusivity for additional drugs in their  portfolio if they treat the same condition and have the same active  ingredient, even if the second drug does not meet the orphan drug  qualifications. This provision has allowed some manufacturers to  circumvent the original intent of the Orphan Drug Act, which was to  incentivize the creation of novel drugs for small populations.   Because of this loophole, some manufacturers have been able to market  widely used drugs to large populations, all while retaining exclusivity  and blocking generic competition from coming to market.   An example of this recently occurred when a formulation of bupe, a  drug to treat opioid use disorder, was approved in 2017 and was allowed  to carry the orphan drug designation granted to its manufacturer's  original bupe drug more than 20 years earlier in 1994.   When the original 1994 orphan drug designation was granted, it was  expected that this drug would not be prescribed frequently. However, as  the opioid crisis worsened, and our response to the crisis evolved,  millions were eventually prescribed the treatment, generating billions  in sales.   Clearly, we knew in 2017 that bupe was not an orphan drug.  Nevertheless, the drug was granted orphan drug status and exclusivity,  and that delayed additional forms of generic competition.   While the FDA eventually recognized this issue with this particular  drug and revoked its orphan drug designation, its exclusivity delayed  generic competition that otherwise would have been on the market.   We need, Madam Speaker, every tool available to us to combat the  opioid epidemic, including low-cost, affordable medication treatments,  and loopholes like this one should not be allowed to limit access to  low-cost drugs.   H.R. 1629 would stop this from happening again in the future. It  requires drug manufacturers to demonstrate in their application to the  FDA that each drug application considered under the cost recovery  pathway would fail to recoup development costs. The legislation would  also ensure that these rules apply to drugs already on the market.   This bill is a narrowly tailored fix for a narrow but very real  loophole in the law. I thank Representative Dean from Pennsylvania for  introducing this bill. It passed the House on a bipartisan basis, by  voice vote, and without opposition last Congress. I look forward to it  passing with bipartisan support again today and getting it through the  Senate and to President Biden's desk so it can become law. I urge all  of my colleagues to support the bill.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to  the gentlewoman from Pennsylvania (Ms. Dean), the author of this  legislation, which is important because whenever we can encourage  generics and make drugs more affordable, it is certainly to the benefit  of the American people.                                time  1615     Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume  for the purpose of closing.   Madam Speaker, I thank Representative Guthrie for his remarks about  trying to work together to lower the cost of prescription drugs. I  thank Congresswoman Dean because this is a part of that effort.   As you will note, today, we had a whole package dealing with mental  health, behavioral health, and other drug activities. It is very  important that we move this whole package and try to get it passed in  the Senate as quickly as possible.   Madam Speaker, I urge support for this legislation on a bipartisan  basis, and I yield back the balance of my time.
