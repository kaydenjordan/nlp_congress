 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, Federal ownership of the land along the Red River dates  back to the Louisiana Purchase. Over time, gradual changes in the  course of the river have created uncertainty regarding Federal  interests in the area as well as confusion about the exact boundary  between Texas and Oklahoma. Further complicating the matter, Native  American Tribes have mineral and other interests in the area impacted  by the precise ownership of the land in question.   In fact, as noted in the Supreme Court case of Oklahoma v. Texas, a  1923 case, the decision was the boundaries were changed due to  accretion and erosion. It is important to note that the gentleman from  Texas does not dispute the criteria set forth by the Supreme Court in  Oklahoma v. Texas. Moreover, in 2000, Congress passed the Red River  Boundary Compact, which shifted the boundary line between the States,  but the location and status of lands in the public domain remain  unchanged. Along the 116-mile stretch, a portion of the land in the Red  River area is still under Federal ownership because it has never been  disposed of under the authority of Congress.   In 2013, the Bureau of Land Management set out to revise the Federal  resource management plan for Federal lands--not private lands, Federal  lands--in Oklahoma, Kansas, and Texas. As part of that process, the BLM  began to survey the lands to determine the extent of all ownership  claims. According to the 2014 testimony from the Deputy Director of the  BLM, Steve Ellis, the survey process the BLM intends ``to identify,  with certainty, and propose management alternatives for lands which  fall within the public domain but have never been patented, reserved,  or disposed.''   According to that same testimony, the BLM estimates that  approximately 30,000 acres of public land exist along the Red River  between the north fork of the river and the 98th meridian. They also  estimate that as many as 23,000 of those acres may be overlaid by  private ownership interests.    One of the most significant and advantageous parts about the process  for updating land use plans is that it includes steps along the way  that allow for public input, analysis, and informed decisionmaking.   Once the survey is complete, the BLM has a variety of statutory  authorities the agency can use to resolve conflicting claims, including  the Federal Land Policy and Management Act and the Color of Title Act.   H.R. 428, the bill before us today, has a troubled history. Flaws in  the bill have prevented it from becoming law for several years. Some of  those shortcomings have been addressed, but others remain.   H.R. 428 would halt the planning and survey process in its tracks.  The bill would strip the Bureau of Land Management of its survey  authority along the 116-mile stretch of the Red River, and it would  force the Federal Government to accept the survey completed by the  States of Texas and Oklahoma.   Prohibiting the Federal Government from surveying its own land is  unprecedented and unwarranted. What is also troubling is that, in stark  violation of Republican policy against authorizations without an  offset, this legislation authorizes the expenditure of $1 million in  Federal funding to pay the States to complete the survey.   It is important to note that allowing State governments to dictate  the outcome of this process is a terrible precedent, and forcing the  American taxpayers to pay the States for those surveys adds insult to  injury.                                time  1515    Parts of this case are currently in the Federal court of the U.S.  District Court for the Northern District of Texas. The parties include  the State of Texas, BLM, and plaintiff landowners; and they are in  mediation working to resolve these very complicated issues. The nature  of that lawsuit is a quiet title action.   I include in the Record a minute order dated Tuesday, January 10,  2017. At the bottom of the order it reads, in relevant part: ``Case did  not settle but parties are continuing to work on settlement. Court will  continue to monitor and assist mediation efforts.''

Mr. Speaker, this bill would undermine the progress of  the judicial branch and instead prohibit the Federal Government from  surveying its own land. It also would force the American taxpayers to  pay the States for these surveys. Shifting this authority, as we said  earlier, is unprecedented and would cause more confusion.   We should allow the parties to resolve this conflict, and Congress  should stay out of it.   What is troubling is that the bill is being proposed as something  that brings the parties together. This mediation is doing that.   More importantly, when you look at the bill itself, the question has  to be asked: Where is the Department of the Interior? Where is the BLM?  Let us not forget, it is the Department of the Interior that has the  fiduciary duty to the tribes.   The question really is: Can or should Congress abdicate its fiduciary  obligation that is owed to the tribes by doing this survey?   H.R. 428 does not warrant consideration by this body. We clearly have  more important issues facing this Nation. Congress should get out of  the way and allow the current BLM process to play out. This bill is a  waste of our valuable time and taxpayers' dollars.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I think it is very important for us--though they have  made light of the fact that this has a history, beginning with the  Louisiana Purchase--that this is not a new issue. There are a series of  subsequent treaties with foreign governments in 1819, 1828, and 1838,  which set the south bank of the river as the southern border of the  United States and the northern border of what is now the State of  Texas.   In 1867, when a portion of this public domain was reserved for the  Kiowa-Comanche-Apache (KCA) Reservation, the middle of the main channel  of the river between the 98th meridian and the north fork of the river  was established as the reservation's southern boundary. The remaining  land between what is now called the medial line and the southern bank  retained its status as public land, which continues through the  present.   In a series of decisions in the 1920s, the U.S. Supreme Court adopted  a method known as the gradient boundary method for determining the  location of the boundary between Texas and Oklahoma along the southern  bank of the river. In giving certainty to the boundary's location and  the extent of tribal holdings, the Court's decision also provided a  basis for clarifying private land ownership on each side of the river.    In 1981 and 1984, two separate Oklahoma landowners argued in the  United States District Court that, under riparian law, changes in the  river's location had expanded their private holdings while reducing the  acreage of the Texas landowners whose properties faced them across the  river. In both cases, the district court followed the Supreme Court's  established principle concerning the location of public and private  lands.   Private property in Oklahoma extended to the center of the river  while private property in Texas stopped at the ordinary high-water mark  on the southern bank, with the remaining land being part of the  original public domain located in Oklahoma.   In 2000, the State legislatures of Oklahoma and Texas, along with  tribal leaders from the neighboring KCA Tribes and Chickasaw and  Choctaw Nations, attempted to resolve these remaining issues by  agreeing to the Red River Boundary Compact. Congress later consented to  the compact, and, in so doing, agreed to move the jurisdictional  boundary between the States from the south bank gradient line to the  south bank vegetation line.   The BLM began updating its resource management plan for public lands  in Kansas, Oklahoma, and Texas, which includes the area along the Red  River, in 2013. The BLM doesn't full know the extent of public domain,  and that is why they are trying to do the survey. The resource  management planning process would update the current RMPs covering this  area, which were developed in 1994 and 1996, and establish a long-term  plan articulating the BLM's objectives and strategies for maintaining  the health and productivity of public lands in the region.   As we discussed earlier, in 1923, the United States Supreme Court  also interjected into this and set the criteria.   We can disagree on some of these issues, but we can at least agree to  get  [[Page H1157]]  our facts straight. We do know, Mr. Speaker, that this has been an  ongoing process and this has gone back for different administrations.   I think the question becomes: Why is it necessary to do this now?  What is it that is happening now? They are in court. They have been in  court. They have availed themselves of the court process. No one  disagrees with the United States Supreme Court decision.   So the question we should all ask ourselves is: Why now? Why take  out, in this bill, my amendment that was rejected by the Rules  Committee which would have eliminated that portion which says basically  the Federal Government has no say in the survey? So why would we  abdicate that major responsibility?   We not only have responsibility to the tribes listed, but there are  also different kinds of tribal lands, which we must take into account.  So the question is: Why abdicate it?   If as was stated earlier that what we are talking about is just a  bill that says to the BLM to do the survey, then why does it contain  within it a statement that says it has no right to concur or to  approve?   I think that it would be a different situation if this was a bill  that said: hurry up and do your survey. But that is not what this bill  says.   This bill says the States of Texas and Oklahoma will do it--actually,  Texas will do it in consultation with Oklahoma and specific tribes.   Why doesn't it say, if what we want is a survey, that BLM do the  survey?   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   It is very interesting because we seem to be confusing what is at  issue here. If what is at issue here is a survey process, then there is  no question. The survey process is set up in the United States Supreme  Court decision of Oklahoma v. Texas. No one disputes that that should  be it.   Neither is it disputed that BLM cannot illegally claim private  property and, in fact, it does have a process by which it can sell that  private property.   First, under Section 203 of FLPMA, the BLM may sell public lands for  private fair market value if, through the planning process, the public  land has been determined to be difficult and uneconomic to manage; the  land was acquired for a specific purpose but no longer fulfills the  Federal purpose; or disposal may serve important public objectives  which cannot be achieved prudently on land other than public land.   Under Section 206 of the FLPMA, the Secretary of the Interior can  also conduct land exchanges of equal value with the same State so long  as the public interest is well served.   Mr. Speaker, the reason why there is a compact of 2000 on this  specific issue is because the States can't do it without the  concurrence of Congress. What is being proposed here, in terms of the  survey, is really using a Federal standard.   Again, the question is: Why?   More importantly, Mr. Speaker, there are tribal lands involved; not  only the tribes noted, but also different types of tribal lands,  private tribal lands different from that which is held in trust by the  Secretary of the Interior, and we are abdicating that responsibility.   We have a fiduciary duty to these tribal lands, and it should not be  treated basically with, well, if we don't agree, maybe we can come  forward and say we don't agree. That is not what this is about.   They are beginning the process. They are in mediation. The courts  have been the mechanism by which landowners have views, and there is  one going on. So why not let the process go?   It just seems to be out of Congress' authority to simply abdicate the  responsibilities that we have and say: The States can do it. And then  we pay for it. Now, that makes no sense.   We need to be able to say to those that we have a fiduciary  obligation to, and others, that we have done our job; that the Federal  Government has done its job.   They are in the process. So the question I have again is, why now?  Why now? This has been going on since way--I read through all the  different treaties and the different types of cases that came up since  1923, Oklahoma v. Texas. So why now?   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I respectfully disagree. In the year 2000, when the Red River Compact  was approved by Congress, and because of the nature of a compact and  because of the requirements of our United States Constitution, which I  know my colleagues abide by, it is a different situation. This could  have been addressed if they wanted it addressed, but that is not what  was done.   It is not over 100 years. We have intervening facts, like the compact  of 2000, which afforded Congress the opportunity to look at this and,  more importantly, the States the opportunity to decide.   Now, what did they do?   They disagreed on the high-water mark. They did not go into these  specific issues. I am sure it is not something that occurred within the  last 17 years. This is something that existed all along. So I call  everyone's attention to the compact of 2000.   Last year's bill, H.R. 2130, contained in there the following  statements: The Secretary disclaims any right, title, and interest to  the land located south of the south bank boundary line in the affected  area.   It also said that surveys conducted by the Bureau of Land Management  before the date of enactment of this act shall have no force or effect  in determining the south bank boundary line.   So to say that they didn't do anything--or it was being done--the law  that was attempted to be passed, it passed out of the House. The bill  that passed out of the House contains in it specific language that they  are saying they don't want any of that to apply.   So, Mr. Speaker, we come back to, I guess, why? Why? The authority to  survey and approve or disapprove the sale or transfer of public lands  belongs to the Federal Government acting on behalf of the American  people.   The Bureau of Land Management has held the authority to examine the  accuracy of these surveys and make revisions, when necessary and, in  this instance, an ongoing process to make changes began in 2013. It is  not like nothing has happened. It has been ongoing. The BLM has the  tools and authority to resolve this survey problem, and Congress should  just get out of the way and allow the process to play out.   Instead, my colleagues across the aisle want to use the situation as  an excuse to make progress on their larger goal, alienating public  land.   Just last week, they voted to repeal the BLM's efforts to update  their resource management planning process. BLM's new rule increased  the opportunities for the public to engage in the management of public  lands and help the agency respond more efficiently to changes taking  place in the environment and across the landscape.   By repealing BLM's planning rule, Republicans are ensuring that more  disputes like Red River will develop, more public land will be lost or  destroyed, and more litigation will ensue, all costing taxpayers more  money.   So, Mr. Speaker, when we talk about H.R. 428, it is just the latest  step in a very unpopular, anti-public lands campaign. Americans across  the country have equal ownership and right to access and to enjoy all  the resources. Whether it is a national park in Montana, a national  park in Hawaii that has a volcano, forest lands in Pennsylvania, or  wetlands in Colorado, the opportunities afforded through these  resources belong to us all, regardless of hometown, education, means,  or experience.   Despite the fact that we are talking about a 160-mile stretch of the  Red River, by cutting away at the authority and management tools  Federal agencies have at their disposal, this bill furthers my  colleagues across the aisle's national public lands agenda and  threatens the multiple-use principle that governs all BLM lands, all  while costing the taxpayers the money.   It is like adding insult to injury. Not only do we pass a law, but we  are also paying the States to do the survey.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, how much time do I have remaining?    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   I want to conclude by acknowledging that I have read all of the  various statements and the cases about the property owners along the  Red River. I do understand that providing them with certainty and  assurance that their property rights are not threatened is a goal that  many share.   However, it would be unprecedented and would only further complicate  matters to transfer the Federal survey authority over public domain to  the States. This is not the way our public lands should be managed.   There is a transparent, objective process to determine ownership  along the Red River. This bill subverts that process and sends $1  million in Federal taxpayers' money for a State purpose. This is  neither fair nor just outcome.   With the long, complicated history and various ownership claims along  the Red River, BLM has to be allowed to complete its planning process  and land survey. It also needs the right to have a say, which this  bill, H.R. 428, eliminates that right.   Congress should not determine the outcome of what essentially amounts  to a three-way property dispute by conceding Federal authority to a  State. BLM has its tools it needs. We just need to get out of the way  and let them do their work, which they have been trying to do over the  years; and we do know 2013 has begun the process.   I urge my colleagues to reject the bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                                time  1545     Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
