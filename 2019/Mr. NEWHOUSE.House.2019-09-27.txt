 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize National  Hispanic Heritage Month and the contributions of Hispanic Americans in  my congressional district in central Washington State.   Growing up in Sunnyside, Washington, I have witnessed firsthand how  Hispanic Americans contribute to our communities through  entrepreneurship, military service, and cultural diversity. They are  our friends, our family, our neighbors, and our coworkers. They are  small businessowners, doctors, police officers, and soldiers.   While we may take 1 month out of the year to recognize the historical  and cultural contributions of our Hispanic American friends, we should  do more to support and highlight our appreciation. That is why I am an  original cosponsor of the National Museum of the American Latino Act,  to finally create a Smithsonian museum to recognize and celebrate  Hispanic American and Latino history in our country.   As Americans, we share a common heritage as a Nation of immigrants,  and the people of central Washington cherish our diverse culture and  history.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in celebrating National  Hispanic Heritage Month.                            ____________________
