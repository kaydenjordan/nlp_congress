 Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the  Farnsworth Museum in Rockland, ME, which is celebrating its 70th  anniversary this year. The Farnsworth Museum highlights Maine and  American art, proudly holding one of the largest collections of works  by sculptor Louise Nevelson, a Rockland, ME, native and features works  by Andrew, N.C., and Jamie Wyeth in its Wyeth Center. Their nationally  recognized collection fills over 20,000 square feet of gallery space  and contains more than 15,000 works of art. The Farnsworth has been a  longtime supporter of the arts and a positive presence in the Rockland  community.   Officially opening in August 1948, Lucy Farnsworth turned the estate  left to her by her parents, William Alden Farnsworth and Mary Catherine  Sprague, into a $1.3 million legacy that would later become the William  A. Farnsworth Library and Art Museum in memory of her father. Over the  course of next several years, the Farnsworth amassed an impressive  collection of American art, opening the Andrew Wyeth Gallery in 1968,  presenting a major exhibition of works by Louis Nevelson in 1976, and,  in 2000, opening both the Jamien Morehouse Wing, to display larger and  more in-depth exhibitions, and the Wyeth Research Center, dedicated to  scholarly research and the development of a groundbreaking computer  database program.   In addition to the beautiful art on display, the Farnsworth has been  a long contributor to Maine communities and is a tourist destination  for many visitors. In 1999, the Farnsworth celebrated the permanent  collection, ``Maine in America,'' as well as the naming of director  Chris Crossman as the recipient of the Kathryn M. Weare Award for  Achievement in honor of his contributions and service to the Maine  community. Additionally, the Farnsworth established the Art Initiative  for Maine Schools, AIMS, to encourage Maine children to participate in  tours and workshop programs and created Julia's Gallery for Young  Artists to educate people on the operations aspect of museums. In 2004,  Julia's Gallery for Young Artists received the Maine College of Art  Award for Leadership in Arts Education.   The Farnsworth is also the steward of the Farnsworth Homestead and  the Olson House. The homestead is listed on the National Register of  Historic Places and was the home built for William A. Farnsworth and  his family. The Olson House, a National Historic Landmark, located in  Cushing, ME, is the late 19th century farm that was home to Alvaro and  Christina Olson and the inspiration for hundreds of works by Andrew  Wyeth.   These examples and many more highlight the importance of the  Farnsworth Museum to the Maine community and all those who visit our  great State. I applaud the Farnsworth Art Museum on their achievements  over the past 70 years and look forward to their continued success as a  positive driving force in the State of Maine for many more years to  come.                            ____________________
