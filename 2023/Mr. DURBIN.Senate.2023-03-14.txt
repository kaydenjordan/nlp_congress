 Mr. President, it seems a little unusual to follow  Senator Schumer because usually Senator McConnell is next, and we  certainly understand why he is not here today. He is in recovery from a  fall that he experienced last week. We wish him the very best and hope  he is back very soon.    I announce that the Senator from California (Mrs.  Feinstein), the Senator from Pennsylvania (Mr. Fetterman), and the  Senator from California (Mr. Padilla) are necessarily absent.
