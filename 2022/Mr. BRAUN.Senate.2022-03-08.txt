 Reserving the right to object, the Assistant Secretary of  Labor for Congressional and Intergovernmental Affairs works closely  with congressional leaders and staff on a variety of issues, including  legislative proposals, hearings, briefings, requests for information,  and general topics. It is essential that the nominee is willing to work  with both Democrats and Republicans in a bipartisan fashion.   Elizabeth Watson is currently the executive director of the  Congressional Progressive Caucus Center--director of the Congressional  Progressive Caucus Center--hardly a springboard of bipartisanship.   During the previous administration, Ms. Watson retweeted posts such  as ``White supremacists don't belong in the White House,'' referring to  President Trump.   Her past actions have cast doubt on her ability to be impartial and  her willingness to work in a bipartisan manner.   My concerns with this nominee are not unique, and there are many  other Members that have concerns as well. There should be a vote on  this nominee.   Therefore, I object.
