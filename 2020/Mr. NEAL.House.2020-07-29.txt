 Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, we are considering H.R. 7327, the Child Care for  Economic Recovery Act, which I introduced with my friend and colleague  Chairwoman Lowey, as well as Representatives Davis, Clark, DeLauro, and  Sanchez.   This legislation is particularly important as our country continues  to face a national emergency. All around America, our constituents, are  struggling to cope with the consequences of the pandemic, consequences  made worse because of the policies of this current administration.   People have lost loved ones and livelihoods. Many faced obstacles to  working: pandemic restrictions and health conditions that make them  vulnerable to COVID and, for millions of families, a lack of reasonable  childcare options.   Today, we have the opportunity to help Americans overcome one of the  hurdles to work. By supporting meaningful childcare relief, we can go a  long way.  [[Page H3915]]    Even before the onset of the coronavirus pandemic, our Nation's  childcare system was strained. Millions of families had trouble finding  quality dependent care, and when they did manage to locate it, they  often discovered long waiting lists and out-of-reach prices.   As it has with so many other preexisting challenges, the pandemic has  greatly intensified the stress on our childcare system. Now, daycare  facilities are closing.   In April, the National Association for the Education of Young  Children conducted a survey of more than 5,000 providers and learned  that nearly half had completely closed. The Center for American  Progress estimates that, without Federal support, the pandemic could  result in the loss of 4.5 million childcare slots, which is almost half  the national capacity.   Last week, I spoke with a group of working mothers. One told me that  she fears we are at risk of losing a generation of working parents.  Others emphasized how terrifying their situations are and how they lack  choices that are needed to continue their careers and protect their  children. Their words echo what we have heard from constituents all  over this country.   Today's bill tackles these problems through a combination of tax  relief for parents and childcare providers, grants to States, and  support for essential workers and their childcare needs.   Specifically, it will double the child and dependent care tax credit  and, for the first time, make it fully refundable so that low-income  parents can access it like everyone else. It also establishes a  refundable tax credit to help childcare providers cover their fixed  costs.   It will help parents carry over their dependent care flexible  spending account contributions to next year and expand the employee  retention tax credit, which is so important to help employers of  domestic workers retain those employees.   This bill triples the guaranteed Federal childcare funding from $2.9  billion to $10 billion a year for the next 5 years. It suspends State  match requirements and will also help more low- and middle-income  families afford care.   In sum, I want to say to the parents of this country: We have heard  you loudly and clearly. This childcare crisis is untenable, and it is  pushing many of you to the breaking point. Nothing cuts deeper than  worry over kids' safety and well-being, and the choices you face are  simply too hard. You need and deserve help accessing safe and  affordable care for your kids, and your ability to obtain it is an  essential precondition of helping the economy move forward and helping  it to grow in the future.   This bill provides unprecedented Federal support for childcare  because we are all in this together, and we have got your back.   Madam Speaker, I urge our colleagues to support this important  legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1300     Madam Speaker, in the spirit of bipartisanship, the Record  should note that the second to the gentleman's request came from the  Democratic side.   Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr.  Danny K. Davis), chairman of the Worker and Family Support  Subcommittee, and original cosponsor of this legislation.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Texas  (Mr. Doggett).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Thompson).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Oregon (Mr. Blumenauer).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Sanchez), who is an original cosponsor of this  legislation.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Alabama (Ms. Sewell).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Judy Chu).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), the distinguished majority leader.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Evans).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Schneider).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Gomez).    Madam Speaker, I was prepared to close after Mr. Reed.    Madam Speaker, I spoke with a group of working mothers. One  told me that she fears we are at risk of losing a generation of working  parents. Others emphasized how terrifying their situations are and how  they lacked choices that will allow them to continue their careers and  protect their children.   Parents all across the country have been doing the hard work of  holding their families together while the White House ignores the  plight and exacerbates the public health crisis. We owe it to these  parents to show that we in Congress hear them and that we are going to  do something about it.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this important  legislation.    Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the subject of my Special Order.    Madam Speaker, I have asked the members of the Ways and  Means family to assemble on the floor tonight so that we might offer  appropriate praise to the life of one of the iconic figures of not just  the civil rights movement, but of the Ways and Means Committee.   I sat next to John Lewis for 25 years on the Ways and Means  Committee, and I must tell you, Madam Speaker, he was the bravest and  most gentle person I ever met.   He nearly lost his life in pursuit of justice and confronted some of  the darkest facets of our society at the Edmund Pettus Bridge as a very  young man, but he never lost faith in what America could become.   During those many conversations--and he offered a tutorial to me  about the life and the legend that he had offered to America--his  unyielding optimism and hope lifted the spirits of his fellow Members  of Congress and the American people in our Nation's most trying  moments.   With quiet strength, grace, and love, he shouldered unthinkable  burdens and changed this world for the better. Through it all, he was  unfailingly humble, selfless, and kind.   I must say--and I was commenting a moment ago to some colleagues on  the committee--if he was in the room, Madam Speaker, you would have to  get him to come to the microphone. That was that reluctance that he  had. And we all had known about the great achievements that he had  offered to this Nation, but it was never, ``Let me get to the  microphone.'' It was always a much more humble arrangement.   He came to my constituency in 2015. He was invited by the Sisters of  St. Joseph, who staffed a small Catholic college in Chicopee,  Massachusetts. They invited him to commemorate the fact that on Bloody  Sunday on the Edmund Pettus Bridge they were the only ones, with  members of the Edmundite priesthood, who would care for them when  others closed their doors.   When John greeted Sister Maxyne Schneider upon introduction for the  commencement address, the two of them broke out in tears, and 5,000  people in the Springfield Civic Center broke out in tears with them. He  remembered that moment, and they remembered him--another great story in  the legacy of John Lewis.   It is rare that a person has an opportunity in this institution to  work alongside a real hero. We had that here, and we sometimes forget  that in the din of incendiary debate. But for three decades, I, along  with other members of the Ways and Means Committee, had that honor. To  be in his presence, his wisdom, and his joyful spirit day in and day  out was a blessing beyond words.   John served in this Congress until his last day, in part because his  work was not done. Despite all the advancements he achieved, glaring  inequities remain in our Nation that demand reform. But lucky for us,  John Lewis inspired generations of young people to follow in his steps,  to stand up to injustice, and to fight for what is right.   Now he can clearly rest, and our prayers are with him as we carry on  his vital and unfinished business. It is up to all of us to pick up  where John left off and to be part of his legacy in action.   For those of us who will join his funeral service tomorrow in  Atlanta, what a great journey this has been to have served with him in  this Congress.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Brady).    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr.  Thompson), another esteemed member of the Committee on Ways and Means.    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Connecticut  (Mr. Larson).    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. Blumenauer).    Madam Speaker, I yield the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr.  Kelly), our friend, who asked me on the floor last week, will the  committee be paying a tribute to John Lewis.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Doggett).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Danny K. Davis), a very close friend of John Lewis.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Sanchez).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New  York (Mr. Higgins).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Alabama (Ms. Sewell).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Washington (Ms. DelBene).    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from California  (Ms. Judy Chu).    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr.  Kildee).    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Kansas (Mr.  Estes).    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlemen from Pennsylvania  (Mr. Brendan F. Boyle).    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr.  Beyer).    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania  (Mr. Evans).                                time  2045     Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr.  Schneider).    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from New York (Mr.  Suozzi).    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his comments.   Madam Speaker, the Nation had a chance tonight to hear about the  affection and regard that we held for a very important member of the  Ways and Means family, John Lewis.   Madam Speaker, I thank Mr. Kelly for yielding me the time. He did  urge at a moment last week: I hope that we will be able to do a  bipartisan tribute to John.   I said we planned one, and we want to make sure both sides are  involved.   I just want to close on this note, as we travel to Atlanta tomorrow  to say good-bye to John. At a Committee on Ways and Means Democratic  retreat in New York about 2 years ago, with a very distinguished  alumnus of the Democratic Party as well, Charlie Rangel came over to  the dinner. John, myself, and former Chairman Rangel, we were sitting  and just talking at the end of the night. After the conversation, when  John got up and left, Charlie Rangel said to me: You know, Rich, there  were many of us who did the right thing along the way. Many of us  participated fully in the civil rights movement. But John Lewis would  have died for the cause.   Pretty remarkable: John Lewis would have died for the cause.   Tonight, Madam Speaker, I want to thank the Members of the House,  both political parties, and the Ways and Means family for a nice  tribute to our friend, John Lewis.  [[Page H3975]]
