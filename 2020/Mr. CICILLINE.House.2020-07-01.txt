 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a Rhode Island  legend, the late former mayor of Newport, Paul Gaines, Sr.   At a moment in our Nation's history, when we are again confronting  the torment of generations of racial inequality, and collectively  working to repair the soul of America, Paul Gaines will be remembered  as a trailblazer in the fight for equal justice under the law.   As New England's and Rhode Island's first Black mayor, Mayor Gaines  was an inspiration, an educator, a soldier, a mentor, and a change- maker who succeeded in every endeavor by bridging divides and leading  with humility and integrity.   When he died last Thursday, at the age of 88, Mayor Gaines left  behind an enormous legacy.   As an activist, he spent a decade of his life working to build a  memorial to the First Rhode Island Regiment, a Continental Army  regiment that is best remembered today for recruiting Black soldiers to  serve during the Revolutionary War.   In these recent years, he continued his work to ensuring equality of  opportunity regardless of one's race, who they are, or where they came  from.   Mr. Speaker, I offer my deepest sympathies to his wife of 61 years,  Jo Eva, and to the entire Gaines family.                            ____________________
