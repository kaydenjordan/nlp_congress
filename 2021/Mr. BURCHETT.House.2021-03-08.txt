 Mr. Speaker, today is International Women's Day, and I  rise to celebrate three special women who are in my life.   My mother, Joyce Burchett, was the youngest of seven. One of her  brothers was actually killed by the Nazis shortly after D-day in the  Second World War.   She flew planes in World War II to help with the war effort. That is  my wonderful mama right there. She was doing that when my dad was off  fighting the Japanese during the Second World War.   She was the youngest of seven, as I stated, and she didn't even have  electricity until she was a senior in high school.   This is my wife, Kelly, and my daughter, Isabel. Kelly was a single  mom when I met her. Being a mom is already a really tough job, and  doing it alone is even tougher. I am blessed to raise Isabel along with  Kelly and to be a father to her. She has been one of the greatest joys  in my life. They both have been.   My mother was and Kelly and Isabel are strong and determined women.  They influence and inspire me every day, and I am grateful to have them  in my life.                            ____________________
