 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember the life  of Mr. Billy Lee, who passed away on December 21 at the age of 85.   Mr. Lee owned McDonough's, the oldest Irish pub in Savannah; and the  upstairs restaurant, Billy's Place. Mr. Lee and McDonough's are iconic  in Savannah. McDonough's has been voted the best karaoke in town for 8  straight years and is an immensely popular watering hole for all  Savannahians.   Mr. Lee never met a stranger in McDonough's and he had an extremely  sharp memory for its patrons. His kindness is fondly remembered by all  who frequented McDonough's, including times when he purchased blankets  for the homeless, allowed folks to use his business for charity events,  and opened his building for Hurricane Irma evacuees from Florida.   Mr. Lee has commented on his restaurant and bar: That's the story of  what we do here. We help people.   Mr. Lee's kind spirit will be missed in Savannah, and I hope that  people will continue to learn from his example for years to come.                            ____________________
