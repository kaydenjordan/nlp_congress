 Mr. President, I would like to thank Pastor Marty Sloan  for delivering the opening prayer in the Senate today.   Pastor Sloan is the lead pastor of Harvest Time, one of the most  active and well-attended houses of worship in Arkansas's second largest  city of Fort Smith, which is the city in which I grew up.   Pastor Sloan is also a proud husband and father and plays an  important role in the life of the Fort Smith community. As the lead  pastor of Harvest Time, he has a passion for caring for his  congregation and those in the larger community through preaching,  teaching, and counseling in order to encourage and build up their faith  and develop meaningful relationships with Christ and one another.   For 22 years, Pastor Sloan has been in ministry and has focused on  both national and international missions. He has also been involved  with the Live Nativity on Capitol Hill and the National Day of Prayer  and has conducted pastoral conferences in America, Peru, and Armenia.  Pastor Sloan says that one of his greatest joys is to ``pastor from the  center of the room'' because his desire is to lead his congregation by  walking through life together with them.   Serving as the guest Chaplain is an incredible honor. I am thankful  for Pastor Sloan's ministry, and I am so pleased he could be here to  offer an invocation of asking God to guide and bless the efforts of  Congress and America's leaders.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise to address the urgent crisis  taking place in Sudan, but, first, I wish to take just a moment to  remember former Congressman Jay Dickey, who, as many in Washington and  Arkansas now know, passed away last week.   Jay was a native of Pine Bluff and represented Southern Arkansas in  the Fourth Congressional District for four terms between 1993 and 2001.  Jay was known as a fierce advocate for Arkansas and worked hard to  ensure that our State had a strong voice in Washington.   A successful business owner and attorney, Jay was a well-respected  member of the Pine Bluff community. He served as Pine Bluff city  attorney and had a brief tenure on the Arkansas Supreme Court. Jay was  a friend to many and built a warm relationship with almost everyone he  met--even those who disagreed with him politically. He also wore his  faith on his sleeve as a proud born-again Christian.   I will always appreciate Jay's kindness to me when I first started  serving in Congress and truly valued his friendship. He was a loving  father, a dedicated public servant, and he will be missed by many.   My thoughts and prayers are with his family and friends as they mourn  his loss, but I know they are also incredibly proud, as I have been, of  the legacy Jay leaves behind, which will continue to have an impact on  us all in the years ahead.
