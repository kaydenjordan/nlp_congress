 Madam Speaker, to my colleagues from Georgia, other  colleagues in the House, I am Kwanza Hall and I am so thankful to be  here today.   In July, just before Congressman Lewis passed away, I had COVID, and  I spent about 3 weeks lying flat dealing with it, and I didn't know I  would be here. So God blessed me with that time to think about what I  would do next with my life at the same time Congressman Lewis had  passed away. He was a friend. He was a neighbor. He and my father  served in the civil rights movement together. My father, Leon Hall, was  in Montgomery at the same time, and Selma.    So I had to think about what was next for me. And God gave me a  choice: Do you want to do your business, or do you want to do My  business?   And I stepped up and answered the call, and He said: I have a mission  for you. The mission is to run for that office and serve District Five.   We have a lot of things on the plate in front of us, and I just want  to be a unifier, a person who can help us get some things done on  behalf of the least of these, as Congressman Lewis would.   So thank you all for having me. Thank you to my mother, my father,  who is not with us, to the Congressmen who have come before me, Wyche  Fowler, and Ambassador Andrew Young.                            ____________________
