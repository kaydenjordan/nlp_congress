 Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to this amendment.    Mr. Chairman, while many today will debate the role of  the Federal Government in regulating product sales between two willing  States, I simply want to make one point: The medical evidence against  raw milk, against unpasteurized milk, is clear. There is no denying the  link between raw milk consumption and life-threatening foodborne  illnesses.   According to the CDC, unpasteurized dairy products, otherwise known  as raw milk, while consumed by less than 4 percent of the population,  account for 96 percent of illnesses from contaminated dairy products.   As a physician who has recently retired from obstetrics, what truly  touches my heart is that two-thirds of these outbreaks are associated  with raw milk consumption involving children.   How any school could allow raw milk inside their walls is nothing  short of appalling, and that is why I stand today and ask you to oppose  this amendment that would expand the interstate sale of raw milk and  would fly in the face of both the FDA and CDC's best science.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chairman, I yield such time as he may consume to  the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Yoho), a veterinarian who knows more  about these foodborne illnesses than I do.    Madam Chair, how much time do I have remaining?    Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Oregon (Mr. Schrader).    Madam Chair, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from Minnesota (Mr. Peterson), the ranking member of the House  Agriculture Committee, if he has any tolerance for the issue.    Madam Chair, according to a veterinarian well known to  me, he has claimed that drinking raw milk is akin to drinking water out  of a cow hoof print in the dirt.   Madam Chair, I want to encourage folks to vote against this  amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.
