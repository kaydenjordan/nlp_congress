 Mr. Speaker, one of the most absurd and destructive plans  being touted by out-of-touch socialists is a ban on fracking, also  known as hydraulic fracturing, for natural gas and oil.   At home in Pennsylvania's 12th Congressional District, a region that  on any given day produces up to 10 percent of our Nation's natural gas,  it is easy to see how the energy economy has benefited everyone. From  high-paying jobs to lower energy costs, natural gas has been an  economic win for the American people.   Even more, thanks to the natural gas boom, America is now energy  independent. That means great things for our national security, as we  are no longer beholden to energy-producing nations that hate us.   Unbelievably, these great benefits are under attack by radical  socialists who seek to ban fracking and cripple America's energy  economy.   According to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the plan to end fracking  would cost more than 600,000 jobs and $261 billion in GDP by 2025, and  that is just in Pennsylvania.   This is why I invited the socialists in this Congress and those  running for President who want to ban fracking to come to  Pennsylvania's 12th Congressional District to face the families they  wish to leave destitute, to face the families who have finally found  success, and tell them why they want to take it away.   For these folks, a ban on fracking would lead to more government  dependence, lower wages, fewer jobs, and skyrocketing energy prices.   In other words, banning fracking would pave the road for America to  become a socialist country. There should be nothing scarier or more  sickening than that.                      Congratulating Bucknell University     Mr. Speaker, I want to take a little bit of time today to  congratulate Bucknell University on achieving a great recognition this  week.   According to the United States Peace Corps, Bucknell University,  located in Lewisburg, Pennsylvania, produces the fourth most Peace  Corps volunteers of all small colleges and universities nationwide.   In their 2020 report, the Peace Corps noted Bucknell produced 13  volunteers for the Peace Corps, an amazing feat for an institution  whose student body is just over 3,600 students.   According to its mission statement, ``Bucknell educates students for  a lifetime of critical thinking and strong leadership characterized by  continued intellectual exploration, creativity, and imagination.''   By forming students in that mission, it is no wonder why so many  Bucknell students find themselves seeking greater service to humanity  through the Peace Corps.   In noting the type of schools that make up the list of robust Peace  Corps volunteers, Peace Corps Director Jody Olsen said: ``These schools  are institutions that emphasize . . . service-minded students.''   Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the people of Pennsylvania's 12th  Congressional District, I congratulate Bucknell University and  President Bravman on this great recognition and on creating service- minded students.
