 Madam Speaker, I rise today in honor of the life of  Luke Letlow.   As a Member-elect of this freshman class, Luke was one of us. We  didn't get the privilege of serving alongside him, but in getting to  know his family, I have no doubt that he would have been an energetic  leader among us.   In talking with Luke's wife, Julia, I have come to know the very best  of what Luke stood for and why he will forever be with us as a Member  of this body.   Luke's love of Louisiana ran as deep as the roots of generations that  came before him. Luke revered leaders ranging from Ronald Reagan, whose  optimistic vision of conservatism transformed the Republican Party and  the world, to the local Richland Parish police jurors who ensured  residents received the essential services that local  [[Page H568]]  government was charged with providing.   Luke loved studying Louisiana political history and voraciously read  every out-of-print book on the subject that he could get his hands on.  Luke's passion for preserving the history of Richland Parish and his  forebears took him from documenting gravesites and local churches to  building a website that chronicled the history of the rural community  where he was raised.   Luke's love of America, Louisiana, and Richland Parish defined him as  a person and motivated him to pursue a career in the noble profession  of public service.    Tonight, we honor his memory. But moving forward, we will strive to  embody his passion for people, our history, and our Nation.
