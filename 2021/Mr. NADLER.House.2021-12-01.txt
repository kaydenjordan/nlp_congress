Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, H.R. 5720, the Courthouse Ethics and Transparency Act  of 2021, embodies an important bipartisan effort to address an alarming  lack of transparency in the personal financial holdings of Federal  judges and the conflicts--or appearance of conflicts--those holdings  can create in the cases those judges are asked to decide.   This legislation makes incremental but necessary progress toward  accountability by building on Federal statutes that already prohibit  judges from deciding cases in which they have a personal financial  stake in the outcome.   It has been the law in this country since the 1970s that judges must  recuse themselves from any case in which they hold a legal or equitable  interest of any size in any property or party under consideration. To  help ensure that recusals occur as required, Federal law also requires  judges to file annual reports disclosing their personal financial  interests so that litigants, the press, and the general public can  check their work.   Unfortunately, recent reporting by prominent media outlets and a  hearing by the Courts Subcommitee, have shown that the law is not  working as intended. The infrequency of judges' financial disclosures  and the inaccessibilty of the reports themselves have made actual  transparency practically impossible.   The result is recent investigative reporting revealing that over 130  Federal judges have decided cases in which they are part owners of the  parties before them; over 60 judges have actively traded shares in the  parties in their courtrooms while cases are still going on, in some  cases profiting on those trades.   The consequences of these actions are both acute and widespread.  Failures to recuse can cause real harm to the parties whose cases are  impacted and can leave a cloud of doubt over any law created from these  cases once the conflicts are uncovered. Perhaps even more concerning,  when the public sees members of their judiciary behaving in such a  manner, their faith in their system of justice can be withered by  cynicism and suspicion.   H.R. 5720 addresses these problems by requiring Federal judges to  abide by the same periodic transaction reporting laws already  applicable to Members of Congress and senior executive branch  officials.   Further, the bill requires the Administrative Office of the United  States Courts to create an online database of judicial financial  disclosure reports and to timely update that database in searchable,  sortable, and downloadable copies of disclosure reports as they become  available so that litigants, the press, and the public can access and  analyze that information in close to real time.   These simple solutions are long overdue and are the product of  bipartisan, bicameral collaboration. I want to thank Congresswoman Ross  and Congressman Issa for their leadership on this issue and for  introducing this legislation. I also appreciate Ranking Member Jordan  for working with us on this bill, and I want to thank Hank Johnson,  chairman of the Subcommittee on the Courts, Intellectual Property, and  the Internet for holding a hearing exposing the issues this bill  addresses.   Madam Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to support this legislation,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman North  Carolina (Ms. Ross).    Mr. Speaker, we have additional speakers. I yield 2  minutes to the gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. Cicilline), a member of  the Judiciary Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Johnson), chairman of the subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, H.R. 5720 would make a meaningful difference  in the accessibility and transparency of an entire branch of our  Federal Government. It would strengthen trust in our courts and, in  doing so, would strengthen our courts.   H.R. 5720 would establish a level playing field for access to  critical government documents, allowing litigants, the public, and the  press to enforce and ensure accountability.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 5677) to make technical amendments to update statutory  references to certain provisions classified to title 2, United States  Code, title 50, United States Code, and title 52, United States Code.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on H.R. 5677.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  [[Page H6753]]    Mr. Speaker, one of the important responsibilities the House gives  the Judiciary Committee is to oversee the revision and codification of  the statutes of the United States. Keeping track of the new laws  Congress passes every session is a formidable challenge, but it is an  essential part of maintaining the rule of law in our country, and it is  a duty we take seriously on the committee.   The body of Federal law is so large and complex at this point that it  would be almost completely unmanageable without the United States Code.  Currently consisting of 54 titles, the code compiles the general and  permanent laws of the United States into coherent subject areas.   The code makes our Federal laws accessible both to the government  officials who work to fairly administer them and to the private  citizens who seek the benefits or relief the law provides them.   The code did not appear magically out of thin air. Congress created  it in 1926 and, since that time, it has been painstakingly constructed  and updated by expert lawyers working under the supervision of the  House.                                time  1415    We all owe a great debt to the Office of the Law Revision Counsel, or  OLRC, whose attorneys ably carry out their statutory mandate ``to  develop and keep current an official and positive codification of the  laws of the United States'' while maintaining strict impartiality as to  legislative policy.   Today, I am pleased to bring to the floor six bills developed by the  Office of the Law Revision Counsel to further this mission. The first  four bills are considered editorial reclassification bills because they  make conforming changes to statutes that have been impacted by OLRC's  reorganization efforts.   For example, in 2014, OLRC reorganized the voting and elections  statutes into a single title, title 52 of the Code. The first bill we  are considering, H.R. 5677, updates references to these laws in other  titles of the Code to reflect their new location in title 52. I thank  Congresswoman Madeleine Dean for introducing this legislation.   I want to make it very clear that the statutory changes made by this  bill and the others we are considering today are purely technical in  nature. They do not change the meaning or effect of any existing laws.  They are part of an ongoing effort to maintain the Code as an  authoritative, accurate, and accessible source of Federal law.   I would like to thank our colleagues who have introduced these bills,  and I am glad we can fulfill our responsibility to keep the Code  updated in a bipartisan manner.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to support this legislation, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Pennsylvania (Ms. Dean), the sponsor of this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I appreciate Congresswoman Dean for her  leadership in introducing this legislation. I urge everyone to support  this legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 5679) to make technical amendments to update statutory  references to certain provisions classified to title 7, title 20, and  title 43, United States Code.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 5679         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous materials on H.R. 5679.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, as I explained during consideration of H.R. 5677, this  bill has been prepared by the Office of the Law Revision Counsel and  makes a number of conforming changes to statutes that  [[Page H6755]]  have been impacted by OLRC's editorial reclassification of titles 7,  20, and 43 of the United States Code.   As I described previously, the statutory changes made by this bill  are purely technical in nature and they do not change the meaning or  effect of any existing laws.   I thank the gentleman from New York (Mr. Jones) for introducing this  legislation, I urge all Members to support it, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, as important as this legislation is, my  brief remarks were enough to explain the bill for the record.   Therefore, with the time remaining, I would like to take this  opportunity to thank Perry Apelbaum for more than 30 years of tireless  service to the House Judiciary Committee.   As you know, Mr. Speaker, the Judiciary Committee is entrusted with a  wide and diverse set of issues, ranging from constitutional law and the  Federal criminal code to immigration and intellectual property.   In his three decades with the committee, as a trusted counsel and  staff director, Perry has left his mark on nearly every area of law  within that broad jurisdiction: protecting the right to vote, securing  our basic civil liberties, and holding the powerful to account where  necessary.   All of official Washington knows Perry as a brilliant attorney, a  selfless friend, and a voice of calm in a crisis. He earned that  reputation leading the country through some of the toughest moments in  our recent history.   He has worked as senior staff on three impeachments. He coauthored  three books with his longtime boss, Chairman John Conyers, Jr.: ``What  Went Wrong in Ohio,'' ``The Constitution in Crisis,'' and ``Reining in  the Imperial Presidency.''   After the attacks of September 11, 2001, Perry worked across the  aisle to keep us safe in a manner that would be consistent with our  civil liberties.   After the attacks of January 6, 2021, he spent many sleepless nights  ensuring that our democratic institutions would endure.   What strikes me, Mr. Speaker, is that Perry's most important and  lasting contributions to the committee have gone to secure a better  life for the Americans who need our help most. These accomplishments  include the Innocence Protection Act, the Matthew Shepherd-James Byrd,  Jr., Hate Crimes Prevention Act, the Emmett Till Unsolved Civil Rights  Crime Act, the Second Chance Act, the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, the  Helping Families Save Their Homes Act, and the James Zadroga 9/11  Health and Compensation Act.   All told, these accomplishments have benefited countless citizens.  They have made our social contract more just and our justice system  more fair. Mr. Speaker, the Talmud teaches us that whosoever saves one  life has saved an entire world. By this measure, worlds upon worlds owe  a debt of gratitude to Perry Apelbaum.   Perry is, of course, far from finished in his work for the American  people. He has told us repeatedly that he intends ``to run all the way  through the tape'' on his last days on Capitol Hill.   He leaves us with a clear sense of mission. He has laid the  groundwork for our most important prerogatives, including but not  limited to comprehensive police reform, commonsense checks on the  scourge of gun violence, and the reauthorization of the Voting Rights  Act.   Perry will continue his public service in the Department of Justice  as a senior counsel in the Antitrust Division. He has already proven  himself a committed advocate for American consumers. His sense of  fairness in matters of antitrust law is unwavering, and our loss will  be the Department's gain.   Of course, we owe our thanks to Perry's beloved wife, Laura Apelbaum,  and his two children, Benjamin and Sarah. There is no question that  they have sustained Perry, in good times and bad, through these many  years.   But most of all, Mr. Speaker, we owe our thanks to Perry Apelbaum.  His departure marks the end of an era on Capitol Hill. Our parting is  bittersweet, but we are so grateful for his leadership, and we wish  Perry nothing but the best as he takes on this new challenge on behalf  of the American people. Please join me in thanking Perry for his  service.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 5695) to make technical amendments to update statutory  references to certain provisions which were formerly classified to  chapters 14 and 19 of title 25, United States Code.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.

Section 4(e)(4) of the Subversive Activities Control Act of       1950 (50 U.S.C. 783(e)(4)) is amended by striking ``(42       U.S.C. 10601)'' and inserting ``(34 U.S.C. 20101)''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to  [[Page H6770]]  revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on H.R.  5705.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, as I explained during consideration of H.R. 5677, this  bill has been prepared by the Office of the Law Revision Counsel and  makes a number of conforming changes to statutes that have been  impacted by OLRC's editorial reclassification of title 34 of the United  States Code.   As I described previously, the statutory changes made by this bill  are purely technical in nature, and they do not change the meaning or  effect of any existing laws.   I thank the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. Bentz) for introducing this  legislation. I urge all Members to support it, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman from Oregon (Mr.  Bentz) for his leadership in introducing this legislation, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 5961) to make revisions in title 5, United States Code, as  necessary to keep the title current, and to make technical amendments  to improve the United States Code.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 5961         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. TABLE OF CONTENTS.         The table of contents for this Act is as follows:  Sec. 1. Table of contents. Sec. 2. Purposes; restatement does not change meaning or effect of                existing law. Sec. 3. Revision of title 5, United States Code. Sec. 4. Technical amendments. Sec. 5. Transitional and savings provisions. Sec. 6. Effect of references to title 5 on application of ethics                provisions. Sec. 7. Repeals.       SEC. 2. PURPOSES; RESTATEMENT DOES NOT CHANGE MEANING OR                     EFFECT OF EXISTING LAW.         (a) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--        (1) to make revisions in title 5, United States Code, as       necessary to keep the title current; and        (2) to make technical amendments to improve the United       States Code.        (b) Restatement Does Not Change Meaning or Effect of       Existing Law.--        (1) In general.--The restatement of existing law enacted by       this Act does not change the meaning or effect of the       existing law. The restatement incorporates in title 5, United       States Code, various provisions that were enacted separately       over a period of years, reorganizing them, conforming style       and terminology, modernizing obsolete language, and       correcting drafting errors. These changes serve to remove       ambiguities, contradictions, and other imperfections, but       they do not change the meaning or effect of the existing law       or impair the precedential value of earlier judicial       decisions or other interpretations.        (2) Rule of construction.--        (A) In general.--Notwithstanding the plain meaning rule or       other rules of statutory construction, a change in wording       made in the restatement of existing law enacted by this Act       serves to clarify the existing law as indicated in paragraph       (1), but not to change the meaning or effect of the existing       law.        (B) Revision notes.--Subparagraph (A) applies whether or       not a change in wording is explained by a revision note       appearing in a congressional report accompanying this Act. If       such a revision note does appear, a court shall consider the       revision note in interpreting the change.       SEC. 3. REVISION OF TITLE 5, UNITED STATES CODE.

(b) Cutoff Date.--The restated provisions replace certain       provisions of law enacted on or before October 19, 2021. If a       law enacted after that date amends or repeals a source       provision, that law is deemed to amend or repeal, as the case       may be, the corresponding restated provision. If a law       enacted after that date is otherwise inconsistent with a       restated provision or a provision of this Act, that law       supersedes the restated provision or provision of this Act to       the extent of the inconsistency.        (c) Original Date of Enactment Unchanged.--A restated       provision is deemed to have been enacted on the date of       enactment of the corresponding source provision.        (d) References to Restated Provisions.--A reference to a       restated provision is deemed to refer to the corresponding       source provision.  [[Page H6816]]         (e) References to Source Provisions.--A reference to a       source provision, including a reference in a regulation,       order, or other law, is deemed to refer to the corresponding       restated provision.        (f) Regulations, Orders, and Other Administrative       Actions.--A regulation, order, or other administrative action       in effect under a source provision continues in effect under       the corresponding restated provision.        (g) Actions Taken and Offenses Committed.--An action taken       or an offense committed under a source provision is deemed to       have been taken or committed under the corresponding restated       provision.        (h) Legislative Construction.--An inference of legislative       construction is not to be drawn by reason of a restated       provision's location in the United States Code or by reason       of the heading used for the restated provision.       SEC. 6. EFFECT OF REFERENCES TO TITLE 5 ON APPLICATION OF                     ETHICS PROVISIONS.         A Federal statute providing that title 5 of the United       States Code as a whole is inapplicable, or providing that an       appointment may be made without regard to the provisions of       title 5 governing appointment in the competitive service,       shall not affect the application of any provision of chapter       131 of title 5, United States Code.       SEC. 7. REPEALS.         The following provisions of law are repealed, except with       respect to rights and duties that matured, penalties that       were incurred, or proceedings that were begun before the date       of enactment of this Act:  ------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                       United States Code                Act                      Section             Former                                                         Classification ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Pub.

App. (IGA                                                        Sec. 3) note. ------------------------------------------------------------------------      Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H.R. 5961.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, to date, 27 of the U.S. Code's 54 titles have been  enacted into positive law, which means that the text of these titles is  itself the law, while the remaining titles are nonpositive, meaning  that they organize Federal statutes for users' convenience but do not  themselves have the force of law.   This legislation and the next bill we will consider represent recent  efforts by the Office of the Law Revision Counsel to keep positive-law  titles in the Code up to date. Because positive-law titles are the law  itself, they must be amended by law when Congress passes new statutes  that belong within the titles because of their subject matter.   H.R. 5961 would make revisions to title 5 of the Code, which relates  to government organization and employees, to account for three  important  [[Page H6817]]  government accountability laws that were adopted in the 1970s: The  Federal Advisory Committee Act, the Inspector General Act, and the  Ethics in Government Act.   Since these laws were adopted after title 5 became positive law, OLRC  had placed them in an appendix to title 5, which made citation to them  awkward and confusing. H.R. 5961 eliminates this appendix by creating  three new chapters for these three laws within the body of title 5  itself.   Like the other codification bills we have considered, the statutory  changes made by this bill are purely technical in nature, and they do  not change the meaning or effect of any existing laws.   I thank the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Neguse) for introducing this  legislation. I urge all Members to support it, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman from Colorado  (Mr. Neguse) for his leadership in introducing this legislation. I urge  everyone to support it, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 5982) to make revisions in title 51, United States Code, as  necessary to keep the title current, and to make technical amendments  to improve the United States Code.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 5982         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. TABLE OF CONTENTS.         The table of contents for this Act is as follows:  Sec. 1. Table of contents. Sec. 2. Purposes; restatement does not change meaning or effect of                existing law. Sec. 3. Revision of title 51, United States Code. Sec. 4. Technical amendments. Sec. 5. Transitional and savings provisions. Sec. 6. Repeals.       SEC. 2. PURPOSES; RESTATEMENT DOES NOT CHANGE MEANING OR                     EFFECT OF EXISTING LAW.         (a) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--        (1) to make revisions in title 51, United States Code, as       necessary to keep the title current; and        (2) to make technical amendments to improve the United       States Code.        (b) Restatement Does Not Change Meaning or Effect of       Existing Law.--        (1) In general.--The restatement of existing law enacted by       this Act does not change the meaning or effect of the       existing law. The restatement incorporates in title 51,       United States Code, various provisions that were enacted       separately over a period of years, reorganizing them,       conforming style and terminology, modernizing obsolete       language, and correcting drafting errors. These changes serve       to remove ambiguities, contradictions, and other       imperfections, but they do not change the meaning or effect       of the existing law or impair the precedential value of       earlier judicial decisions or other interpretations.        (2) Rule of construction.--        (A) In general.--Notwithstanding the plain meaning rule or       other rules of statutory construction, a change in wording       made in the restatement of existing law enacted by this Act       serves to clarify the existing law as indicated in paragraph       (1), but not to change the meaning or effect of the existing       law.        (B) Revision notes.--Subparagraph (A) applies whether or       not a change in wording is explained by a revision note       appearing in a congressional report accompanying this Act. If       such a revision note does appear, a court shall consider the       revision note in interpreting the change.       SEC. 3. REVISION OF TITLE 51, UNITED STATES CODE.

(f) Regulations, Orders, and Other Administrative       Actions.--A regulation, order, or other administrative action       in effect under a source provision continues in effect under       the corresponding restated provision.        (g) Actions Taken and Offenses Committed.--An action taken       or an offense committed under a source provision is deemed to       have been taken or committed under the corresponding restated       provision.

(Mac) Thornberry          9406               51 U.S.C. note  National Defense Authorization Act                      prec. 40901  for Fiscal Year 2021 (Public Law  116-283) ------------------------------------------------------------------------    [[Page H6833]]                                            Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H.R. 5982.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, as I explained during consideration of H.R. 5961, this  bill is part of the Office of Law Revision Counsel's ongoing effort to  keep positive-law titles of the U.S. Code up to date.   H.R. 5982 would make revisions in title 51 of the Code, which covers  national and commercial space programs. Since it was created as a  positive-law title in 2010, Congress has adopted several important  reforms to the subject matter of title 51. Some of these new laws were  placed into the nonpositive title 42, covering public health and  welfare, while OLRC located others in notes to title 51. H.R. 5982  incorporates these recent statutes into the body of title 51 itself.   I thank the gentlewoman from Minnesota (Mrs. Fischbach) for  introducing this legislation. I urge all Members to support it, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentlewoman from Minnesota  (Mrs. Fischbach) for her leadership in introducing this legislation. I  also appreciate the comments of the gentleman from California (Mr.  Issa) on bipartisanship.   In this era, when the press portrays us as constantly at each other's  throats, when the public gets the impression that we never work  together, that Congress is totally broken, the fact of the matter is,  we often work together and we often pass bipartisan legislation. It  doesn't get the publicity. It is not as exciting as when we fight  amongst ourselves. The press doesn't report it, but it is vital to the  success of the United States.   I congratulate all involved with this legislation, and in particular  Mr. Issa and the others on the Judiciary Committee who have worked so  hard on these bills. I urge everyone to support them, and I yield back  the balance of my time.
