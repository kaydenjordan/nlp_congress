 Mr. Chairman, I stand in support of the amendment.   The amendment does a great deal to restore our constitutional right  to due process and protects the institution of federalism. The  equitable sharing program incentivizes local law enforcement agencies  to ignore State laws regarding civil asset forfeiture in favor of  Federal law.   After Ohio reformed civil asset forfeiture laws, local agencies have  been able to bypass, just as the gentleman from Michigan described. DOJ  allows this even when Federal officials play no role in the  investigation or the arrest. Congressman Amash's amendment would end  this policy.   This program violates the independence of State's police powers and  promotes an asset forfeiture scheme that undermines due process. I urge  my colleagues to support this amendment.                                time  1630
