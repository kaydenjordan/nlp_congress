 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 1  minute in morning business.    Mr. President, on this very day in 1940, Acting  Secretary of State Sumner Welles issued a statement outlining U.S.  policy toward the Soviet Union's annexation of the Baltic States. It  began: ``During these past few days the devious processes whereunder  the political independence and territorial integrity of the three small  Baltic Republics--Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania--were to be  deliberately annihilated by one of their more powerful neighbors, have  been rapidly drawing to their conclusion.''   It expressed the sympathy of the people of the United States for  democratic self-government and, at the same time, articulated the  policy of the United States to oppose predatory activities using force  or the threat of force or any intervention in the affairs of another  sovereign state. The United States continued to recognize the  sovereignty of the Baltic States throughout about 50 years of Soviet  occupation.   Things that go around come around. Now we have a historical footnote.  Vladimir Putin has been trying to rewrite this history for his own  devious purposes--reverting to the absurd Soviet claim that the Baltics  in 1940 joined the Soviet Union voluntarily.   There are also clear parallels we ought to take notice of to this  current Russian occupation of parts of the Republic of Georgia and the  Ukraine. The principles in Secretary of State Welles' Declaration are  as relevant today as they were 80 years ago.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on another issue--and more current-- earlier this year, after the longest economic expansion in U.S.  history, the government told the American people to stay home and  businesses to close--the first time in 240 years of our country.  Countless lives have been saved because Americans heeded their  government's call. And at the same time, whether they wanted to or not,  they were sacrificing for their fellow Americans.   There is no doubt that containing this virus has caused economic pain  not seen since the Great Depression. Hopefully, we are racing toward a  vaccine answer to this pandemic. In the meantime, Americans must  continue to sacrifice, just as previous generations did for the sake of  their neighbors, families, friends, and loved ones.   Make no mistake, we will beat this virus, and the United States of  America will emerge stronger and even more prosperous than before.   Today, Senate Republicans, hopefully, will unveil an unprecedented  expansion of previous assistance to help our country get through this  crisis. As Finance Committee chairman, I look forward to introducing  further assistance to individuals, relief for workers and employers,  support for patients, providers, and foster youth, and additional  flexibilities for State and local governments to fight this disease and  the economic pain that has come before it.   I call on my colleagues to, once again, work together and not let  partisan politics or gamesmanship get in the way of delivering for the  American people.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I am pleased that earlier today the  Senate passed S. 3841 by unanimous consent. This is a commonsense  measure that will ensure the $1,200 economic impact payments Congress  provided to help individuals meet essential needs during these trying  times don't instead end up in the pockets of creditors and debt  collectors.   The CARES Act, which authorized the economic impact payments, sought  to ensure that individuals in need received 100 percent of the payment  they are eligible for by generally exempting such payments from  administrative offset for past due debts owed to Federal or State  agencies. However, as currently written, this language does not protect  these payments from bank garnishment or levy by creditors or debt  collectors.   The bill we passed today will further the original intent under the  CARES Act of ensuring that the economic impact payments go to help  individuals struggling to make ends meet as a result of government- enforced lockdowns and economic fallout of the current pandemic. It  does this by extending protections against bank garnishment to economic  impact payments that are very similar to what is provided to Social  Security benefits under current law. Moreover, it continues the policy  under the CARES Act of providing an exception for child support  enforcement orders to ensure noncustodial parents who owe back child  support fulfill their legal and moral obligations to their children.   I would like to thank Senators Brown, Wyden, and Scott of South  Carolina for working with me on this important bill. I hope that the  House passes an identical measure as soon as possible so that we can  get a bill to the President's desk and these protections can be put  into effect.                            ____________________
