 Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of S. 881, the Promoting Research  and Observations of Space Weather to Improve the Forecasting of  Tomorrow Act, commonly referred to as the PROSWIFT Act.   Fluctuations in solar magnetic activity create variations in the  environment between Earth and the Sun that can affect technologies in  space and here on Earth. This phenomenon is what we refer to as space  weather.   For the most part, space weather has a minimal effect here, but  increased solar activity and severe events can create widespread  problems and even disrupt our electric grid. Satellites that have less  protection from Earth's magnetic field are especially vulnerable.   Significant space weather events are not a new phenomenon, and we  have evidence dating back more than 150 years of severe space weather  events affecting human activity. However, the impact of these events is  much greater now that we rely on satellites and remote sensing for  everything from cell phone communication to energy production to GPS  navigation.   For example, farmers in Oklahoma have been at the forefront of  utilizing precision agriculture to help ensure the most effective use  of our resources when planting crops, a technology dependent on GPS.    Space weather is also a national security issue. Our military has a  variety of assets in orbit around the Earth, which could potentially be  harmed by electromagnetic interference. They rely on satellites built  by NASA and operated by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric  Administration, or NOAA, for timely and accurate information about  potential space weather events.   It is not only technology that is threatened by space weather events.  There are the astronauts who currently work on the International Space  Station more than 200 miles above the Earth's surface and will one day  serve on missions to the Moon and Mars. While we have developed  techniques and technology to reduce the threats posed by increased  radiation exposure due to a severe solar event, we have more work to do  to mitigate these hazards to our astronauts as we venture beyond low- Earth orbit.   In short, severe space weather can have significant effects on each  and  [[Page H4459]]  every one of us. That is why timely and accurate information from  agencies like NASA and NOAA is so important. These agencies play an  important role in better monitoring and forecasting space weather.   The bill before us today represents a good faith effort by the House  and Senate to provide a framework that will provide for better  coordination across the Federal Government. This is especially timely  given that we are about to enter a period of increased solar activity,  which will create more space weather events.   I am pleased this legislation includes an amendment I introduced  during the markup of this legislation. My amendment creates a pilot  program that will ensure that emerging private-sector companies will  have a seat at the table and will be able to provide monitoring and  forecast data, which the Federal Government can purchase and utilize in  their space weather forecasts.   I thank the sponsors of this legislation for their work on this  important topic. I ask my colleagues to support this bill, and I  reserve the balance of my time, Madam Speaker.                                time  1230     Madam Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Alabama (Mr. Brooks).    Madam Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I yield myself  such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I, again, would like to thank the sponsors of this  legislation for their hard work on this important topic.   I encourage all my colleagues to support this bill, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 4979, the Rural STEM  Education Act. I am pleased to be leading this important bipartisan  bill and would like to thank Congressman McAdams, Congressman Baird,  Congresswoman Johnson, and the other 43 Members of Congress who  cosponsored this bill for their support.   Now more than ever, America's prosperity and security depend on an  effective, inclusive science, technology, engineering, math, and  computer science workforce, or STEM.   Nationally, 80 percent of the fastest growing occupations depend upon  mastery of STEM skills. The number of STEM jobs is growing three times  faster than non-STEM jobs. Over the next decade, the STEM shortage is  anticipated to reach 1 million positions, according to the Bureau of  Labor Statistics.   To succeed in this job market, our students need to be equipped with  solid skills in science and engineering.   Meeting this demand starts in the classroom. With STEM education  becoming so fundamental to success in any industry, finding ways to  improve the quality of STEM learning everywhere is of critical  importance.   Over 9 million students in the United States, nearly 20 percent of  the K-12 population, attend rural schools. In Oklahoma, that number is  even higher. One-third of our students attend rural schools.   These students face a number of barriers to accessing high-quality  STEM learning, including a shortage of trained science and math  teachers, single teachers teaching multiple grade levels, a lack of  access to advanced STEM courses, and few local university and industry  partners.   Since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, we have seen even  further proof that rural students are at a disadvantage, given the  unreliability or nonexistent broadband access many must deal with while  currently distance learning.   The Rural STEM Education Act supports research and development  activities to improve our understanding of the challenges rural  communities are facing in providing and sustaining quality STEM  education programs and take steps to address them.   H.R. 4979 helps develop best practices for accessing and using  computer-based and online STEM education courses. It will help schools  combine online STEM education with hands-on training and  apprenticeships, to give students both theoretical and practical  understanding of science and math skills.   This bill will also take steps to address one of the great key  obstacles to rural STEM education: reduced connectivity and, in  particular, the lack of broadband access. Of the 21 million Americans  who lack access to broadband, the majority live in rural areas. With  the increase in online learning, we need to prioritize connectivity for  all students.   This bill directs the National Institutes of Standards and Technology  to establish a prize competition to stimulate innovations in  technologies to deploy broadband connectivity to underserved rural  communities.   It also establishes a working group to set key research priorities  for improving broadband access so rural communities can enjoy the same  connectedness as the rest of the country.   This bill includes a number of provisions to help provide rural  educators with the tools they need to be successful, both in the  classroom and online.   It supports opportunities for rural educators to refresh and enhance  their own STEM knowledge, such as training in computer science and  research opportunities at Federal laboratories and universities. These  experiences provide rural educators with high-quality STEM skills and  practices they can take back to their classrooms and pass on to their  students.   Lastly, the major focus of the bill is broadening the participation  of rural  [[Page H4467]]  students in STEM. One way we can do this is by emphasizing place-based  learning, which gives students direct access to the STEM knowledge in  their communities and local environments.   Place-based learning connects students to the science that is right  outside their doors, whether it is studying animal science with FFA,  learning about local ecosystems out on the prairies or in forests, or  developing the technological skills required to operate increasingly  complex and computerized farm equipment.   That direct experience engages students and helps them understand  that STEM skills matter to everyone, not just scientists in white lab  coats.   Taken together, the measures in this bill will dramatically improve  rural STEM education. I believe rural areas represent one of the  greatest yet most underutilized opportunities for talented students to  enhance the United States' future STEM workforce.   I am pleased this bill has gained the endorsement of the STEM  Education Coalition, the Afterschool Alliance, Battelle and STEM-X,  National Science Teaching Association, American Chemical Society,  American Geophysical Union, Microsoft, Girl Scouts of the USA, National  FFA Organization, and Association of Public and Land-grant  Universities.   I again would like to thank Chairwoman Johnson, Representative  McAdams, Representative Baird, and their staff for working with me on  this bill.   I strongly encourage my colleagues to vote ``yes'' to better STEM  education for America's rural students, and I reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Indiana (Mr. Baird).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I might  consume.   In closing, I again want to thank Chairwoman Johnson, Representative  McAdams, Representative Baird, and their staff for working with me on  this bill.   I am grateful to my colleagues for helping me move this forward in a  bipartisan way. I want rural students to have every opportunity to  compete and contribute STEM skills both to their communities and to the  national workforce.   The Rural STEM Education Act gives teachers better tools to teach  science and math, leverages local resources to engage students in key  subjects, and addresses the lack of broadband access in rural  communities.   Madam Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support this bill, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4990, the Election  Technology Research Act of 2020. I am proud to join Representatives  Sherrill and Gonzalez and Chairwoman Johnson as an original cosponsor  of this bill.   The security and integrity of elections is fundamental to American  democracy and should not be a partisan issue. To that end, this  bipartisan bill takes necessary and appropriate steps to update  research activities at the National Science Foundation and the National  Institute of Standards and Technology to promote the security and the  modernization of U.S. voting systems.   The bill also establishes an election systems center of excellence at  NIST to foster collaborations between NIST, universities, and State and  local election officials to address election security challenges.   The U.S. Constitution vests the responsibility of administering  elections with State and local governments, and we in Congress should  respect the boundaries of this well-established system of federalism.   However, the Federal Government has an important role to play in  providing guidance and assistance to States on election systems. The  Federal Government can and should work closely with States and local  government officials to deal with foreign and domestic cyber threats.   This bill provides the research tools to do just that, and it does so  without imposing costly or burdensome mandates on States. Instead, this  bill leverages an established system to provide voluntary guidelines to  State and local election officials to use as they see fit.   I appreciate Chairwoman Johnson and her staff for working with us to  produce a good, bipartisan bill. I urge my colleagues to support it,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Ohio (Mr. Gonzalez).    Madam Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Davis), a fellow ranking member on a full committee and  always an insightful individual.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I thank Chairwoman Johnson, Chairwoman Sherrill, and Representative  Anthony Gonzalez for working together in a bipartisan manner to produce  measured legislation that will help secure and modernize America's  voting systems.   I encourage my colleagues to support this bill, and I yield back the  balance of my time.
