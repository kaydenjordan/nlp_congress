 Madam Speaker, I rise today to stand with the people of  Israel and their right to defend themselves against the Iranian-funded  terrorist groups, Hamas and Hezbollah.   Last week, these terrorists began firing missiles into Israel and  killing Israeli citizens. Since these unjustified attacks started, we  have seen Members of Congress and the media rush to declare a moral  equivalence between Israel and its attackers.   Let me be very clear: There is no moral equivalence between the State  of Israel and terrorists who shield themselves with children, target  civilian  [[Page H2407]]  centers for missile attacks, and openly desire to destroy the Jewish  people.   Israel is a sovereign, democratic Nation and is entitled to defend  itself. The indiscriminate violence against Israeli citizens must end.  Time and time again, Israel has proven itself to be America's strongest  ally, and we must have Israel's back in their time of need. I urge my  fellow Members of Congress and the Biden administration to stand firm  with Israel against those who seek its destruction.                            ____________________
