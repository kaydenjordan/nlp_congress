 Madam Speaker, I rise in outrage due to recent  attacks on women's reproductive rights and now, as we have seen, maybe  plans to attack other fundamental rights.   Republicans are using this leaked opinion as fuel to take their  extreme policies even further. I say to my fellow colleagues, if  Republicans overturn Roe, they will take aim at other privacy rights,  such as same-sex marriage and access to contraception.   Indeed, in Texas, Governor Greg Abbott now wants to overturn a  Supreme Court decision that ensures public education for immigrant  children.   In West Virginia, a white nationalist wants to take aim at Brown v.  Board of Education, which outlawed racial segregation in public  schools.   I ask you, what comes next?   Madam Speaker, we are fighting to protect a woman's freedom to make  her own healthcare decisions. But we will also be fighting the fight of  all fights to protect all our freedoms.   Don't mess with women's reproductive rights.                            ____________________
