 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember  David Freyling, a dear friend and dedicated patriot who passed away  over the weekend.   Dave's entire life was about serving others. He served in the Army  from 1956 to 1966 with the 82nd Airborne in Berlin during the  construction of the Berlin Wall, and was later stationed in Korea,  where he helped build roads, bridges, and other infrastructure.   Dave dedicated his life to fellow veterans. He was the chairman of  the Help for Heroes fund and the Veterans Assistance Commission of  Macon County for 13 years, and many knew him for his selflessness in  getting veterans the help they need. For many years, he voluntarily  drove veterans to the Danville VA hospital nearly 90 miles away, taking  389 total trips and racking up over 70,000 miles, to shuttle his fellow  veterans to the VA to get the healthcare they deserved.   He was active in his church, volunteered with the American Red Cross,  and was a prominent member of both the American Legion and the Macon  County Honor Guard. He served on the Decatur Civic Center Board and  worked tirelessly to bring to life the World War II Memorial in town,  which was finally completed in 2012, thanks to Dave's hard work. By all  accounts, Dave was a true example of patriotism and service.   Words cannot express how much he will be missed. He made an  immeasurable impact on the lives of veterans and the entire Decatur  community. I extend my deepest condolences to his wife, Jeannine, and  to all those who knew Dave. I am so glad he got to watch the fireworks  before he passed.                            ____________________
