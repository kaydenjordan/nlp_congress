 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that when the House  adjourns today, it adjourn to meet at 9 a.m. tomorrow.    Mr. Speaker, I take a moment and praise the work of the  International WeLoveU Foundation, which I am proud to say is located in  Oradell, New Jersey.   The organization and supporters are dedicated to improving the lives  and conditions of people across the globe. They focus on the belief  that we are all human beings, and when we help each other out, we bring  out the best in all of us.   Last July, I attended one of their events, a walkathon in Jersey  City's Liberty State Park. They raised $50,000 to support disaster  relief in Mozambique. Basically, the country was hit by two hurricanes  in 2 months that devastated towns, farms, and homes.   Most people did not even know it happened, so I was impressed to see  2,500 people donate their time and effort to help people thousands of  miles away. But that is what the WeLoveU Foundation does and continues  to do:  [[Page H7639]]  help those less fortunate during times of crisis.   I am proud to support the work that they do and hope to praise more  organizations like them in the future.                            ____________________
