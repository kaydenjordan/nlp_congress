 Madam Speaker, today I rise in recognition of Veterans  Day to honor the brave souls from the Virgin Islands and throughout the  Nation for their selfless and valiant service.   In the Virgin Islands, our veterans' spirit of service is a beacon of  inspiration. Yet, the very liberties they fight tirelessly for are  mirrored by the injustices they confront upon returning home: the  inequitable access to healthcare and benefits they deserve. This  disparity is more than an oversight. It is an egregious mistreatment of  our Nation's heroes and has been a driving force for my relentless  advocacy to rectify the wrong.   That is why last year I supported the landmark PACT Act guaranteeing  veterans harmed by burn pits or other toxins to receive automatic VA  healthcare and benefits. I am proud for the successful advocacy for an  amendment requiring the GAO to study the state of access and barriers  and benefits to veterans living in the territories.   Madam Speaker, we owe our veterans more than gratitude. We owe them  action. It is time to deliver on our promise.                            ____________________
