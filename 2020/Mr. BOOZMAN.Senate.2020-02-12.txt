 Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the  newest members of the Arkansas Business Hall of Fame.   Arkansas native Olivia Farrell is a shining example of what a  lifetime of hard work and devotion looks like. After graduating from  the University of Arkansas at Little Rock in 1978, she joined the  Arkansas Writers Project, selling ads for the Arkansas Times. Shortly  after, the Writers Project also created Arkansas Business, which was  later purchased by Farrell and became the Arkansas Business Publishing  Group, where she served as CEO.   Not only did Farrell find personal success in business, but she also  sought to help bring more women into the business community. As such,  Farrell created and promoted an annual magazine highlighting the top  100 women in Arkansas. This list encouraged companies and their  stakeholders to bring more women into their ranks. Furthermore, she  created the Women's Foundation of Arkansas to promote increased  investment in women's education, business opportunities, and  philanthropy.   Some of her most notable awards include being inducted in the  Arkansas Women's Hall of Fame, as well as being the recipient of the  Business and Professional Leader of the Year award by the Rotary Club  of Little Rock. Her leadership and kindness have been the subject of  much deserved praise.   Reynie Rutledge was born in Smackover, AR. Growing up in a small  Arkansas town taught him the value of hard work and doing the right  thing. He earned an undergraduate degree in industrial engineering from  the University of Arkansas prior to earning his MBA in 1973. Upon  leaving school, he was hired as a loan officer at Worthen Bank in  Little Rock. A few years later, Rutledge took a gamble in purchasing  First Security Bank, which at the time had only three branches and $46  million in assets. Under his leadership, the small Searcy, AR, bank  grew into a $5.9 billion dollar holding company with over 77 locations  across 17 counties and 34 communities, with more than 1,000 employees  across the State.   Rutledge has always given back to the Natural State. He has been an  active member of Searcy's First United Methodist Church since 1977 and  also serves on the Searcy Water Board. Rutledge has also served as a  member of the University of Arkansas Board of Trustees, chairman of the  selection committee of the Arkansas Business Hall of Fame, and chairman  of the Arkansas Bankers Association. Some of the many accolades he has  received over his career include the University of Arkansas 2000  Volunteer of the Year, 2012 University of Arkansas Distinguished Alumni  Award, and 2011 Lifetime Achievement Award from the Walton College of  Business.   Gerald B. Alley was born in Pine Bluff, AR. As the son of a  businessowner, he saw firsthand the hard work and commitment required  to produce a thriving business that maximizes a person's ability to  give back to their community. After finishing his education and working  for his father, Alley enrolled at the University of Arkansas at the age  of 16, majoring in finance. After graduating from the University of  Arkansas, he continued his education at Southern Methodist University,  where he earned his MBA.   Along with the help of his brother, Troy, Jr., he started Con-Real.  Under his leadership, Con-Real built the largest parking garage in  Texas. Additionally, the company helped build schools, stores, and  other facilities that provided entertainment and essential services to  the community. As Alley gained more experience as a business leader, he  expanded Con-Real's services and launched another firm focused on  medical construction which represented the largest medical system in  the U.S. Today, Con-Real offers a multitude of services ranging from  real estate to technology and innovation while consistently promoting  minority firms.   Aside from his business ventures, Alley serves on the executive  advisory board at the Walton College of Business at the University of  Arkansas. Additionally, he is on the advisory board at the Cox School  of Business at Southern Methodist University and is also a member of  the board of trustees at the school. After years of business and  philanthropic success, he has proven to be a role model for anybody who  values dedication, hard work and perseverance.   Charles Nabholz was born near Squirrel Hill, AR. Hailing from a  farming family, he was instilled with a strong work ethic that served  him well. Though the family business began in 1949, he began his career  with Nabholz Construction after graduating from Conway's St. Joseph  High School in 1954.   He began his career with the company as a laborer. Eventually,  Nabholz founded and managed Con-Ark builders, a company that would  later merge with Nabholz Construction. After a brief stint out of the  State, he returned to serve as Governor Frank White's director of State  Building Services. He continued to serve as a valuable asset outside of  the State government, helping to create Nabholz Properties and serving  as chairman of the board for the Nabholz Group in 2000. In 2014, he was  named chairman emeritus of Nabholz Group.   Charles Nabholz is an extremely involved member of his community. Not  only is he a member of the several Arkansas trade associations, but he  actively participates in or has previously contributed his time to  several groups such as the Conway Regional Medical Center Foundation,  the Conway Chamber of Commerce, and the Arkansas Research Alliance.  Among the many honors he has received are an award for Leadership in  Free Enterprise and the Distinguished Citizen Award.   I congratulate each of these honorees for their valuable  contributions to Arkansas and the industries they represent. Our State  is certainly better off because of the work each has done to advance  their own careers, as well as the companies they have led. This honor  is a fitting way to acknowledge them and memorialize their legacies in  the Natural State's business community.                            ____________________
