 Mr. Speaker, I rise today on a saddened occasion to talk  about a son, a brother, a husband, father, soldier, agent, and friend,  truly beloved by so many whose lives he touched.   Alberto Bhoge was born February 12, 1984, and honorably served in the  U.S. Army Reserves from February 2010 to September 2014.   During his time serving honorably in uniform, he deployed to  Afghanistan in April 2010 until February 2011 with C Company 478th  Civil Affairs Battalion.   If serving wasn't enough to dedicate your life and be willing to die  for this Nation, he took his uniform off and continued his service in  the Federal Bureau of Investigation where he protected our country  through his civil service.   Alberto passed on January 17, 2023, and is survived by his wife, who  also serves with the FBI, and their two children.   Mr. Speaker, I ask that everyone here today join me in praying for  his family, friends, and all those who cared for Berto. We love you.  God bless. Airborne.                            ____________________
