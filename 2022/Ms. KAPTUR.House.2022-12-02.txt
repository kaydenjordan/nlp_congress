 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in solidarity with the people  of Ukraine and President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who recently honored the  over 14 million of his countrymen in Ukraine who died during the  Holodomor, the Soviet-enforced famine that purposefully starved Ukraine  in the early 1930s to subjugate them and politically control them.   Then, as now, the tyrants of the Soviet Union, Josef Stalin, and  Russia used food and famine as a weapon of war. Innocent civilians are  not unintended victims but, rather, specific targets of horrific  brutality to rule over them.   Russia's and Putin's aim in this modern era, waging a war on Ukraine,  is to kill, maim, starve, freeze, and torture as many men, women,  elderly, and children as possible.   These are war crimes. Putin and his enablers are war criminals. But  the courageous Ukrainian people have not broken, they have not bent.  They fight on with great valor.   As Ukraine leads this righteous fight for her liberty, her  sovereignty, and her very survival, it is incumbent upon all free  nations to aid her in her time of need.   Ukraine, America stands with you. The world stands with you. We pray  and fight for the day that your home will be a peaceful, enterprising,  and virtuous one again.                            ____________________
