 Could we have a bit of order, please?    Mr. President, so in a few minutes, we are going to  proceed on the nomination of an outstanding public servant, Margaret M.  Garnett, whom I was proud to recommend to President Biden as district  judge for the Southern District of New York. She is a proud resident of  Brooklyn, a brilliant legal thinker, and someone whose entire life  story has been defined by public service.   She has had more than a decade of experience prosecuting cases,  ranging from murder to robbery, to financial fraud, and more, as part  of the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York.  Fifteen times, she has tried a case all the way to jury verdict,  including what was, at the time, the largest tax fraud case in U.S.  history.   But Ms. Garnett is also a fierce defender of the rights of the  accused. She was instrumental in exonerating five individuals wrongly  convicted of murder.   She once said that ``our job is to do justice, and that is a much  broader task and quest than racking up convictions.''   Our courts need more public servants like Margaret Garnett, described  by her colleagues not just as brilliant but wise, not just determined  but kind, not just an outstanding lawyer but a true friend and defender  of our system.   If anyone--anyone--has mastered the recipe for serving as an  excellent jurist, it is certainly Margaret Garnett. So I was eager to  recommend her to the President for the Federal bench, and I am proud to  support the nomination of Margaret Garnett today and encourage my  colleagues to support her as well.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I enter a motion to reconsider.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to the consideration of  Executive Calendar No. 379, Micah W.J. Smith to be United States  District Judge for the District of Hawaii.    I suggest the absence of a quorum.
