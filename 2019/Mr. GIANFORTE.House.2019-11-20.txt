 Mr. Speaker, it is time. Actually, it is past time. It  is past time for Congress to pass the United States-Mexico-Canada  Agreement.   Today, I am pleased to join with my colleague and friend, Senator  Steve Daines, to draw attention to the USMCA's importance to Montana.   President Trump and his trade negotiators have done a great job  negotiating this trade deal. USMCA will secure open access to markets  in Mexico and Canada, markets critical to Montana farmers, ranchers,  manufacturers, and businesses.   USMCA will bring over $68 billion in new economic growth. USMCA will  create 176,000 new American jobs. USMCA helps family farmers and  ranchers, which is why 1,000 ag groups from across the country have  endorsed it. USMCA increases agricultural exports by $2 billion a year.  USMCA supports American workers.   Speaker, USMCA is a win for Montana and America. But here we are, 355  days, almost a full year, since President Trump signed USMCA, and the  deal has gone nowhere in the House.   So, what is the holdup? The Speaker has stalled since the deal was  announced. She objected to it. Those objections were addressed, yet  here we are.   The Speaker says she is on a path to yes on USMCA. A path to yes,  however, isn't a yes. Farmers, ranchers, manufacturers, and business  owners deserve certainty, not just a path to yes and more delays.   Unfortunately, just yesterday, Politico reported USMCA faces another  delay because of House leadership--another delay. The House has 13 days  left this year, 13 days to get this deal done. It is up to Congress to  act.   Speaker, the needless delays must end. The Trump administration has  done its job and negotiated an agreement that works for Montana and our  country. It is time for Congress to do its job.   I urge House leaders to give farmers, ranchers, manufacturers, and  business owners the certainty they need. I urge House leaders to move  forward with USMCA to create jobs, increase paychecks, and grow our  economy.   Let's consider USMCA. Let's vote on USMCA. Let's ratify USMCA.                            ____________________
