 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Dr. Judy Genshaft for  her 19 years of service as president of my alma mater, the University  of South Florida.   During her tenure, she emphasized research. That commitment has been  a major part of why USF has been rated as one of the Nation's top 25  public universities for research.   Her advocacy for technology had a direct impact on the city of Tampa,  which has grown into one of the most successful tech hubs in the world.   Under her leadership, USF's endowment nearly doubled; its 4-year  graduation rate tripled; and now, all USF students graduate at the same  rate, regardless of their race, ethnicity, or family income.   On a personal level, she is also an immensely generous donor, having  helped fund the USF Honors College and then made an additional gift to  endow its deanship.   More impressive than these numbers are Judy's contagious energy and  her genuine concern for her students. She regularly worked 12-hour days  and still made time to talk with students whenever she saw them.   Mr. Speaker, Judy is a woman clearly guided by purpose. I am so  grateful for everything that she has done and continues to do to make  my alma mater, the University of South Florida, better for our students  and our city.                            ____________________
