 Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for  yielding.   Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the amendment by Mr. Olson. It is  a bipartisan effort. But it is also an effort to save lives, because in  2015 with the Memorial Day flood we had 7 people lose their lives; and,  in 2016, with the tax day flood, we had 8 people lose their lives; and,  of course, Hurricane Harvey claimed 68 lives across the State of Texas.   This is not only about dollars and cents, it is about saving lives,  and I encourage my colleagues to support it.    Mr. Chair, I thank all of my colleagues who  have been associated with this amendment.   Mr. Chair, this has been a bipartisan effort. Mr. Culberson and I  have worked together not only on this effort, but also to serve people.   We do have people who are still living in temporary shelter in  Houston and we have people who are still awaiting FEMA's assistance.  With some 4.7 million people in the area having been impacted, it is  exceedingly important that this amendment be adopted.   Mr. Chair, I am appreciative that the chairman has indicated his  support of it, and I thank Mr. Culberson, Mr. McCaul, and other  colleagues for bringing this amendment to the floor.
