 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding and for  his great presentation today.   Today, we are on the floor of the House where the other side has  turned this Chamber where slavery was abolished, where Medicare and  Social Security and everything were instituted, into a puppet show.   Do you know what? The puppeteer, Donald Trump, is shining a light on  the strings. You look miserable. You look miserable.   The only advantage to all of this is that instead of reversing what  we did on the IRA to save the planet or reversing what we did to reduce  the cost of prescription drugs, we are wasting time.
