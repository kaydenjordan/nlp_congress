 Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the chairman for his great  bipartisan work on this package in S. 488, as well as the ranking  member, Ms. Waters, for her bipartisanship.   This is a package that takes the finer work, not just over the last 2  years, but work over the last 4 to 6 years of Chairman Hensarling's  leadership, puts them together where we have had Democrat, Republican,  House, and Senate agreement on into a package that can hopefully make  our markets and our economy work better.   I want to thank the chairman and the ranking member for including in  this package our international insurance standards bill. This is a bill  that was on the floor last week. It passed with a unanimous vote, which  was fantastic. What we are trying to do is basically make sure that we  maintain in international agreements our State-based model of  insurance, that that doesn't get undermined. If we are going to  undermine State-based insurance, it should come through this  institution and not through an international agreement.
