 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  to insert extraneous material on H.R. 840.    Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Chair, I rise in strong support of H.R. 840, the Veterans'  Access to Child Care Act.  [[Page H1419]]    We ask our servicemembers to risk their lives in service of our  country, and in return, we promise to provide healthcare and benefits  so they can live happy, healthy, and successful lives, and provide for  their families.   As our veteran population becomes increasingly diverse, as the number  of LGBTQ and minority and women veterans goes up, we must ensure every  veteran has the opportunity to access their healthcare and benefits.  Addressing underserved veterans is a pillar of my VA 2030 vision, which  will drive our work on the Committee on Veterans' Affairs in the 116th  Congress.    I proudly chose Congresswoman Brownley's Veterans' Access to Child  Care Act as the very first bill our committee would bring to the House  floor because it addresses a sometimes overlooked group of veterans:  veterans who are parents and caregivers to young children.   Providing cost-free, safe, and convenient healthcare so that veterans  can see a mental health provider for treatment of post-traumatic  stress, military sexual trauma, cancer resulting from exposure to Agent  Orange, spinal cord injury, or even treatment for drug or substance  abuse is the least we can do to make their lives easier so they, in  turn, can be loving parents and caregivers to the children who depend  on them.   Under my leadership of the most diverse and talented Committee on  Veterans' Affairs in the history of this Chamber, underserved veterans,  especially women veterans, minorities, LGBTQ veterans, and veterans  from our tribal communities, homeless veterans, and even deported  veterans will be a top priority.   We will work together to shatter the barriers and structural  challenges underserved veterans face in this country they selflessly  served by first attending to their most basic and essential needs:  healthcare.   Ms. Brownley, the chair of the Veterans' Affairs Subcommittee on  Health and the head of the Task Force on Women Veterans, has been a  tireless advocate for veterans since being elected to Congress. Her  bill makes an already successful and popular pilot program permanent, a  program that helps mothers, fathers, grandparents, and caregivers who  need their VA healthcare, but struggle to find safe and convenient  childcare or struggle to afford the high cost of childcare for their  children.   A veteran should never be made to choose between caring for their  children and their health. This bill will make sure veterans will no  longer have to make this terrible choice.   The Caregivers and Veterans Omnibus Health Services Act first  authorized the pilot program we are making permanent today. Under the  pilot, VA could provide childcare services to eligible veterans seeking  mental healthcare, intensive mental healthcare services, and other  intensive healthcare services that require veterans to travel to VA  hospitals, clinics, or vet centers for regular or frequent  appointments.   The first childcare program started at the VA Medical Center in  Buffalo, New York, in October of 2011. Within 2 years, VA expanded the  program to Northport, New York, and American Lake, Washington, and  later brought childcare to Dallas, Texas.   The 2-year pilot program was meant to end in September 2013, but  Congress has reauthorized the program for the past 6 years due to its  success and popularity.   Since the beginning, over 10,000 children have used the childcare  pilot program, and as more veterans and their children use the program,  the cost decreased.   Last Congress, the legislation authorizing this program passed  unanimously, and now we will have an opportunity to improve this  already great bill with amendments we will be considering today and  tomorrow. I am optimistic this bill will pass with the same bipartisan,  unanimous support.   So I am very excited to work with Dr. Roe, the ranking member of our  committee, on this bill and on future bipartisan legislation.   Before I give him a chance to share his thoughts on this bill, I  would like to share one of the anecdotes we received from a social  worker who helps homeless veterans under the Department of Housing and  Urban Development-Veterans Affairs Supportive Housing Program,  otherwise known as the HUD-VASH program: ``Just this week a female  veteran with a 3-year-old son discussed childcare with me. She was so  relieved it was still open, because she scheduled a gynecological  appointment that she was going to cancel because she had no one to care  for her son.   ``This is a veteran who came to us homeless with a newborn and  unmanaged diabetes. She is now diligently following her medical regimen  and consistently makes appointments. She is stably housed in the  community, enjoying being a mother, attending college, and working  part-time.   ``I do not think we would have been able to stabilize her life  without the support of childcare to allow her to get to her  appointments and receive the treatment, medication, recommendations,  and care that have helped her succeed.''                                time  1515    Now, as chairman of this committee, I look forward to sharing more  stories of veterans throughout this country whose lives have been  improved because of access to VA healthcare.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Chair, I thank the gentleman for his support of the bill. I  would say, with regard to the amendments, we would have entertained  more amendments. I would have been happy to do so had they been  germane, and we would have been glad to entertain them, but they were  not.   Before I yield to Ms. Brownley, the sponsor of this legislation, I  include in the Record a letter of support from the Easterseals.                                                    Easterseals,                                                   February 6, 2019.      Hon. Julia Brownley,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative Brownley: Easterseals is pleased to       again support your Veterans' Access to Child Care Act       legislation to increase the availability of child care for       veterans who are receiving services or treatment at a U.S.       Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) medical center.        Easterseals is a national network of more than 70 nonprofit       organizations who deliver local services to help children and       adults with disabilities, veterans, older adults and others       to live independently and to fully participate in their       communities. Easterseals is a leading provider of inclusive       child care and early education and development in the United       States, providing thousands of young children with and       without disabilities with high-quality child care.        Easterseals understands how important access to high-      quality child care is to allow parents, including veterans,       to go to work and to meet their own health care needs. That       is why we supported the establishment of a pilot program at       the VA to provide child care at select VA medical centers       around the country that qualified veterans could use while at       a medical appointment or while receiving medical services.       The program has been particularly helpful for female       veterans, nearly 30 percent of whom have children living at       home. A recent VA report found that 42 percent of female       veterans who use the VA reported that finding child care to       attend a medical appointment was hard or very hard. When       asked about solutions, more than three of out five female       veterans surveyed said on-site childcare would be ``very       helpful.''        The Veterans' Access to Child Care Act would expand and       make permanent the VA Child Care Pilot Program. The       legislation would make available a stipend, to cover the full       cost of child care provided by a licensed, on-site or private       child care center while the veteran receives services,       including travel time back and forth to the facility. The       legislation is a common-sense next step toward improving       access to VA health care to veterans.        Easterseals is pleased to support the Veterans' Access to       Child Care Act. In addition, Easterseals stands ready to       partner with the VA to provide child care assistance while       they attend to their well-being and medical care. Thank you       for your leadership on this important issue.            Sincerely,                                                 Maynard Friesz,                                           Assistant Vice President,                                 Government Relations, Easterseals.    This bill is also supported by the American Legion, the  Veterans of Foreign Wars, the Vietnam Veterans of America, and other  veterans service organizations. So I am pleased to say that we have  heard the VSOs weigh in on Ms. Brownley's legislation.   Madam Chair, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from California  (Ms. Brownley), the author of the bill.    Madam Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New  York (Mr. Higgins).    Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   We have the data to show how access to healthcare services improves  and saves lives, but I think it is important that we also hear from the  veterans and the providers whose lives have been improved by this  program.   I would like to share another story from a childcare staffer in  Buffalo, New York.   ``Buffalo also has a World War II veteran, now 97 years old, who  cares for his great-granddaughter. He heard of the service, stopped in  to see the facility and ask questions to verify he felt `safe' in  leaving her in their care. As primary caretaker for this child, he is  so pleased to be able to attend his appointments at his `elderly age'  and keep his family close.''   Let me also add, I want to address the reservation, although the  ranking member has stated his general support for the bill, but this  reservation about the legislation, H.R. 840, lacking a pay-for that was  included in last session's legislation, and the pay-for that they said  was necessary this time around.   I want to state that H.R. 840 simply makes permanent a program that  we, as a Congress, have reauthorized six times since 2013. For none of  those six times was the issue of a pay-for really germane. In fact, the  CBO has never required that we do it.   The pay-for that the gentleman keeps speaking of will not pay for  this program. It will simply take money from veterans and send it to  the Treasury, and the VA, still under discretionary funds, will still  have to find the money to pay for it.   Each of the six times we authorized this program, not once did my  colleagues insist on a pay-for. Only when we are introducing  legislation to make it a permanent program does this suddenly pop up as  a concern.   In reality, even if we included the pay-for, the Treasury wouldn't  see the funds for nearly a decade.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, just in response, the pay-for to which the  gentleman from Tennessee is referring is under mandatory spending,  which would not actually pay for the program. It would be returned to  the Treasury, and the discretionary funds simply--there is no pay-for  out of the discretionary funds. It is coming out of the mandatory side.  It is a very illusory device.   So I want to reiterate that each time this pilot program was  reauthorized under the majority, never was there a demand on their part  that there be a pay-for.   Madam Chair, I have no further speakers. I am prepared to close, and  I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I wholly support Ms. Brownley's bill, H.R.  840. I urge my colleagues to join me in its passage, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I  support this amendment because, by clarifying that community-based  outpatient clinics are covered under the bill, we are ensuring that  veterans seeking healthcare services at any VA facility are able to  receive no-cost childcare.    Madam Chair, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment, even though I am not opposed to the amendment.    Madam Chair, I rise in support of this amendment to  ensure that our taxpayer dollars are spent according to Congress'  intent.   I agree that childcare should only be provided to veterans when they  are using the childcare to attend their healthcare appointments.   I thank the gentlewoman for working with me to make this amendment  bipartisan and ensure it is clear to the VA that they cannot revoke  this benefit from veterans for missing an appointment.   The intent of this amendment is not to be an incentive to access  care. It is simply to make it easier for veterans to make it to their  appointments. It will be up to us as lawmakers to keep close oversight  over this program and many others at the Department of Veterans  Affairs.   This committee will keep close watch over the resources we provide  and the programs we authorize at the VA. We will hold VA leaders  accountable when these programs are not carried out according to  congressional intent, or made in a haphazard and uninformed manner, or  without the purpose of doing what is best for veterans.   I look forward to working with the gentlewoman and my colleagues on  this committee to oversee the successful execution of this childcare  program so any eligible veterans who need childcare can get it.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from the  Northern Mariana Islands (Mr. Sablan).    Madam Chair, I yield the gentleman an additional 30  seconds.    Madam Chair, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Let me say for the record that I believe, if a veteran is receiving  care at a facility, in this case in Hawaii on travel from Saipan, that  the intent of the legislation would provide that childcare for the time  necessary for that veteran, and it would be at a VA facility. It would  be childcare at a VA facility in Hawaii, in this particular case.   Madam Chair, in closing, I do urge that my colleagues support the  amendment by Mrs. Radewagen, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   I support this amendment because veterans are not immune from the  opioid epidemic. They are not immune to alcoholism or substance abuse.  When a veteran is also suffering from post-traumatic stress or other  serious health conditions that may have caused dependency on a  substance, we should do everything we can to make sure that veteran can  receive care.   I thank the gentleman for offering this very important amendment, and  I urge all my colleagues to support it.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment,  which would prevent additional VA hospitals and clinics from providing  onsite childcare to veterans receiving care at VA hospitals and  clinics.   VA only has four childcare sites throughout the VA system, and this  amendment would prevent further expansion of the program by preventing  a VA hospital or clinic from even doing basic things to provide  convenient childcare, things like covering electrical sockets to make a  facility safe for young children or putting up fencing around the  playground so children can play safely.   As our colleague, Ms. Shalala, reminded us during the Rules Committee  meeting yesterday, and as many parents of young children quickly learn,  most private childcare facilities do not allow children to be  temporarily dropped off for just a few hours. Childcare facilities need  to know whether children are up to date on their vaccinations, have  food allergies or other medical conditions to provide safe care.   This means VA must have the flexibility to determine how best to  execute this program at each of its facilities throughout the country.  If this means that it makes sense to build an onsite childcare center,  VA should not be barred from doing so.   I think this amendment was written without considering its effects,  which would limit further the expansion of the program and prevent  veterans from being able to access childcare and their healthcare when  they need it.   Any of us who have been on this committee long enough know that VA  has had trouble managing major construction projects. Admittedly, this  is what we know on the committee. And I am just as outraged as my  colleagues across the aisle when VA construction projects are  mismanaged and money is wasted. However, we are talking about minor  construction that, in many cases, will be necessary to expand this  program to all eligible veterans who need it.   There are other ways in which we can ensure the money for this  program is not mismanaged, and it doesn't need to be something as  drastic as preventing construction which will, in effect, prevent the  program's expansion.   Now, I hope to work with General Bergman and my other colleagues on  this committee to prevent mismanagement of construction projects,  procurement of the $16 billion electronic health record, and other  contracts and programs at the VA; and I pledge to work with the general  to ensure funds for construction of childcare facilities are not  wasted.   Mr. Chair, I must say that I have to urge my colleagues to oppose  this amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I would just wish to point out to the ranking  member of the Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee of the  Veterans' Affairs Committee, General Bergman, that his amendment would  not even allow for the repurposing of existing facility space that may  exist at a VA.   It is so rigid that it would be difficult to even put protective  electrical sockets in to prevent young children from electrocuting  themselves. Even minor construction would be prohibited by this  amendment.   I am pleased to know that the general is serving on the Oversight and  Investigations Subcommittee, and I do plan to work with the chairman,  Mr. Pappas of New Hampshire, and him to make sure that VA money is well  spent.   As I said, this amendment would simply prevent reasonable expansion  of this program, and that is something that members of this committee  and Members of this House would not want to see happen.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.   I support this amendment because, by clarifying that vet centers are  covered under the bill, we are ensuring that veterans seeking  healthcare at any VA facility are allowed access-at-no-cost childcare.   Vet centers are particularly attractive to veterans who are  uncomfortable in a more clinical setting, and they should be able to  seek childcare while they receive their mental health care at a VA vet  center.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment, even though I am not opposed to it.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of this amendment offered  by the gentleman from Kentucky, a new member on the Committee on  Veterans' Affairs, and I believe the co-chair of the Bourbon Caucus.   I agree that it is important to require that VA collect data on the  effectiveness of its childcare program so we can determine whether  veterans are better able to access their healthcare because of this  benefit.   As the veterans population becomes increasingly diverse, the VA of  the year 2030 that I envision must be prepared to provide healthcare to  women veterans, fathers of young children, stepparents and  grandparents, and to make sure veterans are able to access their  healthcare while also caring for their children.   Congress and VA need reliable data to inform these decisions and  determine whether other barriers to healthcare access exist for  veterans who care for young children. If the data from this study  demonstrates that veterans are less likely to miss appointments and  have better healthcare outcomes, it could be used to inform further VA  policy decisions to expand the program.   Mr. Chairman, I wholeheartedly support this bipartisan amendment, and  I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   I support this amendment because it will allow Congress to receive  the critical data and information it needs to determine how to expand  this program and the feasibility of expanding this program to  community-based outpatient clinics and VA centers, VA facilities that  are away from the main VA medical center campuses but critical for  veterans in rural areas to access their care.   While this bill specifically provides the no-cost childcare benefit  to veterans receiving care from the VA doctors, nurses, and VA  providers, I would like to work with my colleagues on the committee at  a future date on whether it may be feasible to provide no-cost  childcare to veterans receiving treatment from community providers, or  even look at ways we can provide incentives to community providers to  offer no-cost childcare on-site when they contract with the VA to  provide care to veterans.   I thank the gentleman for offering this important amendment. I  support it wholeheartedly, and I urge all my colleagues to do so as  well.    Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   I support this amendment because it provides an important  clarification that veterans receiving physical therapy for a service- connected disability will be able to access no-cost childcare.   When 50 percent of the veterans treated in VA facilities suffer from  chronic pain, physical therapy is a vital part of their treatment that  will reduce their need for prescribing opioids. We are in the midst of  an opioid epidemic in this country, and many of our veterans, sadly,  suffer from opioid addiction because they were prescribed these  powerful drugs to treat pain.   We should encourage other treatments like physical therapy, which can  address the root cause of pain, and make it easier for them to access  this care, which often requires multiple treatments over time.   I thank the gentleman for this important amendment, and I urge my  colleagues to support it.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition, even though I am not  opposed to the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of this amendment offered  by the gentleman from Illinois, which would ensure either parent to a  young child would be considered the primary caretaker for a child and,  therefore, eligible to receive the childcare benefit.   This amendment is necessary, especially in instances when a veteran  is receiving mental health services with a spouse. In instances like  this, a veteran could not rely on the spouse to watch a child if it was  important that a spouse participate in the treatment.   This will also relieve a significant administrative burden on VA and  the veteran: As long as a veteran is a parent to a child and in need of  childcare, that veteran would be eligible.   As lawmakers, we should strive to make sure that programs we  authorize are not confusing to VA and conduct oversight to ensure our  constituents are not confused when the VA rolls out a program. This  amendment will make it more clear to VA and veterans that, in families  where one or both parents are veterans, they are eligible for this  childcare benefit when receiving services from the VA.   I support this amendment, and I urge my colleagues to do the same.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Chairman, I want to make note that we just have gotten a release  that the VA has exceeded 1 million telehealth visits in fiscal year  2018. That one-year achievement represents a 19 percent increase over  the previous year. I congratulate the VA for that amazing achievement.   I want to make known my support for my good colleague from the  Northern Mariana Islands, Mr. Sablan's, amendment, because as VA  expands its footprint--and we have just seen how it has expanded its  footprint significantly--and that it remains at the forefront of  providing treatment via telemental health services, we need to ensure  that the VA has the ability to make those telehealth services as  successful as their in-person services.   In districts like Mr. Sablan's where veterans are separated from VA  healthcare services by the Pacific Ocean, telemental health is often  the only manner in which veterans are able to receive mental healthcare  from the VA.   Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman for offering this very important  amendment and I urge my colleagues to support it.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment, even though I am not opposed to the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the amendment offered  by the gentleman from Texas.   I think all of us can recount concerns raised by our constituents  about VA payment processing and late payments to healthcare providers.   Although I am not aware of any issues with respect to VA stipend  payments to childcare providers under VA's pilot program, I do think it  is important that VA report to Congress on whether it has experienced  problems with making timely payments and ask for the resources to  address payment processing.   The more data we collect from VA, the better we are able to determine  what solutions and resources are needed to improve VA programs and  services.   Mr. Chair, I do thank the gentleman for offering this amendment, and  I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I have no further speakers. I urge support  for the gentleman's amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I move that the Committee do now rise.   The motion was agreed to.   Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr.  Sean Patrick Maloney of New York) having assumed the chair, Mr. Johnson  of Georgia, Acting Chair of the Committee of the Whole House on the  state of the Union, reported that that Committee, having had under  consideration the bill (H.R. 840) to amend title 38, United States  Code, to direct the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to provide child care  assistance to veterans receiving certain medical services provided by  the Department of Veterans Affairs, had come to no resolution thereon.                            ____________________
