 Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to call up H.R.  471, the PAUSE Act, to protect all Americans from Biden's border  crisis.    Madam Speaker, two wrongs don't make a right.   Let me be clear: the riot on January 6 was wrong. Any violence on  that day should be punished, as I have said before.   But make no mistake: the Democrats' response is also wrong.   For 15 months, Democrats have used January 6 as a blank check to  trample on civil rights and congressional norms.   They broke every rule, violated every norm, bullied every skeptic  simply to hold on to power.   Let's be honest: this is a political show trial.   The committee has sent hundreds of subpoenas to private citizens for  phone records, bank records, and private communications.   To those who invoked their right to due process, Chairman Thompson  replied, `` . . . you are part and parcel guilty to what occurred.''   What a disgusting betrayal of the Constitution and the Bill of  Rights.   But think for a second about what Chairman Thompson is saying. If you  question his authority, if you disobey his demands, then you are a  criminal and you should be punished.   Congresswoman Luria, who is also on the select committee agrees. Last  week, she criticized Attorney General Garland for not putting her  political opponents in jail fast enough. She told Garland, `` . . . do  your job so we can do ours.''   I am sure some Members got real excited by that.   Democrats are using the power of the Federal Government to jail their  political opponents and threatening the Attorney General for not doing  it fast enough.   In their twisted view, this agreement is immoral. Dissent is a crime.  And they are to be obeyed without question.   Today's resolution is also about criminalizing dissent.   I can pause, Mr. Speaker, if he needs to listen more.    I was going to tell Mr. Speaker if the House is not in  order, and you need to listen to staff, I can pause.    No. I said to Mr. Speaker, the House is not in order.  [[Page H4223]]  There was no yielding. Your staff is continuing to communicate.   I think if I am speaking, the House should be in order. I don't know  if that is a criminal offense, too.    Mr. Speaker, I have the time. You have the gavel.    Mr. Speaker, the House is not in order. He has not been  recognized.    Mr. Speaker, for the House to be in order, should  people be in their seats, or should people be talking?    Mr. Speaker, the House is not in order. People are  standing and talking.    Mr. Speaker, today's resolution is about criminalizing  dissent.   Democrats are threatening to throw in jail a good man who has done  nothing but attempt to follow the law simply because he is President  Trump's closest aid.   Mr. Scavino does not deserve that.   He tried to cooperate with the select committee's requests. He sent  timely letters to the committee to clarify the vague scope of the  requested testimony.   He even offered to answer the committee's questions in writing, which  the committee's rules allow for, so he could balance cooperation with  fair concerns about executive privilege.   But the committee rejected every compromise. It is their way or no  way.   It took them 2 months to reply to Mr. Scavino's letter, then another  6 weeks. Then they rushed to hold him in contempt.   They also demanded the right to ask any question they wanted,  including on topics that have nothing to do with protecting the  Capitol, like the 25th Amendment.   Even if you agree that the select committee has a legislative  purpose, the fact is that purpose is not unlimited.   The committee must identify a specific nexus between its legislative  purpose and the information it wants. But it never identified the nexus  for the information it was seeking from Mr. Scavino.   And I bet it won't identify that nexus today either. Why? Because the  nexus does not exist.   Without it, their subpoena is invalid.   Congressional oversight is supposed to inform the legislative process  and must have a valid legislative purpose. It is not there so the swamp  can bully its political enemies.   Let's be honest. Mr. Scavino never acted like he was above the law,  and anyone who says otherwise is wrong. If anyone has acted like they  are above the law, it is the Select Committee.   Mr. Speaker, as I said earlier, two wrongs don't make a right.   The riot on January 6 was wrong, but Democrats' reaction to trample  American civil liberties is also wrong.   Do we really want to live in a country where politicians can seize  your phone records, compel your testimony, and ignore your rights  because they disagree with your politics?   Most Americans don't want to live in a country like that.   That happens in Russia, in Communist China, in North Korea. It should  never happen in America.   But, Mr. Speaker, under one-party rule, it is. But to all Americans,  when we take back the House, it will stop.                                time  1415
