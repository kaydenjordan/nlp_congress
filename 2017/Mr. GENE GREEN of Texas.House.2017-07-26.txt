 Mr. Chairman, I want to thank our ranking  member for yielding to me.   I rise in opposition to funding for President Trump's border wall. I  have visited the border of Texas and Mexico many times. Communities all  along and beyond the border in my home State of Texas are opposed to  this border wall.   Texas has deep and historic ties with our neighbor to the south,  Mexico. The people of Texas and Mexico share a pride. A clear majority  of our communities believe that the close ties between Texas and  Mexico--cultural, economic, linguistic--benefit both Texas and Mexico.   The construction of this ``big, fat, beautiful wall,'' to quote  President Trump, along a 2,000-mile-long U.S.-Mexico border is not only  unnecessary, but would be harmful to our border communities and  wildlife and natural habitats along the border, and become a symbol of  spite and division toward Mexico and its people.                                time  1700    Much of the border between the United States and Mexico is already  separated by the Rio Grande River, a clear natural obstacle between the  two countries. High traffic areas along our Southern border are further  separated by over 650 miles of pedestrian and vehicle fencing currently  on the border.   Congress has provided the Department of Homeland Security with robust  funding since the Department's creation to sharply increase the number  of Border Patrol officers and surveillance tools, including aerial  drones along the border.   As a result of these substantial investments by the American people,  the number of immigrants without authorization has steadily declined,  while the number of border apprehensions are near a 40-year low.   The $1.6 billion funded by taxpayer dollars included in this  legislation for the President's border wall should be directed for  genuine needs, like expanding education opportunities for our children,  rebuilding our Nation's aging infrastructure.   Mr. Chairman, I ask my colleagues, if given the opportunity, to amend  the legislation before this Chamber to remove the border wall funding.  Otherwise, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join me  in opposing the minibus appropriations bill.
