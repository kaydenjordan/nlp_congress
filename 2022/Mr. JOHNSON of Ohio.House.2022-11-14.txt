 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the legacy of  Corporal Howard Arthur Tibbs, one of our Nation's esteemed World War II  Tuskegee Airmen.   Corporal Howard Tibbs was no stranger to military service. The Tibbs  family's military history dates back to the Civil War, when Charles  Henry, Sr., of Salem, Ohio, the grandfather of Howard Tibbs, fought  with the Ohio Colored Troops in the Grand Army of the Republic.   In addition to dutifully serving our Nation's military efforts, the  Tibbs family has actively participated in other patriotic endeavors,  including helping to organize the local movement to guarantee the right  to vote for women and educating young people about the military,  cultural, and political contributions of Black Americans.   Corporal Howard Tibbs continued his family's legacy of duty, serving  our Nation when he joined the 99th Fighter Squadron and the 477th  Medium Composite Group during World War II.   In 2007, he posthumously received the Congressional Gold Medal in  recognition of his military contributions and bravery, both at home and  abroad.   Today, the House has the opportunity to honor Corporal Howard Arthur  Tibbs by passing H.R. 2473 and naming the Salem post office after him.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill.
