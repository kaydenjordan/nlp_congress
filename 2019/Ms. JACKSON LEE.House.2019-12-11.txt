 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for her  leadership. And having been the ranking member of the Immigration and  Citizenship Subcommittee over the years, I understand the momentous  task and the excellent work that has been done.   This bill does what Republicans have always asked: For immigrants to  work, for people to seek status; it provides status to hardworking  agricultural workers. It provides them a certified agricultural worker  status.   They undergo background checks and pass strict criminal and national  security bars. They have the opportunity to access the line to  citizenship. They don't get in front of others. They are protected from  reckless deportation.   The industry is protected, the farm industry, the production of food  is protected.   I am delighted that my amendment regarding temporary protected status  that impacts Hondurans, Haitians, and others--and also, as I attempt to  work on TPS for our Guatemalan friends, this bill ensures the fair way  to deal with farmworkers.   It stops the outrage of deportation. It stops the outrage of threat,  and it does what Cesar Chavez says, that we cannot have achievement and  forget our progress and prosperity for our community. It honors their  work.   I ask my colleagues to support H.R. 5038.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 5038, the Agricultural  Worker Program Act.   This legislation will stabilize the agricultural sector and preserve  our rural heritage by ensuring that farmers can meet their labor needs  well into the future.   First, the bill establishes a program for agricultural workers in the  United States (and their spouses and minor children) to earn legal  status through continued agricultural employment.   Specifically, the bill creates a process for farm workers to seek  Certified Agricultural Worker status--a temporary status for those who  have worked at least 180 days in agriculture over the prior 2-year  period.   Certified Agricultural Worker status can be renewed indefinitely with  continued farm work (at least 100 days per year).   Applicants must undergo background checks and pass strict criminal  and national security bars.   Dependent status is available for spouses and minor children.   The bill does not require workers to do or apply for anything else in  order to stay and work in the United States.   But long-term workers who want to stay have the option of earning a  path to lawful permanent residence by paying a $1,000 fine and engaging  additional agricultural work, as follows:   Workers with 10 years of agricultural work prior to the date of  enactment must complete 4 additional years of such work.   Workers with less than 10 years of agricultural work prior to the  date of enactment must complete 8 additional years of such work.   The Farmworkers movement in this country was started and led by a  great leader, Cesar Chavez who said, ``We cannot seek achievement for  ourselves and forget about progress and prosperity for our community.  Our ambitions must be broad enough to include the aspirations and needs  of others, for their sakes and for our own.''   The Texas Farm Workers Union (``TFWU'') was established by Antonio  Orendain and farmworker leaders of the Rio Grande Valley active with  the United Farm Workers after a disagreement with UFW leadership over  direction of a melon strike in south McAllen, TX in 1975.   In August 1975, nearly ten years after he began organizing farm  workers for the United Farm Workers in the Rio Grande Valley of South  Texas.   Orendain worked for Cesar Chavez in the Chicago UFW national grape  and lettuce boycott office.   Farmworkers undertake some of the toughest jobs in America.   They have earned the opportunity to build their lives without the  fear of being uprooted from their families and their communities.   The bipartisan Farm Workforce Modernization Act empowers the economic  and physical well-being of immigrant families while providing much- needed labor security for our nation's farms.   The agricultural industry relies on the labor of 2.4 million  farmworkers--about half of whom are undocumented.   This bill would protect thousands of families from deportation.   With over 60 Democratic and Republican cosponsors, the bill has  garnered significant bipartisan support.   This is a big step in making our immigration system more humane and  more efficient.   I know the farming and agricultural communities in the state of Texas  farm and my district borders communities that farm.   What we are doing here is the right thing and attempting to reinforce  the breadbasket that the United States happens to be to the world.   I have heard the clamoring of farm workers for a very long time but I  have also heard the need for fairness and the improvement of conditions  that they are working in with adequate compensation.   This bill regularizes people who want to be regularized and who want  to contribute to helping the agricultural industry in this great  nation.   My amendment which I believe is a positive addition to this  legislation, to ensure that individuals with Temporary Protected Status  [[Page H10070]]  (TPS) & Deferred Enforced Departure (DED) who are farmworkers are  eligible to qualify for Certified Agricultural Worker status, and the  path to legalization and citizenship that is created by the bill.    AMENDMENT TO THE AMENDMENT IN THE NATURE OF A SUBSTITUTE TO H.R. 5038                    OFFERED BY MS. JACKSON LEE OF TEXAS         Page 3, strike lines 19 through 21 and insert the       following:        (B) on the date of the introduction of this Act--        (i) is inadmissible or deportable from the United States;       or        (ii) is under a grant of deferred enforced departure or has       temporary protected status under section 244 of the       Immigration and Nationality Act.    I would like to thank Congresswoman Lofgren and her team for working  with our office to insure that this would be a positive way of making  the point that individuals who are around farming areas can continue to  do great work.   I would like to thank the organizations involved in the assisting in  crafting this amendment, the United Farm Workers, UFW Foundation and  Farmworker Justice.   My amendment, and this bill, are about doing the right thing. One  important goal of this legislation is to recognize the contributions of  farmworkers to our nation's agricultural success.   Individuals with TPS, from Haitian workers in Florida to Honduran  workers in California, and those with DED, including UFW members in  Washington, are a key part of our nation's farmworkers.   We must afford those individuals with TPS and DED the same  opportunity to earn a more secure temporary status and lawful permanent  residency as will be given to many of our nation's other farmworkers.   Many of these individuals have been living in the U.S. for years and  have U.S. citizen children.   All they wanted to do was to get a pathway to citizenship in a myriad  of directions but in particular, to do it legally.   Ensuring that farmworkers who have TPS and DED are eligible to  participate in the Farm Workforce Modernization Act's legalization  program is important to provide needed stability to this workforce.   Moreover, it necessary to further the legislation's intent to  stabilize the current agricultural labor supply and to ensure that  farmworkers are able to join more fully the society that they are  helping to feed.   I would like to thank the Judiciary Committee, my colleagues, both  Republican and Democrat, and in particular, Chairman Nadler and Ms.  Lofgren, who emphasized a very important point that this has been a  year of working together.   I am reminded of our tenure here on the Judiciary Committee and I  think we have attempted to be fair and bipartisan on immigration reform  for at least 2 decades.   I am also reminded of the legislation that came from the Senate, led  by the late Senator John McCain that was a bipartisan bill that  attempted to respond to the issues of undocumented persons.   United Farm Workers Support for the Farm Workforce Modernization Act                            (H.R. 5038--Lofgren)         The United Farm Workers of America supports the bipartisan       Farm Workforce Modernization Act (H.R. 5038). We were proud       to join the bipartisan group of members of Congress and the       major grower associations to develop and support H.R. 5038.       It is cruelly ironic that the people who feed the United       States live in a deep, all-encompassing fear that they       themselves cannot provide food for their families. The human       cost and stress for farm workers and their families as they       live in fear of deportation and harassment due to our broken       immigration system threatens our nation's food supply and is       a source of great shame for our nation. The compromise       legislation authored by Representatives Lofgren, cosponsored       by a bipartisan, diverse group of over 50 members of the       House, and endorsed by the Congressional Hispanic Caucus will       go a long way towards improving the lives of farm workers       today and in the future, and our broken immigration system.        We support H.R. 5038 for a simple reason--it will make the       lives of all farm workers better. H.R. 5038 meets the       following basic principles:        1. Equality of Treatment--the new agricultural visa program       will allow farm workers and their families to have the same       rights and protections as current U.S. farm workers.        2. No Discrimination--the program does not create major       incentives to discriminate against U.S. workers (including       newly legalized workers).        3. Fairness in pay--the pay rates protect U.S. workers and       supports predictable pay increases.        4. Eligibility to earn permanent residence--no one that       works to feed our country should be condemned to permanent       second class status. H.R. 5038 changes our current immoral       system.        You have the ability to pass H.R. 5038. If H.R. 5038       becomes law, agricultural workers will have stability for       themselves, and their families and the agricultural industry.       Please vote YES on H.R. 5038.     Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the Conference  Report to S. 1790, the ``National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal  Year 2020.''   The National Defense Authorization Act is designed to meet the  threats we face today as well as into the future.   The results of our work here today will reflect our strong commitment  to ensure that the men and women of our Armed Services receive the  benefits and support that they deserve for their faithful service.   Building on our efforts from previous years, this bill contains a  number of initiatives designed to provide the resources and support  needed for the men and women who keep our nation safe.   This legislation recognizes the reality that we live in a dangerous  world, where threats are not always easily identifiable, and our  enemies are not bound by borders.   Confronting this unique type of enemy requires unique capabilities.   As we have seen time and time again, our military has the ability to  track down violent extremists who wish to do our country harm,  regardless of where they reside.   Madam Speaker, I am pleased that seven of my amendments adopted  during House consideration of the NDAA are included in the final  legislation or in language in the accompanying report:   Jackson Lee Amendment directing the Secretary of Defense to  promulgate regulations to ensure that candidates granted admission to  attend a military academy undergo screening for speech disorders and be  provided the results of the screening test and a list of warfare  unrestricted line (URL) Officer positions and occupation specialists  that require successful performance on the speech test. Academy  students shall have the option of undergoing speech therapy to reduce  speech disorders or impediments.   Jackson Lee Amendment directing the Secretary of Defense to submit a  report analyzing the capacity of the Department of Defense to provide  survivors of natural disasters with emergency short-term housing to the  congressional defense committees not later than 220 days after the date  of enactment of this Act.   Jackson Lee Amendment directing the Secretary of Defense to provide a  briefing to update the Committees on Armed Services of the Senate and  the House no later than March 15, 2019 on the status of the program  required in section 1277 of the John S. McCain National Defense  Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018, including an assessment of  whether the program is beneficial to students interning, working part  time, or in a program that will result in post-graduation employment  with the Department of Defense components or contractors.   Jackson Lee Amendment requiring report on Maternity Mortality Rates  for military members and their dependents.   Jackson Lee Amendment requiring report to be submitted to Congress  within 240 days following enactment on the risks posed by debris in low  earth orbit and to make recommendations on remediation of risks and  outline plans to reduce the incident of space debris.   Jackson Lee Amendment requiring that a report from the Secretary of  Defense 240 days after the date of the enactment to the congressional  defense committees that accounts for all of the efforts, programs,  initiatives, and investments of the Department of Defense to train  elementary, secondary, and postsecondary students in fields related to  cybersecurity, cyber defense, and cyber operations.   Jackson Lee Amendment adding ``instruction on the opportunities and  risks posed by advancements in AI'' to the objectives of the Artificial  Intelligence Education Strategy.   The passing of this bill today brings us one step closer to enacting  the 57th consecutive National Defense Authorization Act.   Despite disagreements on key issues, Members have not failed to reach  consensus on behalf of our fighting men and women.   I am proud of the work we have done here today.
