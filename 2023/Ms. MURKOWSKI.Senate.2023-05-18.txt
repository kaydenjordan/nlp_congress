 Mr. President, I rise to honor the life and  legacy of William ``Bill'' Deshay English, an Alaskan who passed away  on January 11, 2023. The stories of Mr. English's remarkable life began  on a dog sled in a remote part of our State during the cold, snowy  depths of winter. After seeing a ``giant mosquito'' buzzing in the sky  as a child, he saw his passion and would go on to become a pilot.   Alaska prides itself as the ``flyingest state'' in the Nation and it  is individuals like Bill English who pioneered that reputation. Even  today, nearly 80 percent of our communities are not connected to the  road system, so we rely on exceptional pilots to keep Alaskans safe as  we travel across some of the most rugged terrain on the planet. Bill  English was one of the best. Across more than 36,000 hours of  commercial flight, he maintained a perfect safety record. That led to  his selection as an Alaska Living Aviator Legend in 2012 and his  induction into the Alaska Aviation Hall of Fame 2 years later.   A celebration of life was held for Mr. English in Anchorage last  week, where guests shared stories and pictures of his life, including  his service to our Nation during World War II, his flying adventures,  and his acts of kindness. I join Mr. English's family and friends in  mourning his loss, while remembering his quintessentially Alaskan life  and the nearly 100 years he contributed to our beautiful State.   Mr. President, I request that Bill English's obituary be printed in  the Record.   The material follows:                     Obituary for William Deshay English         William (Bill) Deshay English's life began on January 31,       1923, with an often-told and much-loved story. After going       into labor, Bill's mother, Agorak, mushed her dog team into       the dead of night and subzero temperatures. She was embarked       on a harrowing ten-mile journey from her home in Wiseman,       Alaska to Coldfoot where the region's only midwife resided.       Charged with running the general store, Bill's father,       William Sr., stayed behind in Wiseman while he awaited the       arrival of his newborn son. When Agorak drove her team back       to Wiseman with infant Bill wrapped in furs, his father's       worry burst into a celebration throughout the remote, scenic       Arctic village on the banks of the Koyukuk River. It was here       that Bill spent his childhood as a happy, active village kid.        During the late 1920s, aviator Noel Wien made an historic       excursion above the Arctic Circle in his open cockpit       biplane, landing on a gravel bar near Wiseman. Young Bill was       entranced by the ``giant mosquito'' buzzing in the sky, a       fascination that would eventually turn into a deep passion       for the art of flying and a dream of becoming a pilot.        When Bill reached adolescence, his parents sent him to live       with his father's family in California. Despite the culture       shock, Bill excelled academically and developed a passion for       track and field. He found that sports offered a way for him       to connect with his peers despite coming from a very       different background. He graduated from high school in       California, after which he returned to Fairbanks and enlisted       in the U.S. Army, serving from 1943-1945. Following World War       II, Bill was able to pursue his childhood dream of becoming a       pilot. He quickly earned his license and applied to work for       the very same man, Noel Wien, who had inspired his dream two       decades earlier.        In 1948, Bill married Shirley Nelson, a Seattle-native who       moved to Fairbanks in 1946 to study English at UAF. Their       romance began when Shirley, watching the planes land at Weeks       Field in Fairbanks, spotted Bill, clad in caribou mukluks       made by his mother, stepping out of his Cessna 140. Love       blossomed, and the two would develop an enduring bond that       would last 72 years and lead to three children, Sharon       (1949), Bill Jr. (1950), and Tamara (1968).        After joining Wien Airlines in 1946, Bill became one of the       first Native Alaskan commercial pilots and began a 37-year       career as Captain that would take him to the far reaches of       Alaska and eventually to a seat on Wien's board of directors.       Along the way, he became the first Native Alaskan pilot to       earn an Airline Transport Rating and the first to serve as an       FAA examiner. He retired with more than 36,000 hours of       commercial flight and a perfect safety record.        During his early tenure at Wien in Fairbanks, Bill helped       promote the World Eskimo-Indian Olympics and became its first       Master of Ceremonies--a position he proudly served in through       the early 1970s. After Bill retired from Wien in 1983, an       Anchorage businessman seeking a sure, experienced pilot with       solid credentials hired Bill to fly his private jet, a       Lockheed Jet Star, around the globe.        Bill was a huge proponent of lifelong education. In his       middle-aged years, he earned a Bachelor's in Business       Administration degree with a major in Transportation from the       University of Washington. He understood the economic and       political influence that ANCSA corporations possessed to       advance the education and well-being of Native Alaskan youth.       In his retirement, he served on the CIRI Board of Directors       and the Cook Inlet Housing Authority Board.        For his long and dedicated career in which he contributed       to the evolution, growth, and safety of aviation in Alaska,       he was honored in 2012 as an Alaska Living Aviator Legend,       and in 2014, was formally inducted into the Alaska Aviation       Hall of Fame. In response, he spoke with humility and       gratitude for the support he received from fellow Alaskans       throughout his life. He was grateful for the opportunity to       give back to the State, communities, and people who had made       possible the flying career he loved.        Bill passed peacefully on January 11, 2023--nearly 100       years after that first ride in a dog sled. He was at home in       Anchorage, surrounded by his loved ones. He will be       remembered for his good-natured humor, quiet energy,       curiosity, and the enduring peace with which he moved through       the world. He will be dearly missed.        He is predeceased by his parents William and Agorak, sister       Dishoo, his wife Shirley, and daughter Tamara. He is survived       by his daughter Sharon and son Bill Jr., grandchildren Gretta       and Wiley; numerous relatives in the Kotzebue area and in the       Oakland, California area.        Bill's family is eternally grateful to the many individuals       and organizations who helped care for Bill and Shirley in       their final months including the Providence Hospice team,       Alzheimer's Resource of Alaska, and Veterans Affairs of       Alaska.                            ____________________
