 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong  support of my amendment to H.R. 4447, the Clean Economy Jobs and  Innovation Act.   This commonsense amendment clarifies that energy saved through the  use of geothermal pumps qualifies as renewable energy produced for the  purposes of this bill.   Battling climate change and reducing greenhouse gas emissions will  require an innovative, multi-pronged approach.   And geothermal pump technology must be a tool available for us to  use.   Geothermal pumps work to reduce energy consumption by transferring  and concentrating heat energy absorbed from the earth.   These installations can reduce energy use in buildings by over 40  percent.   My amendment clarifies that these energy savings count as renewable  energy produced, recognizing that geothermal pumps remain a critical  part of our effort to reduce emissions and defeat climate change.   I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.    Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support  of my amendment.   This amendment requires the establishment of a reliability standard,  within the Federal Power Act, relating to extreme weather events. It  directs the Department to create a program and publish a report, on  ways to improve the resiliency of electrical grids.   Over the past year my District and others across the State of  California have experienced many of these power shutoffs due to extreme  weather events--such as wildfires. These shutoffs hurt local  businesses, leave thousands in the dark, and put the medically  vulnerable at great risk.   The federal government must step up to ensure the U.S. electrical  grid is more resilient. We must provide states and local utilities the  [[Page H4945]]  resources they need to reliably provide power to our communities.   I urge an Aye vote on this amendment to help communities like mine  and all the others affected by severe weather.
