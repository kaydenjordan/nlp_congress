 Madam President, I am proud to recognize Levi  Goodan of Meriden and Maurgan McGrath of Hopkinton as October's Granite  Staters of the Month. Levi and Maurgan both separately started  initiatives to donate toys and other goods to patients at the  Children's Hospital at Dartmouth--CHaD--to help provide comfort to  young patients with serious illnesses.   At the age of 8, Levi was treated at the Children's Hospital at  Dartmouth for multiple broken bones over the course of 1 year.  Following his treatment, Levi decided to donate his birthday and  Christmas gifts to CHaD, since he knew how difficult spending nights at  the hospital could be and wanted to lift peoples' spirits. He was  inspired by his late grandfather, who used to tell him stories about  receiving treatment for polio when he was a child at Boston Children's  Hospital. His grandfather would frequently emphasize to Levi the  importance of staying strong, hopeful, and positive in difficult  circumstances.   Since then, Levi continues to donate to CHaD. He most enjoys donating  Legos, Play-Doh, fidget spinners, and projects such as kits to grow at- home crystals.   Maurgan was born with a prenatal condition called malrotation, which  results in problems in the normal formation of the fetal intestines,  and as a result, she underwent various surgeries at ChaD while growing  up. She remembers how lonely her experience was at times and did not  want other children to feel the same way. As part of her senior year  project, Maurgan began collecting books, games, and pajamas for  children at CHaD to help them regain a sense of hope.   Levi and Maurgan exemplify the Granite State spirit, taking a  difficult time in their lives and using the experience as a source of  strength. In both their cases, they helped bring joy to other young  people who are facing similar challenges. Their commitment to helping  other children navigating the often lonely, scary world of hospital  visits should inspire all of us to give back and become more involved  in our communities. I am honored to name them as Granite Staters of the  Month, and I know that they will continue to make a positive difference  in their communities for years to come.                            ____________________
