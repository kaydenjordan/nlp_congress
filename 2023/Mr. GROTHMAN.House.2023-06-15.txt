 Mr. Speaker, there has been a lot of discussion going  on this week about regulation. As we go home for this 3-day weekend, I  encourage my colleagues, as they get around their district, whether  they run into people who are in farming, in manufacturing, in banking-- particularly in the nursing home field--to ask those folks about the  difference between regulatory rules that they live under today and 30  years ago. How many more man-hours are they spending every week filling  out government forms that does nothing to make their bank or farm or  manufacturing facility run better.   I think you will find them saying that they never would have gone  into business in the first place if they knew about this blizzard of  regulation, that they could not have swallowed it all at once but had  to take a drip, drip, drip over 20 years.   In any event, I encourage my colleagues to get out to a different  group that they normally don't deal with, the businessmen and -women-- the farmer, manufacturer, nursing home, banker--and they will find out  that our country is unquestionably poor because of the sea of people we  have filling out paperwork every week.                            ____________________
