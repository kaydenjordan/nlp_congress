 Mr. President, as a U.S. Senator, I swore an oath to  uphold the Constitution, and, while sitting in this High Court of  Impeachment, I have fulfilled my duty to serve as an impartial juror.   After hearing all counsel arguments and reviewing all evidence in the  voluminous record, including 17 witnesses, 192 witness video clips, and  28,578 pages of evidence, procedural rules, and constitutional  concerns, I will vote to acquit the President, preventing his immediate  removal from office and disqualification from the ballot.   A fair and accurate reading of this chapter in our Nation's history  will conclude that, on the issues of fact and law presented to this  High Court of Impeachment, reasonable and public-spirited Senators can  disagree. This lends further support to the notion that the American  people should be afforded the opportunity to register their opinions by  participating in the coming national election.   While the Senate worked to remain impartial and open-minded  throughout this trial, it must be acknowledged  [[Page S807]]  that a political fever permeated this process from the beginning,  dating back not just to the start of the House of Representatives'  impeachment efforts, but all the way back to November 2016. As a  result, the House improperly impeached. Now, the Senate should exercise  restraint. Here is why.   First and foremost, a fair legal process is fundamental to our  democracy. The House managers have repeatedly emphasized that no  Americans are above the law. I could not agree more: No private  citizen, President, or assembled majority of Congress can violate the  rights guaranteed to other Americans under the Constitution.  Accordingly, the President is entitled to basic due process rights, and  the House failed to afford him these rights. Due process includes the  right to legal counsel, the right to review evidence, and the ability  to confront your accusers--rights denied by the House majority. House  Managers breathlessly insist that ``overwhelming'' evidence already in  the record proves ``beyond any doubt'' the President's continued  service constitutes an imminent threat to the American people. The  House's flawed and rushed process led to unfair proceedings and  resulted in superficial, unspecific charges supported by a one-sided,  improperly curated factual foundation.   Second, Separation of Powers is a cornerstone of our constitutional  republic, and its preservation is essential to prevent abuse of power  by one branch over another. A majority of the House should exercise  extreme caution when it bases impeachment upon the President's exercise  of his foreign relations prerogatives, which are expressly granted to  him by the Constitution. Additionally, in developing its Articles of  Impeachment, the House majority chose to circumvent the judicial branch  of government in order to clarify an issue of unsettled law pertaining  to Executive Privilege. Instead, the House simply arrogated to itself a  novel and dangerous new legal authority: absolute power to define  Executive Privilege, even when the President is exercising his foreign  relations powers granted by the Constitution.   As with prior impeachment inquiries, following a formal request by  the House, the Federal courts could have compelled the executive branch  to provide sensitive documents and witnesses. The House chose to ignore  this longstanding precedent because it conflicted with its political  timeline. Astonishingly, Speaker Pelosi rushed the mismanaged process  forward only to delay it, again for political purposes, before finally  sending the Articles of Impeachment to the Senate. Now the House,  having failed to fully develop its evidentiary record, invites the  Senate to act as an accomplice to its ramrod impeachment and create a  dangerous new 51-vote Senate threshold to override executive branch  claims of Executive Privilege.   To accept this invitation would be a violation of a long-established  separation of powers.   Senators might be tempted by a burning curiosity or crass political  calculation to further develop the House's vague and tainted articles,  but the constitutional separation of powers dictates that our legal  charge must be more narrowly confined. To act otherwise would violate  our oaths and dangerously incentivize calculating and intemperate House  majorities to promiscuously impeach rival Presidents. We must set aside  our personal preference because, under the Constitution, we are duty- bound by the ``sole power to try'' the infirm articles before us.   Lastly, Americans should stand against any Senate action which abets  the creation of a constitutional crisis through the politicization of  impeachment. The House majority's misguided process created a precedent  to weaponize impeachment, a new precedent that will lead to serial  impeachments in a polarized America. If the House majority had its way  and the Senate accepted its invitation to fix their broken articles,  either political party would be tempted to impeach and potentially  remove their political opponents from office by initiating slapdash  impeachment investigations. This new precedent would reduce impeachment  to a mere vote of no confidence, similar to that in the U.K.  Parliament. During President Nixon's impeachment, then Democratic  Chairman Peter Rodino of the House Judiciary Committee urged that, for  the American people to accept an impeachment, it must be powerfully  bipartisan. This has been dubbed the Rodino rule, and I embrace the  standard.   A decent respect for the law and the opinions of fellow citizens and  a concern for future precedent requires that I pointedly emphasize what  I am not arguing, that a President can lawfully do ``whatever he  wants,'' that inviting foreign election interference is appropriate,  that absolute immunity attaches to Executive Privilege, or that a  statutory offense must be committed to impeach.   In summation, I have ineluctably arrived at a conclusion after  impartially applying the law to all facts presented: House managers  delivered tainted articles and failed to present requisite evidence to  support their exceedingly high burden of proof. Therefore, I am duty  bound to join my colleagues who would have the Senate resume the  ordinary business of the American people.   The Founding Fathers, who warned of the political nature of  impeachment, also provided us a means to address dissatisfaction with  our Presidents: frequent elections. This week, Americans began the  Presidential election process. For the sake of our Constitution and our  Nation, the Court of the American People should render its verdict  through an election to address its support of or opposition to the  current administration.                            ____________________
