 Mr. Speaker, a recent Morning Consult poll found  that nearly half of all voters--46 percent--``believe the media  fabricates news stories about President Donald Trump and his  administration.''   It is not surprising that the American people feel this way. Each day  they wake up to another barrage of negative reporting about a President  they elected.   In fact, a recent Harvard University study found that news coverage  of President Trump's first 100 days was 80 percent negative, a record  high for any recent President.   The news media used anonymous sources to report illegitimate claims  that intentionally placed the President and his administration in a bad  light. This is borderline malicious.   The liberal media frequently rushed to print stories with one single  biased source. Often, the stories turn out to be false. This is the  current state of journalism by the liberal media.   The media should report on the topics of the day in a fair and  balanced manner; otherwise, the American people will continue to  consider the media's coverage to be fabricated news.                            ____________________
