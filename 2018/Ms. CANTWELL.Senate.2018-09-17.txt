 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I come to the floor to thank my  colleagues for working so hard on this very important legislation we  are going to pass tonight to deal with the opioid crisis.   From Port Angeles to Spokane, I guarantee my colleagues that I have  heard about this problem, I have seen how our communities are  struggling, and this is the very help that they have been asking for.  They want new tools, they want better solutions, and they want us to  join the fight against drug manufacturers who push these drugs out to  communities when they should be following a process and reporting so  that our law enforcement can cut down on the huge amounts of opioids  streaming into our communities.   This legislation does many things, and I am glad that it does. The  STOP Act will help crack down on shipments of fentanyl into the United  States via the U.S. mail, which is something that is very important  that we do, and I thank my colleague from Ohio for that.   It authorizes funding for a new grant program to help train law  enforcement and protect them against the deadliest opioids, like  fentanyl, because their exposure to it has been so unbelievable and it  is a risk to them every day they are out there doing their job.   This bill reauthorizes the drug courts program, which many people in  the State of Washington have told me has been beneficial to how they  deal with this crisis as it relates to the individuals in their States,  helping nonviolent offenders recover and helping them move forward.   It reauthorizes the High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area Program,  which uses Federal resources to help local law enforcement crack down  on illicit drug rings. We need to help law enforcement, which is  dealing with this problem every single day, to have the tools to do  this job. The fact that it reauthorizes the High Intensity Drug  Trafficking Area Program is just the kind of tool they need.   This bill also makes permanent the ability for doctors to treat up to  275 patients with the kind of treatment that is necessary for them,  which also helps us to get to people faster and to get them into a  recovery situation faster.   One thing I really want to draw attention to is this issue of hearing  over and over about how opioid manufacturers have flooded our  communities with a product when, in reality, current law says they are  supposed to monitor and track the distribution of this drug. Well, in  too many cases, those safeguards have not been followed. Throughout  their process, they weren't reporting on suspicious orders of opioids  that prevents them from ending up in the wrong hands, and in some  instances, they ended up in the hands of a black market, which then  continued to flood communities with the product.   In one example, a physician in Everett, Washington, wrote more than  10,000 prescriptions of opioids. This number of prescriptions was 26  times higher than the average prescriber in Everett, Washington. So he  wrote 26 times more opioid prescriptions than the average provider.  However, the drug manufacturer failed to report this suspicious  activity.   When we authorized this drug, we said this process is what has to  happen. Because of its highly addictive nature, it has to be tracked.  Law enforcement has to keep track of and be advised of anything that  looks like suspicious activity. This abnormally high number was a clear  red flag that should have been reported. Instead, the opioid  manufacturer turned a blind eye to the negligent distribution.   In response to those abuses, people in my State and in many other  States have been critical and have filed lawsuits because they have  been so concerned about this issue. What is clear, though, is that we  need to do something now to make sure that opioid manufacturers follow  the law that is already on the books about the reporting of suspicious  distribution or volumes of distributions that are suspicious. Today,  this legislation takes a major step forward on that front by including  penalties for negligent opioid distribution strong enough to serve as a  deterrent to those manufacturers against the actions we have seen in  the past.   The bipartisan Opioid Crisis Response Act includes provisions from  legislation that I and Senator Harris from California authored. Our  provisions increase the civil and criminal penalties on companies that  fail to take responsible measures to prevent their drugs from entering  the black market.   Our legislation increases the civil penalties by 10 times, from  $10,000 to $100,000 per violation. That adds up very quickly in what we  think have been transactions that have been very suspicious. In  addition, the bill increases the maximum criminal penalty to $500,000  for companies that willfully disregard and/or knowingly fail to keep  proper reporting on these distribution activities.   Again, this is what we put into the law because of the highly  addictive nature of these drugs. We said that they have to be monitored  and their distribution has to be monitored because prior to today the  slap on the wrist was not enough of a deterrent, and most of those  requirements were ignored. Today, we are putting a much more stringent  requirement in the law to say that they will get serious fines if they  don't follow the law.   This is such an important issue that a bipartisan group of 39 U.S.  state attorneys general sent a letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee  in support of this effort. Our own attorney general, Bob Ferguson,  helped in promoting that effort, and I want to thank him. The state  attorneys general said:         Diversion of prescription opioids has devastated       communities in our states. The consequences for turning a       blind eye to suspicious opioid orders cannot merely be a cost       of doing business. We urge you to support . . . the CARES Act       to ensure that penalties  [[Page S6174]]       effectively hold manufacturers accountable and help stem       diversion.    So I agree with those state attorneys general, and I am so glad this  is included in this legislation. Creating a more serious attitude  toward the illegal distribution of this product and its falling into  the hands of black markets is so serious. I urge my colleagues to  support this legislation.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I just wanted to follow my colleague  from Washington with comments about having a hearing in the Judiciary  Committee as we proceed to next Monday. I think it is very important  that all of our colleagues have all of the information. I also think it  is important that an investigation be taken seriously and be underway  at the same time. So I hope that my colleagues are not just thinking  that we will have a hearing and move forward as quickly as possible but  will treat this as the serious investigation that people in the State  of Washington and around the country want to see. I so appreciate the  fact that this is a very challenging time, but information must be  received and a true investigation must also occur.   I thank the President.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
