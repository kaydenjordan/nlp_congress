 MALONEY of New York asked and was given permission  to address the House for 1 minute.)    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in  support of our Nation's greatest asset, our workers, our essential  workers--nurses, teachers, mail carriers, transportation, sanitation,  and food industry workers, among so many others--who have lifted the  Nation with their sacrifice and bravery.   Just as they have supported us, we must support them by supporting  unions. Attacks on unions, and a series of significant actions by the  former administration, have weakened worker protections and, in turn,  destroyed the middle class.   That is why I was proud to just vote to pass the Protecting the Right  to Organize Act, the most significant upgrade for workers' collective  bargaining rights in more than 80 years.   If we are to fully recover from this deadly pandemic and build back  better, we must invest in and protect the rights of our workers to  unionize. American workers and their families are depending on us.                            ____________________
