 Mr. Speaker, I want to say what an honor it has been  to serve alongside the great Louie Gohmert. I have watched him on  television, as we say, for many years, fighting the fight for our  freedom, for the Constitution, and for the values that make America so  exceptional and so great.   I know I am about to be gaveled, and I am running out of time, so let  me say this: This man has the kind of grit and the kind of fight that  this country and this country's leaders are going to need if we are  going to restore freedom and return power to the people and resurrect  the great United States of America.   If we could just bottle a little bit of Louie Gohmert and force-feed  it to the Members of this body, I believe we could get our great  country back.   God bless Louie Gohmert. God bless his family and all his future  endeavors, and God bless America.                            ____________________
