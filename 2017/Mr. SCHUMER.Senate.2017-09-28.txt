 Mr. President, first I ask unanimous consent that I be  able to speak in leader time, and, after my remarks, that the Senator  from North Dakota be recognized to speak on the judge nomination and be  given the time she wants, about 10 minutes, and that we move the vote  to immediately thereafter.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?   Hearing none, it is so ordered.    Mr. President, let me thank my friend from Oregon for  his outstanding remarks. He has been a leader in keeping the internet  open and free and making sure that this new highway system, in effect,  is as free as our old highway system, or the existing highway system,  to let the big guy and the little guy compete on equal terms. That is  all we want, and Mr. Pai doesn't seem to get that.   There is a whole round of appointees from this administration who  simply side with big corporations no matter what, and this is an  example of just that.   So I thank my friend from Oregon for his remarks.   Mr. President, I have three topics this morning--briefly, healthcare,  then, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, and, finally, taxes.
