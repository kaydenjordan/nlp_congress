 Mr. President, I rise to recognize the 150th  anniversary of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Vicksburg District. The  history of this vital entity can be traced back to 1873 when Captain  William Henry Harrison Benyuard opened the Monroe-based branch to  address surveys and conduct wreck removals on the Yazoo and Ouachita  Rivers. Today, the Vicksburg District encompasses areas across  Arkansas, Mississippi, and Louisiana containing nine major river basins  and incorporating approximately 460 miles of mainline Mississippi River  levees.   As U.S. Senator for Arkansas, I have worked closely with the  Vicksburg District Corps leaders on many projects to benefit The  Natural State. I have always appreciated our collaboration to  strengthen navigation, conservation, recreation and water supply on the  Ouachita River. To better serve the communities adjacent to tributaries  and reservoirs in its jurisdiction, I have worked alongside the Corps  to fund studies in the Ouachita River Basin and support its flood risk  management mission on the Red and Ouachita Rivers. The District has  also been instrumental in securing additional water supply for the city  of Hot Springs and Central Arkansas Water via Lake Ouachita and Lake  DeGray.   The Corps plays an important role in managing safety and  environmental issues for our waterways and related structures. As a  member of the Environment and Public Works Committee, I proudly support  these efforts and am committed to always working to ensure it has the  funding and resources necessary to carry out its mission.   I look forward to continuing our partnership and delivering the  resources to improve Corps infrastructure and facilities, and I  congratulate the Vicksburg District on 150 years of managing water  resources and responding to emergencies for the benefit of the entire  region it serves and supports.                            ____________________
