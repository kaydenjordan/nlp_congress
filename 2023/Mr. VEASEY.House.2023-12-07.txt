 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate Shiloh Missionary  Baptist Church's 120th anniversary.   For over 120 years on the north side of Fort Worth near the  stockyards, this church has been a pillar of the community where people  of all backgrounds can come and worship and gather.   In 1902, Mrs. Cenie Campbell Stovall, a dedicated Christian woman,  organized the church's first Sunday school classes held in the backyard  of Mr. and Mrs. John Kennedy on the southwest corner of 24th and Ross  Avenue.   For years, this church has been such a pivotal part of the Fort Worth  community. They have organized so many different events and activities  that benefit the north side and all of Fort Worth.   From 1958 until 2015, they were under the direction of the venerable  Reverend Albert E. Chew, Jr. Now, they are under the direction of Kraig  Lowell Pullam, and they continue to do great things.   Again, Shiloh, congratulations on 120 years, and here is wishing you  a great 120 more.                            ____________________
