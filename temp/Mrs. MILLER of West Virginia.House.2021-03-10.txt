 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak  against H.R. 1319, Pelosi's progressive payoff, and in support of  America's gig economy.   Not only is this a costly bill full of liberal wish-list items that  do nothing to crush COVID or create jobs, but it also stifles America's  gig economy at a time when it needs our support the most.   The gig economy provides flexibility and opportunity to businesses,  workers, and customers in urban and rural areas. The success of  America's gig economy is due to the absence of government  overregulation.   Let's take a lesson from the gig economy that has flourished and  scale our response around demand rather than regulation.   I am giving this bill one star. Our gig economy workers and customers  deserve the freedom to work and to thrive.
