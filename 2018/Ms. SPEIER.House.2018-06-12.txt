 Mr. Speaker, today marks the 120th anniversary of the  Proclamation of Philippine Independence. About 120 years ago, U.S.  actions turned promises of freedom into false hope.   Though Filipino rebels fought alongside our troops to end colonial  Spanish rule, the Philippines became a U.S. territory, not a nation.  Filipinos only achieved independence in 1946, after decades of further  bloodshed.   Despite this unfortunate past, we have moved forward together. I am  proud to represent one of the largest Filipino communities in the world  anchored in Daly City. Filipino Americans make countless contributions  to our society, from Bruno Mars' songs to servicemembers' brave  sacrifices.   Even when our leaders don't share our values, the people of the  United  [[Page H5078]]  States and the Philippines together remain committed to democracy,  human rights, and self-determination.                            ____________________
