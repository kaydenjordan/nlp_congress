 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1606,  the Veteran Entrepreneurship Training Act.   This bipartisan legislation provides statutory authority for the  Boots to Business Program, which provides entrepreneurship training to  individuals including veterans and active members of the Armed Forces,  to be administered by the Small Business Administration.   The Boots to Business program provides entrepreneurship education and  training, offering a general understanding of entrepreneurship and  relevant business ownership principles.   Through this program, veterans learn about the abilities,  information, and tools required to start a business, such as how to  create a business plan and the resources offered by the Small Business  Administration.   Active-Duty Service members, including National Guard and Reserves,  Veterans, and their spouses are eligible to participate in the program.   Our veterans dedicated their lives to protecting the freedom of all  Americans and it is critical that they are armed with the tools,  resources, and training to be successful as they return to civilian  life.   This bill plays an important role in smoothing that transition and  constitutes an important step in preparing veterans to thrive in the  private sector.   Notably, many of the same skills that are fundamental in  entrepreneurship and business ownership have already been developed in  veterans through their time in the military, including leadership,  problem solving, and discipline.   This program will help veterans leverage those skill sets towards  career success in civilian life.   I am proud to say that Houston is home to over 280,000 veterans and  is ranked 10th nationally for the newest businesses per capita.   This bill will help connect Houston's veterans with the wealth of  opportunities for small business entrepreneurship across the city.   Further, this bill will help address the ongoing crisis of  homelessness among America's veterans on a national scale.   Today, more than 1 in 10 people experiencing homelessness are  veterans who fearlessly and selflessly served our Nation.   They have kept their promise to serve our Nation; they have willingly  risked their lives to protect the country we all love.   We must now ensure that we keep our promises to our veterans and  provide them with the support they deserve as they pursue success in  civilian life.   This bill is an important part of that effort.   By providing entrepreneurship training and support, we can help give  veterans the tools they need to get back on their feet and achieve  greater financial security.   Our Nation has a proud legacy of appreciation and commitment to the  men and women who have worn the uniform in defense of this country.   We must be united in seeing that every soldier, sailor, airman, and  marine is welcomed back with all the care and compassion this grateful  Nation can bestow.   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 1606 and in  equipping our veterans with the tools, resources, and training for  their long-term success.    Mr. Speaker, I rise to express my support for S. 30,  Fiscal Year 2023 Veterans Affairs Major Medical Facility Authorization  Act.   It is always my honor to address issues related to the wellbeing of  the women and men who served and continue to serve our country.   As noted by the Congressional Budget Office, this bill authorizes the  appropriation of $3.7 billion for fiscal year 2023 for the construction  and renovation of seven major VA medical facilities for the Department  of Veterans Affairs.   With approximately 360,000 employees, roughly 1,600 health care  facilities, 144 medical centers, and 1,232 outpatient sites, the  Department of Veterans Affairs remains one of the largest and most  complex agencies in the U.S. Government.   The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) provides health care to  approximately 9 million veterans annually.   Over the past ten years, more than 60,000 veterans have died by  suicide, and 20 veterans die by suicide each day.   Between 2005 and 2017, nearly 79,000 veterans killed themselves, more  than the total number of troops who have died in the wars in Vietnam,  Iraq, and Afghanistan combined (roughly 65,000).   There has never been a more urgent time than this that requires the  urgent need for rebuilding the department's flailing infrastructure and  resolving staffing shortage in VA medical facilities.   It is equally important to keep the focus on efforts to reduce wait  times and availability by specialty, adequately address the veteran  suicide rate, and find lasting solutions to the overall healthcare  needs of our veterans.   It is therefore appropriate for this House to vote for this bill to  ensure that the Veterans Health Administration's (VHA) major medical  facilities receive the needed attention that they deserve to meet the  health needs of our veterans.   This bill does not only help with furnishing inpatient and outpatient  care and treatment of veterans and their dependents, but also supports  the care and treatment in non-VA facilities; community-based outpatient  clinics, medical supplies, and equipment.   This bill will benefit the operations of VA medical centers (VAMCs)  and other medical facilities, such as community-based outpatient  clinics (CBOCs), Vet Centers, and other veteran-related community care  programs.   It will also benefit many VA medical facility services like the  Community Care Program (VCCP), the Camp Lejeune Family Member Program  (CLFMP), CHAMPVA, the Foreign Medical Program (FMP), the Children of  Women Vietnam Veterans Health Care Benefits Program (CWVV), and the  Indian Health Service (IHS)/Tribal Health Programs (THP) Reimbursement  Agreements Program.   I applaud President Biden's administration for keeping its promise to  adopt a comprehensive public health and crisis sector approach to  address suicide among veterans, service members, and their families  within his first 200 days in office.   Since taking office, the Biden administration has made commendable  progress in filling the department's 50,000 empty positions especially  in ways that reflect the diversity that exists within the active-duty  and veteran community.   This bill helps to build on that progress by addressing the  department's aging infrastructure, which has been in place for roughly  58 years.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3672,  which designates the clinic of the Department of Veterans Affairs in  Indian River, Michigan as the ``Pfc. Justin T. Paton Department of  Veterans Affairs Clinic.''   This bill honors Private First Class Justin T. Paton and his  courageous service to our Nation.   Today and every day, I stand with our Nation's veterans and their  brave and selfless service in support of our freedoms.   Over 280,000 of our Nation's veterans reside in the city of Houston  and I am proud to fight every day for the honor, recognition, and  appreciation they, and all of our Nation's veterans, deserve.   Veterans have kept their promise to serve our Nation; they have  willingly risked their lives to protect the country we all love.   We must now ensure that we keep our promises to our veterans by  recognizing, remembering, and honoring their service.   I urge my colleagues to join me today in recognizing and honoring the  service and sacrifice of Private First Class Justin Paton.   This bill honors the Indian River native who valiantly served in the  United States Army with the 1st Cavalry Division, Delta Company until  he was killed in action by enemy fire.   Private First Class Justin Paton gave his last full measure of  devotion to the United States as he was killed by hostile sniper fire  in Iraq in February 2007 at the age of 24.   Paton served as unit leader of his Company and was posthumously  awarded a Bronze Star for his selfless actions in service to a grateful  Nation.   As such, I rise in support of this bill, which honors his memory by  designating the Department of Veterans Affairs clinic in his hometown  as the ``Pfc. Justin T. Paton Department of Veterans Affairs Clinic.''    Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record at the  appropriate time that I was unavoidably detained with an event with my  local police officers and was not able to vote on the floor for H.R.  1606, Veterans Entrepreneurship Training Act of 2023, roll call vote  Number 272. If I had been present, I would have voted ``aye.''                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I was absent for roll call vote 273,  again, with an event with my local law enforcement. It is H.R. 3672, to  designate the clinic of the Department of Veterans Affairs in Indian  River, Michigan, as the Private First Class Justin T. Paton Department  of Veterans Affairs Clinic.   Mr. Speaker, I ask to place my ``aye'' vote for roll call 273 in the  appropriate place in the Record.    =========================== NOTE ===========================        On June 20, 2023, page H2981, in the third column, the following  appeared: Mr. Speaker, I ask to place my ``aye'' vote for roll  call 237 in the appropriate      The online version has been corrected to read: Mr. Speaker, I  ask to place my ``aye'' vote for roll call 273 in the appropriate    ========================= END NOTE =========================                                ____________________     Mr. Speaker, just a few minutes ago, a Member stood  on this floor to charge the President of the United States with high  crimes and misdemeanors and that he failed to faithfully execute his  duties.   As a member of the Judiciary Committee having participated in several  impeachments, differences in policies, differences in parties does not  reflect, at any time, a cause for impeachment.   Mr. Speaker, let me express my appreciation on a different topic to  the African American Police Officers League that had an outstanding  program today of giving to young people  [[Page H2984]]  scholarships and interacting with those young people. That kind of  interaction fosters good police-community relationships.   Since this is gun antiviolence month, it was good for these young  people to be around police officers who live in their neighborhood,  went to their high schools, and care about them and their families.  This interaction makes a difference. This is the new policing, and I  thank the African American Police Officers League and members of the  Houston Police Department for recognizing how we work with our children  and how we inspire them.    Mr. Speaker, I thank AAPOL for their service.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, June 2023 marks National Reunification  Month, honoring those who work tirelessly to keep families together  across the nation.   Here we are, recognizing the individuals and continuing initiatives  that support keeping families together.   The topic for this year's reunification is ``Shifting Power and  Reconnecting Families All Year Long.''   The three important themes during Reunification Month include:  [[Page H2988]]    1. The fact that we should celebrate parents and children who have  successfully reunited and understand how challenging an accomplishment  it may be.   2. Celebrate child welfare professionals, kin caregivers, and  resource families who helped make reunification a reality for parents  and children. And lastly . . .   3. Inspire parents and professionals who are currently involved in  child welfare to see that Reunification Matters and Reunification  Happens.   It is also a good time to commit once more to supporting, enhancing,  and intensifying these initiatives all year long.   By definition, the child welfare system is a collection of programs  and services aimed at optimizing children's well-being by ensuring  their safety, establishing durability, and aiding their families.   The operation and provision of child welfare services may vary from  state to state, but all states are accountable for adhering to federal  and state laws.   And yet, the stress of involvement in the child welfare system and  foster care placement instability can contribute to or exacerbate  mental health problems, and a child's unmet physical and mental health  requirements have been related to placement instability.   I want to acknowledge that there are too many, particularly Black and  African American children, unnecessarily taken from their homes and  placed in foster care.   Not only are child protective agencies more likely to investigate  Black homes, remove their children, and place them in foster care, but  Black children are prone to spend more time in foster care and are less  likely to be reunified with their families.   Research tells us that Black children are less likely to be reunified  than White and Hispanic children, older children are less likely to be  reunified and children with health or mental health issues are less  likely to be reunited.   In addition, more than 200,000 kids entered foster care, and 587,330  of those cases of maltreatment or neglect have been documented  nationwide.   Every child deserves a village of support.   In Houston, there are well over 2,000 children currently in the  foster care system.   Texas alone response times the hotline to report child abuse,  neglect, or exploitation, increased by half a minute, with callers  waiting on hold an average of 5.2 minutes, since the January 2022  report.   Furthermore, research on kinship care has indicated that children  placed with relatives have better behavior, mental health, and well- being than children placed in non-relative foster care, and that  children placed with family have higher placement stability.   Older foster youth have the same needs as younger children for a safe  and loving family that will support them into maturity.   It is extremely unfair that youth who age out of foster care are more  likely to encounter homelessness, unemployment, early parenthood, and  substance abuse. That is why I congratulate the Hay Center for using  Federal Block grant funds to build housing for aged out youth with  wraparound services in Houston.   The needs, experiences, and voices of children and youth in foster  care as well as their families and aretakers need to be lifted.   Everyone has a part to play in making communities and families  stronger and lowering the need for foster care in a secure manner.   This year commemorates the fifth anniversary of the Family First  Prevention Services Act's passage.   I am astounded that the passage of this law, that emphasis on the  child alone was replaced with one that included the family as well.   Family First made financing available for a variety of authorized  evidence-based prevention-focused programs, such as those to address  mental health issues, substance use disorders, and to offer parental  skills-building.   Family First prevention plans have been filed by 45 states including  Texas and 4 tribes to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services,  and several have already started putting them into practice.   The COVID-19 pandemic brought to light the need for more innovative  ways, like telehealth, to provide mental health services to children,  youth, and their caretakers.   Several state child welfare agencies are co-designing techniques to  design with individuals and communities rather than for them. This  method elevates the voices and experiences of adolescents, parents,  relatives, and foster parents.   The Harris County Plan of Safe Care Steering Committee is a cross- sector group of organizations from academia, child welfare, healthcare,  justice, public safety, and substance use disorder prevention  treatment.   The Texas Department of Family and Protective Services operates a  ``Treatment Foster Family Care'' program to stabilize children at risk  of placement in a congregate care setting or psychiatric hospital who  experience emotional, behavioral, or mental health difficulties.   Transforming the child welfare system will require the development of  new policies, practices, and infrastructures that prioritize prevention  and the well-being of children and families.   As well as meaningful participation of those with lived experience in  all stages of reform planning, development, and implementation.   Many people find the process of receiving assistance to be  unnecessarily difficult.   Not to mention the overwhelmingly horrifying number of children who  are placed in unlicensed homes.   It is illegal to place children overnight in unlicensed facilities,  but because of mounting demand, children are sleeping in such places  anyway.   The harm to faster children goes beyond loneliness and missed meals.   It saddens me to know foster children have been subjected to physical  and sexual abuse in these temporary placements.   Children have gone missing while in state care and some have been  groomed for sexual trafficking.   CPS workers--trained for case management, not therapeutic care--have  their hands tied in how to respond.   We are talking about traumatized children who have been subjected to  abuse and neglect.   Children who are now being housed in temporary residential treatment  centers or temporary group homes under the supervision of CPS staff.   Placement into foster care is a significant and traumatic experience  in the life of a child, and for their family.   That is why we need to work to support and strengthen families and  prevent unnecessary removals of children from their homes.   Too often, the perspectives of children, youth, and families, have  been silenced in debates about how communities may improve their  approach to child and family well-being.   We should all believe in hope.   Hope is the belief by a family that despite the challenges they face,  the strength and support of neighbors and others in the community will  help them to overcome and thrive.   Childhood should be some of the most beautiful moments of your life.   No one person young or old should endure what many of our nation's  people are experiencing.   No child left behind means exactly that.   Our children are the future, the past and most importantly the  present.   Do not take your focus off of the important and what some may deem  ``touchy'' subjects, because they are the most pivotal in the end.   They are all of our children and every one of us is needed to  safeguard and protect them.   As co-chair of the Children's Caucus, I encourage all of us to  continue to dig deeper, love more and reach out to children in need.   As Members of Congress, it is our duty to do even more to ensure all  safeguards are in place and to uphold laws, and to create or amend laws  where needed.                            ____________________
