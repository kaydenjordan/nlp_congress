 Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Massachusetts for  yielding me this time.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the VETERAN Act, the legislation  before us today, and I do so for a very simple reason: This merely  codifies what is already existing law under the Affordable Care Act, or  so-called ObamaCare, something that was done through rulemaking that I  presume has bipartisan support.                                time  1245    Yes, it is important to protect the veterans, but the reason we are  on the floor today is another example of one of the greatest  legislative malpractice acts ever committed in Congress: trying to pass  a Republican healthcare bill with no oversight, with no hearing, no  public input, and no experts testifying to run the traps for us as far  as the intended and the unintended consequences.   The reason we are on the floor now 1 month after passage of that bill  is to try to correct just one of the deficiencies that exist in it.   I say it is a so-called healthcare bill because what it really is is  a $900 billion tax break to the most wealthy individuals in our  country, including insurance companies and drug companies, under the  guise of healthcare reform and asking 23 million Americans, including 2  million veterans, as my friend from Massachusetts just pointed out, in  Medicaid to give up their healthcare coverage to pay for that massive  tax cut.   It also will discriminate against older Americans in a rural  congressional district, such as mine in western and north central  Wisconsin, by allowing insurance companies to charge them higher  premiums. It will also allow insurance companies to once again  discriminate against individuals that have preexisting conditions.   It does absolutely nothing to control the costs of healthcare--which  have been rising--especially prescription drug costs that are affecting  all Americans, and it was done in a way to jam this Congress and jam  the American people about the consequences of this so-called healthcare  bill.   So, yes, let's fix and make sure that we are protecting veterans who  are getting their healthcare outside the VA medical center so that  they, too, qualify for premium tax credits, which this legislation  allows.   But let's do healthcare the right way by studying the implications of  what will affect one-fifth of the entire U.S. economy and almost one- half of all Federal spending. Let's regroup and do it the right way,  through normal legislative process. That is having bipartisan  discussions, committee hearings, and talking to the experts--consumers  and patients alike--so we know what we are getting into when we are  trying to take a run at the importance of healthcare in our country.   One area that I think we can reach bipartisan agreement on or should  be focused on are further steps to reduce the cost of healthcare to  make it more affordable for all Americans. Again, we are missing that  opportunity because of the lack of hearings and because of how this  legislation was rushed through this Chamber just a month ago.   We on this side didn't even get to see the language of it until late  the night before it was on the House floor. That is no way to legislate  healthcare policy.   Mr. Speaker, let's fix it today with this one small piece of  legislation.
