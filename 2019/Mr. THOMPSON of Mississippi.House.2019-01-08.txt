 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules  and pass the bill (H.R. 251) to extend by two years the Chemical  Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards Program of the Department of Homeland  Security, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 251         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Chemical Facility Anti-      Terrorism Standards Program Extension Act''.       SEC. 2. EXTENSION OF CHEMICAL FACILITY ANTI-TERRORISM                     STANDARDS PROGRAM OF THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND                     SECURITY.         Section 5 of the Protecting and Securing Chemical       Facilities from Terrorist Attacks Act of 2014 (Public Law       113-254; 6 U.S.C. 621 note) is amended by striking ``4       years'' and inserting ``6 years''.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent  that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their  remarks and to include extraneous material on this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as  I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 251, the Chemical Facility  Anti-Terrorism Standards Program Extension Act.   H.R. 251 would extend the Department of Homeland Security's authority  to carry out the Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards, or CFATS,  program for 2 years. Under this novel regulatory program, DHS works  with the owners and operators of our Nation's highest risk chemical  facilities to ensure those facilities have adequate security measures  in place.   Unless Congress acts expeditiously, authority to regulate these high- risk facilities will expire in a matter of days. We cannot let this  happen.   The risk of a terrorist attack on a chemical facility is not  conjecture; it is a credible threat echoed by every Homeland Security  Secretary since 2005. Federal and State law enforcement officers have  uncovered multiple plots aimed at chemical facilities, including after  the 9/11 attacks when it came to light that the hijackers had also  scouted chemical plants.   National security experts, from former Homeland Security Secretary  Michael Chertoff to President Obama, have expressed concern that a  terrorist could seek to penetrate a chemical facility to carry out a  weapon of mass destruction attack. CFATS is the way DHS partners with  chemical facilities to combat this threat. The program enjoys support  across party lines and within the regulated community.   I led the initial bipartisan effort to establish the program in 2006.  CFATS had a bumpy start, but over time, with the stability of a long- term authorization, in 2014, CFATS has developed into a security  program that is making the U.S. demonstrably safer.   Don't take my word for it; the data speaks for itself. Since CFATS  was created, the number of chemical facilities designated as high risk  in the U.S. has dropped by half. This achievement means that  communities near the chemical plants are safer.   Still, like with any other program, there are areas where it could be  strengthened. The 2-year extension sought under this act is needed to  give the House and Senate ample time to come together to address  oversight findings to improve the program.   It is unfortunate that in the waning days of the previous Congress,  bipartisan House efforts to provide the regulated community with  confidence that the CFATS security regime would continue were rebuffed  by a couple of Senators who took the public position that the program  should be completely ended unless it was changed in the way they liked.  In fact, they said as much in a letter to House and Senate leadership  on October 23, 2018:   ``If Congress fails to reform the CFATS program, we believe the  program should expire and not continue to be reauthorized via annual  appropriations.''   The approach they took was eerily similar to the one the President is  now taking as he sets a partial government shutdown in motion to try  and compel Congress to agree to providing nearly $6 billion in funding  for a border wall.   Mr. Speaker, the Secretary of Homeland Security wrote to Congress in  November urging for a short-term reauthorization.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record both the letter from my Senate  colleagues and the letter from the Secretary.                                                     U.S. Senate,                                   Washington, DC, October 23, 2018.      Hon. Michael McCaul,      Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Bennie Thompson,      Ranking Member, Committee on Homeland Security, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Greg Walden,      Chairman, Committee on Energy and Commerce, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Frank Pallone,      Ranking Member, Committee on Energy and Commerce, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman McCaul, Chairman Walden, Ranking Member       Thompson, and Ranking Member Pallone: We write regarding S.       3405, the Protecting and Securing Chemical Facilities from       Terrorist Attacks Act of 2018. This bill will reauthorize the       Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards (CFATS) program at       the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) with commonsense       reforms to secure chemical facilities while reducing the       regulatory burden on the private sector.        During the 113th Congress, the Senate Committee on Homeland       Security and Governmental Affairs, House Committee on       Homeland Security, and House Committee on Energy and Commerce       worked together to reauthorize and reform the CFATS program,       although the reauthorization is set to expire in January       2019. At that time, the CFATS program faced significant       challenges, including long backlogs to review security plans,       a flawed tiering methodology, program management issues, and       questions about whether the program was effectively reducing       risk and enhancing security.        The CFATS program currently regulates over 3,000 chemical       facilities nationwide. Although DHS has improved its       management of the CFATS program over the past four years,       such as eliminating the estimated nine-year backlog of       reviewing facilities' unique site security plans, it is       evident that the program needs additional reforms. On June       12, 2018, the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and       Governmental Affairs held a roundtable that included DHS, the       U.S. Government Accountability Office, a CFATS chemical       inspector, and a variety of companies and industry groups.        During the roundtable, stakeholders provided feedback on       how to further improve the CFATS program. For example,       industry stakeholders expressed concerns about duplicative       regulatory regimes between DHS and the Bureau of Alcohol,       Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives; advised that DHS should       not make terror screening mandatory for Tier 3 and Tier 4       facilities; complained about inadequate communication from       DHS about changes in facilities' tiering; and discussed how a       CFATS recognition program can provide greater regulatory       relief. We also heard from a CFATS chemical inspector on       basic and continuous training issues and need for       improvement, particularly with respect to cybersecurity. In       addition, the Committee's oversight has shown a need for DHS       to report on new metrics that will show if the program is       effectively measuring risk reduction and addressing the       current threat environment.        Incorporating this feedback from CFATS stakeholders,       Chairman Johnson introduced S. 3405 on September 4, 2018.       Senator Capito is a cosponsor. S. 3405 reauthorizes the CFATS       program for five years and brings  [[Page H267]]       much-needed regulatory relief to the U.S. chemical industry       while effectively balancing safety and security. On September       26, 2018, the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and       Governmental Affairs unanimously reported S. 3405 favorably       by voice vote. On September 28, 2018, Rep. Katko, Rep.       Moolenaar, and Rep. Cuellar introduced H.R. 6992, a       bipartisan House companion.        In the coming weeks, we hope the committees of jurisdiction       will continue to work together, as they have throughout this       Congress, to find areas of agreement to reauthorize and       improve the CFATS program. The purpose of the reauthorization       process must be to improve federal regulatory programs       incorporating lessons learned from Congressional oversight.       S. 3405 provides a path for the CFATS program to continue for       an additional five years without inflicting burdensome and       duplicative regulations on DHS's industry partners. If       Congress fails to reform the CFATS program, we believe the       program should expire and not continue to be reauthorized via       annual appropriations.        We look forward to working with you to reauthorize the       CFATS program with commonsense reforms before the conclusion       of the 115th Congress. Thank you for your attention to this       important subject.            Sincerely,      Ron Johnson,        Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental       Affairs.      Shelley Moore Capito,        Chairman, Subcommittee on Homeland Security Committee on       Appropriations.                                   ____                                  Department of Homeland Security,                                  Washington, DC, November 29, 2018.      Hon. Bennie Thompson,      Ranking Member, Committee on Homeland Security, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Ranking Member Thompson: I write to you today in       support of the reauthorization of the Chemical Facility Anti-      Terrorism Standards (CFATS). The Department of Homeland       Security's (DHS) CFATS authorities will expire in sixty days,       which would prevent us from setting security standards and       implementing measures that would reduce the risk of hazardous       chemicals from falling into the wrong hands.        We continue to face one of the most serious terrorist       threat environments since 9/11. Foreign terrorist       organizations are urging recruits to use simple weapons,       including toxic chemicals, to target public spaces and       events. Terrorists have already used rudimentary chemical       weapons on the battlefield and we face the increased risk       that they could use these weapons outside of conflict zones.       In response, DHS has stepped up its security posture,       including the establishment of the Office of Countering       Weapons of Mass Destruction. But we must also ensure that       dangerous agents are secured at the source to prevent our       enemies from exploiting them.        The Department's CFATS program is a successful public-      private partnership focused on preventing the misuse of       dangerous chemicals. Since its inception in 2006, it has       played a key role in bringing our nation's chemical security       standards to a higher level, and it has made it harder for       nefarious actors to acquire deadly agents and to exploit       potential security vulnerabilities for attacks. Our national       security depends on the authorities provided by CFATS, from       securing cyber control systems to vetting facility personnel       for terrorist ties. We cannot let our guard down. The stakes       are too high.        The Department has reviewed the language included in S.       3405, Protecting and Securing Chemical Facilities from       Terrorist Attacks Act of 2018, and understands the intent is       to improve this important regulatory program. The Department       agrees that critical review of the program's structure is       important. However, we believe that if the program were to       lapse--as a result of the current sun-setting provision--it       would increase the risk to our country and create uncertainty       across the chemical industry.        To that end, I am requesting that Congress consider a       short-term reauthorization of the program in its current       form. If reauthorized, I will direct the Cybersecurity and       Infrastructure Security Agency to conduct a comprehensive       audit to assess additional opportunities to enhance program       effectiveness and efficiency. This time will afford us the       opportunity to take into account past performance and to       evaluate Congressional recommendations, industry impact, and       potential changes that can strengthen the program. This audit       would be conducted in full collaboration with the appropriate       Congressional committees.        In the four years since the initial multi-year       authorization in 2014, DHS has and continues to innovate and       streamline the CFATS program, while the chemical industry,       assured of the stability provided by a longer-term       authorization, has made long-term investments in security       measures. This is a win for both government and industry.       This progress would be disrupted in the absence of compliance       requirements and is yet another reason why CFATS       reauthorization is needed.        Through your leadership, the American people and our       homeland are more secure and resilient than ever before.       Please consider a short-term reauthorization of CFATS so we       can continue to be vigilant against those who wish us harm.       Should you have any questions, please have your staff contact       the DHS Office of Legislative Affairs.        The Office of Management and Budget advises that there is       no objection to the submission of this letter from the       standpoint of the Administration's program.            Best Regards,                                               Kirstjen M. Nielsen,                                                         Secretary.     Mr. Speaker, as Secretary Nielsen notes  in her letter, `` . . . if the program were to lapse--as a result of  the current sunsetting provision--it would increase the risk to our  country and create uncertainty across the chemical industry.''   The Secretary and I may not agree on everything, but we agree on  this: We cannot let this critical national security program fall victim  to this political game of chicken.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Richmond).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30  seconds to the gentleman from Louisiana.    Mr. Speaker, how much time do I have  remaining?    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Pallone).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1  minute to the gentleman from New Jersey.  [[Page H269]]         Mr. Speaker I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from New York (Mr. Tonko).    Mr. Speaker, H.R. 251 was introduced by  Democratic and Republican leadership of the Homeland Security Committee  and the Energy and Commerce Committee.   This bill would allow the Department of Homeland Security to continue  working with high risk chemical facility owners and operators  throughout the U.S. to guard dangerous chemicals against malicious  actors.                                time  1700    For proof of how grave this threat is, one need look no further than  West, Texas, where, in 2013, a perpetrator set fire to a fertilizer  plant, causing an explosion that leveled an entire town. More than a  dozen first responders and civilians lost their lives in the blast.   Allowing authority to lapse would throw away the progress that has  been made since 2014 and needlessly make our communities less secure.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues in the House to support H.R. 251  and call on the Senate to join us in maintaining this important  security program.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas  and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend, Ms.  Velazquez, for yielding me the time.   Mr. Speaker, we are currently on the 18th day of President Trump's  government shutdown. On a daily basis, the economic harm of the  shutdown is being felt more acutely by small businesses in the Federal  marketplace than their larger competitors. In contrast to large firms,  small firms often rely on just a few contracts to provide a large  portion of their annual revenue. As such, many report that, during the  shutdown, they may have to lay off staff  [[Page H271]]    Small firms are projected to lose out on nearly $301 million daily in  new contract work because agencies cannot enter into new contracts  during the shutdown.   I urge the President to put America first and agree to reopen the  government.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 226, the Clarity on Small  Business Participation and Category Management Act of 2019. H.R. 226  seeks to improve reporting on small business participation in Federal  contracting.   This legislation requires the Small Business Administration to report  to Congress on the number of small businesses awarded best in class  contracts and the dollar amount of such contracts. This information  should help us get answers regarding how category management impacts  the participation of small businesses, including minority-owned, women- owned, and veteran-owned companies, in the Federal marketplace.   Market research has shown that past contract consolidation efforts by  the Federal Government have decreased the number of small prime  contracting opportunities in the Federal workplace. In fiscal year  2017, the percentage of contracting dollars that went to small  businesses was 24 percent, down from 26 percent in fiscal year 2015. As  such, concerns about the impact of category management on small  businesses are understandable.   As a longtime advocate for small businesses, I am pleased to  cosponsor this legislation, and I thank the gentlewoman from New York  for bringing this bill forward.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support small businesses by  voting in favor of this legislation.
