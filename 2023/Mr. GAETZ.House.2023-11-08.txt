 Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, the FBI wants a massive new complex for  their Washington, D.C., area activities. They want to spend more than  $300 million on that complex.   Though the FBI has an employee base that is about 2.3 percent of the  United States military, Mr. Chairman, they are literally asking for  something that is larger than the Pentagon for the FBI.   My amendment would disallow any planning, spending, or distribution  of funds for that purpose. I don't believe that the FBI deserves a  massive new headquarters or Washington field office.   The activities inside of Washington, the Greater Washington metro  area, have really driven a lot of the investigative work we have done.  It is not bad folks from the FBI out of some field office in middle  America or elsewhere in the country. It is the Washington, D.C.-based  activities that have pressured other field offices for no good law  enforcement reason. It is the D.C.-based entities that have suppressed  credible investigative leads into criminal conduct over the objections  of other bureaus and offices, and they have initiated investigations  into American citizens merely for engaging in constitutionally  protected speech.   They have attempted to entrap Members of the United States Senate by  holding false classified briefings. That is the testimony we got from  Senator Grassley and Senator Johnson.   They have also worked hard to censor factual information harmful to  their preferred political candidates, notably the Hunter-Biden laptop  story that the FBI based in the D.C. metro area was involved in  cajoling censorship of.   Building a new headquarters would condone, reinforce, and enable the  Washington field office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation's  nefarious behavior. We shouldn't do it, and we should adopt this  amendment to ensure that is the case.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1545     Mr. Chair, it is not my grave concern that the FBI's  building is crumbling. It is my grave concern that the civil liberties  of Americans are crumbling. I wish we were more worried about that and  less worried about whether or not we have new carpet and wallpaper at  the FBI building.   My colleague from Arkansas says that the FBI headquarters is in a  state of disrepair. Mr. Chair, it is the FBI itself that is in a state  of disrepair.   While my colleague from Arkansas may be right that we may not always  hate the FBI, how about while we are most concerned about the things  they are doing we not go build them a new $300 million building.   My colleague says there needs to be a hearing. Let me tell you about  the hearing that mattered to me. Frankly, many of my Democrat  colleagues are also worried about civil liberties. That was the hearing  where we learned that the FBI has conducted over 278,000 illegal  queries on the FISA system, or the hearing that said that the Inspector  General found that 38 times an hour these people were violating FISA.   The notion that we would stand here and defend them, frankly, is  deeply disappointing. I think those folks deserve to sit in the rat- infested J. Edgar Hoover Building until they get their act straight  with America's civil liberties.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, where I think Leader Hoyer is correct is that  this effort would be incomplete in the absence of major reforms to FISA  and the other authorities that are abused, no matter who the people  are. The people have changed and the corruption has remained the same  at the FBI. Under Republican and Democrat leadership, we have seen  consistent abuses of Americans' civil liberties. To take tax money away  from our fellow Americans, who are the victims at times of these  abuses, and then build a new center for the FBI seems deeply unwise to  me.    Mr. Chair, I yield to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer) for the  purposes of a colloquy.    I appreciate that clarification, and I don't think anyone  would confuse his views with mine as it relates to the FBI.    Reclaiming my time.   Mr. Chair, I appreciate the distinction, and I am grateful that there  are a number of Democrats, like Ms. Lofgren and Mr. Nadler, who are  working very closely with Republicans to try to reform these  authorities so that people's Fourth Amendment rights are not violated.  Doing that alongside creating some new $300 million monstrosity for the  FBI, that is, quite literally, larger than the Pentagon, sends entirely  the wrong message, and that would support adoption of this amendment.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
