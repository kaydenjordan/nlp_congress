 Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. McGovern for yielding time  to me.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support the rule and the four underlying  bills to help fully reopen the United States of America. Here we are,  19 days into the Trump shutdown, and all we see is political posturing  from the White House and the Republican-controlled Senate, which has  failed to take any steps to reopen the government.   The President has made Federal employees political pawns to try and  get his way. He has put America and the hardworking men and women who  work for her in jeopardy.                                time  1300    Last week, I joined a bipartisan majority of the House in supporting  two bills to fully reopen the government. Unfortunately, the Senate has  failed to take up those bills. They would immediately reopen the  government and put 800,000 people back to work.   I know that the gentleman from Oklahoma said we have plenty of time.  Those were his words just now. We don't have plenty of time. We need to  get people back to work.   I want to share some stories from my district. Denver Federal Center  is in the middle of my district, and it has the highest concentration  of Federal agencies anywhere in the country outside of the D.C. area.  [[Page H306]]    More than 15,000 of these and other Federal workers in Colorado have  either been furloughed or forced to continue working without knowing  whether they will be paid or not.   One of these employees is Sherry who works for the EPA. Sherry is  furloughed and doesn't know when she will get back to work or if she  will be paid when the EPA reopens. Sherry has two sons with  disabilities who rely on counseling and treatment not covered by her  insurance. She is being forced to make decisions about how to continue  their treatment, pay for groceries, and keep up with her family's other  expenses.   Or take Shannon, who is a supervisor for the TSA. Shannon is still on  the job but doesn't know when she and her coworkers are going to get  paid for work. Shannon told my office: If the shutdown lasts through  this month, it will be nearly impossible for her family to make rent.  They barely made January payments and still have outstanding utility  and credit card bills.   I also met with Matt this morning who is an air traffic controller in  Denver. He and his coworkers have stayed on the job keeping our skies  and the traveling public safe, but will not receive paychecks on  Friday.   One more story is from Gabe who lives in Wheat Ridge, Colorado, where  I live. Gabe is a student who called my office concerned he won't be  able to start classes at the University of Colorado because his  registration with the Selective Service System cannot be processed  until the government reopens.   These are just a few examples of why we need to fully reopen the  government. I urge my friend from Oklahoma to work with Mr. Hoyer, Ms.  Pelosi, and Mr. McGovern to come up with solutions to this, to get  these people back to work as soon as possible,   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on the rule,  and ``yes'' on the underlying legislation.
