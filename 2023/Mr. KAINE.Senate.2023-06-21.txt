 Madam President, today, I am introducing legislation to  remove ``Robert E. Lee Memorial'' from the official name of Arlington  House.   This legislation is partially inspired by requests from descendants  of General Robert E. Lee and people who were enslaved at Arlington  House. This is an effort to promote a society that is more just and  equitable for all, regardless of race, by moving on from a public  symbol that honors a figure that fought to protect slavery.   Arlington House is the first name of the historic mansion, which sits  on Federal land within Arlington National Cemetery. The property is  administered by the National Park Service and overlooks the Potomac  River and the Nation's Capital. The house was built by Martha Custis  Washington's grandson, George Washington Parke Custis, as the Nation's  first memorial to George Washington. Later, his daughter married Robert  E. Lee and the couple lived in the home until the Civil War, when  Federal forces occupied the house and surrounding property. During that  period, the site was chosen to serve as a national military cemetery in  part to prevent Lee from returning.   Only in the 20th century, in 1955 and again in 1972, did Congress add  the commemorative text honoring Robert E. Lee to the site's formal name  in Federal statute. This was part of a retrograde effort across the  former Confederacy to bestow public recognition on prominent  Confederate figures as heroes while minimizing or whitewashing their  roles in taking up arms  [[Page S2189]]  against the United States to preserve slavery. As Senator from the  State that has among the most difficult histories when it comes to  slavery, civil rights, and Confederate monuments, I believe these  symbolic proposals matter, that the Federal Government should reserve  honorifics for individuals whose lives advanced American values and  ideals, not detracted from them.   Today, the National Park Service is dedicated to telling the story of  those who were enslaved at the Arlington House. I am hopeful that this  name change will help to do just a little bit more to encapsulate the  full history of the site, which included the presence of many families  and generations throughout history, such as the Syphax, Burke, Parks,  and Gray families.   I am pleased that companion legislation is also being introduced in  the U.S. House of Representatives by my colleague, Representative Don  Beyer, who has led this effort for years.                            ____________________     Madam President, today, I am introducing legislation to  remove ``Robert E.
