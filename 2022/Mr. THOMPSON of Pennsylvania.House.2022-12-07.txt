 Madam Speaker, I rise today to  recognize the 81st anniversary of National Bible Week.   In 1941, weeks before the United States entered into World War II,  Franklin D. Roosevelt declared the week of Thanksgiving as National  Bible Week. This celebration recognizes the spiritual and historical  significance of the Bible. It is a week where we can come together and  celebrate this holy book. The Bible shaped our Nation's history and  continues to provide guidance to the lives of so many.   Madam Speaker, I am grateful to live in a country where we can freely  read Scripture and worship the Lord without fear of persecution. The  Bible is timeless and continues to provide us with words of wisdom,  comfort, and guidance as we navigate unprecedented times.   Madam Speaker, I leave you with this verse from 2 Timothy 3:16-17,  one that I keep close to my heart: ``All Scripture is breathed out by  God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for  training in righteousness, that the man of God may be competent,  equipped for every good work.''   May God continue to bless the United States of America.                            ____________________
