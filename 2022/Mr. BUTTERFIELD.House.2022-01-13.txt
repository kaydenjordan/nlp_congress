 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 868, I  call up the bill (H.R. 5746) to amend title 51, United States Code, to  extend the authority of the National Aeronautics and Space  Administration to enter into leases of non-excess property of the  Administration, with the Senate amendment thereto.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I have a motion at the desk.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and insert extraneous material into the Record on the House  amendment to the Senate amendment to H.R. 5746.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 5746, the Freedom  to Vote: John R. Lewis Act. As President Biden made clear in his speech  in Atlanta on Tuesday, the time to act to protect the right to vote and  the very essence of our democracy is now. The bill we are considering  today meets the gravity of this moment.   H.R. 5746, Mr. Speaker, combines two pieces of legislation vital to  ensuring every American has free, equitable, and secure access to the  ballot: The Freedom to Vote Act and the John R. Lewis Voting Rights  Advancement Act, the latter of which critically also includes the  Native American Voting Rights Act.   Together, Mr. Speaker, these bills will combat the wave of voter  suppression laws we saw enacted in States across the country following  the Supreme Court's decision in Shelby County v. Holder, a decision  that undermined the essential preclearance protections of the Voting  Rights Act, which accelerated at an alarming rate following the  unprecedented voter turnout in the 2020 elections.   Rather than responding to increased voter participation with  welcoming arms and provoter policies, States have instead been enacting  laws that roll back access and aim to erect roadblocks to the ballot  box.   Despite a 2020 election that election security experts said was the  most secure in American history, according to the Brennan Center For  Justice, 19 States have enacted 34 restrictive voting laws in the last  12 months.   The time, Mr. Speaker, to act is now. Voter suppression and  discrimination are alive and well. It is our duty and firmly within our  constitutional powers as a Congress to protect the rights of the voter  and ensure equal access to the franchise.   This bill, Mr. Speaker, does just that. It sets nationwide standards  for access to early voting; promotes voter registration through  automatic voter registration, same-day voter registration, and online  voter registration; gives every voter access to no-excuse absentee  voting; protects the security of our election infrastructure and our  precious election workers; addresses the rising threat of election  subversion; puts an end to partisan gerrymandering; curbs the torrent  of dark money flooding our politics; and, yes, it restores the critical  protections of the 1965 Voting Rights Act and protects the right to  vote for Native American voters.   We must set an example as a democracy and encourage, rather than  suppress, voter participation in our electoral process.   This legislation is critical to protecting our democracy. I encourage  all of my colleagues, Democrat and Republican, to support this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  New York (Mr. Jeffries), the chairman of the House Democratic Caucus.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman  from Massachusetts (Ms. Clark), our Assistant Speaker.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman  from Georgia (Ms. Williams), my friend.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman  from Michigan (Mrs. Lawrence), the second vice chair of the  Congressional Black Caucus.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman  from Florida (Ms. Wasserman Schultz), the dean of the Florida  delegation.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Sarbanes), the author of the For the People Act.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman  from Ohio (Mrs. Beatty), the distinguished and unrelenting chair of the  Congressional Black Caucus.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman  from Pennsylvania (Ms. Scanlon), who serves on the Committee on House  Administration and the Committee on the Judiciary.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman  from Texas (Ms. Garcia), my friend who serves on the Committee on the  Judiciary.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  the Commonwealth of Virginia (Mr. Beyer), my friend.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), my friend, the distinguished Democratic leader.    Mr. Speaker, I would ask my friend from North  Carolina to refer to the bill section that refers to voter ID. It  simply says this bill sets uniform national standards for States that  choose to require identification to vote.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Pelosi), the Speaker of the House of Representatives.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Clyburn), the Democratic whip, who  has led the way in this House and the South for generations.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Raskin), who is a member of the coveted  House Committee on House Administration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Aguilar), who is the distinguished vice-chair of the  Democratic Caucus and, I might say, a member of the Elections  Subcommittee of which I have the honor to chair.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman  from Selma, Alabama (Ms. Sewell), who is my dear friend and a sponsor  of the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act.    Madam Speaker, I want to remind my friend from  Arizona who just spoke that this bill sets uniform national standards  for States that choose to require identification to vote. The bill  gives States the flexibility--flexibility--to choose whether to require  voter IDs. It is not a mandatory voter ID law.   Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New York (Mr.  Jones), who is a thoughtful leader on the Committee on the Judiciary.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman  from Connecticut (Ms. DeLauro), who is my friend and chair of the  Appropriations Committee who stays in perpetual motion.    Madam Speaker, may I inquire about how much time  each side has remaining.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman  from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee), my friend who is another Member who stays  in perpetual motion and who is a senior member on the Judiciary  Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman  from Texas (Mr. Green), my friend and classmate from Houston, Harris  County.    Madam Speaker, at this time in the interest of time,  I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Allred), my friend  from Dallas, who represents the 32nd Congressional District.    Madam Speaker, again, how much time do I have  remaining?    Madam Speaker, I say to the gentleman that I am  prepared to close.   Mr. Davis is my friend, and I want the world to know that.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may  consume in order to close.   First of all, Madam Speaker, let me thank the gentleman from Illinois  (Mr. Rodney Davis) for his kind words.   When Members of Congress say to each other, ``you are my friend,'' I  just want the world to know that we mean that sincerely. Mr. Davis and  I are genuinely friends. I am the chairman of the subcommittee. He is  the ranking member of our full committee, and we have a whole  relationship. We respect each other. I thank Mr. Davis so much.   And I thank our chair of the full Committee on House Administration,  Congresswoman Zoe Lofgren, who allowed me to manage the floor today.  And I want to thank her for her leadership, not only on this committee,  but also on the Committee on the Judiciary.    Madam Speaker, this has been a healthy debate. This is the way  Congress should work. This is a healthy debate, and I look forward to  debate in the Senate. I hope it will start forthwith and conclude on  Monday. I look forward to passage in the United States Senate.   Madam Speaker, the choice before the House today is clear. We must  protect our democracy.   It is past time for this Congress to act. Historically, we have come  together to protect the right to vote. From the Voting Rights Act of  1965, that I remember so well, its subsequent reauthorizations, and  various election administration bills, we have protected and expanded  the right to vote. And Madam Speaker, we must do that again.   The Voting Rights Act works. Along with Lani Guinier, and Julius  Chambers, and Leslie Winner, and Jack Greenberg, of the NAACP Legal  Defense Fund, I joined with them in the 1980s and successfully  litigated Voting Rights Act cases in North Carolina. The Voting Rights  Act works.   Throughout my career, I have witnessed this body come together to  ensure all Americans have a voice in this democracy. We must do that  again now.   One of our most sacred rights in this country is the right to vote.  Indeed, as the Supreme Court observed in Wesberry v. Sanders: ``Other  rights, even the most basic''--the most basic--``are illusory if the  right to vote is undermined.''   As a Congress, as a Nation, we cannot, we must not tolerate any voter  suppression, any voter discrimination of any kind in any State in  America.   And so, I respectfully urge all of my colleagues, Democrat and  Republican, all 435 of us, I urge all of us to support this bill. Vote  ``yes.''   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time for a vote.    Madam Speaker, I include in the Record the following  letters of support for the Senate Amendment to H.R. 5746.                                          National Urban League,                                     New York, NY, January 13, 2022.        Dear Representative: As President and CEO of the National       Urban League, and on behalf of its 91 affiliates in 37 states       and the District of Columbia, I am writing to express our       strong support for the House Amendment to the Senate       Amendment to H.R. 5746, the Freedom to Vote: John R. Lewis       Act, as it is considered in the House and Senate in the       coming days. As a historic civil rights organization       dedicated to ensuring that all people are able to exercise       their fundamental right to vote, we stand with our fellow       civil rights organizations in supporting this bill.        The Freedom to Vote: John R. Lewis Act will ensure that       voters can safely and freely cast their ballots, protect       against election sabotage, stop partisan gerrymandering, and       limit the influence of dark money in politics. In 2021 alone,       19 states have enacted 34 new laws that suppress the right to       vote for all Americans and more are under consideration       today. In addition, states are pursuing manipulative       redistricting effoits which discriminate against and dilute       the representation of Black and Brown voters. This       legislation would fight back against these attacks and ensure       the ability for every American to participate in safe,       accessible, and transparent elections.        Our organization fully endorses this bill, which responds       to the current needs of this nation in the fight for voting       rights, and urges you to support this legislation. For more       information, please contact Yvette Badu-Nimako, Senior       Director for Judiciary, Civil Rights and Social Justice.            Sincerely,                                                  Marc H. Moria,                              President and Chief Executive Officer,                                             National Urban League.  [[Page H173]]                                    ____                                                                                  Fair Fight Action,                                                   January 13, 2022.        Dear Representative: We write in strong support of the       House Amendment to the Senate Amendment to H.R. 5746, the       Freedom to Vote: John R. Lewis Act, which will ensure that       voters can safely and freely cast their ballots, protect       against election sabotage, and stop partisan gerrymandering.       This bill is critical to mitigating the harmful effects of       extreme anti-voter bill SB 202, which passed in the Georgia       legislature in 2021 and will severely restrict voting access       for countless eligible Georgia voters.        Georgia is just one of 19 states that enacted 34 new laws       that restrict access to the ballot box in 2021 alone. Just       four days into Georgia's 2022 session, anti-voter legislators       are already attempting to prohibit drop boxes entirely. In       Georgia and in states across the country, carryover bills       from 2021--including bills that would ban no-excuse vote by       mail and end automatic voter registration--are still active.       What's more, candidates are running for top election offices       peddling the Big Lie. We must stem the tide on this insidious       erosion of our democracy. Black and brown voters in Georgia       and across the country are looking to Senators to stand on       the right side of history by voting yes on the Freedom to       Vote: John R. Lewis Act. This legislation would fight back       against these attacks and ensure the ability for every       American to participate in safe, accessible, and transparent       elections.        Our organization fully endorses this bill and urges you to       support this legislation.            Sincerely,                                                 Fair Fight Action.                                   ____                                                                          The Leadership Conference,                                   Washington, DC, January 13, 2022.        Dear Representative: On behalf of The Leadership Conference       on Civil and Human Rights, a coalition of more than 230       national organizations committed to promoting and protecting       the civil and human rights of all persons in the United       States, we write in strong support of the Freedom to Vote:       John R. Lewis Act.        This legislation fills a distinct and critical role in       combatting barriers to voting and protecting our democracy.       Every American should be able to rely on a baseline level of       voting access, free from obstacles to the voting booth or       attempts to dilute or nullify their votes. Only passage of       the Freedom to Vote: John R. Lewis Act can make this       aspiration a reality. We urge you to move swiftly and pass       this legislation.        For far too long, our elections have been undermined by       practices and tactics intended to undercut the power and       representation of African Americans, Latinos, Asian Americans       and Pacific Islanders, Native Americans, people with       disabilities, and other communities historically excluded       from our political process. The Freedom to Vote: John R.       Lewis Act is a comprehensive package that would address these       barriers, including by establishing uniform national       standards for elections and restoring essential provisions of       the Voting Rights Act of 1965.        The Freedom to Vote: John R. Lewis Act would set a basic       federal foundation for voting access for all Americans. It       would require states to modernize voter registration by       instituting automatic and same-day registration, protecting       against discriminatory purges, allowing all voters to request       mail ballots, and ensuring voters have access to early       voting. The legislation would also permit voters who lack       photo identification to use a variety of documents to       establish their identity, restore voting rights to citizens       with past convictions once they complete any term of       incarceration, and prevent state election subversion.        Moreover, the bill would also ban partisan gerrymandering       and ensure protections in the redistricting process for       communities of color and people who speak a primary language       other than English. These reforms will make it easier for       everyone to vote--and virtually all of them address barriers       that disproportionately affect Black, Latino, Asian, and       Native American voters and voters with disabilities and are       modeled after reforms that have been successfully implemented       in multiple states.        The Freedom to Vote: John R. Lewis Act would stop most of       the worst anti-voter measures that some lawmakers are       proposing and passing in states across the country. For       instance, the bill would eliminate efforts to roll back early       voting by ensuring states offer at least two weeks of early       voting, including on nights and weekends. Furthermore, the       legislation would require that provisional ballots are       counted within a county and create a minimum standard for       secure drop boxes, as well as establish Election Day as a       federal holiday. By providing a baseline set of national       voting rules that every American can rely on, the bill       protects all Americans, including voters of color, against       efforts to manipulate those rules. In addition, it includes       much-needed protections for groups including students, voters       with disabilities, and military and overseas voters.        The legislation would also restore the essential provision       of the Voting Rights Act that prevents the adoption of       discriminatory voting practices before they go into effect by       establishing a transparent process for protecting the right       to vote. In addition, it will restore and strengthen other       provisions of the Voting Rights Act to help bring down the       barriers erected to silence Black, Brown, and Native people;       young voters; people with disabilities; and new Americans and       ensure everyone has a voice in the decisions impacting our       lives. Finally, the bill includes the Native American Voting       Rights Act, which protects voting rights for Indigenous       communities who face myriad unique challenges to fully       participating in our democracy.        The Voting Rights Act was passed with leadership from both       the Republican and Democratic parties, and the       reauthorizations of its enforcement provisions were signed       into law each time by Republican presidents: President       Richard Nixon in 1970, President Gerald Ford in 1975,       President Ronald Reagan in 1982, and President George W. Bush       in 2006. For more than half a century, protecting citizens       from racial discrimination in voting has been bipartisan       work.                                  Conclusion         In 1965, Congress passed the Voting Rights Act to outlaw       racial discrimination in voting, and it became our nation's       most successful and consequential civil rights law.       Previously, many states barred Black voters from       participating in the political system through literacy tests,       poll taxes, voter intimidation, and violence. By outlawing       the tests and devices that prevented people of color from       voting, the Voting Rights Act and its prophylactic       preclearance formula put teeth into the 15th Amendment's       guarantee that no citizen can be denied the right to vote       because of the color of their skin.        For decades, Congressman John Lewis implored his colleagues       in Congress to realize the promise of equal opportunity for       all in our democratic process. When President Lyndon Johnson       signed the Voting Rights Act, he declared the law a triumph       and said, ``Today we strike away the last major shackle of .       . . fierce and ancient bonds.'' But 56 years later, the       shackles of white supremacy still restrict the full exercise       of our rights and freedom to vote. Before his death,       Congressman Lewis wrote: ``Time is of the essence to preserve       the integrity and promises of our democracy.'' It is long       past time for Congress to realize the promise of democracy       for all and support the Freedom to Vote: John R. Lewis Act.
