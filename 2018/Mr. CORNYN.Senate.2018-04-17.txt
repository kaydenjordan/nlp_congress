 Mr. President, I come to the floor to offer some remarks  on the decision of the President of the United States to order  precision missile strikes on three facilities in Syria last Friday  night.   This action demonstrates American leadership in the face of gross  human rights violations and, as we all recall, President Obama's  redline, which was not enforced, which indeed is a provocation in and  of itself.   I am glad this President has seen fit now, not just once but on two  occasions, to punish the Syrian regime for such gross human rights  violations. These actions are consistent with our values and legal  authorities provided to the President under the Constitution. They are  similar to decisions made by Presidents Clinton and Obama in Kosovo and  Libya.   While not unprecedented, clearly what occurred is very serious. So I  want to take just a few moments to explain why I think the strikes were  justified and were the appropriate course of action taken against the  Assad regime.   What we now know is, the Syrian government, on April 7, attacked  civilians in the city of Duma, killing at least 70 and injuring 500  more. To carry out the attack, the regime used chlorine and sarin gas  against its own people. We know this because credible medical  personnel--including the World Health Organization--reported physical  symptoms that indicated these substances had been used. People were  convulsing in the streets, their nervous systems were attacked, their  pupils were constricted, all telltale signs of these chemicals.   When civilians suffer in this way, there is nothing normal or  acceptable about it--even in a country grappling with a brutal civil  war. That Bashar al-Assad inflicted these crimes on his own people  makes them even darker and more insidious.   Chemical weapons have long been the kind of redline in the realm of  armed, international conflict. After World War I, the 1925 Geneva  Protocol banned chemical and biological weapons because they are  different in kind from guns, sabers, and bombs.   One reason they are different is because of the suffering they  inflict on their victims. Another reason is because of their  indiscriminate nature. Gases, by their very nature, are impossible to  control. They spread in the atmosphere. You can't quarantine gas inside  of a defined battlefield, which means civilians can't and will not be  spared. In other words, there is nothing surgical or targeted about  these weapons. The use of them can't be tailored to avoid harming  children and innocent bystanders. They are instruments of terror, short  and simple, and their brutality and lethality are stunning.    A third reason these weapons are so atrocious is because of the  slippery slope they provide. If gas attacks are tolerated in the  international community, what comes next--biological, radiological, or  nuclear weapons? That is not an unreasonable question. The free world  must therefore stand unified against the use of chemical weapons. The  failure to do so sends a signal of idleness or even complicity to the  dictators of the world.   The Geneva Protocol that eventually led to the Chemical Weapons  Convention has been ratified by more than 190 nations. This means there  is a near global consensus that the kinds of gas attacks perpetrated by  Bashar al-Assad are completely out of bounds, even in war zones.   As I stand here today, I want to offer my support for both the  mission that was carried out and the underlying objective, which was to  degrade Syria's capability to research, develop, and deploy chemical  weapons--ones that have clearly done tremendous amounts of harm.   The targets of our Syrian missile strikes were a research center and  two storage facilities used in the production and testing of chemical  and biological weapons. We hope that now that these facilities are  destroyed, Assad will be perhaps persuaded not to use chemical weapons  once and for all. There is reason to be skeptical, as we know, since he  has before. We all remember last year when we struck Syrian airfields  after similar provocations. Bashar al-Assad ignored our warning, gassed  his own people, and has now paid a higher price. Will it be enough? Who  can know, but I hope so. The consequences of his cruel and repressive  tactics were swift and circumscribed airstrikes ordered by the  President of the United States. They protected against the loss of  innocent life and avoided sparking a larger regional conflict.   We are grateful to our allies, Great Britain and France, which played  a pivotal role in the mission. We are also grateful to our uniformed  military for their meticulous planning, flawless execution, and  courageous leadership.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that  notwithstanding rule XXII, if applicable, at 1 p.m. on Wednesday, April  18, the Senate resume consideration of the Muniz nomination, with 1  hour of debate remaining, equally divided between Senator Gillibrand or  her designee and Senator Alexander or his designee, on the nomination;  further, that following the use or yielding back of that time, the  Senate vote on the nomination as under the previous order; finally,  that the Senate now proceed to legislative session for a period of  morning business, with Senators permitted to speak for up to 10 minutes  each.    Mr. President, for the information of our colleagues, I  know the leader plans to make a motion to proceed to S.J.
