 Madam Speaker, I rise today in  opposition to H.R. 1, which is just a continuation of Republicans'  relentless attack on working families. This is not a tax plan; it is a  tax scam.   This President won't disclose how he is going to benefit from this  tax scam. He has disrespected us all. This tax scam will eliminate the  student loan interest deduction. It will eliminate State and local tax  deductions on income. It will restrict the mortgage interest deduction.   It is estimated that 47 million taxpayers face a tax hike. Almost  half of any tax cuts will go to the richest 1 percent. Residents of my  State of California will face the largest net tax increase totaling  $12.1 billion in 2027 alone.   Madam Speaker, I call on the President of the United States of  America to show his tax income and to show his tax plan. He needs to  let us know what he is all about and what his taxes are. From the very  beginning, he said he couldn't show them at the time that he was asked  when he was first inaugurated into this Presidency, but time has  passed. It is time for the President to show us his tax returns, rather  than coming up with a tax scam asking everybody else to pay up, to pay  more, and saying that this is a middle class tax cut when it is not.   We want to know more about him and his plan. So with my 1 minute, my  2 minutes, whatever it is, this evening is all about saying a message  to the President.   Even though I will be cautioned that I am not to talk to the  President, I am calling on the President: Show your tax returns.
