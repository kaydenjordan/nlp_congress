 Mr. Chair, I thank Congresswoman Shalala for her work and  this timely amendment to add $10 million for critical services for  children for things like legal services, child advocates, counseling,  and mental health services.   There is a humanitarian catastrophe at the border today. In San  Diego, we see the kids and families who have traveled a long and  treacherous path, but when they arrive, they are met with inhumane  living conditions. ICE and CBP facilities are overcrowded, and it  hardly gets better once the families are released.   Refugee resettlement agencies and the local governments have been the  primary providers of these support services. The influx of families  have left shelters overburdened and community resources strained.   The San Diego community has stepped up to meet this need when the  administration has not, but these extra funds will protect families and  ensure that all who claim asylum get the due process they are  guaranteed under international law.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.
