 Madam Speaker, I am so grateful to the appropriators for  including seven funding priorities for my district, El Paso, Texas, in  the base bills, including funding for health technology upgrades,  police body cameras, drinking water and wastewater infrastructure, and  much more.   Each year I work to bring El Paso's voice to the table, and my  amendments focus on our priorities.   These amendments include increased funding for the Office of Civil  Rights at the Department of Education to support economically  disadvantaged communities; emphasizing the need for a binational COVID- 19 vaccination plan; funding for water reuse programs in communities  experiencing drought conditions; and several amendments directing  funding towards communities like El Paso, so we aren't left behind in  the fight against the climate crisis; and so much more.   Lastly, we have witnessed congressionally appropriated funding being  irresponsibly diverted by Governors in States like mine, so I am happy  to see all subcommittees under this bill include my congressional  intent amendment expressing a strong urgency to ensure that States can  no longer do this.
