 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak against this  unconscionable abortion on demand until birth act. I strongly oppose  this extreme bill.   I am a mother and a grandmother of two precious grandsons, and I am  committed to protecting the life of the unborn. As a pharmacist, I have  helped many women overcome fertility issues to be able to give birth to  these treasured trusts from Heaven, which supporters of this bill deem  expendable and nonviable.    These same women were desperate to have and to hold these precious  children that this bill would make so easy to abort for such reasons as  inconvenience, wrong sex, medical inadequacies, and bad timing. The  uncompromising push to allow on-demand abortions until birth is  heartbreaking. It would overturn almost all pro-life laws put in place  by States to protect those unborn children, including late-term  abortion bans.   We cannot allow this to happen. I will be voting no on the abortion  on demand bill. And let me tell you, when I do, I will be thinking of  all the precious lives that have been saved through the very pro-life  protections that this bill seeks to overturn.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my fellow colleagues who care about the sanctity  of life to join me in opposition.
