 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. King),  my dear friend, for all of his work in this area; not just his work,  but his leadership.   I know his heart beats with a desire to make sure that any heart  beating is protected.                                time  2100    I heard a comedian on television this last night saying something  about, ``Yeah, so many years ago I had an abortion because it is my  choice,'' something of that order. The audience cheered and clapped. I  thought, ``A comedian?'' My heart wasn't angry. My heart just broke for  that child.   As my friend knows, my wife and I, our first child came 8 to 10 weeks  early. They tried for 3 days to stop the contractions, and after 3 days  it was clear our daughter was coming. Back then, it was far enough back  that we really didn't know if we were going to be able to keep her.   The first day she was there in Tyler, we were losing her. I had had  malpractice cases as a judge that involved the condition. I know for  preemies they don't like to give too much extra oxygen because you get  to 100 percent and it may cause blindness. It is a condition called  retrolental fibroplasia. The retina has not matured enough, and in the  presence of oxygen, the blood vessels constrict and cause little fibers  to come out and separate from the back of the wall. I knew all of that.  I knew all about what was going on.   When the pediatrician came in and tried to intubate our child, tried  to get that tube in--he didn't intubate a lot of children. He was just  a wonderful, caring doctor. They lost her three times. The monitors  went off. They got her going again, tried to get the tube in so they  could get more oxygen to her little, undeveloped lungs. He didn't know  I was sitting there in the nursing station watching. It was like a  horror movie. I was sorry I ever started watching it, but I could not  leave until I found out how it came out.   Also, they were praying for my child and the doctor's hands and what  he was doing. But he finally got her intubated and came out sweating  profusely because he had that little child's life in his hands. I had  already held our child. I could hold her in one hand. I was careful and  preferred to use two.   But anyway, he made clear we needed to take her either to Dallas or  Shreveport. At that time--now all kids, if they have to go somewhere,  they go to Dallas, instate, from Tyler.   But at that time, I said: Well, which is more successful?   He said: It seems like the survival rate in Shreveport right now is a  little better.   I don't know what it is now.   But I said: Let's get her to Shreveport.   So I wasn't sure. Kathy had to stay in the hospital there in Tyler,  but I followed the ambulance and made sure she was checked in.   When I got over there, the doctor, I could understand why they had  such a good survival rate. His name is Dr. Tsing. He, with one of the  nurses, got me over to our daughter's isolette. It is open-air. They  had the monitors hooked up. They had the halo around her head piping in  extra oxygen.   He said: Please sit down here on this stool.   He said: Now, you are probably aware that her eyes are not  functioning properly. She can't recognize you when she opens her eyes  and tries to see, but she knows your voice. She has been listening to  your voice for months. She knows you, and she is comforted by your  voice because she knows you. So you sit here, and you talk to her, and  you caress her little arms and face and talk to her, and you will do  some good for her.   They said: We have a 2-hour limit on how long you can sit here, and  then you have to take a break for a couple hours and you can come back.   The last thing Kathy had asked was that I do anything I could to help  our little girl. So there I sat, and I caressed her little face.   The danger of a child born prematurely, the number one danger is the  lungs not being properly developed to get enough air in to actually  keep the child alive. So her breathing from the first moment of birth  was very, very shallow, and her heart rate was erratic, very fast. You  could see it on the monitors, very shallow, very fast, and very erratic  breathing and heartbeat. But she had a heartbeat.   As the gentleman from Iowa has said many times, my friend, and Janet  said many times: Gee, you walk in a room. You see a body not moving.  You check to see if there is a heartbeat; and if there is a heartbeat,  you know you have to call an ambulance. You have to do everything you  can to try to keep that person living, which is, again, the principle  behind the Heartbeat bill.   Her heart was beating just so very fast and erratically, but when I  was playing with her little hand, she took her whole hand, it wrapped  around the end of my finger, and she held on tight. It was a tight  grip. This was a child whose lungs are not working so well, eyes aren't  working that great, but she was holding on and holding tight.   I was there for 3 or 4 hours before Dr. Tsing came back. When he came  back, he said: Have you looked up at the monitors?   I had not for a couple of hours or so. I looked up, and the breathing  was very shallow, but it was no longer erratic. It had a regular beat,  a regular rhythm to it. The heartbeat was still very fast, but it was  not erratic. It was a regular heartbeat with a regular pattern.   Dr. Tsing said: She is drawing strength from you. She is drawing life  from you.   I can tell you, when you know this little child is drawing life from  you and strength from you, you don't want to leave. Finally, after 8  hours, the nurses and the doctor came over.   They said: You have to leave. It has been 8 hours.   I said: I don't want to leave. The monitors show she has a regular  heartbeat, regular breathing. I don't want to leave.   They said: You were supposed to leave 6 hours ago. You have to leave  now. Go somewhere.   I did leave and went to McDonald's. My heart was up there with our  daughter, and so I rear-ended a lady right there by McDonald's. The  policeman was very nice, and the lady that lived there in Shreveport  was extremely nice, but I couldn't wait to get back to our child.    She is extraordinary, absolutely extraordinary in every way, one of  the top artists in the world. She was chosen to be one of the first 12  artists that Swatch Art Peace Hotel dedicated to the arts in Shanghai,  one of the first 12 they selected to live there as artist-in-residence  from all over the world. She was one of the first 12--amazing talent.   I think about the talent of so many, 60 million children. Every one  of them had some kind of gift, and they are gone.   I have appreciated the National Right to Life when I was in college,  when I was out of college, and when I was a prosecutor after law  school. When I was a practicing lawyer, local businessman, my own firm,  I was elected a judge, I never wavered in my appreciation of the  National Right to Life.   I want to make sure that people understand, we also have a Texas  Right to Life. It is not National Right to Life. It is its own  organization.   I have talked to the Grahams. The Grahams that head up the Texas  Right to Life, God bless them. They have done incredible work, but they  make clear, we don't care whose bill it is, we don't care who came up  with the idea; if there is any bill that will prevent even one precious  life from being aborted, that life being saved and allowed a chance to  be loved and to love and to not be aborted, then they are on board.   That is the way everybody I knew who is pro-choice, meaning you  choose  [[Page H778]]  to live, that is the way I thought everybody was. So it has been quite  an awakening to be here in Washington and to have any groups,  especially one that I put up on a pedestal for so many years, for  decades now, that says: Our board doesn't support a bill.   We have a bill, the pain-capable bill, heck, any bill--pain-capable?  Yes, sign me on--that saves 5 to 15 percent of abortions, count me in;  I am there.   Then, National Right to Life may save 80, 90 percent of the children  who are being killed; count me in. I am in.   I thought that is where everybody would be. I don't know. I really  don't understand. If it is a turf battle, it wasn't our idea. Why is it  that any group doesn't support saving an additional life?   I do read the Bible every day. I made that promise I would read the  Bible, and I do that. I have just gone, again, through some of the Old  Testament books, and when I read the prophets talk about how evil a  society was, they said that this king did right in the eyes of the  Lord, and this king did evil in the eyes of the Lord. When the writer  wants to really illustrate the point that a society had become so evil  that it was an abomination to God, they would point out that they  sacrificed their children on the altar of an idol.   I remember reading that as a kid, and I thought: What could be worse  than that? I just cannot imagine a parent being willing to sacrifice  their child. I can imagine my parents, lots of parents, fighting to the  death to protect their child, but I just couldn't imagine how that  could happen in these Old Testament days.   Then I came to realize we have been doing that since the seventies.  We have been sacrificing these children who could survive on their own  on the altar of individual choice: I am too busy to do other things. I  don't have time for a child when there are parents begging for children  to adopt.   So I just appreciate so much my friend speaking up on behalf of the  unborn. We have heard from our Democratic friends so many times that a  society is judged by the way they protect those who cannot protect  themselves and help those who cannot protect themselves. Clearly, there  is nobody more innocent and more in need of protection than a child not  quite born that someone wants to kill.   So I appreciate my friend's illumination of what is going on. I thank  him for his efforts not just tonight, but every day.
