 Mr. Speaker, with all the issues people are dealing  with, the inflation, the high cost of everything, now we have the  Securities and Exchange Commission's incredulous new proposed rule  requiring small, privately run family farms to produce huge volumes of  climate-related information to be able to then sell their products to  public companies, which is going to be nearly impossible for small  farms. Inflation being driven by SEC new regs.   Farmers are facing an assault of repeated increases in regulations  and rises in inputs cost. When world leaders are warning of coming food  shortages, don't make it harder for farmers to do their jobs and grow  food for people to use.   Small family farms are struggling financially to keep their  operations up and running. They don't have the funds to hire a full- scale environmental compliance department to meet the SEC's ridiculous  proposed demands. Farmers are producing more food and fibers with less  inputs, like water, land, and labor than ever before.  [[Page H6891]]    The SEC needs to think about the unintended catastrophic consequences  this new rule will have on our Nation's farmers, and in turn, on our  food supply, which is already going to be short.   We need to fight together in a bipartisan effort to combat this  blatant government overreach.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Louisiana (Mr.  Johnson) for continuing to lead these in order to get this important  message out on what is facing Americans not because of a naturally  caused crisis but a man-made one, a government-made one. We are doing  it to ourselves.   Instead of addressing the economic crisis that is plaguing Americans,  the Democrats are prioritizing liberal initiatives and increasing  Federal spending, with some accounts receiving double-digit and even  triple-digit percentage increases typically through regulatory agencies  that are going to make our jobs harder to do.   We have issues. Mr. Speaker, this is just a small example right here  of some of the prices of things that are going up. It is not because we  have had hurricanes or things like that that have wiped out crops. No.  We have had a lot of droughts, but in my home State of California, some  of that drought and some of the shortages of water, indeed, are because  of government action.   The priorities that we see for spending include giving 20 percent  more money to the EPA. I have had the EPA work in conjunction with the  Army Corps of Engineers to stop people from farming fields in my  district because they think it might have an effect on the Clean War  Act or something like that. These are fields that have already been  farmed in the past and have been fallow for a period of time, and they  want to put them back into production. Oh, no, you need a permit. They  didn't think they needed a permit. They didn't know they needed a  permit, and so they get fined, big-time.   As Americans face this runaway inflation caused by out-of-control  government spending and other regulatory issues that drive up the cost  of everything, these are the solutions we get: even more government.   I put some reasonable amendments across recently to try and move  things  [[Page H6912]]  in the right direction and not have these outlandish spending ideas  take hold.   For example, in my home State of California, Mr. Speaker, you may  have heard of our high-speed rail project that supposedly would link  San Francisco to Los Angeles. Well, it sounded like a neat idea on  paper when it was proposed and finally voted on by the voters to put $9  billion of bond money toward that back in 2008 for a $33 billion  project.   So, they voted for it. Actually, they delayed the election several  times because they didn't want to vote in another bond in an atmosphere  that might not have been perfect, so they chose 2008, and somehow, it  passed 52 to 48 percent. At $9 billion, that was triggered by the  voters saying build a high-speed rail; you can't subsidize it; it has  to carry its own weight. The price soon, when we figured it out, 3  years later, tripled from $33 billion to $98.5 billion. It is projected  now to be about $105 billion.   I had a recent proposal saying: No more spending on this until we  actually have a handle on a few important items. They are not even  compensating the landowners in the valley so far for the land they are  taking by eminent domain that is in the right-of-way. They have all  this money, it is such a great idea, and they aren't getting around to  even paying the people whose land lies in the way of it. What is that  all about?   As well, they are not doing the environmental stuff properly to see  that the path is going to be properly handled as far as what might be  environmentally sensitive in that area.   Thirdly, they don't even have the whole route laid out. They don't  know how they are going to get south of Bakersfield through the  Grapevine, over the Grapevine, and around the Grapevine into L.A. Are  they going to build a $25 billion tunnel through there that might be  subject to seismic? Who knows. But they are still pursuing it anyway.   It has received $3.5 billion of stimulus money from the Obama era of  2009 money--2009, we are talking. Then, they want to get another $2  billion from the so-called infrastructure bill that passed recently.  That is $5.5 billion of Federal taxpayer money that all the 49 other  States get to pay for, for this boondoggle that, so far, they can maybe  lay their hands on $25 billion, the projection, for a project that is  going to cost $105 billion. They are going to be searching for $80  billion more. They have already gotten five out of the Federal  Government, pretty much. They want $80 billion more.   The whole premise of high-speed rail was that private investors  couldn't wait to come in to be part of this project to help build this  fast train from L.A. to San Francisco. The investors are staying away  until and unless you make guarantees that they will make money, and  that is not even allowed in the original proposition that was barely  passed by the voters.   There really is no end here on this. They will continue to pursue  Federal money because they don't have it at the local level. We have to  put a stop to that. That is why I offered an amendment.   This is at a time when people need lower priced fuels for their cars.  That is all driven by policies that are happening here in Washington,  D.C., pretty much. You can't blame it all on Ukraine and Putin. Yes, we  import maybe 7 or 8 percent of our oil. We could have made that up  quickly with known reserves of energy we have here, energy we can  produce in this country.   We don't need Russian oil. We don't need Putin oil. We don't need  foreign oil. We can do it here. We should be doing it. But Biden is  making us pay the price with this incredible transition thing he is  talking about. It is just hurting the American people. Energy affects  the cost of everything, even the final bit where if you got it, then a  truck brought it.   In the meantime, California, under a bill called AB5, is putting  owner-operator trucks out of business because they are not part of an  employment--they don't belong to a union or what have you. In  Washington, D.C., they want to emulate that bill called AB5 under what  is called the PRO Act and have it cost everybody in the whole country  over that.   The ideas coming out of here are not helping the American people. It  is very tone-deaf here in Washington, D.C., and in the White House of  what the American people are struggling with, with inflation and more  profligate spending coming out of this place.   As I mentioned, the Army Corps of Engineers has been busy as a tool  of the EPA, working on something called the waters of the United  States. They want to be in charge of every drop of water that hits the  ground in the country. Even if it hits your roof, Mr. Speaker, and runs  down your gutter, there are some jurisdictions that want to control  that.   It is pretty ominous, especially when you look at my colleague before  me who spoke about the wheat situation in Kansas, as well as they are  having difficulty with their wheat crop down in Texas. I have wheat  growers up in the northern part of my State in the Klamath Basin that  if they could get just enough water, they could get a wheat crop. But  they are taking the water away and flushing it down the Klamath River,  ostensibly to help the fish population. But that doesn't even work  because they are trying to flush some disease or virus out of it, and  it doesn't even work. Yet, they keep doing it anyway.   It is kind of like with the delta in California, flushing water out  to save the delta smelt. The delta smelt population is basically  extinct, and they still flush millions of acre-feet of water out  through that.   So, California's agriculture is suffering. California's economy  suffers. Those people who are productive are now unemployed, needing  assistance instead of being part of the assistance. These are all  government regulations coming from D.C. and from California.   It also affects low-cost energy, renewable energy, hydroelectric  power. When they take that water away from the Klamath, when they take  it away from Shasta Dam and run it out the ocean, that means your  electricity prices go up, Mr. Speaker. This all affects the economics  of American families because of regulations and profligate spending  here in Washington, D.C.   As we look at the world food situation, as my colleague from Kansas  has talked about, we are not getting the wheat crop out of the Midwest.  There is not enough to run a combine. As he mentioned, we can't even  run a combine up in Klamath Basin.   If they don't get the water for the wheat, where are they going to  run a combine to help us? Ukraine? They are dodging bombs right now.  Russia has 27 million tons of wheat tied up that they are not letting  out of the ports in Ukraine.   Where are we supposed to get the food? Hungary is cutting off their  exports of wheat. India is cutting off their exports of wheat. We can't  grow it in this country. Where in hell are people supposed to get food?  No one is going to come to help us.   America is always the one helping everyone else. We need water for  ag. We need the money they are wasting on high-speed rail, $105  billion. You could build 21 $5 billion dams for that and grow the food  in California that so many people depend on.   I will have an update on that as well as to why California food is  important not just in California to growers and workers there but to  people in New York, people in Pennsylvania, and people all through the  Midwest. What we grow is important not just for our local economy but  actually to keep things on the table that people need and demand.  Instead, we would be importing them or not having them at all.    It all starts here in Washington, D.C., with misplaced priorities  coming out of this administration that are not helping. I have to ask  often to the Biden administration and even some of my colleagues in  these two Houses here: Whose side are you on?
