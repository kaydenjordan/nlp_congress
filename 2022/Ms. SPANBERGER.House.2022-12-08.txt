 Mr. Speaker, I stand here today, a day after we  celebrated the life of A. Donald McEachin, to again on the House floor  remember the life and legacy of my friend, my mentor, and, as he used  to call me, his neighbor. When I was first running for Congress, Mr.  McEachin, Donald, used to tell people: I need a new neighbor in  Virginia.   I had the privilege of working closely with him, learning from him,  and being his friend throughout our service together in Congress and  our work across our shared communities.   He was a good man who endeavored to make others feel heard throughout  his career, whether he was in the courtroom, in the Virginia General  Assembly, or here in Congress.   For decades, he served his community each day with a passion for  people, a sense of humor, and an abiding faith in God. He was a  relentless advocate for those who needed a voice, our natural  resources, and every Virginian.   His passing leaves a hole in the hearts of so many. I will miss my  friend, my brother, my mentor, and I stand here on the House floor to  give my deepest condolences to his beloved wife, Colette; his  wonderful, adored children, Mac, Briana, and Alexandra; and his beloved  grandbaby.   He will be missed. We will continue to do right in his memory and in  his honor.                            ____________________
