 Madam Speaker, I rise today, standing on the  achievements of brave women who came before me, to commemorate the  centennial anniversary of the 19th Amendment House passage, expanding  the right for women to vote.   As we celebrate this historic day, I want to pay tribute to an  overlooked but trailblazing woman who helped make it possible, Delaware  pioneer and suffragist, Mary Ann Shadd Cary. In her prophetic words:  ``We should do more and talk less.''   Using the power of the pen, Shadd Cary was the first woman to edit  and publish a newspaper in North America, using that role to combat  systemic racism and slavery.   After the Civil War, she set her sights on a new cause: voting. She  became one of the first Black female lawyers in the United States to  testify before the House Judiciary Committee, in 1874, advocating for  women's suffrage in these very Halls.   Described by W.E.B. Du Bois as ``well-educated, vivacious, with  determination shining from her sharp eyes,'' Mary Ann Shadd Cary blazed  trails for women everywhere, and throughout her life, always fought in  the name of justice and equality.   We owe it to her and we owe it to all to continue to fight for our  rights.                            ____________________
