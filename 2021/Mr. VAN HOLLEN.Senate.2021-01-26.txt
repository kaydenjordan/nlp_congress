 Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the  nomination of Antony J. Blinken to be U.S. Secretary of State.   Mr. Blinken has decades of experience in foreign policy, beginning in  the early 1990s as the Special Assistant to the Assistant Secretary for  European and Canadian Affairs. He has since risen to senior foreign  policy positions on Capitol Hill and in the executive branch, including  as Democratic Staff Director on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee,  and as Principal Deputy National Security Adviser and Deputy Secretary  of State in the Obama administration. I have had occasion to work with  him over the years and can testify to his professionalism, diligence,  and good judgment.   Mr. Blinken faces an enormous task. The last 4 years have been rife  with chaos, division, and ineffective unilateralism. Under the so- called slogan of ``America First,'' President Trump turned his back on  allies and emboldened our adversaries, leaving the United States  weakened, vulnerable, and alone. Mr. Blinken must not only reverse the  damage done by President Trump; he must reinvigorate U.S. leadership in  a manner that meets the challenges we face today--from the existential  threat of climate change, to a more aggressive and confrontational  China.   To begin, Mr. Blinken must restore our alliances, rebuild our global  partnerships, expand our commercial ties, and rejoin the critical  international agreements and organizations recklessly abandoned by  President Trump. Already President Biden has reversed Trump's Muslim  ban, rejoined the Paris climate accords, and recommitted to the World  Health Organization. In the coming months, Mr. Blinken must work with  our allies to develop a united front to counter the threats posed by  adversaries such as China, Russia, and Iran. He must reaffirm our  commitment to NATO. He must reestablish U.S. leadership in providing  development and humanitarian assistance around the world, reasserting  U.S. values of democracy, human rights, and the rule of law.   As importantly, Mr. Blinken must restore the State Department itself.  The Trump administration routinely undermined and smeared our dedicated  career foreign and civil service officers. Rebuilding the morale of our  talented public servants will be imperative for the successful  execution of our foreign policy.   Given the breadth of his knowledge and experience, I am confident Mr.  Blinken is the right person to meet America's foreign policy  challenges, and I support his confirmation as U.S. Secretary of State.                            ____________________
