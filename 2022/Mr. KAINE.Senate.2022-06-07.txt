 Mr. President, as we continue our battle with  COVID-19, we must acknowledge the healthcare healers that are serving  in our rural communities. In particular, I would like to highlight the  work of the Health Wagon in Virginia. The Health Wagon is the oldest  mobile clinic in the Nation. Their mission is to provide compassionate,  quality healthcare to medically underserved people in Appalachia. The  Health Wagon works to mitigate barriers to healthcare access, taking  healthcare into the community, into places like grocery stores, food  banks, workplaces, and providing communities in southwest Virginia with  access to primary, specialty, dental and vision care.   Health Wagon originated 40 years ago with Sister Bernadette Kenny of  the Catholic order Medical Missionaries of Mary. Sister Bernie traveled  on rural mountain roads in her Volkswagen Beetle to deliver healthcare  to individuals in southwest Virginia. Now, the organization employs  more than 50 staff members across four clinics and four mobile units.  Their average patient is 41 years old, with 100 percent of patients  being uninsured or underinsured. Over the last year, the Health Wagon  has served 10,857 individual patients and documented 35,250 patient  encounters.   The Health Wagon has also been vital in the fight against COVID-19.  Since March 2020, the Health Wagon has provided more than 18,000 COVID- 19 tests, provided 19,567 COVID-19 vaccinations, and administered over  5,500 monoclonal antibody treatments. They do not bill for services,  and their programs are sustained by grants and donations from  individuals, corporations, and foundations. The Health Wagon is led by  president and CEO, Dr. Teresa Tyson. Dr. Tyson has served with the  Health Wagon for 30 years, and under her leadership, the organization  has received national recognition for its innovative projects in  telehealth space. The Health Wagon was the first to deliver a virtual  wound care clinic and conducted the first FAA-approved drone delivery  of medications in the United States. Dr. Tyson led the largest health  outreach of its kind in the Nation, as well as providing the first  telecytoscopy in the world in partnership with University of Virginia.  Dr. Tyson leads a group of caring and committed providers.   Rural communities are the backbone of our country, and the Health  Wagon has served the Appalachia community admirably. I thank them for  their service.                            ____________________
