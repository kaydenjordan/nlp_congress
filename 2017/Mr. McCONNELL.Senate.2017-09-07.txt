 Mr. President, I understand there is a joint  resolution at the desk that is due a second reading.    In order to place the joint resolution on the calendar  under the provisions of rule XIV, I object to further proceedings.    Now, Mr. President, at the outset of the week, I  outlined three issues we needed to address immediately: provide  resources for Hurricane Harvey and Hurricane Irma preparedness, ensure  that the government remains funded, and ensure that a default is  prevented so the emergency resources I mentioned can actually get to  Americans who need them.   That is what the legislation I filed cloture on yesterday achieves,  and it achieves it all together in one package. It will provide  certainty and stability for first responders, State officials, and the  many others involved in preparing for and recovering from these storms  with critically needed emergency resources that will not be interrupted  by the prospect of a shutdown or default.   The recovery effort for a record-setting storm like Harvey has  strained resources to the limit already. The advance of another  historic storm now makes the need for action even more urgent, so let's  work together and act on this legislation very quickly.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following  leader remarks, the Senate be in a period of morning business, with  Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each, until 11  a.m.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to amend my  previous consent request that it will be debate only, with Senators  permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each until 11 a.m.    I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  order for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I move to refer the House message on  H.R. 601 to the Committee on Appropriations with instructions to report  back forthwith with the Paul amendment No. 816.    I ask for the yeas and nays on my motion.    I have an amendment to the instructions.    I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the  amendment be dispensed with.  [[Page S5032]]     I ask for the yeas and nays on my amendment.    Madam President, I have a second-degree amendment at  the desk.    Madam President, I move to table the motion to refer,  and I ask for the yeas and nays.    For the information of all of our colleagues, the next  vote will be on the motion to table the Sasse motion on disaster  funding. With a little bit of cooperation, we will then set two votes  after lunch to get to passage of the bill this afternoon so it can be  sent over to the House today. Senators should expect additional votes  right after lunch.
