 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I don't know of any topic that is more  important for our country than the relationship between the United  States and China.   I am a big fan of history. I love to read about history. I think one  of the best ways to understand the future is to understand the past. It  strikes me that, at some point in the future, someone will write a book  about the 21st century, and I think that book will have mention of a  number of the things that consumed our time in political debate. I  believe the central issue globally that will define the 21st century is  the relationship between the United States and China, in which  direction it heads.   Let me say at the outset that China is destined to be what it already  is becoming: a rich, important, and powerful nation. That in and of  itself should not be threatening. It is a reality. It is one that I  think holds promise, to the extent that a rich and powerful China is a  responsible stakeholder in the affairs of the world.   I think there is another truth, and that is, what is developing today  is an incredibly serious imbalance between the United States and China  on trade and commerce, increasingly on diplomacy, and potentially-- eventually--militarily and geopolitical.   So when I come today to speak about China, it is not simply in the  context of our current trade tensions, which is a part of a much  broader issue. The fact of the matter is that this is the way we should  view it because this is the way the Communist Party of China views it.  The truth is that they view our trade tensions as an inevitable blip in  their long-term plan to supplant the  [[Page S5625]]  United States of America as the world's dominant political, military,  and economic power.   Now, it is understandable why many Americans would feel uneasy at the  prospect of being supplanted by China. First of all, they have seen so  many of our industries that once thrived in our towns and cities  weakened or leave altogether, and they have read about the grotesque  violation of human rights and dignity of people and China's Communist  Party's persecution of Christians, Muslims, and other religious  minorities.   The sad fact is that we have come to this realization far too late in  this city. For many years, many of the policy elites across the  political spectrum turned a blind eye to this growing threat. There was  this notion that, once China became rich and prosperous, they would  become like us. It is as if somehow economic prosperity, in the sense  and in the way China is achieving it, automatically leads to supporting  values such as the ones that we hold dear. But the fact is that we can  no longer ignore the reality that this is not the direction that China  is headed, and it has implications for our country and the world.   Our country, our workers, and families can no longer afford elected  officials in this city who turn a blind eye to the seriousness of this  challenge. At this point, given all the information before us and the  trends that have clearly emerged, ignorance on this matter is no longer  an excuse, and, frankly, the Communist Party of China is no longer  hiding its ambition about what this is all about.   I am not asking you to believe my words on this. I just ask that you  believe them, that you take their words seriously. That is why I come  here to point to a speech last week by Huang Qifan, who is a former  Central Committee member and recently retired as the vice chair of the  National People's Congress Financial and Economic Affairs Committee. He  showed us, by the way, what passes as modernization within the Chinese  Communist Party.   In the speech he gave, he didn't speak in the typical Communist  jargon. He doesn't invoke abstract theories or laws of history or in  any way hold back. He speaks with a frankness that we should actually  be grateful for because it enlightens us and hopefully propels us to  take action. To Huang, as he makes very clear, the trade war that is  ongoing is a fight to the death, an inevitable outcome in a fight  between two systems.   Paraphrasing Mao Zedong, he urged Chinese businesspeople to shed  their illusions and prepare for struggle. China is the rising power.  The United States is the aging hegemon, and China's rise will be  sustained.   Huang declared, ``At this time, the socialist road with Chinese  characteristics is obviously more competitive. . . . than the U.S.  economic system.'' Such confident words are not just his; they emanate  from the very top. Just after gaining power, their current President,  apparently for life, Xi Jinping, told the party it is ``inevitable that  the superiority of our socialist system will be increasingly  apparent.''   The United States, according to Huang in his speech, cannot make  partners and cannot make space for others in the world. Rather, we are  stuck. We are stuck in a situation in which China must fight the United  States either economically or militarily to find its place in the  world.   Throughout his speech, by the way, he points to various events in the  U.S. and the Western world that is evidence of the claims that he  makes. He points to the financial crisis, to the ballooning deficits,  and to what he terms political instability. In very clear language, he  says that these are problems that ``capitalism can't avoid''--that is  his quote--but the Chinese system can through central guidance. ``This  is our institutional advantage,'' he argues.   Embedded in his speech, there are two themes. The first is a  confidence in the inevitability of China's rise and its conflict with  the United States. Closely related to it is a second theme, and that is  an appeal to the rest of the world to follow in the Chinese  authoritarian model, or, as they call it, socialism with Chinese  characteristics. In their telling, it is clearly a superior model to  ours.   The time has come for America and our allies, who value freedom and  liberty and free enterprise, democracy, human rights, and the dignity  of all people--the time has come for us to eagerly confront this  assertion. Unfortunately, there are too many in the Western world and  in the free world that refuse to see the challenges, indeed, the threat  that is posed by the Communist Party and China's vision of the world in  the future.   Rather than discuss the technical threat posed by an entity like  Huawei, I want to articulate the threat in China's Communist Party's  words, the threat in their own words, as Qifan said last week: ``Our  currency will become the world currency.''   Understand the implications of this stated goal. China's aim is to  use economic power to displace the United States of America and the  role it has played in the world since the end of the Second World War.  China's message to the world is that its industries, its workers, and  its politics will be more productive than ours. The Chinese Communist  Party says to foreign countries, to investors, and to businesses that  the long-term play to keep their economies growing is by partnering  with them, not partnering with us.   Some may say, What is the big deal about that? Let's just take care  of our own problems. Here is the big deal. Here is what it would mean  for Americans in real terms. If the world heads in the direction they  advocate, it would mean lower wages for you, it would mean homes and  mortgages that are unaffordable, and it would mean a world where what  you can say and do abroad but also at home is increasingly dictated by  the Chinese Communist Party and its benefactors in the United States  and elsewhere.   If you don't believe me, just realize that already major motion  pictures produced in Hollywood are censored--censored, even as they are  played in the United States because those movies will not have access  to Chinese movie theaters. We have already seen multiple American  companies have to apologize, take content off the internet, and change  T-shirts that they sell at stores because they offend the Communist  Party of China and are going to be cut off from selling to that market.  It is already happening. It will happen at a much more accelerated  pace.   By the way, we have also seen news outlets in some places have to cut  back and censor what they say. We have had a television program in a  major American network take out content from a program for fear of  being censored in the vast Chinese market. Beyond that, the new  companies, the new technologies, the improved standards of living,  which the United States has always relied on to prove the superiority  of our way of life, will also no longer exist.   Indeed, some of these predictions are already happening. The economic  growth, the prosperity, and the stability that marks Americans' shared  memory of the last century appear to be increasingly absent from this  one. Simply put, the Chinese Communist Party believes that the 20th  century, which was termed the American Century, was an anomaly, and  they believe that they alone have mastered the scientific laws of  history, so democracy must stand aside and give way.   We should clearly understand that the Communist Party of China's  mission, a mission they term ``national rejuvenation'' of Chinese power  and China's prominent place on the world stage, means supplanting our  values and our way of life. As Xi Jinping explained 2 years ago, this  goal is the original aspiration and mission of the party.   What is our model? Well, it is incumbent upon us as Americans and as  leaders and our democratic allies around the world to make the case  that our model is the superior. It is incumbent upon us to make the  case on behalf of our model just as aggressively as an authoritarian  China is making their case for socialism with Chinese characteristics.  Our leadership must also be one that respects human dignity, that  defends our interests and religious liberty, democracy and human  rights, and the rule of law, which means consistently sticking up for  nations committed to these same ideals and standing with people who are  fighting for these and being crushed by totalitarianism anywhere in the  world.   By the way, in the 20th century and the 21st century, American  leadership  [[Page S5626]]  brought peace. After the carnage of the first half of the last century,  the United States has led the world to avoid open great power conflict,  and it meant historically little bloodshed and deep international  stability compared to previous eras.   The international system that America helped craft and lead comes  with a promise of multilateral security, and that is why we must remain  wholly committed to protecting our allies. We spared no cost to help  them rebuild to defend themselves and to protect the dignity of their  citizens. The Chinese Communist Party, on the other hand, cannot  conceive of a world that is not driven by status and hierarchy. They  are not partners, and they view no one as partners. They view them as  vassal states. So this progress, even to someone like Huang Qifan, is a  hidden plot to suppress others.   Such cynicism, by the way, reveals more about the Chinese Communist  Party than it does about us or the failure of American efforts to offer  a helping hand to China in exchange for modernization. To the Chinese  Communist Party, power serves no purpose but to strengthen the party's  rule and to spread its influence around the world.   And for them, those who deviate from the party's expectations deserve  to be sent to forced labor camps where they toil on the party's behalf  and where mass surveillance is a necessary safeguard against deviants  whose only crime is to want a private civic life.   As part of making the case for our model, we must continue to make  the case as to why China is an untrustworthy partner in any endeavor,  whether it is a nation-state project, in an industrial capacity, or  financial integration. They have a neocolonial project, the Belt and  Road Initiative, which follows a very consistent playbook: Approach  nations with promises of lucrative state projects, exploit corruption,  bleed those nations dry, and then hijack their domestic infrastructure.  In Sri Lanka, what it meant was the de facto takeover of wide swathes  of their political system after a project sputtered and Beijing seized  the port.   Beijing is ultimately an untrustworthy partner in international  commitments. We have seen this repeatedly in the Asia-Pacific where  they have flagrantly violated international agreements and obligations  in Hong Kong and Taiwan. We see it right off the coast of Vietnam and  the Philippines, where Beijing is literally building artificial islands  to substantiate ludicrous territorial claims.   Chinese leaders have long claimed to never seek hegemony, and yet the  bullying of their neighbors, they justify it, and they justify it on  the grounds that China deserves respect because of its power and  position. Doing business in China is not just like here or anywhere  else. It is not business between two private companies. It means doing  business with companies backed by, sponsored by, and protected by the  Chinese Communist Party.   Their economy is purposely opaque, and Chinese companies, many of  which are state-owned or state-directed, are tools used by the Chinese  Communist Party to further their mercantilist goals.   The telecommunications company that we have heard of so often,  Huawei, is just one example. Nations that have naively partnered with  Huawei on 5G have exposed vital technological infrastructure to  Beijing's surveillance state, a partnership that Beijing has shown it  will readily exploit.   The bottom line is that China, no matter what, will continue to play  a prominent role in the future of our world; and frankly, we should  welcome a growing, thriving China, but one that plays by the rules.   Today's China, governed by the Chinese Communist Party, is not  playing by any rules. It is a predatory state in nature, and it  actively seeks to supplant not just the United States but a world order  committed to democracy, human rights, and the dignity of all.   Since their induction into the World Trade Organization in 2001,  China has shown itself to be anything but a responsible global partner.  This is a dangerous recipe for conflict, and that is what China's  leaders are preparing for. Xi put the party on notice in 2013, saying  that China ``must diligently prepare for a long period of cooperation  and of conflict'' with capitalist democracies.   If anything, the intervening years have strengthened this conviction.  Huang told business leaders that Americans ``want your life.'' He calls  it an illusion that ``some small amount of money'' would resolve the  trade war.   ``We do not want to fight but are not afraid to fight,'' Huang  concluded, once again quoting Mao.   China clearly sees this moment--these decades, really--as their  opportunity to supplant America from its global leadership role.  Conflict, armed or otherwise, is an inevitable byproduct of that  progression.   America, as Huang noted, has been the ``world's leader for decades,''  and we have used that power to build an international system that  prioritizes fundamental human rights, open democratic governance, and  liberal economies, all the things that the Communist Party of China  believes represents weakness.   So we must be absolutely clear as to what that means. If China  becomes the world's dominant economic power, they will become the  world's dominant military power; they will become the world's dominant  financial power; and they will become the world's dominant cultural  power. Given their critique--and I would say disdain--of our system, we  can expect that a future such as that will look much different than the  reality we live in now.   If China supplants America in the West, the world that our children  will inherit will be nothing like the one we grew up in and know.  Instead of exploiting China's brand of authoritarianism country by  country, as they do now, China will be positioned to reorient the  entire globe, the application of the party's governance at home applied  on a global scale to the way countries interact with one another.   Let me close with the prophetic words of a Chinese dissident, Wei  Jingsheng. In his testimony before Congress in the year 2000, against  and in opposition to China's ascension to the WTO, he said:         If the United States will not fight the world's largest       tyranny politically, then inevitably it will have to fight it       economically, and eventually, militarily. Therefore, the only       way to preserve peace and freedom begins by comprehending       democracy's greatest enemy, and countering it effectively.    Blissful ignorance is no longer an option. We cannot overlook the  obvious signs in favor of near-term economic gains. The world has  reached a crossroads, one in which our inability to act will usher in a  Chinese century, and that will have disastrous consequences.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that  notwithstanding rule XXII, the cloture motions for the Cella, Jorjani,  and Black nominations ripen at 11:30 a.m. on Tuesday, September 24; I  further ask unanimous consent that notwithstanding rule XXII, following  the cloture vote on the Black nomination, that the Senate resume  consideration of the McGuire nomination, and that at 3:30 p.m., all  postcloture time on the McGuire, Cella, Jorjani, and Black nominations  be considered expired; finally, I ask unanimous consent that if any of  the nominations are confirmed, that the motions to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table and the President be  immediately notified of the Senate's actions.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to legislative session and be in a period of morning business,  with Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, as chairman of the Senate Committee  on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, each week I highlight a small  business that displays the unique entrepreneurial spirit found  throughout our country. It is my privilege to recognize a Florida small  business that demonstrates consistent hard work, a commitment to  excellent customer service, and a desire to give back to the Florida  community. Today, it is my honor to name Melao Bakery as the Senate  Small Business of the Week.   Founded in 2009, Melao Bakery is a family-owned and operated  restaurant run by Eduardo Colon and Denisse Torres. Originally from  Puerto Rico, Eduardo and Denisse have created a place where families  can enjoy traditional Puerto Rican cuisine in Kissimmee, FL, a city  many Puerto Ricans call home. Melao has grown from a small bakery in  central Florida with seven employees into a full-menu restaurant  employing more than 150 people at its two locations in Kissimmee and  Orlando. Melao Bakery is known for its commitment to exemplary customer  service and for providing an authentic, traditional experience for its  customers.   Eduardo and Denisse arrived in Florida 17 years ago from Vega Baja,  PR. In Vega Baja, the couple owned a bakery but made the decision to  move to Florida, with their 1-year-old son, in search of new  opportunities. When Eduardo and Denisse settled in Kissimmee, they did  not move to open the bakery immediately; Eduardo studied to pass truck  driving exams, and through hard work, he was able to establish his own  heavy transport company.   Melao Bakery not only provides delicious pastries and cuisine, but it  also serves as a meeting place for local Hispanics. They have since  expanded their vision through the acquisition of the shopping center  where Melao Bakery is located. Eduardo and Denisse's business has been  honored for maintaining a strong sense of Hispanic heritage by the  grassroots organization, the Libre Initiative. In 2012, Melao Bakery  was also recognized by the Kissimmee Chamber of Commerce as the first  Hispanic business to win its annual Small Business of the Year award.  In 2014, Melao Bakery was presented with the Governor's Business  Ambassador Award for its leadership in creating employment  opportunities in central Florida. Additionally, Melao Bakery has won  awards for the quality of its food, such as Best Latin Restaurant in  the Osceola community.   Eduardo and Denisse have made significant efforts to better the lives  of those in their community, both in Florida and in Puerto Rico. After  Hurricane Irma hit Puerto Rico in 2017, Eduardo and Denisse donated  dozens of generators to help survivors get their businesses back up and  running. Their dedication to preserving the culture and heritage of  Puerto Rico in central Florida has created a loyal customer base and  has made Melao Bakery a community staple. Melao Bakery is a shining  example of how dignified work can lead to grassroots engagement and  successful business expansion. As we celebrate Hispanic Heritage month,  I am proud to highlight Melao Bakery for their dedication to Florida's  Hispanic community.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the immediate consideration of H.R. 4285, which was received  from the House.
