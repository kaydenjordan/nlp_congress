 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, yesterday afternoon, South Dakota  Governor Kristi Noem notified me that multiple residents of South  Dakota have tested positive for the coronavirus. While this is  obviously something we had hoped to avoid, we knew this was a  possibility, and South Dakota has spent weeks preparing to deal with an  outbreak.   Over the next few days, public health officials will be checking into  where these individuals have been so that anyone with whom they came in  contact can be notified. My staff and I are working closely with the  Governor and her team, and I will continue to carefully monitor the  situation.   At the Federal level, I am focused on making sure that State and  local governments have the resources they need to deal with the virus.  Last week, I was proud to support bipartisan legislation committing  significant Federal resources to the coronavirus fight.   I am praying for all of the South Dakotans who are affected by the  virus, and I want to thank the healthcare workers who are on the  frontlines of this fight. We are lucky to have you.                                   S. 2657    Madam President, I am disappointed that the Senate failed to move  forward on the American Energy Innovation Act this week. This is a  bipartisan  [[Page S1679]]  piece of legislation that should have been able to advance in the  Senate. It contains measures from more than 60 Senators, and 90  Senators voted last week to begin debate on the bill. I am disappointed  that we couldn't maintain that bipartisan momentum and get this bill  over the finish line.   The United States is in a pretty good position when it comes to  energy right now. Our energy supply is abundant, and energy prices are  generally affordable. But we are in this position for a reason--because  we took steps to increase our domestic energy supply and lessen our  dependence upon foreign oil.   We can't afford to become complacent. If we want to keep American  energy affordable and abundant, we need to make sure that we stay on  the cutting edge of energy innovation and continue to invest in our  domestic energy supply, from oil and natural gas to renewable energy  sources like hydropower and wind. We also need to make sure we stay on  top of threats to our energy grid and our energy security.   The American Energy Innovation Act is designed to help maintain  American strength in the energy sector. It invests in a wide range of  clean energy technologies, from wind and solar to hydropower and  geothermal. It focuses on improving research into carbon capture, and  it directs the establishment of a research and development program to  identify ways to use captured carbon.   The bill also invests in advanced nuclear energy research so that we  can regain our edge in the use of this clean energy technology, and it  focuses on improving energy storage. Many modern clean energy  technologies are intermittent or lack the reliability of traditional  electric sources. The amount of energy produced from wind, for example,  is dependent on the amount of wind on any given day, so it must be  backed up by a traditional plant, often powered by natural gas.  Creating new ways to store clean energy will allow us to increase our  reliance on renewable energy sources.   Another area that needs to be addressed when it comes to renewable  energy is recycling. Solar panels, wind turbine blades, and electric  car batteries are key components of clean energy production, but all of  these components eventually reach the end of their life. Both solar  panels and wind turbine blades eventually have to be replaced, and car  batteries eventually lose their ability to hold a full charge.   The question becomes what to do with these components. Wind turbine  blades can be well over 150 feet long and weigh somewhere around 15  tons. That takes a lot of room in a landfill. In the case of electric  vehicle batteries, we are not just talking about filling up landfills.  We are talking about potentially hazardous waste if lithium or other  materials leak from the battery.   While recycling and reuse methods exist for clean energy components,  much more work needs to be done to ensure that clean energy doesn't  eventually result in massive buildups in landfills. Since roughly a  quarter of the net electricity generated in my home State of South  Dakota comes from wind, I am particularly interested in what it would  take to recycle or reuse the blades from wind turbines on a large  scale.   I am very pleased that my wind energy recycling amendment was  included in the chairman's substitute amendment to the American Energy  Innovation Act. My amendment would establish a competition to identify  innovative uses for wind blades that have reached the end of their  life, with a focus on uses that present the greatest potential for  large-scale commercial deployment.   With an estimated 32,000 wind blades likely to be removed from U.S.  wind turbines in the next 4 years, it is past time to get American  innovators focused on this problem. I appreciate Chairman Murkowski's  interest in addressing this side of green energy and hope that we can  continue this work.   In addition to clean energy and innovation, the American Energy  Innovation Act focuses on boosting the security of our electric grid.  It invests in cyber security and grid modernization and focuses on  improving our domestic supply of some of the key elements and minerals  that we rely on for manufacturing--everything from computer chips, to  batteries, to defense applications.   Right now, we have to import too much of these critical minerals from  countries like China. For the sake of our national security, it is  important that we find ways to identify supplies of these minerals here  at home.   Finally, the American Energy Innovation Act invests in workforce  development. All of the innovative technologies in the world will not  help us if we don't have the skilled workers to operate and maintain  these technologies. We need to ensure that, while we are investing in  innovation, we are also investing in the energy workforce of the  future.    As I said, it is disappointing that the Senate wasn't able to move  forward on this bipartisan legislation. I hope we will be able to  continue discussing this bill and the Senate will take it up again in  the near future.   The American Energy Innovation Act would promote clean energy  development, help maintain a strong domestic energy supply, increase  the security of our energy grid, and invest in American workers. We  need to get this legislation across the finish line.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator  from Texas (Mr. Cruz).
