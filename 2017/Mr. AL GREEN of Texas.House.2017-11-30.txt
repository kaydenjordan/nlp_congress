 Mr. Speaker, I rise because I love my country.   I rise, Mr. Speaker, because I refuse to stand idly by as a  billionaire bigot does irreparable harm to my country--a billionaire  bigot who tolerates the KKK but won't tolerate Islam; a billionaire  bigot who tolerates anti-Semitism, racism, sexism, ethnocentrism,  xenophobia, and homophobia.   Mr. Speaker, I don't know what the consequences will be, but I do  know this: the people who sent me here sent me to this Congress to  fight hate, not to tolerate, not to mitigate, but to eliminate hate.  The people I represent have an expectation of me.   Mr. Speaker, I don't know what the vote will be, but I do know this:  Next week, there will be a vote to impeach. Next week, there will be a  resolution brought before the Congress, and there will be a vote to  either table it, send it to committee, or vote it up or down.   That is what the people I represent expect me to do, and I will do no  less.
