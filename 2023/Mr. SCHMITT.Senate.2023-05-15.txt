 Mr. President, I rise today to honor the life and  memory of Mr. Edgar ``Bee'' Ernest Wilhelms, Jr., of Reynolds County,  MO.   Edgar Wilhelms, Jr., born in Exchange, MO, on September 12, 1925, was  the last remaining World War II veteran in Reynolds County. In 1943, at  18 years old, Edgar enlisted with the U.S. Army. During his time in  service, he achieved the rank of corporal and aided the Allied efforts  in the European Theater. In January of 1946, Corporal Wilhelms left the  Army to return to his family back in Missouri.   A few months prior to his military service, Edgar married his loving  wife, Lucille G. Haywood, in Ellington, MO. During their marriage, they  had four children. Edgar's greatest joy in life was spending time with  his children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren, and great-great- grandchildren. In addition to spending time with his family, Edgar  enjoyed fishing, cooking fish, and hunting quail, squirrel, deer, and  elk. Edgar was also very involved in his community. He was a lifetime  member of the VFW Post 6660 in Centerville, MO, a former member of the  Barnesville Masonic Lodge No. 353, and a congregant at the Ellington  First Baptist Church.   Edgar passed away on Wednesday, May 10, 2023, at the age of 97. He is  remembered by his family and friends as a loving husband, father,  grandfather, great-grandfather, great-great-grandfather, and friend. He  will be deeply missed by all who knew him. I ask my Senate colleagues  to join me in honoring the life of Mr. Edgar ``Bee'' Ernest Wilhelms,  Jr., and I offer my sincerest condolences to his family and friends  during this difficult time of mourning.                            ____________________
