 Mr. President, I rise today in celebration of 100 years  of Scouting in Wyoming.   On Saturday, March 21, 2020, the Boy Scouts of America Greater  Wyoming Council will host their annual Silver Beaver and Eagle Scout  Recognition Luncheon in Casper. This year holds a special significance  as they will celebrate their 100th anniversary at this event.   The Boy Scouts of America incorporated on February 8, 1910. Scouting  came to Casper with the creation of the Casper Council in 1917. The  council continued to expand, changing its name to the Casper Area  Council in 1925, Central Wyoming Council in 1931, and finally the  Greater Wyoming Council in 2016. The Boy Scouts of America's mission is  ``to prepare young people to make ethical and moral choices over their  lifetimes by instilling in them the values of the Scout Oath and Law.''  The council remains true to this mission and to their purpose to  educate youth, age 5 to 21, to build character, develop personal  fitness, and to train in the responsibilities of participating  citizenship.   In Wyoming, the Greater Wyoming Council upholds the mission and  purpose of the Boy Scouts through service to 11 counties and 3,000  youth across our State. The organization enjoys tremendous community  support with 1,400 volunteers and 150 community partners. This  consistent and broad involvement demonstrates what a valuable benefit  the council provides to the youth and people of Wyoming.   The council provides a variety of events and opportunities for  Scouts, families, and communities in Wyoming. These events include  their annual Strength of America Banquet, the annual Camp Buffalo Bill  Summer Camp in Cody, fishing tournaments, and family camping trips.  They work hard to provide many opportunities for Scouts to participate  in fellowships, trainings, basecamps, and much more, to help members  be, as the Scouts say, ``Prepared for life.''   Brad Bodoh, the Scout executive for the council, has a strong  background in serving the Scouts of America. We are fortunate to have  his leadership. Before Brad made Wyoming home, he worked for the Boy  Scouts of America in Iowa and Ohio. The knowledge and experience Brad  brings to the Greater Wyoming Council allow the Scouts to flourish and  expand their skills. Senior district executives Frank Solla and Andrew  Allgeier, in addition to the council office staff, are instrumental in  growing and supporting the organization's participation throughout the  state.   In Wyoming, we live by the Code of the West. One of the principles of  the Code is ``to take pride in your work.'' The council's volunteers  and families embody this principle. They make it possible for Scouts to  advance through the program all the way through the rank of Eagle  Scout. They see their work rewarded every time a Cub Scout earns a new  badge and an Eagle Scout completes their project. The support for this  organization is truly exceptional, and Wyoming is better for it.   Mr. President, it is my pleasure to honor this historic milestone for  the Greater Wyoming Council. Their centennial celebration is a  recognition of all the hard work and preparation the council has done  in the past 100 years and will continue to do for the next 100 years.  Bobbi and I are proud of the Greater Wyoming Council and the community  support behind it. We celebrate the century of Scouting in Wyoming and  extend our congratulations.                            ____________________
