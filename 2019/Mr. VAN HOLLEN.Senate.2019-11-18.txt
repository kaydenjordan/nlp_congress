 Mr. President, the World Day of Remembrance for Road  Traffic Victims commemorates the millions of people killed and injured  on the world's roads. It is also a day to thank emergency responders  for their role in saving lives; to reflect on the impact of road deaths  on families and communities, to draw attention to the need for improved  legislation, awareness, infrastructure, and technology to save more  families from the tragedy of losing a loved one.   Since the United Nations recognized the World Day of Remembrance for  Road Traffic Victims, its observance has spread to a growing number of  countries on every continent. The day has become an important advocacy  tool in global efforts to reduce road casualties, and the theme of this  year's World Day of Remembrance is ``Life is not a car part.''  Additionally, the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 3.6 calls  on governments and their stakeholders, including NGOs and private  citizens, to address the personal medical, and financial burdens  associated with road deaths and injuries. More than 1 million people  die  [[Page S6621]]  from road crashes every year, and tens of millions are seriously  injured. Road traffic crashes are the No. 1 killer of young people aged  15-29 and the eighth leading cause of death among all people worldwide.   Rochelle Sobel, president of the Association for Safe International  Road Travel, highlighted the gravity of this issue and the imperative  to fix it:         Every 27 seconds somewhere in the world a person dies in a       road crash. Those of us who have lost loved ones in a crash       know only too well the ongoing pain and devastation that this       tragedy causes families and communities. Road crashes are       preventable. We must all work together so that the hopes and       dreams of our loved ones are not shattered in the roads of       the world.    We all need to do our part to take action to prevent these avoidable  tragedies and to save lives.                            ____________________
