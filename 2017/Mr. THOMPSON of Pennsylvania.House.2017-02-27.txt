 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to identify  an important rung on the economic ladder.   The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, can help pave  the way for recipients to climb the economic ladder through work  training.  [[Page H1324]]  The truth is simple: where poverty exists, skills gaps can prevent  access to jobs with family-sustaining wages.   Underemployment and unemployed are leading causes of poverty, and  promoting pathways to employment is the best way to help individuals  climb the economic ladder out of poverty and into self-sufficiency.  Combined with other welfare programs, SNAP recipients may face a  welfare cliff when they are just above the income eligibility level,  which can create disincentives to finding work or increasing earnings.   Better enforcement of work requirements is needed in some States, and  enforcement needs to be coupled with more effective SNAP employment and  training programs.   As the House Agriculture Nutrition Subcommittee chair and House  Career and Technical Education Caucus co-chair, I am committed to  reforming the nutrition needs of today and greater opportunities for  tomorrow for all Americans.                            ____________________
