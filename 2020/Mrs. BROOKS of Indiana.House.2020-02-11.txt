 Madam Speaker, I rise today to express my  strong support for H.R. 1980, the Smithsonian Women's History Museum  Act.   I want to thank Representative Maloney for championing this important  legislation. Her determination to honor American women, which started  back in 1998 and the fact that she has brought this type of legislation  forward ever since then is a true testament to her grit.    I also want to thank the chairwoman of the House Administration  Committee. I want to thank the ranking member of the House  Administration Committee. I really welcome their leadership, and they  have seen the importance of this legislation.   The Smithsonian Institution was established in 1846 to increase the  diffusion of knowledge, and I can think of no better subject matter on  which to increase and diffuse knowledge today in 2020 than educating  Americans and those who visit our country about the amazing American  women who have come before us.   A museum dedicated to American women's history will help ensure that  my daughter and my son--future generations--understand the impact that  our women have had on our country's past; and with a greater  understanding of our country's past we can better navigate the future.   Establishing this museum to collect, study, and establish programs  covering historical contributions of women will inspire generations of  women to come--women like Jeannette Rankin, the first woman to ever  come to this body, the U.S. House, from Montana in 1916 before women  even had the right to vote.                                time  1330    Women like Lucille Ball, and we all love Lucy, she was the first  woman to run a television studio and capture the attention of viewers  around the globe.   Women like Dr. Mae Jemison, an engineer and physician, she was the  first African American woman to travel to space.   Women like these three--and there are thousands more--who deserve to  have their stories shared with folks around the world and people here  at home.   Madam Speaker, I encourage all of my colleagues to support this  strong bipartisan piece of legislation to create this national museum  dedicated to American women's history. It will celebrate the  achievements of American women.    Madam Speaker, I think it is important to  note that in this 116th Congress, where you had a record-breaking  number of women come to this body--101 women, more than ever before,  and hopefully, even more will be coming in future Congresses--I urge  passage of this important piece of legislation.
