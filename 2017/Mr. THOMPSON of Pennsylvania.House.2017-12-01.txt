 Mr. Speaker, this week I had the  opportunity to meet with a number of organic farmers to discuss the  upcoming farm bill and its impact on organic production.   In recent years, organic production has continued to grow in  Pennsylvania,  [[Page H9573]]  Pennsylvania being the second largest State for organic production, and  in many other States.   There are a number of programs authorized in the farm bill, including  Beginning Farmers and Ranchers, that help provide financial assistance  and planning assistance for new farmers and farms. Access to programs  such as these is essential for supporting the next generation of  farmers and growing American agriculture.   As it relates to organic, the farm bill contains numerous provisions  and programs tailored to organic producers. This includes conservation  assistance through EQIP Organic Initiative, the Market Access Program,  Organic Agriculture Research and Extension, and competitive grants.   The Horticulture title also includes the National Organic  Certification Cost Share, marketing and data collection, the Organic  Program, and the Organic Check-Off Program.   Mr. Speaker, supporting agriculture of all forms through the farm  bill is critically important for the industry, rural communities, and,  quite frankly, all Americans.                            ____________________
