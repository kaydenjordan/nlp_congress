 Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this budget  proposal.   With many working families and businesses still struggling to adapt  to a rapidly changing economy, our top priority in Congress should be  helping expand opportunities, opportunities to sustain long-term  economic growth  [[Page H8244]]  and security so no American is left behind.   Unfortunately, the bill we are voting on today is not a serious  budget designed to help middle class families. Instead, this budget is  simply a vehicle to rush through a partisan tax proposal using a  process known as reconciliation.   And what is worse, the Ryan-McConnell tax plan would add trillions of  dollars to the deficit, making our children foot the bill for tax cuts  that disproportionately benefit the wealthiest. In fact, the Tax Policy  Center has estimated that the Ryan-McConnell tax plan could raise taxes  by an average of $1,209 a year on families earning between $50,000 and  $150,000 a year. This is moving in the wrong direction.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no.''
