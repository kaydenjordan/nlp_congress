 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor a local gentleman and  distinguished resident of Orange, New Jersey, Mr. Robert Cottingham.  His life has been one of inspiring public service and dedication to his  community. He is a military veteran who served as a combat infantryman  during the Korean war.   When he returned, he sought opportunities to help others. During the  1970s and 1980s, he mentored new African American workers at the Xerox  Corporation to help them thrive. In his community, he sought to help  youth and others through service organizations such as Kappa Alpha Psi  Fraternity and the Montclair YMCA. He even dedicated his weekends to  service and taught Sunday school as a member of the Church of the  Epiphany and Christ Church in Orange. In addition, he was a nationally  accomplished high hurdle runner and high school track star.   I had the privilege of attending Mr. Cottingham's 90th birthday  yesterday and I can tell you that he still inspires and serves as an  example of the best in our community.                            ____________________
