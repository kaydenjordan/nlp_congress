 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the  Pregnant Workers Fairness Act, a bipartisan proposal that will finally  secure clear protection for pregnant workers.   Pregnant women should not have to risk their lives on the job. Yet,  too often, instead of offering accommodations routinely given to other  employees, a pregnant worker risks termination, meaning she loses her  paycheck and health insurance right when she needs them the most.   We know that COVID-19 has exacerbated health inequalities for women,  especially women of color.   Before the pandemic, moms in the U.S. already struggled and died from  pregnancy-related causes at the highest rate in the developed world,  with Black moms dying three to four times the rate of their White  peers.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter on behalf of maternal  health organizations who support putting a national pregnancy  accommodation standard in place.                                                      May 11, 2021.      Re Support the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act.         Dear Representative: The undersigned organizations       dedicated to assuring quality maternal, infant, and child       health and well-being, improving pregnancy and birth       outcomes, and closing racial disparities in maternal health       enthusiastically support the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act       (H.R. 1065). Modeled after the Americans with Disabilities       Act, the bill would require employers to provide reasonable,       temporary workplace accommodations to pregnant workers as       long as the accommodation does not impose an undue hardship       on the employer. This bill is critically important because no       one should have to choose between having a healthy pregnancy       and a paycheck.        Congress must do all it can to end the prejudice pregnant       workers, especially Black pregnant workers and workers of       color, continue to face in the workplace. This includes       making sure when pregnant workers voice a need for reasonable       accommodations that those needs are met rather than penalized       and that the workplace is an environment where pregnant       workers do not fear asking for the accommodations they need       to maintain their health.        Three-quarters of women will be pregnant and employed at       some point in their lives. Most pregnant workers can expect a       routine pregnancy and healthy birth. However, health care       professionals have consistently recommended that some       pregnant individuals make adjustments in their work       activities to sustain a healthy pregnancy and prevent adverse       pregnancy outcomes, including preterm birth or miscarriage.       These medically necessary workplace accommodations can       include allowing additional bathroom breaks, opportunities to       stay hydrated, lifting restrictions, or access to a chair or       stool to decrease time spent standing.        Unfortunately, too many pregnant workers, particularly       pregnant people of color, face barriers to incorporating even       these small changes to their workdays. For example, Black       women experience maternal mortality rates three to four times       higher than white women, with Indigenous women similarly       experiencing disproportionately high rates. The circumstances       surrounding these alarming statistics can often be attributed       to a lack of access to care, including due to inflexible       workplaces, and deep biases in racial understanding. Various       social determinants such as health, education, and economic       status drastically influence the outcomes of pregnancy for       Black women leading to severe pregnancy-related       complications. As the Black Mamas Matter Alliance has pointed       out ``Health is determined in part by our access to social       and economic opportunities, the resources and supports that       are available in the places where we live, and the safety of       our Workplaces . . . however, disparities in these conditions       of daily life give some people better opportunities to be       healthy than others. Black pregnant workers along with Latinx       and immigrant women are disproportionately likely to work in       physically demanding jobs that may lead to workers needing       modest accommodations to ensure a healthy pregnancy. Too       often, however, those requests are refused or ignored,       forcing pregnant workers of color to disproportionately       contend with unsafe working conditions.        Furthermore, Black mothers have among the highest labor       force participation rates in the country and 80 percent of       Black mothers are their family's primary breadwinner. Yet,       historically, Black women have been exploited in the       workplace, and that exploitation continues to this day.       Though Black women only comprise 14.3 percent of the       population, nearly thirty percent of pregnancy discrimination       complaints are filed by Black women. This is because of the       multiple forms of discrimination Black workers and other       workers of color too often face in the workplace. As scholar       Nina Banks has noted, ``The legacy of black women's       employment in industries that lack worker protections has       continued today since black women are concentrated in low-      paying, inflexible service occupations . . .'' Black women in       low wage jobs working during pregnancy face little support       from employers when safeguards do not address pregnancy       related accommodations. Faced with the threat of termination,       loss of health insurance, or other benefits, Black pregnant       people are often  [[Page H2331]]       forced to keep working which can compromise their health and       the health of their pregnancy.        Workplace accommodations help safeguard a healthy pregnancy       or prevent harm to a higher-risk pregnancy. Across the       country, pregnant workers continue to be denied simple, no-      cost or lowcost, temporary adjustments in their work settings       or activities and instead risk being fired or forced to take       unpaid leave to preserve the health of their pregnancy.        This impossible choice forces many pregnant workers to       continue working without accommodations, putting women and       their pregnancies at risk of long-lasting and severe health       consequences. When pregnant workers must continue working       without accommodations, they risk miscarriage, excessive       bleeding, and other devastating health consequences. Black       women have the highest incidence of preterm birth and yet we       know that workplace accommodations such as reducing heavy       lifting, bending, or excessive standing can help prevent       preterm birth, the leading cause of infant mortality in this       country.        Black women also experience higher rates of preeclampsia,       which is one of the leading causes of maternal mortality. We       are still learning about how to prevent this dangerous       medical condition, yet we know that simply allowing workers       to take bathroom breaks can prevent urinary tract infections       which are ``strongly associated with preeclampsia.''       Similarly, ensuring pregnant workers can drink a sufficient       amount of water can also help pregnant workers maintain their       blood pressure, which is critically important since       hypertensive disorders (high blood pressure) are also a       leading cause of maternal morbidity and mortality. By putting       a national pregnancy accommodation standard in place, the       Pregnant Workers Fairness Act has the potential to improve       some of the most serious health consequences Black pregnant       people experience. Furthermore, the Pregnant Workers Fairness       Act will help remove one of the many barriers Black pregnant       people face at work by ensuring they are afforded immediate       relief under the law, and not thrown into financial dire       straits for needing pregnancy accommodations.        The Pregnant Workers Fairness Act is a measured approach to       a serious problem. As organizations dedicated to maternal       health and closing racial disparities in pregnancy and birth       outcomes, we understand the importance of reasonable       workplace accommodations to ensure that pregnant persons can       continue to provide for their families and have safe and       healthy pregnancies. We collectively urge swift passage of       the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act.

Mr. Speaker, the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act  can improve some of the most serious health consequences Black pregnant  women experience in the workplace.   Federal protections for pregnant workers are stuck in the 1950s. In  2021, it is past time for workplaces to accommodate our families and  protect all pregnant workers. It is women and families who keep our  economy and communities running.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes.''
