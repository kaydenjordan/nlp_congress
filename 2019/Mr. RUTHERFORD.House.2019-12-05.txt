 Madam Speaker, this morning, Speaker Pelosi announced  that yesterday's hearing in the Judiciary Committee will, with  ``leading American constitutional scholars,'' give Congress no choice-- no choice--but to impeach the President. But let's take a look at who  exactly testified at yesterday's impeachment hoax.   Professor Karlan donated over $12,000 to liberal Democrat  politicians, went after the President's 13-year-old son, and she can't  even walk past the Trump Hotel without having to cross the street.   Professor Gerhardt donated thousands of dollars to former President  Obama and Hillary Clinton. He also worked against Justice Kavanaugh  during his nomination process.   Professor Feldman called for the President's impeachment in 2017  based on a tweet, just over a month into his Presidency.   However, Professor Turley, who voted against the President, had this  to say about the lack of evidence against President Trump:  ``Impeachments have to be based on proof, not presumptions.''   Abuse of power? Madam Speaker, an impeachment with this fact pattern  is an abuse of power by the House of Representatives.                            ____________________
