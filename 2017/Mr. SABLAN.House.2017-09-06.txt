 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to bring up H.R.  3440, the DREAM Act, to protect DREAMers like Riya, who grow up  pledging allegiance to our flag, and who has worked for two Members of  this Congress.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair understands that the gentleman  from Oklahoma has not yielded for that purpose; therefore, the  unanimous consent request cannot be entertained.   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California  (Mr. Correa) for the purpose of a unanimous consent request.
