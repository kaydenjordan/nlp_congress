 Madam Speaker, I rise to applaud the work of my  colleagues in both parties on reaching a bipartisan consensus on a  trade agreement between the U.S., Mexico, and Canada.    I know that this was no easy task, and today we are poised to pass  this historic agreement.  [[Page H12262]]    This was a priority for me, and I worked tirelessly to ensure that  the administration, my colleagues, and House leaders knew how important  this was for Texas.   For Texans, trade with Mexico and Canada isn't just a textbook  exercise or abstract policy issue; it is real jobs for more than 36,000  Texans in my district.   Businesses across north Texas rely on supply chains between our three  nations to manufacture, distribute, and sell goods and services. We  must give them certainty and stability.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes.'' This job- creating agreement will shift the trade paradigm and create a new  standard for trade that will protect workers and the environment both  here at home and across the North American continent.   Madam Speaker, I thank Chairman Neal and the working group and  Ambassador Lighthizer for their work on getting this across the line.
