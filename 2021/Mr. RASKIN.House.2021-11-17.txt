 Madam Speaker, is there a high school or a workplace in  America that would do nothing if a student or a worker posted violently  threatening material against a fellow student or a colleague? Please  show it to me, if so.   Last month, a high school student in Michigan made threatening  statements about a specific classmate. He was arrested.   In Boulder, Colorado, several high school students were expelled for  posting violently threatening material online.   Last month, in Chicago, a firefighter was fired for his threatening  social media posts, including a cartoon of someone running someone else  over in a car.   A woman in Pennsylvania who made violent threats against a colleague  on Facebook was fired, and the State court found she was ineligible for  unemployment compensation because her violently threatening speech  online constituted willful misconduct.   It is remarkable to me, Madam Speaker, that we have colleagues who  think we should do nothing in the face of a Member of the United States  House of Representatives who posts an animated cartoon video of him  killing a colleague.   Congressman Gosar is 62. Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is  32.
