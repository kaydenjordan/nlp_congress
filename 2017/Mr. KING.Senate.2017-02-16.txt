 Madam President, I rise today in one sense as a former  Governor. In looking at nominations of Cabinet members by the  Executive, I start with a position of deference to the Executive  because I think he or she should be able to choose the people who  surround them and give them advice. I understand that. I did that as a  Governor, and I understand that principle. Indeed, in the proceedings  before this body thus far, I think I voted for 7 or 8 or perhaps 10 of  the nominees for Cabinet members who advise the President.   But today we are considering a nominee who is hostile to the  fundamental purpose of the Agency to which he is being appointed. We  are appointing a person to be the head of an Agency that is called the  Environmental Protection Agency. All you need to know about the mission  of that Agency is contained in the name, the Environmental Protection  Agency, and we are considering a nominee who has no record that I have  been able to discover of protection of the environment. None. Zero. No  history of actions on behalf of the environment, on behalf of the  health and welfare and well-being of the citizens of his State or of  the United States.   It is bizarre, to me, to be appointing people to an office where they  are hostile to the mission of the office to which they are being  appointed. In fact, not only has he no record of positive environment  activity, his record is completely to the contrary where he has opposed  activities of the Environmental Protection Agency.   As everybody knows, as attorney general of Oklahoma and leading other  attorneys general around the country, he sued the Environmental  Protection Agency numerous times; I think something like 20 times. And  some of those rules--all of those rules were put into place to protect  the health and well-being of the American people. There are several of  them that I am particularly sensitive to.   When I was the Governor of Maine, we had an issue of air quality. We  still do. The reason we have an air quality issue in Maine is because  of the air that is coming in on the prevailing westerly winds from the  rest of the country. At one point, we had a time where we did the  calculations, and we could have taken every car off our highways,  closed every one of our factories, and we still would have had air  quality violations on the coast of Maine. Pollution doesn't respect  borders. It doesn't respect State borders, and it doesn't respect  international borders. That is why it has to be a national  responsibility.   Of course, each State can also have, as we do in Maine, its own  department of environmental quality, its own department of  environmental protection. Each State could and should and will do that  and has done that, but we also need to have national standards because  otherwise the States will race to the bottom: How friendly are you to  business? Come on in; we have no rules. This was realized almost 50  years ago by a Senator from Maine, a Senator whose seat I occupy, a  Senator whose desk I have in my office, Edmund Muskie. Edmund Muskie  was the father of the Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act, and he  came from a State where this was not politically easy. The rivers in  Maine had been grossly polluted by industrial waste. Yet he took the  lead on this important issue.   Here is something extraordinary: The Clean Air Act, one of the most  important environmental laws of the 20th century and very  controversial, widespread impact around the country, passed this body  unanimously. It is unbelievable looking back to that day. We couldn't  pass the time of day unanimously in this body today, but there was  bipartisan consensus that protecting the environment for ourselves and  for the future of our citizens was not a political issue. It was an  issue of responsibility. It was an ethical issue. And Ed Muskie, a  giant in this body, created the groundwork and the legislative basis  for the work we are still doing today.   In Muskie's time, the pollution was obvious. You could see it, and  you could breathe it. I live on the Androscoggin River in Brunswick,  and when I first went there 35 years ago,  [[Page S1363]]  you could smell the river in the spring. You could smell it. You knew  it was spring; you could smell the foam and waste that was coming down  the river. That is gone today because of the work of people like Ed  Muskie.   By the way, people like Howard Baker, Republicans--and in our State  of Maine, the environmental movement was led by Republicans in those  days. Hoddy Hildreth, David Huber, Ken McCloud, Harry Richardson--those  are all prominent Republican leaders in our State who also led the  environmental protection movement in our State.   As I said, it was easy. You could smell it; you could see it. The  smog in Los Angeles was so bad that it was ridiculous, and it was  unhealthful, so we took some steps that dealt with that.   We are facing an environmental threat today that is somewhat less  visible--although I will argue that it is actually quite visible--but  it is no less profound. In fact, I believe it is more dangerous, more  threatening, more important to the future of this planet and our  country and our people than those obvious threats that were faced back  in 1970 and beyond.   Environmental protection, in my view, is a moral and an ethical  issue; it is an intergenerational ethical issue; and it can all be  summarized by what I call the main rototiller rule. The main rototiller  rule goes like this: If you borrow your neighbor's rototiller in the  spring in order to plow up your garden and get ready to plant, you have  an obligation to return it to him in as good of shape as you got it and  with a good tank of gas. That is all you need to know about  environmental stewardship, because we have the planet on loan. We don't  own it. We own it temporarily. We own plots of land temporarily, but we  don't own the planet. We have it on loan from future generations--from  our children and our grandchildren and seven generations hence. Yet our  age, our generation, is acting like it is all ours, like everything is  ours.   It took millions of years, for example, to create the fossil fuels  that are underneath the Earth. The word ``fossil'' has a meaning. They  are there because they are from fossils. It goes back literally  millions of years for the Earth to distill the plant and animal matter  into this miraculous substance called oil--millions of years. Yet we  are using it up. Forget about the pollution for a moment; just think  about the idea that we are using an asset that the Earth produced over  millions of years, and in a matter of--I don't know--200 to 300 years,  we are going to use it all. It is as if on Thanksgiving the turkey  comes to the table, all of the family is sitting around, and Dad says:  OK, I am going to eat this whole turkey. You don't get any.   What do we tell people when they look back on us in 20, 50, 100, 200  years? What are they going to think of our generation? What is our  defense going to be?   We know it is not infinite. There is argument about how much is  there, but it is not infinite. There is no machine in the center of the  Earth that is creating these substances; therefore, we have a  responsibility to future generations, as my friends in Maine would say,  not to pig out on what we have and just forget about who comes next. Of  course, as it becomes more rare, it will become more expensive, so we  are passing those costs off as well. Beyond that is the environmental  cost.   I mentioned the obvious environmental problems back in the seventies  and eighties of when you could see the air, when you could smell the  rivers, but today the problem is what we are doing to the planet, which  is climate.   What bothers me about this nominee is he basically says: Well, it is  a controversial issue. The sciences differ.   No. The science is clear.   Before I get to that, I have one more point about the ethical and  moral responsibility.   Last year, we had Pope Francis here. Pope Francis has talked a great  deal about this issue and the ethical and moral and, indeed, religious  obligation we have to be good stewards of our environment and of our  planet. People criticized the Pope. They said: Let the Pope stick to  religion and stay away from science.   It turns out that the Pope is a chemist. That is an unfortunate fact.   When the Pope was here, I did a little act of Jesus in the Good Book  and found a number of references to the responsibility we have to  protect the environment and the land. Indeed, in the Old Testament--and  we all know about the Sabbath, that on the seventh day, He rested.  There is a provision in the Old Testament whereby every 7 years the  people were instructed to let the land lie fallow for a year--a Sabbath  for the land in order to preserve its productivity.   I believe this is fundamentally an ethical issue. What do we owe our  children--to just forge ahead in the face of overwhelming science and  all of the predictions? What is happening in the world around us is  selfishness. It is unethical. It is wrong. It is unfair.   As I said, we are talking about a nominee for this body who says the  debate about climate change is just that--it is a debate.         There are scientists that agree, and there are scientists       that don't agree to the extent of man's contribution and       whether it is even harmful at this point.    Give me a break. The scientific community is virtually unanimous,  and, indeed, the data is unanimous.   I carry a little card around with me. This is a blowup of it. I am a  visual person--I like to see things, and I understand them better. To  me, this is what you need to know about what is going on.   By the way, what this is, is CO2 in the atmosphere, parts  per million, for 800,000 years. People say: Well, it has varied over  time. It goes up and down. It is just a natural cycle.   It does vary over time. Here is 850,000 years, and you can see that  it varies from a low of about 180 parts per million up close to 300  parts per million, and that is the variation. Absolutely true. That is  the variation until you get to about 1860, and that is when it starts  to go up. Now we are at 400 parts per million, which is 25 percent  higher than it has been in 5 million years. Was it a coincidence that  it started to happen when we started to burn fossil fuels in such vast  quantities? Of course not. Was there a big outburst of volcanos in the  mid-1800s? Of course not.   This is not debatable. These are measurements. These are scientific  measurements. Debating this is like debating that water boils at 212  degrees: Oh, no. I think it boils at 214 degrees.   No. It is 210.   It is 212.   Light travels at 186,000 miles a second. That is not debatable.  Neither is this.   We are in a very dangerous place. Scott Pruitt calls it an argument  and doesn't want to do anything about it. Not only does he not want to  do anything about it, he wants to undo the things that have been done  to try to protect us.   You can look at this chart and say CO2 is going up. It is  invisible gas. You cannot taste it. You cannot smell it. It does not  poison us. It is in the atmosphere anyway. Who cares? What difference  does it make?   Here is what difference it makes. This is the other side of my little  card. This is the correlation of over 800,000 years between temperature  and CO2. Of what you can see, the blue is the  CO2, and the temperature is red, and what you see is an  almost exact correlation. It is beyond coincidence. When CO2  goes up, the temperature goes up. When CO2 goes down, the  temperature goes down. You can see it over the time. Do you know where  we are now in CO2? Here. The correlation is unmistakable, it  is powerful, and it is dangerous.   The nominee for the Environmental Protection Agency denies this. He  says it is a debate. Just for a moment, let's take him at his word.  Let's say it is a debate. Let's say it is not entirely settled. If the  risk is so catastrophic, wouldn't it be prudent to try to take some  measures to prevent it even if you are not sure? By the time we are  sure--by the way, we are sure now. By the time Scott Pruitt is sure, it  will be too late. It may already be too late. We may be beyond the  tipping point, and all we can do is mitigate the danger, not stop it  altogether, because we have been heedless of the consequences of the  results that will impact the next generation of Americans and of people  around the world.   What are the consequences going to be? What if it gets a little bit  warmer? We will be able to play golf longer in Maine--hey, not bad--but  the consequences in many cases are going to  [[Page S1364]]  be catastrophic. There are many already affecting Maine in terms of  where our lobster population is moving.   I had a sea farmer in my office 2 days ago, a fellow who has a great  business. He has grown it for years. It is really a serious business of  growing oysters, and he has always grown them in the Damariscotta  River. In fact, if you go to a fancy restaurant and ask for  Damariscotta River oysters there, they are the top-level oysters in the  world. He has always grown them in the river. He puts in the little  seed. They start in little, tiny shells, and then they grow out. He can  no longer grow them initially in the river because the water is so  acidic from carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, which is absorbed by the  ocean, that the shells don't grow. He had to move the incubation part  of his business onshore and treat the water to lower the acidity so  that the shells will grow, and then when they get a certain size, he  puts them back in the river.   This is a real, direct, obvious, observable effect of global climate  change and of too much CO2 in the atmosphere. It is not  theoretical. It is not debatable. It is not that scientists differ.  This guy is trying to make a living, and he can only do it by treating  the water because the acid that has been created by the ocean in its  absorbing the CO2 is making it impossible for the oysters to  develop. That is a direct impact. Probably the most direct impact we  are going to be able to see and identify and not avoid is sea level  rise.   Last summer--as a matter of fact, in August--I went to Greenland. Let  me just put that in context. It is the continent of Greenland. The ice  on Greenland, if and when it melts--and I think it is when, not if-- will add 61 feet to the ocean depth. The ice in Antarctica has 212 feet  of sea level rise contained in it. Just think about that for a minute.  Greenland is melting at a rate no one has seen before. I saw it with my  own eyes. I saw these big things in the ice. We helicoptered out over  the ice sheet, and you could see these big holes in the ice called  moulins. Into those moulins are flowing, rushing rivers of meltwater.  You can see them. They are blue, and they run across the ice and down  into the hole, and they go all the way down to the bottom, 2 miles  thick, where they lubricate the space between the ice and the land and  accelerate the ice in its moving toward the ocean. ``Accelerate.'' That  is an important term. That is a term I heard at the University of Maine  from their climate scientists. That is a term I have heard from  scientists in other parts of the country. ``Accelerate.'' ``Abrupt.''    We all think of things changing very slowly; as a matter of fact, the  very term glacial means ``moving slowly.'' Not anymore. We went to the  Jakobshavn Glacier, the largest glacier that is draining the ice sheet  of Greenland, and it has retreated as much in the past 10 years as in  the prior 100 years. It has retreated as much in the past 10 years as  in the prior 100 years. Do the math, and that is 10 times the rate that  the ice is flowing off the Greenland ice sheet into the ocean and  raising sea levels.   One of the problems with what is going on now is the process of  acceleration. For example, everybody knows that the ice in the Arctic  Ocean is disappearing at an unprecedented rate. A cruise ship went  through the Arctic Ocean last summer. The Arctic Ocean has been closed  throughout human history. It has been unavailable for commerce. You  couldn't get through. It was always covered with ice. In the summer it  would clear a little bit. Now we are talking about international trade  through the Arctic Ocean.   What happens, though, scientifically, when the sun's rays hit the ice  and the snow, 85 percent of the energy of the sun is bounced back. That  is science. When the ice is gone and the dark ocean is available, 85  percent of the sun's energy is absorbed into the ocean. That is called  a feedback loop. That accelerates. The more it melts, the more it gets  melted, and that is the kind of thing that is happening in Greenland,  in Antarctica, and, indeed, all over the world.   Here is something I learned on my trip to Greenland that I really  hadn't absorbed. If there is anything we think of as a constant, it is  the ocean. You walk down to the beach in Maine or on to the dock in  Portland, you look out, and you see it. There it is. It is the way it  has always been. It turns out it has always been that way for only  8,000 years. It happens to have always been that way when people have  been around and keeping records and taking pictures, but it hasn't  always been that way.   Here is an amazing bit of science that, frankly, I wasn't aware of.  This is the ocean depth 24,000 years ago. This is the ocean depth  today. So 24,000 years ago, it was 390 feet shallower than it is today.  It was 390 feet shallower 24,000 years ago. Why 24,000 years ago?  Because all the water was locked up in the glaciers. In one sense,  Greenland and Antarctica are the last remnants of the glaciers, and  they are now melting.   This period, 24,000 years up to today, is how the oceans have risen.  You can see coincidentally, it has been pretty fixed for 8,000 years,  and that is why we think it is going to always be that way. I used to  teach about the recency effect. All human beings tend to think that  what happened last week is going to happen next week. But this tells us  that the ocean level is variable.   Here is the amazing spot, right here. It is called the meltwater  pulse 1A; all geologists know about this. And if you do the calculation  on this period, the ocean gained about a foot a decade. It got deeper.  The sea level rose about a foot a decade during this period, and this  is what we are facing right now.   The best estimates I have been able to obtain are that we are facing  about a foot to a foot and a half of sea level rise in the next 15  years, and a foot a decade thereafter for the rest of the century. If  you do the math, that is an additional 6 to 8 feet.   In fact, there was an estimate just released last week that says it  is more like 9 feet, 3 meters. Nine feet? Miami is gone; New Orleans,  gone; New York, under deep threat; Bangladesh--we are talking about  national security here because the people who are going to be pressed  into migration because of this are going to create a national security  and a migration crisis, the likes of which this country and the world  has never seen. We are talking about 1 million or 2 million people out  of Syria, and it has caused great uproar here and in Europe. The  estimates are for the migration from climate change in the reasonably  foreseeable future to be 200 million to 500 million people. Think of  the national security implications of that.   And here we are debating a nominee for the Environmental Protection  Agency who says: Well, it is debatable; maybe it is, maybe it isn't.   It is not debatable. This is happening. And for us to ignore it and  to approve this nominee who is hostile, who has sued the Agency, and  who has never done a thing in his life to protect the environment, is  just outrageous. It is a dereliction of our responsibility, and we are  going to look back on this moment and say: What were we thinking?   I understand that the President won. Elections have results. He can  move in the direction he wants to on policy, but this is beyond policy.  This is just fundamentally irresponsible to our children, to their  children, and the future of this country.   So I hope, after this debate and after this discussion, the people of  this body will come together--just as they did with the Secretary of  Labor nominee, who really wasn't appropriate--and say the same thing.   Plus, finally--I will just note this as a parenthetical--there is the  issue of the emails in and out of this fellow's office when he was  attorney general that they have been hiding for 2\1/2\ years or 3 years  that may well become available in a week. If I were someone  contemplating voting for this fellow, I sure as heck would want to wait  until I saw these emails because there may be things there that are  going to be profoundly embarrassing, if not worse.   So there is no reason to move this nomination today, and there is no  reason, in my view, to move this nomination at all.   I understand that the EPA can overreach--any agency can overreach-- and there should be control on regulations. I have worked on regulatory  reform since I have been here, but there is a difference between  regulatory reform and a wrecking ball to the fundamental protections  that have made so much difference to the people of this country.   So I hope we will consider the future in our vote today--not just  ourselves,  [[Page S1365]]  not just the regulations, not just a few people who may be profiting by  the exploitation of these resources, but think about our kids, our  grandchildren, and our ultimate responsibility to this country.   Thank you, Madam President.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.   Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Madam President, I wish to start where the Senator  from Maine left off, and that is with respect to the approximately  3,000 emails that Scott Pruitt, the nominee to lead the Environmental  Protection Agency, has been hiding from public view. I hope all  Senators know now that last night, a judge, Judge Timmons, ordered that  those emails be released so the American public can see exactly what is  going on.   Here is what the judge said: ``There was an abject failure to provide  prompt and reasonable access to the documents that had been  requested.''   Willful ignorance is always a bad policy, and I really hope that the  Senate will not engage in willful ignorance when it comes to the  nomination of Scott Pruitt. Why not wait a few days to see what is in  the emails that were so deliberately hidden from public view? That  should worry every Senator, Republican and Democrat alike.   In addition to all of the concerns that have been raised by my  colleagues on this floor with respect to having Scott Pruitt at the  helm of EPA, Marylanders have a special concern. In fact, those who are  part of the Chesapeake Bay States have a very, very special concern.   The Chesapeake Bay is a natural treasure, and it is a national  treasure. It is the Nation's largest estuary. It is beloved by  Marylanders and beloved by all who benefit from its great bounty.   Marylanders get up in the morning and go crabbing on the bay. It has  also been a source of income for our State and the other bay States.   The reality is that our tourism industry depends on a healthy bay.  Our watermen depend on a healthy bay. Our boating industry depends on a  healthy bay. So it is not only an environmental imperative, it is an  economic imperative in the State of Maryland. And the Chesapeake Bay is  threatened more than almost any other water body in the United States  by pollution. That is because its tidal tributaries have a shoreline  more than the whole west coast of the United States. In other words, if  you look at the water surface of the bay and you look at the surface  area of the rivers and streams feeding into the bay and you look at all  the shoreline there, it is greater than the west coast.   The surface water area, including the 150 major rivers and streams  and more than 100,000 smaller tributaries, is 4,500 square miles. But  the watershed--the landmass that drains into that area--is 64,000  square miles, from six States and the District of Columbia, everywhere  from Virginia to parts of New York State. And because the bay is  threatened by pollution coming from throughout that great area--those  six States and the District of Columbia--back in the 1960s, people  recognized we had to do something about it because we had combined  sewer water overflows, we had fertilizer runoff, we had stormwater  runoff from six States and the District of Columbia bordering the  Chesapeake Bay and threatening its livelihood and threatening the  economy of the State of Maryland.   That is when a number of States got together and said: We have to do  something about it. Senator Mathias, who was a Republican Senator from  the State of Maryland, brought people together and said: We need to do  a national study funded by the Federal Government because, in a  situation where you have so many States contributing to the pollution  of the bay, obviously, it is not within the power of only one State to  do something about it.   And over nearly three decades from those early days back in the 1960s  and beyond, we entered into a number of bay agreements with the three  States immediately around the bay: Pennsylvania, Virginia, Delaware,  and the District of Columbia, and then it got expanded over time. But  despite all of the efforts in those States, it was as if we were on a  treadmill.   The good news is the actions taken by the States, with the help of  the EPA, meant that we were not going backward. It was a little bit as  if we were trying to run up a down escalator. If we hadn't been taking  any action, we would be going down fast. The bay would get more and  more polluted, become less and less healthy. But even with all the  measures we were taking, it was as if we were running in place on that  escalator that was going down.   So in 2009, the bay States decided that they needed to put more teeth  in the enforcement mechanisms to make sure that everybody was being  held accountable for their share of cleaning up this precious natural  resource and natural treasure.   That is when we entered into an agreement with the Environmental  Protection Agency, giving the EPA the authority to help enforce the  provisions of that agreement if any State strayed. And the results have  been very important and very encouraging. Just this January, the  Chesapeake Bay Foundation, in its biannual ``State of the Bay Report,''  gave the Chesapeake Bay its highest, its healthiest score since the  report began in 1987.   I want to be clear. We are still a long way from a healthy Chesapeake  Bay, but we have gone from running in place to actually making a few  steps forward, and that is largely as a result of the efforts of the  bay agreement and the new leverage that the Environmental Protection  Agency has to enforce compliance with that agreement.   Here is where the story of the President's nominee to be the head of  EPA intersects with the Chesapeake Bay. As attorney general of the  landlocked State of Oklahoma, Scott Pruitt decided to join in a court  case to try to blow up this Chesapeake Bay agreement. He decided from  Oklahoma that he wanted to get in the business--the bipartisan business  that had been supported by Republican and Democratic Governors alike,  Republican and Democratic Senators alike, over a long period of time.  He sued, along with others, the EPA to try to prevent the EPA from  playing this important role that helped give us a boost.   Now, the good news is Scott Pruitt and the others failed. The judge  said: Sorry, you are wrong; this does not exceed the EPA's authority.  The good news is that we are going to continue to proceed. But what are  we going to do when Scott Pruitt, who brought that lawsuit against the  Chesapeake Bay agreement, is the Administrator of the EPA?   Senator Cardin, my friend and colleague from the State of Maryland,  asked him about this at the hearing. At the hearing, Scott Pruitt made  some positive statements about this agreement. Then Senator Cardin  wanted to follow up and make sure he heard it straight, and so he  followed up with some questions in writing. What came back were a  series of statements that showed that Scott Pruitt was backtracking on  the commitment he had made--backtracking on his promise to lead a  strong EPA and have an important EPA role in enforcing this Chesapeake  Bay agreement.   In addition to the fact that he has shown willful ignorance about the  dangers of climate change, which are all so very real to the State of  Maryland--just go down to the Naval Academy and ask the superintendent  there, and he will tell you they have many more storm surges right  there in Annapolis as a result of climate change--and so many other  areas where Scott Pruitt has sided with big money, special interests,  polluting special interests, he clearly is somebody whom we worry about  in the State of Maryland with respect to protecting the Chesapeake Bay.   So I ask all my colleagues to join with us in at least demanding now  that we have an opportunity to see the 3,000 emails, which a judge has  required be provided to the public next week.   I hope all Senators don't want to be embarrassed by voting for  somebody today, only to find very compromising emails next week. I  really believe we have an obligation to the American people to ensure  that we have an opportunity to view those emails. I certainly know the  people of Maryland, when it comes to protecting our beautiful  Chesapeake Bay--both because of its natural beauty but also because it  is essential to our economy--join me in encouraging my colleagues to  ask for a delay and, at the very least, vote no on the nomination of  Scott Pruitt.   I yield the floor.  [[Page S1366]]    The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.
