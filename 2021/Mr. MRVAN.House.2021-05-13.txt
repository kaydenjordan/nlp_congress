 Madam Speaker, as the co-chairman of the Congressional  Steel Caucus, I was honored last week to help facilitate a letter to  the Appropriations Committee. This letter expressed our support for the  International Trade Administration and the International Trade  Commission, which are incredibly important to the success of the  American steel industry and its workforce.   The letter encouraged the committee to build on its previous efforts  to provide adequate resources to the ITA and the ITC, so they may  ensure timely and objective responses to trade remedy complaints and  investigations.   Their work is essential to upholding our trade laws and ensuring that  all American workers can compete on a level playing field.   I look forward to continuing to work with the members of the  committee and the Steel Caucus to support these agencies and the  strength of American steelworkers and manufacturers.                            ____________________
