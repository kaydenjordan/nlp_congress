 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         At the end of division A (before the short title), insert       the following:        Sec. __.  None of the funds made available by this Act may       be used by the Environmental Protection Agency to enforce       notification requirements respecting released substances       under subsections (a) through (d) of section 103 of the       Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and       Liability Act of 1980 (42 U.S.C. 9603) or subsections (a)       through (c) of section 304 of the Emergency Planning and       Community Right-To-Know Act of 1986 (42 U.S.C. 11004) with       respect to releases of hazardous substances from animal waste       at farms.    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 504, the gentleman  from Missouri (Mr. Long) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Missouri.    Mr. Chairman, my amendment is very straightforward. It  would  [[Page H7154]]  make clear that two laws enacted several decades ago to manage the  aftereffects of industrial toxic waste spills would not apply to  everyday emissions that are simply a way of life on family farms.   A court decision earlier this year overturned the EPA exemption for  agriculture from reporting requirements under the Superfund and  emergency planning and community right-to-know laws. This court  decision means that over 100,000 farmers and ranchers will be forced to  report odor emissions from livestock and poultry manure.   If farmers and ranchers don't submit these reports, they face  potential lawsuits from the government and any citizen who wishes to  sue them, subjecting them to penalties as high as $53,907 per day for  not filing paperwork. Farmers will lose time and money that would  otherwise be spent growing our Nation's food supply.   Mr. Chairman, I think that it is important that I note that the Obama  administration as well as the Bush administration defended this  exemption. This is not a partisan issue. This is simply a case of  reaffirming congressional intent under the law, as the EPA already  tried to do several years ago.   Mr. Chairman, I urge all Members to vote in favor of my amendment,  and I reserve the balance of my time.   Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Minnesota is recognized for 5  minutes.   Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, this amendment would prohibit the EPA  from requiring agricultural sources to report air emissions under the  Comprehensive Environmental Response Liability Act.   The purpose of this amendment is to circumvent a 2017 court decision  that invalidated an EPA rule which exempted agricultural sources from  such reporting.   Policy riders like this do not belong in the appropriations bills.  The EPA should either accept the court's decision or they should appeal  the decision. At a minimum, something that is this impactive with court  policy does not belong as a rider on an appropriations bill. For that  reason, I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Calvert).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Calvert).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Calvert).    Mr. Chairman, I say this is a nonpartisan issue, and I  would like to point out that the organization, National Association of  SARA Title III Program Officials, back in 2012, in an earlier version  of a similar amendment, had opposed this. Back on May 28 of this year,  they announced that they are no longer in opposition. So I don't really  think it is controversial at all.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.   Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, I just want to point out that, as a State  representative and, even now, as a Member of Congress, I will encounter  people--and I was just at our State fair--over the years, people who  have built homes in rural areas and are contributing to the schools and  maybe have a soybean farm or a community that is built up over the  years around farms. All of a sudden, a hog farm comes in and people are  sick, they are unable to go to work, their children develop lung issues  and all kinds of problems. They come to the State or they come to us as  Members of Congress and say: What is going on here? The air is so  polluted, it is making me and my family sick. I am losing my home. I am  losing my investment.   So I think that there is a role to have these discussions about what  do we do, as a community, to make sure about people who live in some of  these rural areas who all of a sudden find themselves, after decades of  living in the same area, unable to open up their windows on a summer  day.   As I said, that is why I don't think this policy rider belongs in  this bill. I think we need to have a thoughtful discussion on it and  really hear out both sides on many of these agriculture issues,  especially in rural communities.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Long).   The amendment was agreed to.                     Amendment No. 41 Offered by Mr. Buck    The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 41  printed in House Report 115-297.
