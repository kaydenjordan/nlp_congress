 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania  for yielding me the customary 30 minutes, and I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, we are here today to consider a rule for H.R. 1, a bill  that might as well be called the polluters over people act. It is yet  another example of how this majority, instead of helping everyday  Americans, is doing the bidding of their deep-pocketed friends.   We had another mass shooting yesterday, but Republicans won't lift a  finger because of the gun lobby. We had another train derailment this  week, but Republicans won't lift a finger because of the polluters. Our  planet is on fire, but Republicans won't lift a finger because of Big  Oil.   Banks are going under, but Republicans want to deregulate more to  help their friends on Wall Street. They want to protect kids from what  teachers teach in the classroom but not against lead pipes in schools.  They say they want to stop inflation but won't go after the billionaire  corporations who aren't paying any taxes while they rip people off.   Time after time after time, Republicans continue to put politics over  people, and it shows. Anyone who spends 2 seconds reading this bill can  see that it is a dirty energy, pro-polluter plan that would drag our  economy back decades. This bill puts polluters over people. It makes it  easier for companies to strip public lands of their resources and  harder to hold corporate polluters accountable for the mess they make.  It gives more handouts to Big Oil, as if the industry's CEOs and  shareholders haven't already raked in enough money with record profits  over the last few years. It guts half a century of environmental  protections that ensure the air we breathe and the water we drink is  clean, and it sets our country back as the rest of the world moves  toward a clean energy future.   There will be plenty of time for us to talk about all the damage the  polluters over people act could do to our country and communities, but  let me just highlight a few of the worst.   First, it increases the national deficit by half a billion dollars.  Considering how much we hear from our colleagues across the aisle about  the deficit and the deficit and the deficit, it is fascinating that  their most important bill blows a hole in the deficit. So much for  their commitment to fiscal discipline. Don't take my word for it, just  consult the CBO. It is a little bit ironic on a day that they are  asking that there be dramatic cuts in all kinds of programs that help  people in this country, they come up with this bill and add close to a  half a billion dollars to our deficit.   Second, it is a job killer. This bill will kill jobs. Over the last  few years, Democrats have invested in building a homegrown, clean  energy system so we don't have to rely on foreign cartels like OPEC and  greedy Big Oil companies for our energy. Investing in these clean  energy projects meant we created millions of clean energy jobs. The  polluters over people act would kill these jobs and pull our country  off course from our path toward a cleaner, cheaper energy future.   Third, it makes it easier to pollute, and it makes it easier for  companies to get away with polluting. Just yesterday, a local  grandfather in East Palestine, Ohio, detailed the pain caused by the  terrible toxic spill there. He said he has ``never cried this much in  his life.'' His young granddaughters developed blotches all over their  bodies, and their eyes were burning.   This bill would mean more billionaire corporations getting away with  polluting without being held accountable, more wells with toxic  chemicals, more days where windows are shut because the air is not safe  to breathe, more kids diagnosed with asthma because the air quality is  so poor.   The worst part is that the Republicans do not care. Their bill  literally puts polluters over the people we are here to serve. It  forces American taxpayers to foot the bill for cleanup while  billionaire corporations dump their toxic waste on our communities.  This is sick.   Look at what is happening to our planet, Mr. Speaker. Year after  year, the warmest ever recorded; species going extinct at rates not  seen in millions of years; sea levels rising and coastal communities  feeling the impact; farmers struggling to cope with changing seasons,  unprecedented droughts, and crop failures. The answer from my  Republican friends is more fossil fuels, more pollution, more drilling,  more toxic waste dumped into our communities, more giveaways for Big  Oil, and nothing, not a single thing, to lower energy prices.    This bill might as well put ExxonMobil and Chevron in charge of our  response to climate change. It might as well put Norfolk Southern in  charge of chemical safety. It is a terrible bill that will shackle us  to dirty fossil fuels for generations to come.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote on the rule and the underlying  legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, my colleagues seem to want to debate energy policy in  China and in Sri Lanka. That may be a fascinating topic, but that is  not what we are here debating. We are here debating energy policy in  the United States of America.   I don't want us to go down the path of more fossil fuels and reliance  on more energy sources that are going to contribute to climate change.  I want us to lead the world toward a greener and cleaner energy future.  I guess the question really here is: Who do you trust?   My colleagues on the other side of the aisle, their argument is  basically: Trust the big oil companies. Give them unfettered access.  Give them more money and they will lower your prices. Really?   They have the capacity to produce more now, but they are not, and  they are gouging people at the pump. Does anybody believe that the CEOs  of these big oil companies making record profits give a damn about  average people in this country, about your constituents or my  constituents? Give me a break. All they care about is profits. That is  the question that people have to answer: Who do you trust? Do you trust  the big oil companies?   I certainly don't after the way they have behaved--not just recently,  but over time. They gouge people all the time.   The other stuff is fascinating, but we can talk about Sri Lanka at  some other time. I would rather talk about the United States of  America.   Mr. Speaker, I urge that we defeat the previous question. If we do, I  will offer an amendment to the rule to provide for consideration of a  resolution that affirms the House's unwavering commitment to protect  and strengthen Social Security and Medicare, and states that it is the  position of the House of Representatives to reject any cuts to these  programs.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment into the Record along with extraneous material immediately  prior to the vote on the previous question.    Mr. Speaker, Social Security and Medicare are the  cornerstone of our Nation's social safety net. These vital programs are  under threat as my Republican colleagues continue to demand reckless  cuts in exchange for paying our Nation's bills.   Some Republicans have recently claimed that they won't cut Social  Security or Medicare benefits. Mr. Speaker, that empty rhetoric has not  been reassuring to the American people who continue to fear that these  programs will be slashed by my Republican friends.   Today, once again, Democrats are giving Republicans a chance to back  up their claims with action by providing them with a chance to reassure  the American people, not just with their words, but with their votes.  Today, they can vote unequivocally that they will not cut these vital  programs. Anything short is an empty promise.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Vermont (Ms.  Balint), to discuss our proposal.    Mr. Speaker, the gentleman says that this building is  powered by natural gas. I think it is probably more accurate to say it  is powered by hot air.   Mr. Speaker, the bottom line is that this bill is a giveaway to the  oil companies. The gentleman says he doesn't trust Big Oil, but this is  a bill that gives them everything they want--their wish list.   Trust the markets? I don't know that the market can clean up a toxic  waste dump or the market can clean up an oil spill or the market can  monitor clean air.                                time  1245    The bottom line is this bill goes after all of those protections and  actually endangers the American people.   To the gentleman from Pennsylvania, who I hope will read more quotes  because I think it is making it clear--which is shocking in the year  2023--he is making the case that climate change doesn't exist going all  the way back to Al Gore, who actually was right when he said that  climate change was a problem, and selectively taking these quotes from  way back when.   Does anybody believe that climate change isn't real?   Come to Massachusetts. I will introduce you to my farmers who  complain about the impacts of climate change on their ability to make a  livelihood. Maple syrup producers wonder whether they will be able to  get maple syrup out of trees in Massachusetts because of climate  change. I could go on and on about the impacts of climate change on our  local farmers.   Much of this discussion, Mr. Speaker, can be tied back to  Republicans' affinity for culture wars. They just claimed a little  while ago that President Biden and Democrats were planning to come  after Americans' gas stoves. It couldn't be further from the truth. No  one is taking your stove.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to include in the Record a Vox  article titled: ``Five myths about gas stoves, the latest culture war  clash.''    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Florida (Ms. Castor).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, the way everybody is yelling and screaming over there,  you would think that they want to have a debate on ideas, but this rule  actually blocks over three-quarters of all the amendments submitted.   Democrats offered 95 amendments. Mr. Speaker, do you know how many  they made in order? Seven.   That is not just an interesting statistic, Mr. Speaker. It means that  real and important ideas are completely blocked from even being debated  on this House floor on their signature piece of legislation. Many of  these amendments would protect public health and safety and our  environment.   Take, for example, an amendment by Ms. Kamlager-Dove, No. 37, that  requires permits prepared under the NEPA process to include an analysis  of health and safety impacts. That is it. It seems like a good idea to  me.    The amendment sponsored by Mrs. Sykes, No. 118, takes into account  drinking water quality when approving permits. I don't think clean  drinking water ought to be a radical idea, but maybe it is on the  Republican side of the aisle. We should debate it.   Another amendment submitted by Mrs. Dingell, No. 15, would require  the United States to actually reduce its emissions before repealing a  section of the law, the greenhouse gas reduction fund, set up to spur  clean energy projects and reduce air pollution.   I offered three amendments, and they were all blocked. One of them,  No. 94, struck language in this bill providing blanket immunity to  polluters who violate our country's bedrock environmental laws.   Really? Do you think that is objectionable? We can't even debate it  here? We can do 7 hours of general debate, but we can't take 10 minutes  to discuss whether companies should get a blank check to pollute. Whose  side are you on?   Back in January, Speaker McCarthy actually promised both sides ``more  openness, more opportunity for ideas to win at the end of the day.''  Mr. Speaker, that promise has been broken. This Republican majority  knows their  [[Page H1480]]  bills fail to address real problems, so they continue to block our good  ideas from even coming to the floor rather than debating them. They are  scared to let Americans hear our ideas, and that tells you everything  you need to know.   This is important, I think, for my colleagues on both sides of the  aisle to know. My friends across the aisle blocked all six amendments  from the gentleman from Pennsylvania, the co-chair of the Problem  Solvers Caucus, Mr. Fitzpatrick, who happens to be a Republican. They  blocked all six.   Mr. Fitzpatrick's amendments would have opposed drilling in the  Delaware River Basin, ensured the act doesn't preempt a State  constitution, established an infrastructure and environmental  innovation trust fund, preserved the greenhouse gas reduction fund,  prohibited energy exploration activities on any protected public land,  and added a sense of Congress that U.S. citizens have a right to clean  air and clean water.   I get it. My friends are pushing this polluters over people bill, but  our colleague, a Republican who is the co-chair of the Problem Solvers  Caucus, was denied all six of these amendments.   What are you afraid of? Why don't you debate these?   It is unfortunate that those ideas apparently were just too radical  to even be debated on the House floor.   I truly hope that Mr. Fitzpatrick, after witnessing his own majority  block all of his amendments, even the ones the gentleman watered down  with a revision, I hope he will not support this rule. Supporting this  rule would mean the gentleman would be voting to block his own  amendments.   In fact, I ask all Republican members of the Problem Solvers Caucus  to vote ``no'' on this rule because if you don't, this will be the  pattern.   Mr. Speaker, I rhetorically ask the Problem Solvers Caucus how they  plan to solve any problems if their Republican leadership won't even  let them offer their ideas and won't even give them a fair fight on  this floor.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, the gentleman from Pennsylvania just said that when we  introduced H.R. 1, our H.R. 1 was a closed rule. I would urge him to go  back and look at the statistics because our H.R. 1 in the 117th  Congress had a structured rule with 56 amendments in order, more than  the 36 on this bill. In the previous Congress, our H.R. 1 had even more  amendments in order.   If the gentleman can't even be kind of factual about that, what else  should we wonder whether it is based on fact or not?   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from New Mexico  (Ms. Leger Fernandez), a distinguished member of the Rules Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for admitting his  error and admitting that he was wrong when he said H.R. 1 was a closed  rule we brought up. I think perhaps the gentleman might want to go back  and consult some of his research because I think he would also find out  that some of the things he said about climate change would be proven  factually wrong.   I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. Correa).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Colorado (Mr. Neguse), a distinguished member of the Rules Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to  close.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to include in the Record a  letter from nearly 100 energy and environment groups including the  Natural Resources Defense Council, the Sierra Club, The Wilderness  Society, and Oceana.    Mr. Speaker, my colleagues are saying that this bill  doesn't put polluters over people. This letter I include states: ``H.R.  1 would encourage new fossil fuel production and infrastructure,  locking us into increased extraction, high and volatile energy prices,  and even greater profits for fossil fuel companies. It would undermine  bedrock environmental laws through a short-circuiting of government  accountability, meaningful public input, and review. It would put the  interests of industry ahead of the public.''   Mr. Speaker, let me just say, H.R. 1 puts polluters over people. It  does nothing to lower energy costs. Their bill makes it easier for  companies to contaminate our water and spew pollution and God knows  what else into the air. It will make us pay for corporations' messes  while they leave behind a toxic trail of disaster.   The polluters over people act is a massive giveaway that ensures the  GOP's industry friends make more money. I would say to those who are  watching this, follow the money. Look at who the oil companies are  giving their money to.   It jeopardizes American jobs. It worsens the climate crisis, and it  takes monumental steps back from achieving a clean energy future.   Mr. Speaker, we can do so much better. This is such a blatant  giveaway to polluters. This is such a blatant giveaway to big corporate  interests. This is such a blatant giveaway to Big Oil. It is offensive.   I urge a strong ``no'' vote on this rule. I urge a ``no'' vote on the  previous question. I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the  underlying bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.
