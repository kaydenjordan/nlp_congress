 Madam President, I rise in support of Jonathan Meyer's  nomination to be general counsel of the Department of Homeland  Security, or DHS.   Mr. Meyer is an accomplished lawyer and dedicated public servant who  is well qualified to serve as the Department's chief legal officer. His  nomination maintains bipartisan support, including from former DHS  general counsels who served under both Democratic and Republican  administrations.   Mr. Meyer's previous government service spans 17 years and includes  senior roles in the Department of Justice, the U.S. Senate, and as the  deputy general counsel for DHS during the Obama administration.   Since returning to private practice in 2016, Mr. Meyer's legal work  has continued to focus on cyber security, technology, and homeland  security. Throughout the confirmation process, Mr. Meyer has  demonstrated that he understands the complex legal issues facing DHS  and the importance of ensuring that the Department cooperates with  Congressional oversight.   DHS has not had a Senate-confirmed general counsel for over 2 years.  DHS needs qualified, Senate-confirmed leaders in place to effectively  carry out its critical mission of safeguarding our Nation.   I urge my colleagues to confirm Mr. Meyer today.   I yield the floor.
