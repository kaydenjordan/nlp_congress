 Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for  yielding. Also, I thank Representative Khanna, Representative Pocan,  and Chairman McGovern for their work in bringing this very critical  measure to the floor.   Of course, I rise in strong support of H.J. Res. 37. Today, I am  remembering our dear friend and colleague, Congressman Walter Jones,  who was an original cosponsor. I miss him tremendously. I know he would  be down here speaking on behalf of this resolution.   Since 2015, the United States has participated in the Saudi-led  military campaign in Yemen without authorization from Congress. We have  helped create and worsen the world's largest humanitarian crisis. 22.2  million Yemenis, 75 percent of the population, need humanitarian  assistance. At least 85,000 children under the age of 5 have died from  war-related hunger and disease.   Our involvement in this war, quite frankly, is shameful. That is why  this bipartisan measure to end the United States' unconstitutional role  in this war is so important. I have long pushed efforts to repeal the  overly broad 2001 Authorization for Use of Military Force.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on H.J. Res. 37  and to support this bipartisan bill to end the United States' role in  the war on Yemen.    Mr. Speaker, I want to offer my condolences  and prayers to my dear friend, Congressman Walter Jones, and also to  the people of North Carolina, who lost a tireless champion.   Throughout his time in service, Congressman Jones never lost sight of  those he served: the families in North Carolina, people across the  country, and, of course, our brave servicemembers around the globe.   Congressman Jones will be remembered for his limitless compassion and  his willingness to reach across the aisle and to find common ground.   I worked with him on many issues over the years, but our greatest  collaboration was on our shared effort to draw down our endless wars  and bring our brave troops home. He was a colead on several of my  bills, including the one to repeal the 2001 and 2002 Authorization for  Use of Military Force to finally end our limitless wars abroad.   It fills me with unspeakable sadness, Mr. Speaker, that Congressman  Jones did not live to see the end of these wars, but his memory will  live on. We will fight harder in his memory to ensure that Congress  does its job on matters of war and peace.   I was honored to call Congressman Jones my colleague and my friend.  His spirit will be greatly missed in the Halls of Congress, and tonight  I again offer my condolences to his family, his friends; and also, I  celebrate his life, because it was truly a life well lived.                            ____________________
