 Madam Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to Congressman  Alcee Hastings.   Congressman Hastings spent more than 30 years in Congress and fought  for racial equality during his storied and historic life. At the time  of his passing, he was the Dean of the Florida Congressional delegation  as the Representative from Florida's 20th District. Before that, he was  Florida's first African-American federal judge and a strong civil  rights advocate. Congressman Hastings died on April 6, 2021 after a  long bout with pancreatic cancer.   Congressman Hastings was a life-long public servant. He served as a  Circuit Court Judge in Broward County, Florida and then became a U.S.  District Court Judge for the Southern District of Florida. After his  election to Congress in 1992, Congressman Hastings was a leading member  of the Congressional Black Caucus and a senior Democratic whip. He  served as a member of the House Rules Committee and a senior member of  the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, where he was  chairman of the Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations. He was an  esteemed member of Congress throughout his time there.   Personally, I am devastated at the loss of my colleague and mentor,  the Honorable Alcee Hastings. We would talk about his time spent in  Newark as a child and his fond memories of growing up there. While  voting, I would spend many days sitting next to him and listening to  the wisdom he imparted on me. His blunt honesty and brilliance as a  legislator were second to none. We even shared our love of colorful  socks. The Lord has another one of my Fathers on the Floor of Congress  with him no and I will miss him dearly.                            ____________________
