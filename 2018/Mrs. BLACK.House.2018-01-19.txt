 Mr. Speaker, the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection  Act requires doctors and nurses present during an abortion to properly  care for a child who survives it. It is an oath that we take to save  lives.    Imagine that, Mr. Speaker. A doctor must give the same care to a baby  born alive after a botched abortion that they would give to a baby born  any other way at the same gestational age.   We are talking about saving living, breathing human beings, human  beings that were formed in the image of their Creator with inherent  dignity.   I am appalled when my friends from the other side of the aisle say it  would endanger a child to take them to a hospital and to actually call  for emergency care where all of the services are provided in an  ambulance and take them to a hospital where they would have the best  chance to survive.   As a grandmother and a nurse, it is utterly appalling that we have to  pass legislation to save babies that are left to die.   Whether or not we agree that life begins at conception--and I truly  hope that one day we will--this bill is merciful, it is humane, and it  is just.   Abortion is brutal for both the mother and the child, and providing  care for babies who have survived this horrific practice should never  be a question. No one should be against this. We all should gather  together and say that if a healthcare professional does not help to  save the life of that baby that is born of a botched abortion, they  should be held criminally liable just as they would for any other life  that they refuse to save.
