 I yield the floor.    Madam President, I thank the Senator from Maine for  helping us coordinate this very important moment today, and I, too,  want to recognize the presence of our former colleague, who is playing  such a great role in helping us commemorate next year as such a very  important time for us to recognize the important role of women's voices  in American politics.   I join my colleagues today to commemorate the 100th anniversary of  the Senate's passing of the 19th Amendment and to honor all the women  who struggled hard and long to make sure our democracy included our  voices, the voices of all women, all those women who saw the promise of  the United States and fought for their place in it. Those women helped  craft a more perfect union. For nearly a century, these women fought to  be heard, and their efforts fundamentally transformed our democracy and  our country.   I am very proud to represent a State with a long tradition of women  activists and leaders. Today, I want to recognize two influential  suffragists from my State--Emma Smith DeVoe and May Hutton. Both women  were pioneers in the struggle to get the right to vote. In an era when  women were given few opportunities, these two women refused to be held  back. They instead paved a way for women to fully engage in the  political process.   Tacoma resident Emma Smith DeVoe built the Washington Equal Suffrage  Association and led the successful campaign to enshrine women's  suffrage in Washington's State Constitution a full 10 years ahead of  the ratification of the 19th Amendment. She helped win the right to  vote for women in Idaho in 1896 and led campaigns in other States,  speaking and organizing rallies and sit-ins, and she helped found the  National Council of Women Voters to continue the nationwide suffrage  movement and educate newly enfranchised women about politics across the  country. Her efforts got her the nickname ``the Mother of Woman's  Suffrage.''   May Hutton, the other activist from our State, overcame a very  difficult childhood. She and her husband became successful  entrepreneurs and devoted much of their self-made wealth to activism.   When they moved to Spokane from Idaho in 1906, May actually lost her  right to vote in the process. She quickly set out to work to change  that injustice and win the franchise for women in every State in the  territory.   She wrote:         Women should vote because they have the intelligence to       vote. They should vote because it gives them       responsibilities, and responsibilities better fit women for       all conditions of life. Equality before the law gives women a       fair chance with men in a question of wages for the same       work.    There you go--a century ago, someone standing up for women to have  the same wage in work, and that is the work we continue here today.   She continued:         In other words, the enfranchisement of women means a square       deal for all.    May stood tall for more than just women's rights; she proposed  extending the franchise to all adults, regardless of sex, race, or  color.   Washington's territorial legislature gave women the right to vote in  1883, but it was struck down by the courts. Because of the continuous  efforts of Ms. DeVoe, Ms. Hutton, and so many others, women finally  gained the franchise in Washington in 1910--a full decade before this  right was guaranteed nationally. Emma Smith DeVoe and May Hutton paved  the way for so many women. Washington State is proud of their work, and  we are proud of their accomplishments.   As we honor them today, we must also recognize that the struggle for  equal rights is still not over. We have more to do. We know that our  country is stronger, more representative, and more successful when we  include women at every table and in every boardroom and at every ballot  box and in every discussion in our families and in our communities, but  we need to be reminded of the example of Emma and May so that other  suffragists know that we remember their work and are grateful for it  and that we are going to continue the fight to get equal access and  equal representation in all issues in the United States.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the  introduction of Senate legislation to help us deal with the affordable  housing crisis in the United States of America.   Many of my colleagues know how pervasive this problem is. Not only is  affordable housing a crisis, but the homeless population that results  from not having enough housing stock in the United States of America is  also a crisis and ends up costing us more money to deal with the same  population.   This is not a new issue. It is not a new problem. We have been trying  to fight to address this issue in the U.S. Senate and to deal with the  affordable housing crisis for years, but the magnitude of the problem  is getting worse. We need to respond by helping to increase supply.  That is because we have so many demographic trends which we see in  report after report citing and documenting what is happening in the  United States of America.   We have an ever-increasing senior population that is living longer  and baby boomers reaching retirement, many of whom need more affordable  housing than there is in the marketplace.   We have returning veterans from our overseas missions who are coming  home and who also need affordable housing.   We need workforce housing. Many parts of the United States of America  have had great economic success but have not kept pace with the amount  of housing stock, and, thus, the supply and pricing has resulted in  astronomical challenges to provide affordable housing within a region  that doesn't leave people driving hours a day just to commute to their  jobs.   We have the remnants of our economic crisis during the great  recession that left so many people without affordable housing and the  fact that we did not keep pace with supply.   Over the last 2 years, I have worked with many organizations at the  national level and participated in the announcement of many reports  done by practically every institution of any significance in the United  States. They all came to the same conclusion: We need to increase  supply.   That is why I am introducing the Affordable Housing Tax Credit  Improvement Act of 2019, along with my colleagues Senator Young of  Indiana, Senator Isakson of Georgia, and Senator Wyden of Oregon, to  strengthen and improve the affordable tax credit that we already have  in place. My colleagues in the House--Representatives DelBene,  Marchant, Beyer, and Walorski--are also introducing companion  legislation today.   We did make progress in the last Congress in increasing the  affordable tax credit. This tax credit helps provide resources for 90  percent of the federally-funded affordable housing that is built in the  United States of America. That is because it takes the tax credit to  incent people to build at this more affordable rate.   I have always said to my colleagues that I am willing to consider any  other ideas that we have to increase affordable housing and will work  with anybody to increase supply in the United States, and I am open to  any ideas. But until we have ideas that are more successful than this,  I am going to continue to push the affordable housing tax credit and  push to increase the supply of the tax credit so that we can increase  the supply of affordable housing.   We have a housing crisis in the State of Washington. It doesn't  matter whether you are in Spokane or Walla Walla or Yakima or  Vancouver. Our urban areas feel it the most and are most pinched. It  causes problems for our law enforcement. It causes problems for our  healthcare delivery system. It causes problems for our transportation  system. The way out of this problem is to build more affordable  housing.   Increasing the amount of tax credit by 50 percent over the next 10  years will give our States, our cities, and our counties more resources  to build affordable housing. It will also provide stability in the  value of affordable housing tax credits used in the bond finance  markets and place a 4-percent  [[Page S3219]]  floor under the credit. This gives more certainty to those who are  building housing and producing it and rehabilitating that in the  market.   It also maximizes the availability of the private activity bonds by  recycling any multifamily bonds that are used along with housing  credits to build affordable housing. Together, these steps would help  us build hundreds of thousands of new units of affordable housing over  the next 10 years.   In my State and other States, it would mean that we would see a 50- percent increase in the amount of credit available over the next 10  years. That is so important because each housing project that is built  takes more people out of the dire situations they are in, takes the  vulnerable population and gives them the opportunity to move forward.   It also saves us dollars. The Senate Finance Committee has heard time  and again from those testifying--whether it is the homebuilders or the  health insurance industry--that it is more costly to deal with this  population while they are homeless. That is to say, you can't deliver  job training to a tent. And somebody who doesn't have proper home and a  stable place to live is more likely to show up in our healthcare  delivery system, costing us more money.   This legislation will also make it easier for formerly homeless  students to also get help from the affordable housing tax credit under  current HUD rules of the program.   It also helps those who are protected under the Violence Against  Women Act can also qualify for affordable housing as they have in the  past.   We know that the challenge of moving forward on affordable housing is  something that is a bipartisan issue. The tax credit has had bipartisan  support for many, many years in the U.S. Congress. We just need to put  the pedal to the metal and provide more of the tax credit so that we  can get more affordable housing built in the United States of America.   I hope my colleagues will help by signing on to this legislation, and  as we discuss various proposals in the Finance Committee regarding tax  policy, I hope my colleagues will help us push to our States and  communities more solutions that will deal with this crisis.                                  ______                                         By Mr. JONES:   S. 1708. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to  establish a refundable tax credit for the installation of a storm  shelter at a qualified residence; to the Committee on Finance.
