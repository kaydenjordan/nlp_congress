 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and memorialize  community leader and advocate Linda Dale Shaner.   Linda graduated from Imperial High School in 1964 and dedicated her  life to improving the lives of others.   She committed her time and energy to improving the health and well- being of those in her community, especially those in the Imperial  Valley.   Despite her own diagnosis, Linda showed her passion for fighting  cancer through her advocacy and volunteer work with the American Cancer  Society Cancer Action Network for over 20 years and through her  incredible contributions to working on policies at the local, State,  and Federal levels.   Linda is survived by her husband Steve, daughters Stephanie and  Christina, and grandchildren Steve and Avery.   A family and community mourns the loss of a loved one, an advocate,  and a friend.   Today, we recognize her and thank her.                            ____________________
