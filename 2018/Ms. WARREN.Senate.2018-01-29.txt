 Mr. President, I want to thank the senior Senator from  Washington for her leadership on this important issue and for gathering  women to come to the floor today to talk about the Republican bill that  has been proposed and that we will be voting on soon.   When I was a girl growing up in Oklahoma, women got abortions. Make  no mistake, abortions were illegal back then, but women got them.  Desperate women turned to back-alley butchers, and some even tried the  procedure on their own, using coat hangers or drinking turpentine. Some  were lucky, but some weren't. Some women bled to death. Some died of  infection. Some were poisoned. And they all went through hell.   In 1973, the Supreme Court stepped in. Forty-five years after Roe v.  Wade, abortions are safer than getting your tonsils out. A lot of women  are alive today because of Roe. Nearly 70 percent of Americans agree,  Roe v. Wade is worth celebrating.   I wish I were here today to acknowledge the impact of Roe. Instead, I  am here to defend it from attack.   Last week President Trump marked the anniversary of Roe v. Wade by  calling for a ban on a rare category of abortions--ones that take place  after 20 weeks of pregnancy. So today, the Senate is voting on a bill  to do exactly that.   Let's be honest about why this vote is happening now. Today's vote is  happening because politicians who have never been pregnant, who have  never had an abortion, who have never had to make a wrenching decision  after learning that the child they are carrying will not survive  childbirth--those politicians want to score political points at the  expense of women and their families.   We are having this vote today because President Trump asked for it.  If it passes, this unconstitutional bill would put women's lives and  women's health at risk. Government officials who seek to insert  themselves between women and their doctors ought to listen to the women  whose lives are on the line and the doctors who care for them. If they  were listening right now, we wouldn't be holding this vote.   Only 1 percent of abortions take place at 21 weeks or later, and the  reasons are heartbreaking. I have heard from people across  Massachusetts who shared their devastating stories. The Senate should  hear these stories.   One woman who wrote to me explained that she was ecstatic to have a  second child but learned late in her pregnancy that her daughter's  brain was severely malformed. She said:         Being a grown woman with a husband and daughter, I never       imagined that I would need to [get an abortion]. But when I       learned that the baby I was carrying suffered from a set of       severe brain malformations, I faced a binary choice for her:       peace or life. . . . I am deeply grateful that I was able to       give her the gift of peace.    She and her husband did what they thought was best for their baby  girl. They got an abortion in the third trimester.   Another couple chose to get an abortion at 22 weeks, after learning  that their son's heart would never fully develop. The husband wrote to  me:         His pulmonary veins did not connect to his heart in the       right place. He had ventricular septal defect, an atrial       septal defect . . . and the left side of his heart was       smaller than his right. . . . We hoped to be eligible for in-      utero heart surgery, but our fetal cardiologists told us that       our son's heart could not be fixed. Our little boy--our       miracle--wasn't going to make it.    He described their choice as an act of mercy. He said:         My wife and I are both pro-life, and we would never       encourage an abortion. [But] there isn't a day that I regret       what we did because we both believe our child is watching       over us from a safer place. There also isn't a day I wonder       who else could possibly understand what we went through. No       law can save my child from his complex congenital heart       disease, or save my wife from her suffering.    But the bill we are voting on today says that the government should  have been part of that decision--no, not just part of that decision. It  would have allowed the government to make that decision, instead of  leaving the choice to these brokenhearted parents.   The bill we are considering today would ban all abortions after 20  weeks, with only limited exceptions. It would force women to carry an  unviable fetus to term. It would force women with severe health  complications to stay pregnant until their lives were on the line.  Whatever you believe about abortion generally, this legislation is  dangerous and cruel.   Devastating fetal abnormalities aren't the only reason women get  abortions after 20 weeks. Some women face so many delays when seeking  an abortion, like finding a provider, raising money for the procedure,  and paying for travel costs--so many delays that a procedure they  wanted earlier in pregnancy gets pushed later and later. These  logistical hurdles fall hardest on young people, on women of color, and  on low-income communities.   What is behind some of these delays? State-level abortion  restrictions pushed through by Republican legislatures that close down  clinics and make it harder for women to get access to the care they  need. You heard that right. Republican-sponsored abortion restrictions  push women to have abortions later and later, and today, Republicans in  the Senate push a bill to ban late abortions. It is all connected.   This bill is only one part of a broad and sustained assault by  Republican politicians on women's rights to make decisions about their  own bodies. Through repeated efforts to limit birth control access, to  defund Planned Parenthood, and to restrict abortions, Republicans are  chipping away at women's health, women's safety, and women's economic  independence.   If Mitch McConnell or Paul Ryan or Donald Trump actually wanted to  reduce abortions, they could embrace policies that would lessen the  economic pressures of pregnancy and of motherhood. They could act to  help pregnant women and their babies access healthcare early and often.  They could help young women avoid unwanted pregnancies in the first  place.   Instead, they have spent the last year doing exactly the opposite.  They have held vote after vote to try to gut the Affordable Care Act  and Medicaid, when we should be expanding those programs. Affordable  healthcare, accessible contraceptives, and other programs that support  working women and families are all under attack. And today, Republican  politicians want to distract from their hypocrisy with an  unconstitutional 20-week abortion ban--one that will not pass, that  ignores the actual experiences of women, and would cause enormous harm  if it were signed into law.   Today's vote, which we all know will fail, isn't about policy; it is  about political theater. But women don't get abortions to prove a  political point. Reproductive rights are about health. They are about  safety. And this particular vote about banning abortions at 20 weeks is  about a bunch of politicians intruding on one of the most wrenching  decisions that a woman will ever make.   It has been 45 years since Roe v. Wade; 45 years since women gained  the constitutional right to a safe, legal abortion; 45 years since the  days of illegal abortions. I have lived in that America. I have lived  in the world of back-alley butchers and wrecked lives. And we are not  going back--not now, not ever.   Thank you.   I yield the floor.  [[Page S534]]
