 Mr. Speaker, Republicans, over the last few  months, have said that they would fundamentally change health care in  the United States, and it is clear today that they have. They have made  it much worse.   I want to highlight one provision that allows for States to permit  insurers to get rid of essential healthcare benefits and charge people  more who have preexisting conditions. Think about that for a second.   In my home State of Texas, the Governor and other State leaders have  already turned their back on so many people, allowing foster care  children to sleep in State offices, allowing sex trafficking and human  trafficking victims to go to jail because there is nowhere else to put  them.   You should ask yourselves: What will your leaders do? Will they allow  insurers to charge you more for preexisting conditions like diabetes  and hypertension and cancer and asthma?   Do you think, and do you trust, that they are going to do the right  thing by you? Because today, this plan allows them to abandon you.
