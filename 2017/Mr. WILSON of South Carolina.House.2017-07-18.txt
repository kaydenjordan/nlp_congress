 Mr. Speaker, it is sad many Americans  have forgotten the ongoing global war on terrorism declared against  Western families by war fatwas in 1996 and 1998, as displayed at the  entrance of the National September 11 Memorial & Museum in New York  City.   In the last year, there has been a year of terror in Europe, as  reported by The Washington Times on Friday. Beginning in defiance of  the anniversary of Bastille Day on July 14, 2016, at Nice, France, with  86 people murdered, it continued with attacks in Berlin, Germany, on  July 18; Ansbach, Germany, on July 24; Reutlingen, Germany, on July 24;  Normandy, France, on July 26; Berlin, Germany, on December 19;  Istanbul, Turkey, on January 1; London, England, on March 22;  Stockholm, Sweden, on April 7; Paris, France, on April 20; Manchester,  England, on May 22; and London, England, on June 3.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget  September the 11th in the global war on terrorism. We will never forget  the 85 men and women murdered in the AMIA Jewish Center bombing in  Buenos Aires, Argentina. I am grateful President Donald Trump is taking  actions to protect American families.                            ____________________
