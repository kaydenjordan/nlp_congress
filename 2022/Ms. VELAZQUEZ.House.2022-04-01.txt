 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this legislation  because it is long overdue for our Federal laws to catch up with the  legal reality in almost every State in the Union, and because Federal  reform must place restorative justice as the top priority.   I thank Speaker Pelosi, Chairman Nadler, and my fellow chairs for  once again bringing this legislation to the House floor.   Mr. Speaker, voters in States like New York have led the way in  changing their cannabis laws, emphasizing restorative justice for our  most marginalized communities. This bill takes a meaningful approach to  undo the wrongs of the failed war on drugs by removing cannabis as a  schedule I drug and encouraging States to expunge low-level possession  records.   Importantly, the MORE Act also helps entrepreneurs access affordable  capital to start a legitimate business, which too often is a barrier to  entrepreneurship for people of color regardless of industry.   As chair of the Committee on Small Business, I am proud the MORE Act  includes measures my colleagues and I championed to ensure SBA  programs, like the flagship 7(a) Loan Program, the disaster loan  program, and Small Business Development Center resources, are available  to legitimate cannabis businesses. The MORE Act is the best proposal to  ensure communities disproportionately impacted by the prohibition of  cannabis are best positioned to profit from its legalization.   Mr. Speaker, for that reason, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes.''
