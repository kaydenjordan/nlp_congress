 Madam President, in 1974, after the House Judiciary  Committee voted to approve Articles of Impeachment against President  Nixon, Chairman Peter Rodino, of my home State of New Jersey, a  lifelong Newark resident of my home city who had been thrust into the  high-profile position only the previous year, returned to his office  and called his wife. When she answered the phone, this chairman, this  longtime Congressman broke down in tears and cried.   Forty-six years later, our Nation has found itself under similar  duress, and I agree with my fellow Newarker--impeaching a President is  a profoundly sad time for our Nation. It is a painful time. No matter  what party, if you love your country, then this is heartbreaking.   When we think about our history as Americans, so many of us have  reverence for our Founding Fathers and our founding documents. They  represented imperfect genius. We talk about the Declaration of  Independence. We hail the Constitution. These documents literally bent  the arc of not just our own history but human history for democratic  governance on the planet. While these were milestones in the path of  our Nation's relatively brief existence, the governing document that  came between the Declaration of Independence and our Constitution is  often overlooked--the Articles of Confederation.   With the benefit of hindsight, it is easy to view the development of  our Nation as preordained, inevitable--as if it were an expected march  toward the greatness we now collectively hail, that this was somehow a  perfectly plotted path toward a more perfect union. But it wasn't.   In 1787, as our Founders gathered in Philadelphia, our fledgling  country was at a crisis and at a crossroads. Its future, as in so many  moments of our past, was deeply uncertain.   You see, when the Framers designed our system of government in the  Articles of Confederation, you can say they overcompensated. With the  tyranny of King George III fresh in their minds, they created a  government with powers so diffuse and decentralized that nothing could  really get done. Instead of one Nation, we were operating essentially  as 13 independent States. The Federal Government could not tax its  citizens. It could not raise money. It lacked a judiciary and an  executive branch.   So when our Framers arrived in Philadelphia that hot summer, they  would have to thread a difficult needle, providing for a strong central  government that represented the people and one that also guarded  against the corrupt tendencies that come when power is concentrated, as  they well knew was so in a monarchy.   Our democratic Republic was their solution. The Nation needed a  powerful Executive, yes, but that Executive needed guardrails, and his  power needed to be checked and balanced. So the Framers created what we  now almost take for granted--three coequal branches of government: the  legislative, the executive, and judicial branches. Each branch would  have the ability to check the power of the other branches to ensure, as  James Madison so profoundly argued, that ambition would ``be made to  counteract ambition.''   But this system of checks and balances was not enough for our  Founders. Still reeling from their experience under the oppressive rule  of the King, many feared an unaccountable, autocratic leader. So the  Founders created a mechanism of last resort--impeachment.   George Mason prophetically asked the Founders to wrestle with the  concept of impeachment at the Constitutional Convention, saying:  ``Shall any man be above Justice?''   The Founders answered that question with a resounding no. The  Constitution made clear that any Federal officer, even the President,  would be subject to impeachment and removal. No one--no one--no one is  above the law. This was seen as the ultimate safeguard, and it has only  been invoked twice before in American history. This is the third.   I sat in this very spot and listened to the evidence presented,  honoring my oath to be objective, and based on the evidence that was  presented in hour after hour after hour of presentations, I concluded  that the President, Donald John Trump, is guilty of committing high  crimes and misdemeanors against the United States of America, against  the people. I believe he abused the awesome power of his office for  personal and political gain to pressure a foreign power to interfere in  the most sacred institution of our democracy, our elections. He then  engaged in a concerted,  [[Page S843]]  far-reaching, and categorical effort to cover up his transgression and  block any efforts for the people's representatives to have the truth.   It brings me no satisfaction to come to this conclusion. I feel that  sadness of my predecessor. Yet we have sworn an oath to protect and  defend the Constitution of the United States.   This is not a moment that should call for partisan passions. It is  not a moment that we think of in terms of the limitlessness of personal  ambition. This is a patriotic moment. It is about putting principle  above party. It is about honoring this body and the Senate's rightful  place in our constitutional system of checks and balances. It is about  fulfilling the enormous trust the Founders placed in this body as an  impartial Court of Impeachment and a necessary check on what they  foresaw as the potential for ``grave abuses'' by the Executive.   If we fail to hold this President accountable, then we fail the  Founders' intent; we fail our democracy; and I fear the injury that  will result.   When our grandchildren and their children read about this chapter in  the history books at a time far into the future, when this President is  a memory along with those of us serving in this Chamber, it will not be  seen through the eye of politics or partisanship. They will read about  how this body acted in their moment of constitutional crisis. I fear  that their unflinching eyes, at a time when the full body of evidence  will be out in the public domain, will see clearly how this body  abdicated its constitutional responsibilities, surrendering them to  partisan passions. They will read about how the Senate shut its doors  to the truth, even though it was within easy reach; how, for the first  time in our history of impeachment proceedings for judges and for past  Presidents, the world's greatest deliberative body conducted an  impeachment trial without demanding a single witness and without  subpoenaing a single document; how, even as new evidence during the  trial continued to be uncovered, the Members of this body failed to  even view it. They failed to pursue with even the faintest effort those  things that would have easily and more perfectly revealed the breadth  and depth of the President's misconduct.   We know across the street, in the Supreme Court, the saying is that  justice is blind, but that means that no one is above the law. It does  not mean that this body should abdicate its responsibilities and it  should abandon its senses and even abandon common sense. If there is  evidence we know about that could speak beyond a reasonable doubt to  this President's alleged crimes and misconduct, it makes no sense  whatsoever that we should deny, in this deliberative body, the truth-- the truth.   This kind of willful ignorance, this metaphorical closing of our eyes  and ears, is a grave danger to any democracy. It is the rot from  within, when the ideals of truth and justice fall victim to the toxic  tyranny of absolute partisanship.   This President has claimed authoritarian power that our Constitution  was explicitly designed to prevent. He has literally said that article  II allows him to do whatever he wants. That outrageous statement  tomorrow could be given life within this democracy.   He has declared himself unaccountable to and above the law. He has  shredded the very governing ideals of this great Republic, and we, the  Senate, the body designed to check such abuses of power, that  ``dignified . . . independent . . . unawed and uninfluenced'' tribunal,  as Hamilton so famously wrote in Federalist Paper No. 65, have been  enablers to this destructive instinct.   This is a sad day. This is a sad moment in the history of this body  and in our Nation, and I fear that it is emblematic, that it is a  symptom of deeper challenges to this Nation, challenges that are being  exploited by our enemies abroad and by opportunists here at home.   The factionalism that our Founders warned us of has deepened beyond  mere partisanship to a self-destructive tribalism. The ``cunning,  ambitious, and unprincipled men'' seeking to subvert the power of the  people, as Washington predicted in his profound and prophetic Farewell  Address, have found their season to flourish here in our time. Many in  our society now hate other Americans, not because of the content of  their character or their virtue and the values they hold dear, but we,  as Americans, now more and more see hate proliferating in our country  between fellow Americans because of what party we belong to.   We have failed to listen to the words that come out of each other's  mouths, failed to listen to the ideals or the principles or the  underlying facts because we now simply listen to partisanship. This  Nation was founded with great sacrifice. The blood, sweat, and tears of  our ancestors, which gave life and strength to this Nation, are now  being weakened and threatened, as our very first President warned.   And, yes, today is a sad moment, but we, as a nation, have never been  defined by our darkest hours. We have always been defined by how we  respond to our challenges, how we have refused to surrender to  cynicism, and how we have refused to give in to despair.   As Senator after Senator today gets up and speaks, I fear that mere  words in this time are impotent and ineffective. It may mark where we  as individuals stand for the record, but the challenge demands more  from all of us in this time. We have already seen on this Senate floor  that sound arguments have been dismissed as partisanship. We have heard  speech after speech and seen how they will not cure this time. They  will not save this Republic from our deepening divides.   So I ask: What will? How? How do we heal? How do we meet this crisis?  I know that this President is incapable of healing this Nation. I have  never seen a leader in high office ever take such glee in meanness. He  considers it some kind of high badge of virtue in the way he demeans  and degrades his political adversaries. He demonizes others, often the  weak in our society, and I firmly believe that he has shown that he  will even conspire with foreign nations to defeat his adversaries, and  then defend himself not with any truth or transparency but by trying to  heighten and ignite even more partisan passions.   So the question is really, How do we heal this Nation? How do we meet  this challenge that is not embodied in any individual?   It was a man far greater than me named Learned Hand who said:         Liberty lies in the hearts of men and women; when it dies       there, no constitution, no law, no court can save it; no       constitution, no law, no court can even do much to help it.       The spirit of liberty is the spirit which is not too sure       that it is right; the spirit of liberty is the spirit which       seeks to understand the minds of other men and women; the       spirit of liberty is the spirit which weighs their interests       alongside its own without bias.    I continue to quote this great judge.         Our dangers, as it seems to me, are not from the outrageous       but from the conforming; not from those who rarely and under       the lurid glare of obloquy upset our moral complaisance, or       shock us with unaccustomed conduct, but from those, the mass       of us, who take their virtues and their tastes, like their       shirts and their furniture, from the limited patterns which       the market offers.    I love our Nation's history. I am telling you right now we have seen  that the true test of our democracy will not come simply from the low  actions from our leaders on most high. The true test of our democracy  will not turn alone on the actions of this body because Presidents  before and this body before have failed us in dark times. They failed  the ideals of freedom when time and again they defended slavery. This  body has failed the ideals of liberty when time and again it rejected  civil rights. This body has failed the ideals in the past of equality  when it voted down, again and again, suffrage for women. Lo, Presidents  before and the Senate before has failed this Nation in the darkest of  times. As the songs of my ancestors have said, our path has been  watered with the tears and blood of ancestors.   How do we heal? How do we move forward? I say on this dark day that  the hope of this Nation lies with its people. As Learned Hand said: The  spirit of liberty is not embodied in the Constitution. Other nations  have constitutions and have failed. The hope of this Nation will always  lie with its people.   So we will not be cured today, and, I tell you, tomorrow's vote--it  is a defeat. But we, as a people facing other defeats in this body,  must never be defeated. Just like they beat us down at  [[Page S844]]  Stonewall and they beat us back in Selma, the hope of this Nation lies  with the people who faced defeats but must never be defeated.   So my prayer for our Republic, now yet in another crisis in the  Senate, is that we cannot let this be leading us further and further  into a treacherous time of partisanship and tribalism where we tear at  each other and when we turn against each other. Now is the time in  America where we must begin, in the hearts of people, to turn to each  other and to begin to find a way out of this dark time to a higher  ground of hope. This is not a time to simply point blame at one side or  another. This is a time to accept responsibility.   Like our ancestors in the past so understood, that change does not  come from Washington. It must come to Washington. As I was taught as a  boy, we didn't get civil rights because Strom Thurmond came to the  Senate floor one day and pronounced that he had seen the light. No,  this body responded to the demands of people, and now is a time that we  must demand the highest virtues of our land and see each other for who  we are--our greatest hope and our greatest promise.   We are a weary people in America again. We are tired. We are  frustrated. But we cannot give up. That flag over there and we who  swear an oath to it and don't just parrot words or say them with some  kind of perfunctory obligation--but those who swear an oath to this  Nation--must now act with a greater unyielding conviction. We must act  to do justice. We must act to heal harms. We must act to walk more  humbly. We must act to love one another unconditionally. And now, more  than ever, perhaps we need to act in the words of a great abolitionist,  a former slave, who in a dark, difficult time when America was failing  to live up to its promise, gave forth a sentiment of his actions  captured in the poetry of Langston Hughes. He declared through his deed  and through his work and through his sacrifice:       America never was America to me,      And yet I swear this oath--      America will be!    As a Nation, in this difficult time where we face the betrayal of a  President, the surrender of obligation by a body, may we meet this time  with our actions of good will, of a commitment to love and to justice,  and to yet again elevating our country so that we, too, may be like, as  it says in that great text, ``a light unto all Nations.''   I yield the floor.
