 Mr. Speaker, yesterday, on Monday, I  hosted and chaired a Listening Session on Organic Agriculture at our  State capitol in Harrisburg.   Agriculture is a key economic driver in Pennsylvania and remains the  Commonwealth's number one industry. One in seven jobs in Pennsylvania  is connected to agriculture, a fact especially important in rural  areas, generating some $7.4 billion in sales in 2017.   Yet agriculture in Pennsylvania and around the country goes well  beyond our local communities. Our farmers not only feed, clothe, and  provide energy and fiber for all Americans, but also to many other  nations around the world.   Pennsylvania agriculture is diverse and encompasses a wide array of  commodities and production methods. Monday's listening session was  specifically focused on the organic agriculture sector in Pennsylvania.   I was proudly joined by my colleagues, Congressman Scott Perry and  Congressman  Tom Marino, as well as Pennsylvania's agriculture deputy  secretary, Cheryl Cook. We heard from a number of expert panelists,  including: Leslie Zuck of Pennsylvania Certified Organic; Dr. Kristy  Borrelli of Penn State extension; Scott Sechler of Bell & Evans; Ken  Rice, an organic livestock feed seller; Andrew Kline, an organic beef  and milk producer; and Hannah Smith-Brubaker of the Pennsylvania  Sustainable Agriculture Association, or PASA.   We heard some tremendous testimony from the all-star panel, and I  thank them for their insights. Over the past decade, organic  agriculture has flourished around the Nation. From 2015 to 2016, the  number of certified organic farms nationwide increased to more than  14,000, and the number of certified acres increased by 15 percent,  according to the USDA.   Pennsylvania has been a leading State in organic agriculture with  more than 800 farms across the Commonwealth. With some farms  transitioning and others just starting out in agriculture, organic is  being supported in a variety of ways. Through Pennsylvania Certified  Organic, Penn State's extension activities, stakeholder organizations,  and the State Department of Agriculture, many are working to help  farmers who wish to transition to organic farming.   There have also been a variety of supports put in place at the  Federal level. Title X of the farm bill is the horticulture portion of  the law which covers specialty crops, local and regional foods, and  organic agriculture.    The 2014 farm bill included $34 million annually to organic  producers. This includes support for USDA's Organic Agriculture  Research and Extension Initiative, the National Organic Certification  Cost Share Program, the National Organic Program, and the Organic Data  Initiative. The farm bill also authorizes the Beginning Farmers and  Ranchers Program, the Farmers Market and Local Food Promotion Program,  the Market Access Program, the EQIP Organic Initiative, and our bedrock  agricultural conservation programs.   Mr. Speaker, as you know, the House and Senate have been working  diligently to write the next farm bill as the current law expires in  September. Writing a new farm bill is timely, as rural areas have been  hit hard by farm recession in recent years with the average farm income  roughly half of what it was just 5 years ago.   Since both the House and Senate have passed versions of the farm  bill, I look forward to working out the differences in conference. This  new law will certainly continue to support both traditional as well as  organic agriculture on many fronts, and I look forward to getting the  final bill across the finish line.         Honoring World War I Heroes in Clinton County, Pennsylvania     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the  memory of two World War I heroes from Clinton County, Pennsylvania.   Private First Class Ira Cranmer Keller and Corporal Beale Marshall  Darby are the hometown soldiers for which the county's Keller & Darby  Memorial Park is named. Private First Class Keller was 24 years old and  the first Clinton County soldier to be killed during World War I.  Corporal Darby was only 18 years old and is the second hometown soldier  to lose his life in the Great War.   Their families donated land in North Bend to be used as a public  park, forever commemorating their sacrifice for our freedom. This  Sunday, there will be a formal memorial and rededication ceremony. A  World War I Soldiers' Commemorative Monument will also be unveiled in  the park.   Mr. Speaker, a century later, we are celebrating the lives of these  two soldiers and honoring the sacrifice that they made to this great  Nation. To this day, the park honors these North Bend heroes, as their  families intended. It is a place where we will always remember the  sacrifices that come with our freedom, and we will never forget.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to welcome  members of the Penn State 4-H program to the Nation's Capital. This  afternoon, students will share their 4-H experiences with me and  discuss the importance the program has had in their lives.   4-H is open to all young people regardless of where they live, what  their backgrounds are, or what interests them. From traditional  activities for youth in rural places to after-school programs for city  youth, 4-H has it all.   Last month, Penn State 4-H hosted the first Pennsylvania 4-H Science  of Agriculture Challenge in State College. Scores of 4-H teams competed  in the challenge that was based around the American Farm Bureau's  Pillars of Agricultural Literacy.   First place went to the Westmoreland County equestrian team. The  marketing team from Clarion County came in second. Third place went to  the Armstrong County Idea Makers. Teams from Allegheny County and  Washington County rounded out the top five winners.   Mr. Speaker, 4-H plays an incredible role in the lives of American  students who are learning leadership, citizenship, and life skills. I  am proud that 4-H helps so many reach their full potential.                            ____________________
