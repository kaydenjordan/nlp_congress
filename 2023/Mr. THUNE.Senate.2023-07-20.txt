 Mr. President, currently, the Senate is considering one of  the most important pieces of legislation that we consider each year,  and that is the National Defense Authorization Act.   It is a bill that authorizes funding for our men and women in uniform  and our defense needs--from planes, ships, and submarines to weapons,  logistics, and communications technology.   The United States has long had a reputation for military strength,  and part of that reputation has rested on the strength of our  equipment, but in recent years, our technological advantage has eroded  to the point where there is reason to be concerned whether we would win  a war against a major power like China. While we have made some  progress to reverse this trend, we have a lot more work to do to ensure  our military retains our technological edge, and I am glad that this  year's NDAA makes progress toward this goal.   Today, I want to talk about one critical aspect of America's defense  capabilities in particular, and that is long-range strike, specifically  our bombers.   Long-range strategic bombers have played a critical role for the  United States in a number of conflicts, but today's bomber force is  desperately in need of an update. Our bomber inventory is roughly one- third the size that it was in 1989, and it is the oldest in Air Force  history. Experts warn that, in a conflict, the current U.S. bomber  force would be insufficient against an adversary like China.  Fortunately, this is one problem that we have made a concerted effort  to address.   Congress, the Pentagon, and successive administrations have been at  work developing a next-generation strategic bomber for a number of  years, and we finally have it. That is the B-21 Raider. It is a sixth- generation, long-range strategic bomber, and it will take its first  flight later this year.   This is something that, as I said earlier, our Nation has a vital  interest in making sure it is completed and that we get that important  military asset as part of our defense arsenal as we look at the threats  that we face around the globe today.   The Air Force calls the Raider the future backbone of its bomber  force, and Secretary of Defense Austin says it is ``deterrence the  American way.''   The B-21 is an example of what American ingenuity can achieve. It  will be able to penetrate hostile air defenses and reach targets  anywhere in the world, which 90 percent of our current bomber force  can't do, all while launching from the United States and deploying  stealth technologies that you have to see--or should I say--not see to  believe. This is a remarkable capability. Its systems will be able to  evolve with a changing threat environment and incorporate new  technologies within the airframe, and it will be able to work alongside  the technologies of tomorrow, such as unmanned aircraft and artificial  intelligence.   The specter of the B-21 has already caused a stir in China, and I am  certain that it will cause our adversaries to think twice about  aggression.   I am proud that when the B-21 enters service in the next few years,  South Dakota's Ellsworth Air Force Base will be Main Operating Base 1-- home to both the formal training unit and the first operational  squadron. The men and women of Ellsworth are working hard to prepare  for this important new mission, and I am working to ensure they have  everything they need to successfully carry it out.   Last year, I worked to ensure that Congress provided not only for the  development and initial production of the B-21 but for support  facilities at Ellsworth that will be needed for the aircraft, including  a radio frequency facility and a weapons generation facility.   I was also able to secure language in last year's NDAA to create a  pilot program to evaluate dynamic airspace concepts. Dynamic airspace  will allow airspace boundaries to evolve as military exercises  progress, enabling larger volumes of airspace for realistic training  for aircraft like the B-21.   I am pleased to report that this year's NDAA authorizes full funding  for the next steps of the B-21 mission, including continued bomber  development and procurement as well as continued investment in the  required support facilities at Ellsworth.   In looking at Ellsworth today, it is hard to imagine that its future  was in jeopardy not that long ago. Shortly after I came to the Senate,  the Department of Defense's Base Realignment  [[Page S3440]]  and Closure Commission recommended Ellsworth for closure. So one of my  first priorities as a U.S. Senator was just keeping Ellsworth open, and  I will say the odds were not in our favor. But thanks to an all-hands  effort by our congressional delegation and State and community leaders,  we proved to the BRAC commission that Ellsworth was too valuable of an  asset to lose. Then we got right to work in building up the base so  that we would never again find ourselves in the same position.   Today, Ellsworth is home not only to the B-21 bomber--the current  workhorse of long-range strike--but also the Air Force Financial  Services Center; the 89th Attack Squadron, which remotely controls MQ-9  Reapers; the Powder River Training Complex, which is the largest  training airspace in the continental United States; and, soon, the B-21  bomber.   Once slated for closure, Ellsworth is set to be a critical part of  our Nation's defense long into the future, and I will continue to do  everything I can to support both the base's mission and the men and  women who make it happen.   As I have noted, the B-21 represents a substantial advance in our  Nation's long-range strike capabilities, and it will help ensure that  we are more prepared to meet the threats of the 21st century.   But as critical as it is, long-range strike is just one aspect of our  Nation's defense, and we will have a lot of work to do to strengthen  our Nation's readiness across the board. We need more B-21-type efforts  to leverage the best of our technological advancements to upgrade other  aspects of our Nation's defense, and we need them quickly. The war in  Ukraine, as well as war games addressing the defense of Taiwan, have  made clear the cost of a major conflict, and if we hope to avoid such  conflicts and deter future attacks against our country or our allies,  we need to make restoring our readiness a top priority.   As we move forward, I will continue to do everything I can to support  not only our airmen at Ellsworth and the B-21 mission but the critical  work of upgrading our Nation's military capabilities.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator  from Wyoming (Mr. Barrasso.)
