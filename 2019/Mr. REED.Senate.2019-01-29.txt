 Mr. President, public schools play a vital role in every  community across the Nation. They play a central role in our  democracy--educating the next generation, serving as polling places for  our elections, hosting community meetings and events, and so much more.  When there is a natural disaster or an emergency, people often gather  at their public schools for shelter, information, and resources. They  are essential facilities and must be included in any new major federal  investment in infrastructure. That is why I am proud to partner with  Chairman Scott in the House of Representatives in introducing the  Rebuild America's Schools Act to fix our schools. I would like to thank  my Senate colleagues who are joining in this effort, including Senators  Brown, Cortez Masto, Hassan, Warren, Whitehouse, Casey, Cardin,  Duckworth, Merkley, Harris, Hirono, Gillibrand, Van Hollen, Rosen,  Blumenthal, and Sanders.   Safe, healthy, modern, well-equipped schools are essential for  advancing student achievement and ensuring that the next generation is  prepared to meet the economic, social, environmental, and global  challenges our nation faces. Yet, too many of the over 50 million  students and six million staff who learn and work in our public schools  spend their days in facilities that fail to make the grade. A 2014  Department of Education study estimated that it would cost $197 billion  to bring all public schools into ``good'' condition. Nationally, there  is also a $38 billion funding gap in annual capital construction and  new facility funding, as reported in the 2016 State of Our Schools  report. Despite the benefits and need, however, Federal funding  accounts for 0.2% of the total current capital investment in our  schools.   State and local communities cannot bridge this gap alone. Last  November,  [[Page S744]]  Rhode Island voters approved a general obligation bond of $250 million  dollars--the largest statewide bond ever--to upgrade our public school  facilities. However, the State had identified over $2.2 billion in  needed improvements to school infrastructure. Rhode Island is not the  only State facing a school infrastructure crisis. In fact, the American  Society of Civil Engineers gave public school buildings across the  country an overall grade of D+ in their 2017 report card. The scope of  the school infrastructure crisis is more than many, States or  communities can address on their own. The Federal government can and  should be a partner in upgrading our public school facilities.   Addressing this need is not only the right thing to do for our  students; it will also give a needed boost to our economy, putting  people to work in family sustaining jobs. According to an analysis by  the Economic Policy Institute, every $1 billion spent on construction  generates 17,785 jobs.   The Rebuild America's Schools Act of 2019 will create Federal-State  partnership for school infrastructure. It will provide, over ten years,  a total of $100 billion in direct grants and school construction bonds  to help fill the annual gap in school facility capital needs, while  creating nearly two million jobs.   Specifically, the Rebuild America's Schools Act will provide $7  billion per year in formula funds to States for local competitive  grants for school repair, renovation, and construction. States will  focus assistance on communities with the greatest financial need,  encourage green construction practices, and expand access to high-speed  broadband to ensure that all students have access to digital learning.  Our legislation would also provide $30 billion for qualified school  infrastructure bonds (QSIBs), $10 billion each year from FY 2020  through FY 2022, and restore the Qualified Zone Academy Bonds (QZABS)  that were eliminated in the Republican Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The  legislation also eases the matching requirements and expands the  authority and eligible purposes of QZABS to allow local education  agencies to construct, rehabilitate, retrofit, or repair school  facilities. The Rebuild America's Schools Act also supports American  workers by ensuring that projects use American-made iron, steel, and  manufactured products and meet labor standards.   I would like to thank the broad coalition of educators, community  organizations, unions, civil rights advocates, and employers that have  provided feedback and support for this legislation, including the  American Federation of Teachers, Association of Educational Service  Agencies, Association of School Building Administrators International,  Brick Industry Association, Californians for School Facilities, Council  of Great City Schools, Healthy Schools Network, International Union of  Operating Engineers, International Union of Painters and Allied Trades,  National Association of Elementary School Principals, National  Association of Federally Impacted Schools, National Association of  Secondary School Principals, National Concrete Masonry Association,  National Education Association, National PTA, National Rural Education  Advocacy Consortium, National Rural Education Association, National  Urban League, North America's Building Trades Unions, Organizations  Concerned About Rural Education, Public Advocacy for Kids, Rebuild  America's Schools, Rural School and Community Trust, Secure Schools  Alliance, Teach Plus, Twenty-First Century Schools Fund, and U.S. Green  Building Council. We look forward to expanding this coalition in the  weeks and months ahead.   We have no time to waste in fixing our deteriorating school  infrastructure. In the words of a student activist in Providence,  ``Students cannot learn in a crumbling building, a school that isn't  fit to uplift our minds.'' We need to listen to our students,  strengthen our communities, and improve our school buildings. I urge  all of our colleagues to support the Rebuild America's Schools Act and  press for its passage.                            ____________________     Mr. President, public schools play a vital role in every  community across the Nation.
