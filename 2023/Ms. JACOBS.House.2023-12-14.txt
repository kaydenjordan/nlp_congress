 Mr. Speaker, as the youngest Jewish Member of Congress, I  know personally how hard it feels to be Jewish because I live it every  day.   I was in the House Chamber on January 6 when insurrectionists stormed  the Capitol wearing T-shirts saying six million was not enough.   I have experienced anti-Semitism my whole life: Jokes about my big  nose, my fuzzy hair, being called a kike while waiting to get a drink  at a bar.   Anti-Semitism was on the rise before October 7, and now it is running  rampant. In San Diego, we know how hateful and deadly it can be. Four  years ago, we mourned a beloved community member who was killed in the  Chabad of Poway, and it seems like every other week we are washing  swastikas off our buildings or sidewalks.   I am so grateful to President Biden for his leadership, for not  politicizing our pain, and for bringing together Jewish Members to  discuss a whole-of-society approach to countering anti-Semitism.   We need to fully fund and implement the U.S. National Strategy to  Counter Antisemitism to ensure that Jewish people are safe and  respected everywhere.   I am committed to this work, not just for a news cycle but for life,  and I hope my colleagues will join me in that effort.                            ____________________
