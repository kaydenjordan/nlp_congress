 Mr. Speaker, we are in the second day of this Trump  shutdown because Republicans won't take yes for an answer.   Senator Schumer went to the White House and had a deal with President  Trump until the Freedom Caucus vetoed it and forced the President to go  back on his word again.   Senator Schumer offered President Trump his border wall. Republicans  said no.   Senate Democrats offered short-term continuing resolutions to keep  the government open. Republicans said no.   Mr. Speaker, I offered a 4-day CR to keep the government open while  we work on reaching a budget agreement that adheres to parity. Mr.  Meadows objected, and the Republicans again said no.   When, I ask, will Republicans take yes for an answer?   I ask: Will the Republican leadership allow its Members to vote for a  clean CR to reopen the government instead of giving its most extreme  Freedom Caucus faction a veto in order to perpetuate the Trump  shutdown?   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to bring up H.R. 4872, the End  the Shutdown Act of 2018, a continuing resolution that would  immediately reopen the government through Tuesday while negotiations  continue on a budget agreement that adheres to parity and on other  critical issues.    Mr. Speaker, I have a parliamentary inquiry.    Mr. Speaker, am I parliamentarily correct that a  continuing resolution is not necessary if, in fact, an appropriations  bill has been passed to fund the government?    Mr. Speaker, am I correct?
