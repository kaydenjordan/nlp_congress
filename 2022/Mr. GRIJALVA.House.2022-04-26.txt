Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and to include extraneous material on the measure under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 270, the Brown v. Board of  Education National Historic Site Expansion Act. This bipartisan bill  would rename the Brown v. Board of Education National Historic Site in  the State of Kansas as the Brown v. Board of Education National  Historic Park.   It would also expand the park to include four affiliated sites in  South Carolina, Virginia, Delaware, and the District of Columbia  relating to court cases on school desegregation that were consolidated  into the Supreme Court case of Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka,  an acknowledgment that I think is important of the entire list of  plaintiffs in that historic court decision.   This legislative effort will continue to elevate the important  stories and education of the civil rights movement through these  affiliated sites and national historic park designation.   This bipartisan bill passed the Senate with an amendment by voice  vote in April. The House companion legislation is sponsored by our  colleague from South Carolina, the majority whip, Representative    James Clyburn.   Earlier this Congress, the House Natural Resources Committee held a  hearing on his bill and ordered it favorably reported by unanimous  consent.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Clyburn for championing this  bill, and I urge my colleagues to support its adoption. I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Clyburn.)    Mr. Speaker, let me thank Representative Clyburn for  his comments and for reaffirming that our national identity is driven  by our history and that history is something that all of us need to  learn.   Mr. Speaker, I urge support of this legislation, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 2793) to reauthorize the Highlands Conservation Act, to  authorize States to use funds from that Act for administrative  purposes, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2793         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the measure under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2793, the Highlands Conservation Reauthorization  Act, is led by my colleague, Representative Sean Patrick Maloney. The  bill reauthorizes funding for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and  the U.S. Forest Service to protect and conserve the Highlands region.   The beautiful Highlands region spans 3.4 million acres across  Connecticut, New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania.   This area has retained its splendor due in part to the passage of the  Highlands Conservation Act of 2004, which authorized the Fish and  Wildlife Service and the Forest Service to work with State and local  governments and NGOs to conserve this ecosystem.   Since 2004, $28 million in Federal funds, matched by $53 million in  non-Federal funds, have permanently protected almost 13,000 acres of  land. These lands protect clean, safe drinking water; sustain healthy  forests and wildlife populations; encourage productive agriculture; and  provide quality recreation opportunities for the public.   I commend my colleague for his leadership on this bipartisan bill to  reauthorize the Highlands Conservation Act and ensure the continued  success of this program.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the legislation, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from New York (Mr. Sean Patrick Maloney) and thank him for  being the driving force in bringing this legislation to this point.    Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 3525) to establish the Commission to Study the Potential  Creation of a National Museum of Asian Pacific American History and  Culture, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the measure under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3525, the Commission To Study  the Potential Creation of a National Museum of Asian Pacific American  History and Culture Act, introduced by my friend and colleague,  Representative Grace Meng.   This legislation would establish a commission to study and report on  the potential creation of a national museum of Asian Pacific American  history and culture in the District of Columbia and its surrounding  areas.   The establishment of this commission is a first step in acknowledging  the long history, role, and contributions of Asian Americans in  American culture.   I thank Representative Meng for championing this piece of  legislation. I urge my colleagues to support its adoption, and I  reserve the balance of my time.                                           House of Representatives,                               Committee on House Administration,                                     Washington, DC, March 30, 2022.      Hon. Raul M. Grijalva,      Chairman, Committee on Natural Resources,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Grijalva: I am writing to you concerning H.R.       3525. There are certain provisions in the legislation which       fall within the Rule X jurisdiction of the Committee on House       Administration.        In the interest of permitting your committee to proceed       expeditiously to floor consideration, the Committee on House       Administration agrees to forego action on the bill. This is       done with the understanding that the Committee on House       Administration's jurisdictional interests over this and       similar legislation are in no way diminished or altered. In       addition, the Committee reserves its right to seek conferees       on any provisions within its jurisdiction which are       considered in a House-Senate conference and requests your       support if such a request is made.        I would appreciate your response confirming this       understanding with respect to H.R. 3525 and ask that a copy       of our exchange of letters on this matter be included in your       committee report on the bill and in the Congressional Record       during consideration of the bill on the House floor.            Sincerely,                                                       Zoe Lofgren,      Chairperson.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                  Committee on Natural Resources,                                      Washington, DC, April 5, 2022.      Hon. Zoe Lofgren,      Chair, Committee on House Administration,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chair Lofgren, I write to you concerning H.R. 3525,       the ``Commission To Study the Potential Creation of a       National Museum of Asian Pacific American History and Culture       Act.''        I appreciate your willingness to work cooperatively on this       legislation. I recognize that the bill contains provisions       that fall within the jurisdiction of the Committee on House       Administration. I acknowledge that your Committee will not       formally consider H.R. 3525 and agree that the inaction of       your Committee with respect to the bill does not waive any       future jurisdictional claim over the matters contained in the       bill that fall within your Committee's Rule X jurisdiction. I       am pleased to support your request to name members of the       Committee on House Administration to any conference committee       to consider such provisions.        I will ensure that our exchange of letters is included in       the Congressional Record during floor consideration of the       bill. I appreciate your cooperation regarding this       legislation and look forward to continuing to work with you       as this measure moves through the legislative process.            Sincerely,                                                  Raul M. Grijalva,                          Chair, House Natural Resources Committee.                                time  1530     Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to  the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Meng), the sponsor of the  legislation.  [[Page H4481]]         Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  New Jersey (Mr. Kim).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Cardenas).    Mr. Speaker, this legislation is important. It comes at  the right time. It is an affirmation of the inclusiveness, diversity,  and the equal status of all of us as Americans.   I am very proud to support this. I urge its adoption, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 5973) to reauthorize the Great Lakes Fish and Wildlife  Restoration Act of 1990, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 5973         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Great Lakes Fish and       Wildlife Restoration Reauthorization Act of 2022''.       SEC. 2. REAUTHORIZATION OF THE GREAT LAKES FISH AND WILDLIFE                     RESTORATION ACT OF 1990.         (a) Reports.--Section 1008 of the Great Lakes Fish and       Wildlife Restoration Act of 1990 (16 U.S.C. 941f) is       amended--        (1) in subsection (a), in the matter preceding paragraph       (1)--        (A) by inserting ``and not later than December 31, 2027,''       after ``2021,'';        (B) by striking ``Committee on Resources'' and inserting       ``Committee on Natural Resources''; and        (C) by inserting ``, with respect to the period covered by       the report'' after ``describes''; and        (2) in subsection (b), in the matter preceding paragraph       (1), by striking ``2016 through 2020'' and inserting ``2023       through 2028''.        (b) Reauthorization.--Section 1009(a) of the Great Lakes       Fish and Wildlife Restoration Act of 1990 (16 U.S.C. 941g(a))       is amended, in the matter preceding paragraph (1), by       striking ``2016 through 2021'' and inserting ``2023 through       2028''.        (c) Administrative Costs.--Section 1009(a)(1)(B) of the       Great Lakes Fish and Wildlife Restoration Act of 1990 (16       U.S.C. 941g(a)(1)(B)) is amended by striking ``5'' and       inserting ``3''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the measure under consideration  today.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   H.R. 5973, the Great Lakes Fish and Wildlife Reauthorization Act, is  sponsored by the gentlewoman from Michigan (Mrs. Dingell), my friend  and colleague from the Natural Resources Committee.                                time  1545    This bill reauthorizes funding for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service  to combat pollution, invasive species, and habitat loss in the Great  Lakes region.   The Great Lakes Basin is the largest body of fresh water on the  planet, holding 18 percent of the world's freshwater supply. Some 35  million people across 8 States and Canada depend on the basin for  drinking water, jobs, and recreation.   The Great Lakes are also a habitat to more than 500 migratory bird  species, more than 140 species of fish, and many endangered and  threatened species.   However, agricultural and industrial waste pose a threat to the water  quality in the basin. There are extensive populations of harmful  invasive species. And wildlife species are at risk due to habitat loss.   Fortunately, since 1990, the Fish and Wildlife Service has worked  with local communities and NGOs to restore the Great Lakes Basin by  tackling pollution, removing invasive species, and restoring essential  habitats.   Congress has reauthorized funding for this important program three  times, and I urge them to do so again today so that the Fish and  Wildlife Service can continue the excellent work that they are doing in  protecting that extraordinary and necessary ecosystem.   I commend my colleague, Representative Dingell, for her work on this  important bipartisan bill.   Mr. Speaker, I urge its adoption, and I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to  the gentlewoman from Michigan (Mrs. Dingell).    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 6023) to require the United States Postal Service to  continue selling the Multinational Species Conservation Funds  Semipostal Stamp until all remaining stamps are sold, and for other  purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 6023         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Multinational Species       Conservation Funds Semipostal Stamp Reauthorization Act of       2021''.       SEC. 2. REAUTHORIZATION; REQUIREMENT TO SELL ALL STAMPS.         (a) In General.--Section 2(c) of the Multinational Species       Conservation Funds Semipostal Stamp Act of 2010 (39 U.S.C.       416 note; Public Law 111-241) is amended--        (1) in paragraph (2)--        (A) by striking ``of at least 6 years,''; and        (B) by inserting before the period at the end the       following: ``and ending not earlier than the date on which       the United States Postal Service provides notice to Congress       under paragraph (5)''; and        (2) by adding at the end the following:        ``(5) Requirement to sell all stamps printed.--        ``(A) In general.--The United States Postal Service shall       sell each copy of the Multinational Species Conservation Fund       Semipostal Stamp that the United States Postal Service prints       under this Act.        ``(B) Notification of congress.--The United States Postal       Service shall notify the Committee on Homeland Security and       Governmental Affairs in the Senate, the Committee on       Environment and Public Works of the Senate, the Committee on       Oversight and Reform of the House of Representatives, and the       Committee on Natural Resources of the House of       Representatives when all copies of the Multinational Species       Conservation Fund Semipostal Stamp printed under this Act       have been sold.''.        (b) Retroactive Applicability.--The amendments made by       subsection (a) shall take effect as if enacted on the day       after the date of enactment of the Multinational Species       Conservation Funds Semipostal Stamp Reauthorization Act of       2013 (Public Law 113-165; 128 Stat. 1878).       SEC. 3. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS.         The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the measure under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 6023, the Multinational Species Conservation Funds  Semipostal Stamp Reauthorization Act is led by my friend and colleague  on the Committee on Natural Resources, Representative   Jim Costa.   The Multinational Species Conservation Fund Semipostal Stamps are a  unique way for Americans to contribute to important conservation  projects. Semipostal stamps are postage stamps sold at higher rates  than standard stamps. When purchasing this type of stamp, Americans  elect to contribute the extra charge to a specific fund or cause--in  this case, the conservation of threatened species worldwide.   African and Asian elephants, great apes, turtles, rhinos, and tigers  are threatened from decades of habitat loss, poaching, pollution, and  climate change. These stamps support efforts to tackle poaching,  improve community engagement and outreach, restore habitat, and raise  public awareness about wildlife trafficking. In fact, between 2011 and  2017, these stamps raised almost $4 million for conservation projects.   However, the U.S. Postal Service has had to stop selling them when  the program's authorization ran out. Approximately 49 million stamps  remained. Annual appropriations bills have been directing the Postal  Service to continue selling the stamps but in a piecemeal fashion. This  bill would fix it once and for all.   The bill directs the U.S. Postal Service to sell all the rest of  these stamps. In doing so, we can continue to support the ongoing  conservation efforts for endangered species around the world.   Let me thank Representative Costa for his work on the legislation,  urge support for it, and I reserve the balance of my time.                                           House of Representatives,                               Committee on Oversight and Reform,                                  Washington, DC, February 28, 2022.      Hon. Raul M. Grijalva,      Chairman, Committee on Natural Resources,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Grijalva: I write concerning H.R. 6023, the       Multinational Species Conservation Funds Semipostal Stamp       Reauthorization Act. This bill contains provisions within the       jurisdiction of the Committee on Oversight and Reform. As a       result of your having consulted with me concerning the       provisions of the bill that fall within our Rule X       jurisdiction, I agree to forgo consideration of the bill, so       the bill may proceed expeditiously to the House floor.        The Committee takes this action with our mutual       understanding that by foregoing consideration of H.R. 6023,       we do not waive any jurisdiction over the subject matter       contained in this or similar legislation, and we will be       appropriately consulted and involved as the bill or similar       legislation moves forward so we may address any remaining       issues within our Rule X jurisdiction. Further, I request       your support for the appointment of conferees from the       Committee on Oversight and Reform during any House-Senate       conference on this or related legislation.        Finally, I would appreciate a response confirming this       understanding and ask that a copy of our exchange of letters       on this matter be included in the bill report filed by the       Committee on Natural Resources as well as in the       Congressional Record during floor consideration thereof.

I acknowledge that your Committee will       not formally consider H.R. 6023 and agree that the inaction       of your Committee with respect to the bill does not waive any       future jurisdictional claim over the matters contained in the       bill that fall within your Committee's Rule X jurisdiction.       Additionally, the Committee on Natural Resources confirms our       mutual understanding that the Committee on Oversight and       Reform will be appropriately consulted and involved as the       bill or similar legislation moves forward including the       appointment of conferees during any House-Senate conference       involving this or similar legislation.        I will ensure that our exchange of letters is included in       the bill report, if any, and in the Congressional Record       during floor consideration of the bill. I appreciate your       cooperation regarding this legislation and look forward to       continuing to work with you as this measure moves through the       legislative process.            Sincerely,                                                  Raul M. Grijalva,                          Chair, House Natural Resources Committee.     Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 6201) to extend the authority for the establishment of a  commemorative work to honor enslaved and free Black persons who served  in the American Revolution, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 6201         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``National Liberty Memorial       Preservation Act''.       SEC. 2. EXTENSION OF AUTHORITY FOR ESTABLISHMENT OF                     COMMEMORATIVE WORK.         Notwithstanding section 8903(e) of title 40, United States       Code, the authority provided by section 2860 of the Military       Construction Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013 (division       B of Public Law 112-239; 126 Stat. 2164; 40 U.S.C. 8903 note)       shall continue to apply through September 30, 2027.       SEC. 3. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS.         The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the measure under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 6201, the National Liberty  Memorial Preservation Act, introduced by my friend and colleague,  Representative Bonnie Watson Coleman.   This legislation would extend the authority for the establishment of  a commemorative work to honor enslaved and free Black persons who  served in the American Revolution. Extending this authorization would  allow the congressionally authorized National Mall Liberty Fund D.C. to  continue fundraising and construction of this memorial near the  National Mall in Washington, D.C.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Watson Coleman for championing  this bill. I urge my colleagues to support its adoption, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to  the gentlewoman from New Jersey (Mrs. Watson Coleman), the sponsor of  the legislation.    Madam Speaker, I urge support for the legislation, and  I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 6651) to establish an Alaska Salmon Research Task Force.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 6651         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Alaska Salmon Research Task       Force Act''.       SEC. 2. PURPOSES.          The purposes of this Act are--        (1) to ensure that Pacific salmon trends in Alaska       regarding productivity and abundance are characterized and       that research needs are identified;        (2) to prioritize scientific research needs for Pacific       salmon in Alaska;        (3) to address the increased variability or decline in       Pacific salmon returns in Alaska by creating a coordinated       salmon research strategy; and        (4) to support collaboration and coordination for Pacific       salmon conservation efforts in Alaska.       SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS.         It is the sense of Congress that--        (1) salmon are an essential part of Alaska's fisheries,       including subsistence, commercial, and recreational uses, and       there is an urgent need to better understand the freshwater       and marine biology and ecology of salmon, a migratory species       that crosses many borders, and for a coordinated salmon       research strategy to address salmon returns that are in       decline or experiencing increased variability;        (2) salmon are an essential element for the well-being and       health of Alaskans; and        (3) there is a unique relationship for people of Indigenous       heritage who rely on salmon for subsistence and traditional       and cultural practices.

Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the measure under consideration.  [[Page H4486]]     Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, H.R. 6651, the Alaska Salmon Research Task Force Act,  establishes a task force of fisheries scientists and Alaskan  stakeholders to study, address, and prevent salmon fishery disasters in  Alaska.   Led by the late dean of the House, our colleague and friend,  Representative Don Young, this bill is a perfect example of how he  fought for what is best for Alaska.   Salmon are a vital part of the Alaskan way of life. Their cultural,  economic, nutritional, and recreational impact cannot be overstated.  But, over the past decade, there have been several fishery disasters  that have put those very salmon at risk.   These financial, ecological, and cultural strains have created an  increasingly dire situation for the Alaskan communities that rely on  salmon, especially Native Alaskan communities.   This bill creates the Alaska Salmon Research Task Force, a group of  members from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the  North Pacific Fishery Management Council, and Alaskan stakeholders, to  ensure that Alaskans are at the forefront of the Alaskan salmon  research efforts taking place in their backyards.   I believe the bill is a fitting tribute to our departed friend. It  elevates Alaskan voices, especially Native Alaskans, and it brings  stakeholders together to build consensus and find a practical solution  to this pressing issue in our 49th State.   I urge my colleagues to support this legislation to safeguard Alaskan  salmon fisheries for generations to come.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I urge support of the legislation, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (S. 497) to establish the American Fisheries Advisory Committee to  assist in the awarding of fisheries research and development grants,  and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.

Section 2(c) of the Act of August 11, 1939 (15 U.S.C. 713c-      3(c)), is amended by adding at the end the following:        ``(6) Any person awarded a grant under this subsection       shall make publicly available a title and abstract of the       project to be carried out by the grant funds that serves as       the public justification for funding the project that       includes a statement describing how the project serves to       enhance United States fisheries, including harvesting,       processing, marketing, and associated infrastructures, if       applicable.''.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the matter under consideration.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of S. 497, the American  Fisheries Advisory Committee Act, led by Senator Sullivan and the late  Representative Don Young.   This legislation establishes a committee to manage awards for  fisheries research and development grants. This important funding,  provided under a grant program at NOAA, helps maintain sustainable,  competitive fisheries and working waterfronts.   The fishery advisory committee would be comprised of representatives  from the different coastal regions of the United States and would  include members of the seafood harvesting and processing industries.  This structure ensures that research and funding decisions are informed  by those who work and live in each region.   The inclusion of seafood harvesters and processors, recreational and  commercial fishers and growers, and members of the fishery science  community as representatives for each region will promote equitable,  sustainable, and science-based fisheries management, ensuring longevity  and productivity of this vital industry.   I urge support of the legislation, and I reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I have the same response as the  gentleman, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 441) to provide for the conveyance of certain property to  the Tanana Tribal Council located in Tanana, Alaska, and for other  purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.

(d) Limitation on Applicability.--The provisions in this       section apply only to the property conveyances specifically       required by this Act.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the matter under consideration.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, H.R. 441, the Don Young Alaska Native Health Care Land  Transfers Act of 2022, serves as a testament to the legacy of advocacy  that the late dean of the House and our friend, Don Young of Alaska,  provided Alaska Natives.   This particular legislation was something that he was urging--as  recently as right before his passing, before we all left--upon me to  move as quickly as possible, and I am glad that we have been able to  get it to this point.   This legislation directs the U.S. Department of Health and Human  Services to convey certain parcels of land to the Tanana Tribal  Council, the Southeast Alaska Regional Health Consortium, and the  Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium for the purpose of expanding  social and healthcare services.                                time  1615    Together, these three nonprofit entities support the Alaska Native  communities as Tribal health and social service providers in both urban  and rural settings.   The Tanana Tribal Council, located in Tanana, Alaska, provides  outpatient services to Alaska Natives. Since the council is rurally  located, healthcare services are often underfunded and harder to come  by.   This legislation's conveyance of approximately 11.25 acres of land to  the council will allow it to build a new facility and expand existing  services to its Indian Health Service beneficiaries, thereby increasing  the quality of care available.   The Southeast Alaska Regional Health Consortium delivers care to  Alaska Natives as one of the oldest and largest Native-run healthcare  organizations in the United States. The consortium operates the Mt.  Edgecumbe Hospital, a 25-bed critical access facility located in Sitka,  Alaska, which is in serious need of renovation due to its age and  current condition.   This legislation's conveyance of roughly 10.87 acres of land to the  consortium will facilitate the planned modernization of the hospital by  granting the consortium title to the acreage.   The Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium serves the healthcare  needs of thousands of Alaska Native and American Indian patients in  south-central Alaska. The consortium provides medical services at the  Alaska Native Medical Center in Anchorage, Alaska, and provides  wellness programs, disease research and prevention, rural provider  trainings, as well as water and sanitation systems construction.  [[Page H4489]]    This legislation will grant the consortium ownership over two parcels  of land totaling approximately 3.5 acres, thus allowing the consortium  to streamline its operations and conduct building refurbishments  without reliance on the Federal Government.   My late friend and colleague, Representative Don Young, championed  these three land transfers, now combined into H.R. 441, to promote  health equity among rural Alaska Natives. His work on behalf of Indian  Country never ceased throughout his time in Congress.   I am grateful that we are here today to support this legislation and  these three critical Tribal health entities in Alaska, a reminder of  the support that Indian Country received from Don Young.   I urge my colleagues to support the bill and call for its swift  passage, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I thank Representative Bentz for his  work on these pieces of legislation today and acknowledge his work on  Representative Meng's H.R. 3525, in particular. There were difficult  things to navigate there, and we appreciate the effort on his part.  Hopefully, we were as cooperative.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
