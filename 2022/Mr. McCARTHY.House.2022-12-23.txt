 Mr. Speaker, we are 2 days away from Christmas. The  Christmas season is the season of giving, but in Congress, it appears  the season of giving will line the pockets of Democrats' special  interests and stick hardworking Americans with the tab. That is what  this omnibus does.   As I listen to this debate, Mr. Speaker, I listened to the other  side. My friend says: No, it is the Democrats who have put people  before politics. They are so giving that they are putting the people  before politics.   What does that mean? What is the definition when you are so caring  and you care so deeply about the people that you put them first before  any politics? Well, let's look because that is what they say this  omnibus does for them.   First, guess how many pages. Over 4,000, so pet projects, pork, and  progressive priorities. Guess how much it costs. They say, oh, about  $1.7 trillion. If you really add it all up, and you add the paygo and  the other things that have been done before, we are talking more than  $2 trillion because the people need to borrow more. That is really  looking out for them.   Guess who wrote it. Well, two retiring Senators who face no  accountability from the voters again. Now, they probably really cared  about the people. They cared so much about the people that Senator  Leahy gets numerous projects named after himself because the people  wanted that.   Do you know who requested that? Just one person, so you don't have to  use plural--no people, just Leahy.   Shelby gets something named after him, too.   Speaker Pelosi, she gets a couple of things named after her because  the people are more important than the politics because that is what  the people of America want right now.   Guess when it was made public so the people would know how hard the  Democrats worked for them. Well, it was in the dead of night, at 2  a.m., on Tuesday before Christmas.   The Democrats care so much about the people that they are home with  the people and not here to read the bill or even vote on it.   I am not sure you don't put a medal in here for the people who don't  show up for work because they care so much.   This is a monstrosity that is one of the most shameful acts I have  ever seen in this body. The appropriations process has failed the  American public, and there is no greater example of the nail in the  coffin of the greatest failure of a one-party rule of the House, the  Senate, and the Presidency than this bill here. You controlled it all.   Mr. Speaker, I just heard him brag about how great the Rules  Committee is. They are so great because they care about the people.  They care so much about the people that they never did their work.   The Senate didn't pass one appropriation bill, not one, so that  people could read it or have debate. They passed a continuing  resolution for the people so the government wouldn't shut down.   What date did they pick? Well, let's pick it right before Christmas  so Members won't be here. They won't read the bill. They will vote by  proxy.  [[Page H10069]]    They care so much about the people, they created a system to control  the floor where they have all the votes in their back pocket, so the  people have no say.   The country is tired of it. Mr. Speaker, I know you are busy reading,  but I do know this is true. The country is tired of it.   Do you know why? Because they told you last month. They told you last  month that, no, you don't put people before politics. You have done  nothing but put politics before the people of America.   Do you know what? They fired you. They fired you. They chose a new  direction for our country by electing a House Republican majority for  the 118th Congress.   If you dearly cared about the people, why wouldn't you let everybody  read it? Why wouldn't you let them debate it? Why wouldn't you simply  wait 11 days? Just wait 11 days.   The people have spoken. They don't like that you didn't do your job.  They didn't like that you put yourselves before them. They didn't like  that you wouldn't show up for work.   So, you stuck it to them one more time, but you did it in a manner  that is so big, we have never seen it before. Eleven days.   This current debate isn't just about bad policy. It is a slap in the  face to every American that voted, which raises the question: What  exactly are we voting on?   I will guarantee you, not a single Member that will vote ``yes'' can  tell you everything that is in it because no one has had the time to  read it.   Maybe my good friend on the Rules Committee, Mr. Speaker, might be at  the groundbreaking for Elizabeth Warren's new $3 million swimming pool  in Massachusetts because that is what America needs to borrow money  on right now, because that is putting people before politics.    I don't know if you are going to go to the Leahy center that he  requested that never went before the committee. It never went before  the people. But you know best, Mr. Speaker. You knew that people really  wanted it even if they didn't request it because Leahy requested it,  and he will never have to stand before the people again.   Here are some of the worst parts of the omnibus. First, to state the  obvious, the omnibus spends too much, increasing the deficit and  fueling even more inflation.   Now, the Democrats have been fired. They had 4 years. Let's just look  at recent history. When Republicans had the majority in the House for 8  years, and you look at discretionary spending from the day we got the  gavel to the day we had to hand it back, do you know how much it  increased? Zero.   You had it for 4 years before you got fired again. Do you know how  much it increased, discretionary spending? One-third, over $440  billion.   Do you want to know why we have inflation the highest it has been in  41 years? You won the majority, and you wasted it. You spent too much,  and you harmed the American public.   The worst thing any government could do to its public is bring  inflation, and that is exactly what you are continuing. This bill  increases the baseline spending by $134 billion.   Let me put it another way. The American, hardworking taxpayer--you  just added $1.5 trillion over 10 years to the national debt when we are  already drowning in $31 trillion in debt. I don't remember the people  requesting that, but in your definition, that is what you did.   What kind of projects are such high priorities that you have to  increase spending by so much? Well, some leftwing pet projects. Let's  look, for example, at what the people really requested here. For  example, there is $2.35 million for the Leahy center in Vermont named  after Senator Patrick Leahy.   Who requested it? Well, Patrick Leahy did. Who wrote the bill?  Patrick Leahy.   Meanwhile, Chairwoman DeLauro bragged that the omnibus fulfills 98  percent of the Democrat Members' requests in the House. That is $5.4  billion for 3,213 Democratic projects.   Mr. Speaker, I am not quite sure of your definition of ``people.'' I  guess it is those Members that you are really looking after. That would  be politics.   Our economy is already in dire condition. Passing this omnibus only  supercharges that disaster.   Do you know what? Inflation is higher today than it was 11 months ago  when President Biden said it had peaked. Families are paying $400 more  per month than they did a year ago. Why? Because you put them before  your politics, as you say. They just didn't know that they really  wanted to pay more.   Last month, our deficit was nearly $250 billion, another record you  own, a record for the highest for the month of November. It was fueled  by a 55 percent increase in our interest payments. Why? Because you own  the majority: the House, the Senate, and the Presidency. That is what  you brought the American public.   Meanwhile, personal credit card debt exploded by almost $400 billion  in the third quarter. That is another record you own for the third  quarter.   Inflation is the economy's number one problem. The Federal Reserve  continues to raise the rate. Why? Because you took the majority. It is  raising rates, and you still don't get it.   Democrats want this bill to put more pressure on the working family  because you know better than the working family, apparently.   Americans have had enough. That is why, again, millions voted to fire  the Democrats in this one-party rule.   Mr. Speaker, second, the omnibus spending bill intensifies the crisis  at the southern border. Now, I know, Mr. Speaker, maybe the Rules chair  will say they are putting the people before politics. That is why the  President says there are more important things to do than even visit  the border. He hasn't had much time in his 40 years of elected office  to have a chance to visit the border.   Since taking office and having one-party rule, Democrats' and Biden's  open border policy has caused the worst border crisis in American  history.   You can try to ignore it, but in 11 more days, since you won't show  up for work here, you no longer will have that opportunity. We are  going to take our work to the border. We are going to have our hearings  on the border.   All you will have to do is open your eyes, and you will see what you  created. You will see the disaster that has become of your legacy.   On this administration's watch, record numbers of illegal border  crossings, deadly drugs, and even terror suspects have come into our  country.   I remember almost 2 years ago, on a tour of the border, speaking to  the border agents. You learn a lot if you are willing to do that. They  told me never before had they seen so many people coming across the  border that they catch on the terrorist watch list.   I went to a press conference after and told the American public what  we had learned. I would assume everybody, especially, Mr. Speaker, when  the Rules chair says he cares so much about the people, that they would  be concerned because he knew what has happened when terrorists have  come to America before, that they would want to rally together to  protect America.   No, Mr. Speaker. Congressman Gallego called me a liar. He said he had  as much clearance as I did, Mr. Speaker, that this could not be true.  But, lo and behold, even the DHS came out and said we tried to deny the  facts, but now we know it is a record-setting number.   How many people on the terrorist watch list coming into this country  is too much for you? How many? How many before they act again?   If you don't want to do that, we now have caught enough fentanyl in  the last year to kill every single American. It is in every single one  of your cities. If you listen to the people and stop playing politics,  they will tell you to stop it.   There is enough now to kill 10 times over every single American.                                time  1130    My good friend, Guy Reschenthaler, on the Rules Committee just  recently told you today--well, as many of you sit home and let somebody  cast your vote--300 Americans will be poisoned and die from fentanyl  from your lack of action.   What does this do to stop it?   Nothing.   What does it do to help manage the crisis at the border?   Well, this bill provides more for migrant shelter services and  reduces the  [[Page H10070]]  number of ICE detention beds, these facilities that eventually release  even more migrants across the country.   Meanwhile, this disastrous bill reduces funding for border technology  that would prevent more illegal border crossings in the first place.   This bill funds--and you should brag about this--300 additional  Border Patrol agents. But as you brag about that, there will be 3,000  illegal border crossings in 1 single day, just in El Paso. These border  crossings are over one overpass in El Paso, and in 7 weeks 70,000  people came to that one location.   I know you care about the people and the border because you say so.  It is just not the border of America. Because in this bill that you say  you put people before politics, you put $410 million for border  security in Jordan, Lebanon, Egypt, Tunisia, and Oman. You will fund  walls and technology to protect the Middle East but not to protect  America. What is worse, you brag about it.   When the American public asks you about it, you tell them to shut up,  you know best, you are putting their issues first, but you are too busy  to go to the border to see what is happening. So I want you to look in  the eye of a parent when they come to you and tell you their child just  died from a fentanyl overdose, not because they purchased fentanyl, but  they purchased a Xanax or something else. It is so rampant. It is laced  in everything we see. Sure, try to explain to them how you put them  before politics when you pass this bill.   This omnibus will continue to fully fund the IRS, including the  87,000 new agents, and do nothing to protect you, the family, or your  business from being targeted by the government. But don't fear, Mr.  Speaker, you told the public that you put them before politics.   Remember earlier this year, the Democrats funded 87,000 new IRS  agents and approved $85 billion to spy on Americans spending $600 or  more. So if you go Christmas shopping this year and you spend $600,  don't fear, the Democrats looked after you. They have got an agent  following your every need. But you can trust them. You can trust them.   Just listen to what we recently found on the Twitter files, the  collusion between Big Tech and the FBI and the intel community. Oh, you  can trust the intel community. Remember those 51 individuals, Mr.  Speaker, the Haydens and Brennans. They told the American public: Don't  play politics. All of this stuff is just Russian and false. I want to  tell you that 2 weeks before an election because you can trust me.   Well, now we find the truth. It is clear that instead of focusing on  actual threats to our country and the people, they colluded with the  private companies by the way of personnel and direct payments. Is there  any money in here for the FBI to pay Twitter to go after Americans  because you know best of what they want, you wouldn't want to do that  with politics? Why does the FBI want to go after them?   Because they want to go after free speech because they may be talking  about politics. Those people must not know that they are putting people  before politics too. They are taking care of those people--shut them  down. Not only is it wrong, it is illegal.   It is time Congress conducts real oversight and accountability in 11  days. I promise you this, House Republicans will begin that on the very  first day.   This bill will give the Biden administration a free pass. This bill  provides the FBI with $375 million for a new headquarters and over $11  billion in funding. I guess this Congress of Democrat majority right  now doesn't care if the FBI spied on you, if the FBI went after you  simply because you wanted free speech. I guess they believe in that.   I guess that is what you mean by putting people before politics.  Don't listen to the people because if they talk about something other  than your politics of what you agree, you should shut them down. Fund  something that does that.   Oh, probably the most sacred of all the Democrats' power, before they  were fired, was the wokeism. Buried in the omnibus is even more money  for wokeism in the government and the military.   The woke left wants to further divide Americans against each other  based upon race, sex, and background. They want to teach our kids that  America is inherently bad and that you should distrust and hate your  fellow Americans instead of striving to be a more perfect Union.   We look to the threats around the world, the rise of China, the  threats from Africa to Asia. You brag about what you did for the  Pentagon.   Where did you put the money?   Well, $8.6 million for gender advisor programs at the Pentagon. That  is going to strengthen our ability to protect America. There is $200  million for the Gender Equity Fund. But you want to make sure it works  everywhere--gender programs in Pakistan. I am not sure how many  Americans requested that. But then again, you were looking out for the  people.   There is $575 million for family planning in areas where population  growth threatens biodiversity; $4 million for shared equity housing  models. These type of woke handouts should not be funded by taxpayers.  They go against everything we stand for as Americans. Most Americans  share Dr. Martin Luther King's belief that the content of character  matters more than the color of your skin.   For all the reasons I have laid out, at the very end this will cost  you more than $2 trillion more than  4,000 pages is a train wreck. It  is jam-packed with wokeism, Washington special interests, and wasteful  spending that means more crushing debt to 330 million Americans and  generations to come.    This bill will make the border worse. It will make inflation worse.  It will make the economy worse. It will make government worse.   The American people are probably asking themselves: How did we get  into this mess?   I will tell you how. Democrats failed to do their job.   Mr. Speaker, if someone wants to challenge me on that then why did  the America public fire you just a few months ago?   Why did you wait to pass this bill, if it was so great, until after  the election?   Why did you allow two Senators to write it that can't be held  accountable, and then name things after themselves?   Why did you pass the CR to push it against Christmas with the storm  before our very eyes?   Why are the majority of Democrats not even here if you think it is so  good?   This is your legacy. I feel sad for you, but more importantly, for  the damage that you have done to America. During the last year  Democrats controlled the House, the Senate, and the Presidency, and  they have yet to fulfill their most basic tasks.   Senate Democrats passed zero appropriations bills out of their  committee. They passed zero appropriations bills off the floor. Mr.  Speaker, they didn't do a damn thing. They went 0-12.   Instead of following the law and funding the government by September  30, they did what they do best: They created a crisis and then didn't  even let it go to waste.   We all remember what Speaker Pelosi told us about ObamaCare: You have  to pass it to find out what is in it. This is exactly the same. They  waited until the last minute in a lameduck Congress with 4,000 pages,  $2 trillion, and put it into the laps of the American public.   Did we have time to read the bill? No.   Did we have time to debate the bill? No.   Did we mark up the bill? No.   Are there Members of Congress here to vote on it? Nope.   It is all right. We got your votes in the back pocket. I don't know  where the American people asked for that.   In 11 days this all changes. We are going to reclaim this body's  integrity and service to the American people after this institution  covers itself in disgrace one last time under the Democrat one-party  rule.   Mr. Speaker, a new direction is coming. In 11 days, Republicans will  deliver. I request a ``no'' vote on the omnibus.
