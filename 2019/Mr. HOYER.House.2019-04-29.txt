 Mr. Speaker, the shooting that targeted the Jewish  community in the San Diego area this weekend was a heartbreaking  reminder of the new challenges facing our country and the world in the  21st century.   In centuries past, purveyors of anti-Semitism, xenophobia,  Islamophobia, racism, and other vile forms of hatred employed the  ancient tools of whisper and rumor and incitement in the village  squares to intoxicate mobs with fear, and fuel violence against those  of a different race, a different religion, a different origin, and a  different color.   Today, the internet and social media have provided haters with modern  tools to do the same incitement. We have seen it in Pittsburgh and in  San Diego. We have seen it in Charlottesville; in Christchurch, New  Zealand; and in Sri Lanka. We have seen it in the viral images online  using anti-Semitic tropes, or painting Muslims as terrorists, or  vilifying migrant families.   As a nation, we need to take action to counter these new forms of  incitement. We are observing a lesson in how hatred has adapted to the  21st century.   What we learn from that lesson and how we adapt to combat new tools  of hatred will determine whether our democracy and commitment to  tolerance and pluralism will survive this century.   Mr. Speaker, I pray for the victims of this weekend's shooting, and I  say to them and all the others who have been targeted by hate in our  day: this House stands against hate and will continue to do its part to  promote the vision of our Founders, of a nation where all are created  equal, and endowed not by the government or the Constitution, but by  their creator with certain unalienable rights, and among these are:  life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.   Let us all stand for tolerance, for inclusion, and reject hate. One  nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.                            ____________________
