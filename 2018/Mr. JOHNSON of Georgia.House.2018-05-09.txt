 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for  yielding me time.   Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge that this body oppose H.R. 2152, which  is a classic piece of legislation which poses itself as a solution, but  it is in search of a problem. The solution has very ominous  consequences for minorities and poor people, and infringes on the  constitutional rights of citizens, that they should be presumed to be  innocent until proven guilty when they participate in these pretrial  release services.   When I was a magistrate court judge in DeKalb County, Georgia, over a  period of 12 years, starting in 1989 to a time about 5 years before I  came to Congress, it was my duty to commit people to pretrial services.   Everybody knows how it works, everybody knows who is eligible, and  everybody knows that it is a roaring success. There are no problems  with pretrial services, which help poor people and basically  minorities, who tend to be disproportionately caught up in the criminal  justice system.   It helps people who can't afford to make a money bail to be able to  get out of jail with some minimal supervision as they await disposition  of the charges against them.   It is a simple program administered by State and local authorities  around the country. It works. There is no question about it. There is  no need for any Federal supervision or oversight of these programs.   What H.R. 2152 would do would be to require local governments who  receive DOJ funding for pretrial services to send a report to the DOJ,  the Jeff Sessions DOJ, detailing the personally identifiable  information on those defendants participating in alternative bail/ pretrial release programs, which are typically utilized by those who  can't afford money bail.   Sending this information to the DOJ will create a permanent record of  the defendants who are awaiting trial, and that data will remain in a  Federal database, even if the charges against the accused are dropped  or the accused is found innocent.   Pretrial service programs are critical in protecting those who are  unable to post bond during their pretrial stages, and this legislation  would disproportionately impact minorities and poor people.   The presumption of innocence is one of the most sacred elements of  our criminal justice system and a pillar of many modern-day criminal  justice operations in modern society throughout the world.   H.R. 2152 threatens this right to a presumption of innocence.  Pretrial service programs are critical, and poor people and minorities  should not be penalized by being permanently marked in a Federal  database, and for that reason I ask my colleagues to not approve this  solution in desperate search for a problem with ominous implications  for poor and minority people.    Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend Buddy Carter  for yielding to me.   For the record, I want it to be known that it was he who called me  yesterday to find out what color suit and tie I was going to wear.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to a great Georgian and a  great American, former Georgia Governor and U.S. Senator Zell Miller,  who died at the age of 86 in March.   He was a north Georgia mountain boy of humble beginnings, who was  raised by a single parent after his daddy died when he was just 2 weeks  old. He was raised in a house that his momma built with her own hands.   Former Presidents, Governors, and dignitaries from all over the  country and the world have honored Mr. Miller, who launched the State's  HOPE Scholarship and led Georgia into the 21st century.   He was a true statesman, who served Georgia and his country as,  first, a United States Marine, then as mayor of Young Harris, later  serving as a State senator, thereafter as Lieutenant Governor, and then  as Governor, and finally as United States Senator.   Zell Miller dedicated his life to public service. He was a man  physically compact and a bit short, but he walked tall and he walked  strong, and he left a towering legacy.   A small town mountain boy from the little town of Young Harris, Zell  Miller made a big impact on the affairs of Georgia and, indeed, the  affairs of the Nation.   Zell Miller left a huge impact on Georgia's judicial system. He  literally changed the face of the State bench.   I include in the Record an article I found of particular interest  from the Fulton County Daily Report, dated March 23, 2018, by managing  editor Jonathan Ringel. The article is entitled, ``The Late Zell Miller  Diversified the Bench.''                 The Late Zell Miller Diversified the Bench                    (By Jonathan Ringel, March 23, 2018)         The news today that former Georgia governor and U.S.       senator Zell Miller has died at age 86 prompts us to look       back on the mark he left on Georgia's legal system--that of       being the first governor to appoint a large number of       minorities and women to judgeships.        As a staff reporter here, I wrote the following article,       which was published Dec. 28, 1998, a few days before the end       of his eight-year tenure as governor.               The Zell Miller Legacy: Diversity on the Bench         When he leaves office next month, Gov. Zell Miller will       have appointed 37 percent of Georgia's 287 trial and       appellate court judges. Those numbers include four of the 10       judges now on the state Court of Appeals and five of the       seven state Supreme Court justices.        Moreover, Miller changed the face of the state's bench,       carrying out his pledge to concentrate on diversity.        Twenty-five of Miller's appointments have been black.       Forty-two have been women. Eleven have been both, meaning he       has added 56 black and female judges to the bench in eight       years.        According to Miller's office, Gov. Joe Frank Harris made 76       judicial appointments in his eight years before Miller. They       included 10 black and 11 women, totaling 18 black and female       judges.        Even before hearing those numbers, attorneys and court       watchers say diversifying the bench will be Miller's legacy       to the law of Georgia.        ``That's a major impact,'' says former Attorney General       Michael J. Bowers of the judicial statistics.        Criminal-defense lawyer John R. Martin, a harsh critic of       Miller when it comes to mandatory minimum sentencing laws,       calls Miller's diversifying the bench ``remarkable.``        ``That is amazing,'' says Paula J. Frederick, immediate       past president of the Georgia Association of Black Women       Attorneys.        Miller looks at his role in diversifying the bench as       ironic.        Appointing judges, he says, was ``the one aspect of being       governor I had never thought about'' throughout 16 years of       being lieutenant governor.        He says he had lots of plans on taking office--such as       starting the lottery-funded  [[Page H3879]]       HOPE scholarship, but being a nonlawyer, ``I had not thought       about the judiciary.''        That changed when he took office in 1991, because, along       with the keys to the Governor's Mansion, Miller inherited a       tricky piece of litigation.        In 1988, state Rep. Tyrone Brooks, D-Atlanta, the American       Civil Liberties Union and other plaintiffs had filed a voting       rights suit against the state. They attacked the picking of       judges in circuitwide at-large elections, claiming the system       was discriminatory because blacks typically were outvoted by       the white majority and that most judges were therefore white.       Brooks v. State Board of Elections, No. CV288-146 (S.D. Ga.,       filed July 13, 1988).        They also alleged that, since 1964, the state should have       been submitting laws creating new judgeships for review by       the U.S. Justice Department, under the federal Voting Rights       Act.        On the review issue, a special three-judge panel of the       U.S. District Court in Savannah agreed with the Brooks       plaintiffs. So when Miller took office, the Justice       Department was holding in limbo 48 established judgeships and       other judgeships created since the litigation began.        ``There was a cloud hanging over the judiciary,'' recalls       Troutman Sanders partner Norman L. Underwood, a former Court       of Appeals judge.        Miller asked Underwood to head the Judicial Nominating       Commission, which since the days of Gov. Jimmy Carter had       screened judicial applicants and recommended shortlists to       the governor.        Miller reconstituted the commission, saying he wanted to       open up the process for minorities and women. He eliminated       four of the five guaranteed slots for representatives of the       bar, leaving only the one for the current bar president as an       ex-officio member.        Miller allowed the speaker of the House and the lieutenant       governor to pick one nonlawyer each for the commission, and       he added the attorney general.        The rest of the picks--three lawyers and two nonlawyers--      remained Miller's.        According to Miller's 1991 executive order, the commission       must always include one woman and one member who is Black,       Hispanic, Asian-Pacific American, Native American or Asian-      Indian American (Daily Report, Feb 13, 1991).        ``The loss of the bar seats was a bit of a       disappointment,'' says Albany litigator William E. Cannon       Jr., the current bar president, who disagrees with Brooks'       argument at the time that the bar's majority control of the       commission perpetuated a ``good of boy network.``        Underwood says there might have been a perception the prior       commissions were not focused on diversity.        That said, the first commission, including three black       members and one woman, went about its work.        Later that year, two seats opened up on DeKalb Superior       Court, which had no black members.        Faced with mixed race and gender shortlists sent by the       commission, Miller chose Michael E. Hancock, then chief Judge       in DeKalb Recorder's Court, and DeKalb State Court Judge       Linda Warren Hunter, who were both African-American.        Considering that more than 40 percent of DeKalb County is       black but the Superior Court had no black judges, Underwood       says, ``I think the governor just sensed that's       unacceptable.''        Miller won't discuss any specific decisions. But he says       his first appointments of minorities and women encouraged       more of each group to apply.        Other factors were at work, as well.        Frederick, a deputy counsel to the state bar who made a       shortlist for a state court position, notes that women and       minorities have graduated from law school in much greater       numbers over the years, adding to the available pool for       Miller.        In addition, the Brooks case loomed over Miller's picks       throughout most of his administration.        In June 1992, after six weeks of negotiations prompted by       U.S. District Court Judge Anthony A. Alaimo, Miller and       Brooks hammered out a historic settlement. (Daily Report,       June 19, 1992)        To end the case, Miller agreed to appoint 30 black judges       and adopt the so-called ``Missouri plan of judicial       selection, in which judges are appointed and then undergo       periodic retention elections.        But in March 1994, U.S. District Court Judge B. Avant       Edenfield of Savannah refused to approve the settlement,       ruling that Attorney General Mike Bowers lacked the authority       to make such sweeping changes to the state's judicial       election system and that the requirement to appoint black       judges would violate the equal protection clause of the U.S.       Constitution. (Daily Report, March 9, 1994)        Brooks appealed unsuccessfully for three years, finally       dismissing the case last year. (Daily Report, June 23, 1997)        Robert J. Proctor, who has brought numerous legal       challenges to affirmative action policies around the state       and opposed the Brooks settlement, says, ``I think Gov.       Miller implemented the settlement anyway.''        Miller came close, appointing 25 black judges. While about       28 percent of Georgia is black, 20 percent of Miller's       appointees were black and 33 percent of his appointees have       been female.        Brooks says, ``I think there's greater trust in the       judicial system now.''        Clayton County District Attorney Robert E. Keller says,       ``The bench must represent a cross-section of society,'' and       credits Miller for his appointments.        But Proctor, a past chairman of the conservative       Southeastern Legal Foundation, says judges should not be       picked on the basis of race or gender.        ``That whole concept is just abhorrent to me,'' Proctor       says.        He adds that Miller's picks do not represent the       proportions of the number of black or female lawyers in the       state.        The state bar keeps records only on gender, says       spokeswoman Jennifer Davis. She says 28 percent of the 29,523       members of the Georgia bar are women.        Miller responds, ``I don't think I've done anything in my       eight years as governor that pleased Bob Proctor.'' (Not       true, says Proctor, who calls Miller's second term       ``taxpayer-friendly.'')        Miller adds, ``You don't choose anybody because they're a       female or a minority,'' noting that there were many times       lawyers who were considered front-runners for posts because       they were women or minorities did not get the job.        Besides, he adds, ``I only got very qualified individuals       on the shortlists.''        Underwood recalls an opening in a circuit that stretched 90       miles from one end to the other. Miller picked a lawyer who       lived in the part of the circuit where there wasn't a judge,       and Underwood speculates, ``In that case, the factor on the       governor's mind was geography.''        Fulton Superior Court Judge Cynthia D. Wright was Miller's       executive counsel for his first term.        She says, ``When you appoint a judge, you have to factor in       a whole lot of subjective qualities.''        ``It is not an objective process.''     Zell Miller was the first Governor to appoint  a significant number of minorities and women to the Georgia bench. Zell  Miller should be remembered for actually desegregating Georgia's  courts. As the Daily Report article outlines, by the time Zell Miller  left the Governorship in December of 1998, he had appointed 37 percent  of Georgia's 287 trial and appellate court judges. Those numbers  include 4 of the 10 judges on the State court of appeals, and 5 of the  7 State supreme court justices.   Zell Miller appointed an African American female as the first African  American to ever serve on the Georgia Supreme Court. Twenty-five of  Governor Miller's appointments were African Americans; 42 of his  judicial appointments were women; 11 were African American women,  meaning he added 56 Black and female judges to the bench in his 8  years. It is a fact that Zell Miller appointed more African Americans  to judgeships in Georgia than all previous Georgia Governors combined.   In addition, Governor Zell Miller appointed an African American to  serve as Georgia's Attorney General, making that African American the  first African American State attorney general in the Nation. It is a  remarkable record for any Governor, let alone one from the Deep South.   One of the first counties where he began to diversify the bench is my  home circuit, the Stone Mountain Judicial Circuit. As Governor, Zell  Miller appointed as State labor commissioner the first African American  to ever hold a nonjudicial constitutional office in Georgia, and Zell  Miller appointed more African Americans to more State boards than any  other Georgia Governor.   As executive secretary for Governor Lester Maddox from 1968 to 1971,  Zell Miller was credited with exerting a moderating influence on  Governor Maddox, a segregationist, and spurring him to appoint Blacks  to his administration, which he did.   As Governor, Zell Miller led an unsuccessful effort back in 1993 to  remove the Confederate battle emblem from the State flag, and he pushed  legislation providing more money for public schools and scholarships  for high school students. In fact, Governor Miller raised teacher pay  in Georgia by 6 percent for 4 successive years--4 successive years, 6  percent each year. By the time he stepped down after his second term of  Governor, Zell Miller was one of the most popular politicians in  Georgia's history, leaving office with an astounding 85 percent  approval rating.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Georgia's First Congressional  District, my friend, Buddy Carter, for inviting me here this evening to  provide a few remarks about the passing of this Georgia lion, Zell  Miller, who did a lot of good for our State and for our people, and I  truly appreciate him for that.
