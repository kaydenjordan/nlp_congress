 Mr. Speaker, I rise to congratulate the Alleghany Lady  Trojans softball team on winning North Carolina's A1 State  championship.   These young women deserve the championship for their hard work and  talent, but they are also champions of humility, giving gratitude to  God, their parents, coaches, and the community fan base that supported  them throughout their season.   Alleghany has a unique softball history, last winning State in 1996  as three-peat champions. Six of this year's team are related to past  champions, which shows the passion and drive passed down from  generation to generation.   Even Coach Weaver is a former State MVP, striving to instill in her  team the determination and confidence that she developed as a high  school athlete.   Congratulations to the Lady Trojans and the community that shares in  this  [[Page H5635]]  victory. It is an honor and a blessing to represent such a great  community.                            ____________________
