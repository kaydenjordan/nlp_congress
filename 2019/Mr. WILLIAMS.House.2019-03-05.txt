 Madam Speaker, I would like to take this time to honor  the life and legacy of my good friend, Jack Barcroft's wife, Faith  Christine Barcroft.   Mrs. Barcroft resided in Gatesville, in the 25th District of Texas  that I represent. At the young age of 39, she passed away on February  20, 2019, from glioblastoma.   Glioblastoma is a very aggressive cancer that can occur in the brain  or spinal cord. It is the most common type of brain cancer, and almost  200,000 people die of it each year. Madam Speaker, this number is far  too high, and it breaks my heart that my dear friend fell victim to it.   Before and after her diagnosis, Faith was a loving wife, mother, and  daughter. She was often described as adventurous, welcoming, and she  always put her family's well-being above her own. This family has  experienced an immeasurable loss, and the entire Gatesville community  and I are praying for them.   While we cannot bring Faith back, we can continue to raise awareness  for glioblastoma and the pain it causes families like the Barcrofts.  Unfortunately, there is no known way to prevent this type of cancer,  but we must not give up. We must bring attention to this unforgiving  diagnosis and pray that one day, research will uncover a cure.   Please keep this loving family in your prayers.   May God bless the Barcrofts.   In God we trust.                            ____________________
