 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I believe my amendment speaks for itself.   My friends on the other side of the aisle are playing political games  with their bill trying to convince the American people that it would  accomplish something that it would not. I have offered a title that  accurately reflects the political grandstanding that my Democrat  friends are effecting today.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield to the gentleman from Oregon (Mr.  Walden).    Madam Chair, this bill before us today makes no  structural changes to improve access to or delivery of care. It would  limit healthcare choices and stifle State level innovation that has  proven to lower premiums. This bill does not help those with  preexisting conditions, but it does attempt to confuse them and  encourage more political dysfunction to the detriment of the American  people.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
