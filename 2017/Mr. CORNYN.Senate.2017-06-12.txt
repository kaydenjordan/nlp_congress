 Madam President, before he leaves the floor, I want to  say to my friend, the Democratic leader, among his other attributes, he  now claims omniscience. He knows everything--even about things that  haven't even been written yet, and I, for one, appreciate as a  Republican his concern about the Republican Party.   I would challenge his memory because I was here in 2010, when 60  Democrats in the Senate jammed through ObamaCare, a bill that we  frankly need to save the American people from as it begins to melt  down.   As the distinguished Presiding Officer from Iowa knows, there is not  a single carrier in Iowa that is willing to sell ObamaCare insurance on  the exchanges because they are simply bleeding money.    I will yield for a question.    Madam President, I would say to my friend from New York  that he is omniscient if he claims to know the content of a bill that  has not yet been voted on or agreed upon by Republicans in the Senate.  I would just put that in the same category as his other advice to folks  on this side of the aisle and again challenge his memory to how we got  here in the first place.   I was here on Christmas Eve when we voted. I ended up voting against,  but Democrats voted to jam ObamaCare through this body and on a  strictly party-line vote. The fact is, ObamaCare is failing millions of  people because if they have access to coverage at all, many of them  have seen their premiums go up an average of 105 percent since 2013.  That is the average in the 30-plus States that carry ObamaCare  insurance on the healthcare exchanges--a 105-percent increase. Many of  them have also seen their deductibles get so big that they cannot even  really use the insurance they have because basically they are  effectively self-insured.    So I take with a grain of salt the comments from my friend from New  York that somehow we are doing something that is so horrible when we  are trying to rescue the American people and clean up the mess our  Democratic friends created when they jammed ObamaCare through on a  party-line vote. If they were serious about it, what they would do is  accept our invitation to work with us to improve healthcare for all  Americans. It would be much better if we could do this on a bipartisan  basis. It would certainly be more durable and be sustained for much  longer than things done strictly on party-line votes. Yet, in the  absence of any real help from our Democratic friends, who just seem to  be standing idly by and not lifting a finger to help the people being  hurt by ObamaCare today, we are going to have to do the best we can  with the hand we have been dealt on behalf of the people whom we  represent.   Madam President, on another matter, as a global leader of state- sponsored terrorism, Iran continues to threaten the very existence of  the nation of Israel and destabilize the Middle East by creating a  breeding ground for violence and hatred.   For the past several years, the United States and our allies have  attempted to contain Iran, often to no avail. For one, President  Obama's lopsided nuclear deal left a zero imprint on Iran's terrorist  activities. So last week the senior Senator from Tennessee, the  chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, introduced  legislation to apply impactful and powerful sanctions on the nation of  Iran. This bill will give the President the ability to block any trade  that could benefit Iran's ballistic missile programs or support its  military buildup.   I plan to introduce a bipartisan amendment to this bill that would  target Mahan Air. This is Iran's largest commercial airline that  doubles as the preferred mode of transportation for terrorists and  their weapons. That is right. It is a civilian airline, but it is  actually used to facilitate terrorism and to transport weapons. Mahan  Air not only supports the efforts of the Quds Force, which is a special  unit of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard  [[Page S3384]]  Corps, but it supports Hezbollah as well. This terrorist airline is a  conduit for personnel, weapons, and a violent ideology throughout the  region.   Unfortunately, despite its proven transgressions, Mahan Air continues  to expand international operations by adding more international  airports to its flight patterns, including several in Europe. This is  an obvious threat to the safety and security of the people where these  planes are allowed to land. Not only are the goods they transport a  cause for concern, but their very presence is a security risk to  Americans who fly in and out of airports at which a Mahan aircraft may  land.   Through all of this, of course, Iran continues to support their  terrorist activities, indeed carrying on under the guise of commercial  civilian aircraft flights.   My amendment would require the Department of Homeland Security to  compile and make public a list of airports at which Mahan Air has  recently landed and then require the Department of Homeland Security to  assess what security measures should be added.   We have a duty to protect American citizens, and I am thankful that  Chairman Corker will bring this legislation to the floor. The fight  against terrorism is multifaceted, and it is not easy, but we can start  by targeting state sponsors of terrorism like Iran with economic  sanctions while we strengthen our military and continue the great  tradition of American leadership around the world.                            Healthcare Legislation    Finally, Madam President, let me return to where I began--to the  issue of ObamaCare.   There is a lot of work to be done here at home as well. I know it is  easy for us to get mired in the ``how,'' but it is also important for  us to remember why we are repealing ObamaCare and why we are replacing  it with something far better for American families.   I want to continue to highlight one of the many stories I am hearing  from my constituents. I wonder whether the Senator from New York is  hearing some of these same stories from his constituents.   This gentleman is a small business owner in the Fort Worth area who  told me that since ObamaCare was implemented, this small business owner  has been forced to change his insurance every year. Can you imagine  going through that headache and hassle when President Obama said: If  you like your health coverage, you can keep it. He was also the one who  said: If you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor. He also  promised that premiums would go down an average of $2,500 for a family  of four--none of which has proved to be true. In this particular  gentleman's case, as is the case for many Americans, his rates have  gone through the roof, rising from roughly $350 a month to $800 a  month. Despite the higher cost, he now receives less coverage because  his out-of-pocket maximum has risen from $3,500 to $14,000. That is  simply outrageous. Throughout the entire process, he has been fighting  a losing battle.   As is the case with many States, including Iowa, provider after  provider has pulled out of my State as well, as they are unable to  afford ObamaCare at all.   This small business owner is not only forced to literally find new  insurance every year, but he has to change providers each year and has  fewer options available. Along the way--this is the other promise  President Obama made that has been broken--this gentleman has lost  access to his doctor of 20 years. He refers to the hope he had when  President Obama looked into the camera and said: Now listen to me. You  can keep your insurance, and you can keep your doctor, and you will pay  less. That is what President Obama said when he was selling ObamaCare.  Instead, this gentleman, this small business owner from Fort Worth, did  not get to keep his insurance. He lost his doctor of 20 years, and he  now pays nearly three times more for less coverage and higher  deductibles.   He closed his letter to me with a question. He asked: Can I count on  you?   I look around the Chamber, and I ask all of us: Can the American  people count on us?   I know they can because it is our responsibility to provide something  far better than what they have had under ObamaCare. They can count on  us if we work together to find solutions that actually provide the  high-quality healthcare American families deserve at prices they can  afford. In many instances, this means getting government out of the way  and allowing the marketplace to lower costs and increase quality, which  is what markets do much better than government regulation.   Right now, every Senator on this side of the aisle is discussing with  our colleagues how best to accomplish that, and we are also discussing  this with the people whom we represent--the physicians, the healthcare  providers, and others--to try to determine the best way forward. I hope  our Democratic colleagues will join us rather than give us lectures  from the Senate floor about the way we are conducting our business,  particularly when their hands are unclean, to say the least, when it  comes to the way they jammed ObamaCare down the throats of the American  people to such bad effect. I would encourage them, rather than to just  obstruct, to actually work with us in a bipartisan fashion. We would  come up with a better product, a more durable product, if our  Democratic friends would work with us rather than just sit on their  hands or actively obstruct our efforts to get the job done.   I urge our colleagues from both sides to work together to find a  solution that repeals what is broken in ObamaCare and replace it with  patient-centered, accessible, and affordable healthcare. I hope that  eventually others will come around to join us if for no other reason  than their constituents are hurting from the status quo.   Madam President, I yield the floor.    The following Senators are necessarily absent: the  Senator from North Carolina (Mr. Burr), the Senator from Georgia (Mr.  Perdue), and the Senator from Idaho (Mr. Risch).    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                  S. 1338         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Dust Off Crews of the       Vietnam War Congressional Gold Medal Act''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         The Congress finds that--        (1) a United States Army Dust Off crewman (pilot, crew       chief, and medic) is a helicopter crew member who served       honorably in the Vietnam War aboard a helicopter air       ambulance under the radio call sign ``Dust Off'';        (2) Dust Off crews performed aeromedical evacuation for       United States, Vietnamese, and allied forces inside South       Vietnam from May 1962 through March 1973.        (3) nearing the end of World War II, the United States Army       began using helicopters for medical evacuation and years       later, during the Korean War, these helicopter air ambulances       were responsible for transporting 17,700 United States       casualties;        (4) during the Vietnam War, with the use of helicopter air       ambulances, United States Army Dust Off crews pioneered the       concept of dedicated and rapid medical evacuation and rescued       almost 900,000 United States, South Vietnamese, and other       allied sick and wounded, as well as wounded enemy forces;        (5) helicopters proved to be a revolutionary tool to assist       those injured on the battlefield;        (6) highly skilled and intrepid, Dust Off crews were able       to operate the helicopters and land them on almost any       terrain in nearly any weather to pick up wounded, after which       the Dust Off crews could provide care to these patients while       transporting them to ready medical facilities;        (7) the vital work of the Dust Off crews required       consistent combat exposure and often proved to be the       difference between life and death for wounded personnel;        (8) the revolutionary concept of a dedicated combat life-      saving system was cultivated and refined by United States       Army Dust Off crews during 11 years of intense conflict in       and above the jungles of South Vietnam;        (9) innovative and resourceful Dust Off crews in Vietnam       were responsible for taking the new concept of helicopter       medical evacuation, born just a few years earlier, and       revolutionizing it to meet and surpass the previously       unattainable goal of delivering a battlefield casualty to an       operating table within the vaunted ``golden hour'';        (10) some Dust Off units in Vietnam operated so efficiently       that they were able to deliver a patient to a waiting medical       facility on an average of 33 minutes from the receipt of the       mission, which saved the lives of countless personnel in       Vietnam, and this legacy continues for modern-day Dust Off       crews;  [[Page S3398]]         (11) the inherent danger of being a member of a Dust Off       crew in Vietnam meant that there was a 1 in 3 chance of being       wounded or killed;        (12) many battles during the Vietnam War raged at night,       and members of the Dust Off crews often found themselves       searching for a landing zone in complete darkness, in bad       weather, over mountainous terrain, and all while being the       target of intense enemy fire as they attempted to rescue the       wounded, which caused Dust Off crews to suffer a rate of       aircraft loss that was more than 3 times that of all other       types of combat helicopter missions in Vietnam;        (13) the 54th Medical Detachment typified the constant       heroism displayed by Dust Off crews in Vietnam, over the span       of a 10-month tour, with only 3 flyable helicopters and 40       soldiers in the unit, evacuating 21,435 patients in 8,644       missions while being airborne for 4,832 hours;        (14) collectively, the members of the 54th Medical       Detachment earned 78 awards for valor, including 1 Medal of       Honor, 1 Distinguished Service Cross, 14 Silver Star Medals,       26 Distinguished Flying Crosses, 2 Bronze Star Medals for       valor, 4 Air Medals for valor, 4 Soldier's Medals, and 26       Purple Heart Medals;        (15) the 54th Medical Detachment displayed heroism on a       daily basis and set the standard for all Dust Off crews in       Vietnam;        (16) 5 members of the 54th Medical Detachment are in the       Dust Off Hall of Fame, 3 are in the Army Aviation Hall of       Fame, and 1 is the only United States Army aviator in the       National Aviation Hall of Fame;        (17) Dust Off crew members are among the most highly       decorated soldiers in American military history;        (18) in early 1964, Major Charles L. Kelly was the       Commanding Officer of the 57th Medical Detachment (Helicopter       Ambulance), Provisional, in Soc Trang, South Vietnam;        (19) Major Kelly helped to forge the Dust Off call-sign       into history as one of the most welcomed phrases to be heard       over the radio by wounded soldiers in perilous and dire       situations;        (20) in 1964, Major Kelly was killed in action as he       gallantly maneuvered his aircraft to save a wounded American       soldier and several Vietnamese soldiers and boldly replied,       after being warned to stay away from the landing zone due to       the ferocity of enemy fire, ``When I have your wounded.'';        (21) General William Westmoreland, Commander, Military       Assistance Command, Vietnam (1964-1968), singled out Major       Kelly as an example of ``the greatness of the human spirit''       and highlighted his famous reply as an inspiration to all in       combat;        (22) General Creighton Abrams, Westmoreland's successor       (1968-1972), and former Chief of Staff of the United States       Army, highlighted the heroism of Dust Off crews, ``A special       word about the Dust Offs . . . Courage above and beyond the       call of duty was sort of routine to them. It was a daily       thing, part of the way they lived. That's the great part, and       it meant so much to every last man who served there. Whether       he ever got hurt or not, he knew Dust Off was there.'';        (23) Dust Off crews possessed unique skills and traits that       made them highly successful in aeromedical evacuation in       Vietnam, including indomitable courage, extraordinary       aviation skill and sound judgment under fire, high-level       medical expertise, and an unequaled dedication to the       preservation of human life;        (24) members of the United States Armed Forces on the       ground in Vietnam had their confidence and battlefield       prowess reinforced knowing that there were heroic Dust Off       crews just a few minutes from the fight, which was       instrumental to their well-being, willingness to fight, and       morale;        (25) military families in the United States knew that their       loved ones would receive the quickest and best possible care       in the event of a war-time injury, thanks to the Dust Off       crews;        (26) the willingness of Dust Off crews to also risk their       lives to save helpless civilians left an immeasurably       positive impression on the people of Vietnam and exemplified       the finest American ideals of compassion and humanity; and        (27) Dust Off crews from the Vietnam War hailed from every       State in the United States and represented numerous ethnic,       religious, and cultural backgrounds.

(2) Sense of congress.--It is the sense of Congress that       the Smithsonian Institution should also make the gold medal       awarded pursuant to this Act available for display elsewhere,       particularly at appropriate locations associated with the       Vietnam War, and that preference should be given to locations       affiliated with the Smithsonian Institution.       SEC. 4. DUPLICATE MEDALS.         The Secretary may strike and sell duplicates in bronze of       the gold medal struck pursuant to section 3 under such       regulations as the Secretary may prescribe, at a price       sufficient to cover the cost thereof, including labor,       materials, dies, use of machinery, and overhead expenses, and       the cost of the gold medal.       SEC. 5. NATIONAL MEDALS.         The medal struck pursuant to this Act is a national medal       for purposes of chapter 51 of title 31, United States Code.                                  ______                                         By Mr. DURBIN (for himself, Mr. Brown, Mrs. Gillibrand, Mr. Reed,          Mr. Blumenthal, Mr. Markey, and Mr. Franken):   S. 1341.
