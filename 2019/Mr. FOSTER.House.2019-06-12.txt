 Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Chair, this bipartisan amendment, offered by myself  and the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Kelly), would strike section  510, which bans HHS from adopting standards for a unique patient  identifier that would allow patients to be uniquely identified across  electronic health record systems.   In the last 21 years that this misguided policy has been in place,  thousands of Americans have died due to giving the wrong drug to the  wrong patient or due to incorrect or incomplete electronic medical  records, all arising from the inability to simply and correctly merge  health records from different systems.   Countless man-hours have been lost trying to figure out whether one  patient's information is the same as another whose name might be  spelled differently, or who has recently moved to a new city or State,  or who might be under a maiden name, for example.   Matching records properly requires a unique identifier for each  patient. A Federal ban on doing this properly makes our healthcare  system more expensive and less safe for patients.   According to a 2016 study of healthcare executives, 86 percent of  respondents have witnessed or knew of a medical error that was the  result of patient misidentification.   A Johns Hopkins study recently calculated that more than 250,000  deaths per year are due to preventable medical errors. While our data  collection on medical errors is not as detailed as it should be, it is  reasonable to assume that a unique patient identifier would help save a  nontrivial fraction of these lives.   Amidst the wave of digitization of the healthcare industry, most  providers have adopted electronic health records, spurred on by the  2009 HITECH Act. But if we cannot ensure that we have the right patient  with their full information at the point of care, then we cannot  properly utilize the enormous promise of the portability and  interoperability of health records.   This ban is also handcuffing us in the fight against opioids. A 2018  roundtable on the opioid crisis cohosted by HHS and the nonprofit  Center for Open Data Enterprise recommended the generation of a unique  identifier for each patient. This would not only guard against doctor  shopping by those struggling with substance abuse disorder, but it  could also prevent those in recovery from accidentally being given  prescription opioids after an injury, surgery, or childbirth,  triggering a relapse.   Repealing this ban tackles a known problem in our healthcare system,  and I urge support for this bipartisan amendment.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Connecticut (Ms. DeLauro), the chairwoman of the Appropriations Labor,  HHS, Education, and Related Agencies Subcommittee.    Madam Chair, I yield myself the balance of my time.   I would like to again thank my colleague from Pennsylvania (Mr.  Kelly), for cosponsoring this bipartisan amendment so that we can move  our healthcare system into the 21st century to save money and, most  importantly, to save lives.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Chair, I would like to thank Congressman   Andy Kim  for cosponsoring this amendment.   This simple amendment would add and remove $1 from the substance  abuse treatment fund, which we intend as a signal that HHS should  prioritize opioid treatment money where the science shows that it  actually works, on medication-assisted treatment.   Unfortunately, addiction is an issue that we have become all too  familiar with in our communities and across the country. It has claimed  too many loved ones, shattered too many lives, and broken too many  families.   It is a devastating reality that drug overdoses have surpassed motor  vehicle accidents as the leading cause of injury-related deaths in the  United States. In fact, more people die in a single year from overdoses  than were killed during the entire Vietnam war.   This is a public crisis that affects people of every race, every  income group, and every education level. These are mothers and fathers.  They are friends and neighbors.   Honestly, when I was first elected to Congress, I was not prepared  for the numbers and the types of stories that I heard from family  members who have lost loved ones to substance abuse.   The urgency of this deadly epidemic requires us to work together and  work smart as a community and a Nation to fight back. It requires that  we use the best available science and spend our money where we know it  does the most good.   We should implement evidence-based treatment options, and research  has backed medication-assisted treatment. Studies have shown that  medication-assisted treatment decreases opioid use, opioid overdose  deaths, criminal activity, and infectious disease transmission.   These studies also show that medication-assisted treatment increases  social functioning and retention in treatment. Patients treated with  medication are more likely to remain in therapy compared to patients  receiving treatment that did not include medication.   It is also important in the tragic case of pregnant women who are  addicted to opioids. A 2012 study by the American College of  Obstetricians and Gynecologists found that the treatment of opioid- dependent pregnant women with buprenorphine improved outcomes for their  babies and that medication-assisted treatment reduced withdrawal  systems in newborns and decreased the length of hospital stays.   Medication-assisted treatment works, and it is what we should be  funding.   Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.   Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Connecticut  (Ms. DeLauro).                                time  1945     Madam Chair, the opioid epidemic has claimed too many  lives and torn apart too many families for us to be using anything but  the most effective treatments.   It is past time that we stop treating opioid addiction as a moral  failing and start treating it like the treatable medical condition that  it is.   Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment to make  sure that HHS prioritizes funding for medically assisted treatment.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Chair, my amendment highlights the need to think  about our future workforce and how it will change because of  technology, and to encourage the Bureau of Labor Statistics to accept a  wider and more forward-looking range of inputs into its range of  projections for the workforce of the future and that BLS should conduct  the Contingent Worker and Alternative Work Arrangement Supplement to  the Current Population Survey more frequently.   I co-chair the New Democrat Coalition's Future of Work Task Force  with my colleagues Congresswoman Lisa Blunt Rochester, Congressman  Chris Pappas, and Congresswoman Haley Stevens, all of whom have  cosponsored this amendment.   The Future of Work Task Force has held a series of forums to hear  from experts on various areas that will require this body's attention  in the coming years and decades.   Last Congress, we heard from historians, economists, and policy  experts about how technological revolutions of the past have impacted  social and political institutions, and the lessons from those  experiences and from our current conditions that can help us prepare  for the future.   We have also heard from labor and business leaders who are pioneering  new ways to attract talent, to retain the services of skilled  employees, and to develop skills for the increasingly rapidly changing  economy.   It is nearly unanimous among our experts that the economy will change  significantly and change faster, but it is less clear just how quickly  the workforce will need to adapt.   For decades, the Bureau of Labor Statistics has been doing excellent  and invaluable work to track our labor trends, and its projections have  proven very reliable and useful to businesses and to our educators in  times of slower and relatively predictable technological development.   However, they are based on backward-looking historical data and  historical trends, and some of the anticipated changes in technology,  such as robotics, self-driving vehicles, and artificial intelligence  could fundamentally change our economies in ways that we haven't seen  before and are not preparing for.   So in its current form, the way that the Bureau calculates and  estimates future development of the workforce may not be able to  capture the dramatic changes that our future holds.   One panel convened by the task force suggested that it would be  difficult or impossible to do projections in any single way to predict  the future of the workforce, but with additional resources, the Bureau  of Labor Statistics could model for a variety of scenarios of different  rates of technological change in different sectors.   My amendment increases the BLS amount by a dollar and decreases it by  a dollar, which we intend to signal that the BLS should submit to  Congress an estimate of the resources it would need to make a range of  forward-looking estimates, including consultation with those industries  that are driving the rapid technological change and those industries  that will be affected by that change to account for the increasing rate  of technological job displacement.   Technological changes to the workforce are not new. The industrial  revolution and the automation of agriculture transformed the way work  was performed in our country, and significantly improved, on the whole,  our standard of living over time, but the benefits have not been  uniform and all communities and all job sectors have not benefited  equally.   Past transformations have typically played out over generations so  that our social and political institutions had ample time to respond,  but today, the development and deployment of our technology is far more  rapid, and Congress, business, and our educational system need the best  possible data to evaluate policy proposals and to produce the workforce  training needed for future employees, to develop educational curricula,  and ensure that our economy works for everyone.   Like the industrial revolution, technological development presents  the opportunity for greatly improved standards of living, but it will  also bring challenges to our workforce.   Businesses, communities, and government must work together.   Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to join me in voting ``yes'' on my  amendment, to begin to establish a range of planning scenarios from the  Bureau of Labor Statistics for the future world that we will all  inhabit.   Madam Chair, I thank my Future Work Task Force co-chairs,  Congresswoman Haley Stevens, Congressman Chris Pappas and Congresswoman  Lisa Blunt Rochester, for cosponsoring this amendment, and I urge my  colleagues to vote ``yes'' on the amendment.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Chair, my amendment would increase the Biomedical  Advanced Research and Development Authority account by $1 million to  support increased R&D for biosecurity.   As the only Ph.D. physicist in Congress, I feel a special  responsibility to speak out on issues of national security, especially  when they concern emerging technological threats that Congress may not  be sufficiently aware of.   For more than 70 years, nuclear weapons have held center stage among  the threats to our national security and global safety because of their  capabilities to threaten the existence of all mankind.  [[Page H4563]]    However, the dangers posed by advanced biological threats are  catching up fast.   For example, the ability of genome editing tools, such as CRISPR/ Cas9, to delete, suppress, and amplify specific genes has been a long  sought-after capability for treating monogenic disorders and other  disorders.   However, this ability could also be abused for nefarious purposes,  such as disrupting the normal function of particular biological systems  or weaponizing synthetic versions of a virus.   This is a global issue that will require global solutions.   Unfortunately, the advances in this field are outpacing our ability  to develop policies that will set international ethical and regulatory  frameworks.   Diagnostic platforms that can rapidly detect and characterize  bioagents will become increasingly critical to safeguarding human  health.   If we are going to stay ahead of these technological threats, we need  to be strategic about our investments.   As a leader in technology and innovation, the United States must act  now to mitigate any dangers that these technologies might pose.   Madam Chair, the $1 million allocated by this amendment represents  truly only a fraction of what will ultimately be needed, but I urge my  colleagues to join me and vote ``yes'' on my amendment.   Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Connecticut  (Ms. DeLauro).    Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to support this  amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.
