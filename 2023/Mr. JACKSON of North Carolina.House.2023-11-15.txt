 Mr. Speaker, I have been a Member of  Congress for about 11 months, and I want to give my constituents a  quick update on some of the bipartisan work that we have done.   Our office has been able to bring about $90 million back into the  district. A big portion of that has gone to the Charlotte airport,  which is one of the main economic drivers not just for the district but  for the whole State.   A portion of that has gone to law enforcement to help them get more  body cameras and also to help them process the backlog of rape test  kits that we have in North Carolina. Another portion has gone to help  fight the fentanyl epidemic, which is claiming lives every single day  in our State.   I have also worked on legislation to close the weather radar gap that  we have in Charlotte that has been a problem for several decades. We  had an amendment pass last week about that.   We had another amendment pass today about quantum technology and the  security concerns that that is going to pose for all of us.   I am also working on a bipartisan bill to cut down on the junk fees  that attach to all the things that we buy as consumers.   Last week, I worked very hard to make sure we finally ban Members of  Congress from trading stocks. It is wrong. It has been obvious for a  long time that this should be against the law, and I am working on a  bipartisan effort.                SECURE THE BORDER BEFORE IMMIGRATION REFORM    (Mr. FULCHER asked and was given permission to address the House for  1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
