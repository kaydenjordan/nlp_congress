 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  include any extraneous material on the subject of this Special Order  hour.    Mr. Speaker, for the next 60 minutes, it is with great  honor that I rise to coanchor this CBC Special Order hour. For the next  60 minutes, we have a chance to speak directly to the American people  on the issues of great importance to the Congressional Black Caucus, to  Congress, and to constituents who represent all Americans.   At this time, Mr. Speaker, we would like to use this time to talk  about the Affordable Care Act. What do you have to lose? What do you  have to lose, Mr. Speaker? Such was President Trump's constant refrain  to the African-American community when rallying for their support of  his administration's various policies.   Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to say that with critical elements of the  American healthcare policy on the chopping block, African-Americans  have a lot to lose, possibly even their lives.                                time  1930    There is as much at stake if President Trump and the Republican- controlled Congress healthcare policies take shape in their current  form.   By illustration, I want to address the impact on low-income families  and individuals in the Virgin Islands who rely on Medicaid, and,  presently, Medicaid is capped in the Virgin Islands. You can look at  our territory as an example of what will happen when there is a cap on  services, which could compromise a State or local government's ability  to administer those most in need.   Since its inception, Medicaid has been an open-ended program that was  intended to expand and contract with need, especially when States and  localities face crippling economic downturns of both manmade and  natural origins. Medicaid covers one in five Americans, and of those,  the majority of enrollees are children and individuals with  disabilities.   Under the Affordable Care Act, widely known as ObamaCare, millions of  African Americans finally gained access to healthcare coverage. In  2015, approximately 11.2 million African Americans became eligible for  Medicaid through the expansion, health care that they previously did  not receive and which would have cost this country much more if that  early-warning health care was not taken care of.   President Trump and Republicans in Congress propose converting  Medicaid from a shared payment program between States and Federal  Government to an arrangement much like a block grant, where the Federal  Government puts a cap on its payment assistance, creating a huge cost  shift to the States. If you want to know what you have to lose if caps  on Medicaid are enacted nationwide, look no further than my home, the  Virgin Islands. It is a grim outlook.   Federal caps on Medicaid programs in the Virgin Islands are set on a  per-enrollee basis. Unlike States in the mainland where Federal  Medicaid spending is open-ended depending on the needs of the people,  the Virgin Islands can only access Federal dollars up to an annual  ceiling. Beyond that cap, the Virgin Islands' government is responsible  for the remaining costs. That means many Virgin Islanders who would  qualify in other States and in other circumstances don't get the  healthcare coverage that they need now.   Under the proposed fiscal arrangement, spending caps don't take into  account the cost of providing services or unpredictable changes in a  community--such as the closure of a major employer or a natural  disasters--forcing a cost obligation for critical support services onto  the already strained budgets of the territory.  [[Page H2227]]    As a result, States and local governments, increasingly, would have  to make tough choices to either reduce services for recipients of  Medicaid or restrict eligibility and enrollment of additional people  who may need it. Those are the choices that Virgin Islanders must make.  So the most vulnerable of our constituents--in this case, children--who  need the safety net that Medicaid, by definition, is supposed to  provide have that final option cut out from under them.   When it comes to Medicaid coverage, the Virgin Islands struggles to  provide low-income families with Medicaid services for three major  reasons:   First, while the Affordable Care Act raised the territory's Federal  Medicaid assistance percentage up to 83 percent for newly eligible  enrollees, this increase in Federal match funding did not apply to  those previously enrolled, which the Federal Government only matched at  55 percent in the Virgin Islands, requiring that the remaining costs be  covered by the Virgin Islands government, a government already strained  to meet basic needs.   The Virgin Islands and the smaller territories are not included in  the Medicaid Disproportionate Share Hospital, DSH, program, which would  shoulder the unanticipated costs our hospitals must take on to provide  adequate care for individuals who use hospitals for basic services  since they have no insurance.   Three, With no Affordable Care Act exchange and no Federal subsidies  to create our own health exchange, many Virgin Islanders were only able  to obtain coverage through the Medicaid expansion if they met the  already strenuous requirements. That means that 30 percent of Virgin  Islanders presently have no health insurance.   This is what the rest of the States are going to have if this  American Health Care Act, as it stands, is passed. A cap on Medicaid is  a cap on medical services that our constituents just can't do without;  and in poor communities, it is going to be even more impactful.   When ObamaCare provided increased funding to expand Medicaid, the  island of Saint Croix was able to start a monthly homeless clinic at  the Frederiksted Health Care Center about 15 months ago. That clinic  has been able to serve many people, providing them with medical care,  showers, meals, and transportation.   On St. Thomas, with the East End health clinic, they were able to  expand their services and increase dental services to people who were  sorely in need of that. If this funding decreases or is lost  altogether, it is highly unlikely that this initiative can be  continued.   Our current healthcare struggle is set to become a future hardship  for mainland American States that provide Medicaid to a significant  number of their population should the current proposals to cap Medicaid  nationwide become law.   How do we avoid this? Do not place a cap on Medicaid. Too many in the  African-American community have everything to lose if healthcare policy  goes in this direction.   At this time, I yield to my colleague, the distinguished gentleman  from Pennsylvania (Mr. Evans).    Thank you so much to my distinguished colleague from  Philadelphia (Mr. Evans) and for the information you have shared with  us.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the distinguished gentlewoman from Chicago,  Congresswoman Robin Kelly, who is also the chair of the Congressional  Black Caucus Health Braintrust, so she can expound upon this question:  What do we have to lose?    Thank you so much, Congresswoman Kelly, for that  information that you are sharing and for the work of the Congressional  Black Caucus Health Braintrust and for the information that you are  giving in the seminars and the groups, the different experiences that  you have had throughout the country.   I yield to the gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. Kelly) so that she can  tell us about some of the places that the Congressional Black Caucus  Braintrust has had workshops or townhalls when sharing information with  Americans.    Mr. Speaker, I know the work that the gentlewoman from  Illinois has done in health disparities that African Americans face. We  disproportionately are struck with hypertension, high blood pressure,  and diabetes, which are some of the things that we are concerned about.  Lapse in coverage under the Affordable Care Act will affect African  Americans in a large way because then those will become preexisting  conditions, which are not covered under this healthcare plan.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. Kelly).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Illinois for  the information and for being with us.   I also thank Chairman Richmond for providing this opportunity for the  Congressional Black Caucus to speak before all of you and let you know.   I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Veasey), my distinguished  co-chair, who has some great information to share with us about what do  we have to lose under the new Health Care Act that is being considered  by the Republicans at this time.    Mr. Speaker, I agree very much with everything that the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Veasey) has said. I thank him for the stories  of individuals because it is individuals that the Affordable Care Act  was meant to cover, not groups of people, but everyday  Americans, children, disabled, our elderly.    Some of the reports say that TrumpCare would be the largest transfer  of wealth from working families to the rich in our Nation's history;  that the Republicans are handing $600 billion in tax breaks to rich and  big corporations through this bill while taking money away from those  Americans who have been able to have their healthcare needs taken care  of in an affordable manner.   You have families that are going to be paying more for less under  TrumpCare. Deductibles and out-of-pocket costs are going to skyrocket,  leaving sick people unable to afford the care that they need. Premiums  will soar and quality coverage is going to be priced out of reach for  many families.   We also heard earlier about the middle-aged American paying an age  tax that is going to come from this, that older Americans are going to  be forced to pay premiums five times higher than what others pay for  healthcare coverage.   I yield to the gentlewoman from Florida (Mrs. Demings), the  distinguished freshman Congresswoman from the 10th District of Florida,  so she can explain to us how TrumpCare and the new Health Care Act is  going to affect her constituents and all Americans and, particularly,  African Americans in this country.    Congresswoman Demings, in fact, you do have a lot to  lose. We see how Florida, with its elders, its senior citizens, will  really take a major hit if this law is passed. And our colleagues have  been giving us examples all the time.   I am always trying to let them know that the Virgin Islands stands as  an example of what it will look like if the Affordable Care Act is  repealed because the Virgin Islands doesn't have the expansion. We were  not put in the mandate for the exchange, and that has led to 30 percent  of Virgin Islanders having absolutely no health insurance, which then  means that our hospitals are strained because the hospitals have to  pick up costs for individuals who are without health care.   Listen, if your child is ill or sick, or you are dying, you are going  to go to the hospital whether you can take care of it or not, whether  you can pay the bill or not; and that has put a tremendous burden on  our hospitals for them to meet the costs of those 30 percent of  individuals living in the Virgin Islands who do not have health  insurance, are not covered by either the government group insurance for  the local government or by the Medicaid money that we utilized because  we did not have the expansion.   And even that is scheduled to leave after the fiscal year 2019, and  we are going to have to make choices of removing people from Medicaid,  of removing care from children, removing care from elderly and from  individuals with disabilities. That is not a choice that Americans  should have to make in this day and age, that individuals do not  receive health care.   I know, Congressman Veasey, that you are hearing from people in your  own district who are giving you these same stories: What is going to  happen if I don't have healthcare coverage? What is going to happen to  my children if they are not able--they have asthma, they have juvenile  diabetes, they have these issues, and I am not going to be able to take  care of them because I am not going to have this insurance. Or the  Medicaid is going to have to be pulled back in our State because we are  going to have it capped; and our State is not a wealthy State and is  not going to be able to make up the difference.   I know that the gentleman has examples from other Members who have  come and given statements for us to bring to the Record about what is  going to happen.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas.    From our experience in the Virgin Islands, that is what  you do not want to happen.   People talk about: Who is on Medicaid? Who are these types of  individuals? Why don't they get jobs?   I mean, in the Virgin Islands, when we had our largest employer,  Hovensa, an oil refinery, close, of course, then our unemployment rate  went up. And these are families in need, families who need the support.   With a cap on Medicaid, we were only able to have 55 percent of  individuals who would qualify for Medicaid with that cap, with that  ceiling that was in place from the Federal Government. It means that a  tremendous amount of children, homeless individuals, people, families  that are out of work for a period of time, are not covered. That, then,  creates this huge burden on a hospital for those families to be taken  care of, for individual care and individual need.   Particularly in the African-American community, when you have things  like diabetes, hypertension, all of these diseases which need constant  monitoring and primary care physicians to take care of and to ensure  that they do not become life-threatening, and come to a place where  then they are coming to the hospital, it is in the millions of dollars  that you are going to need support and care for the servicing of  individuals with these diseases.   So I know that we are pushing that there be an expansion of Medicaid,  that the cap not be put on Medicaid services, not because we want to  coddle people who are poor, but because we know it is necessary. And  the cost of not taking care of them on the front end of health care,  with Medicaid, is an astronomical cost on the back end when they have  diseases that have just gone out of control because they have not been  able to go to primary care physicians and get the health care that they  need.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas.    I thank the gentleman for all of the examples that he  has given, real-world, real-people examples. I think it is important  that all of us, as Members of Congress, really take to heart the words  that we are hearing from Americans that are going to be affected by  this.   Particularly in the African-American community, this is going to have  a devastating affect on them to have this Affordable Care Act be  repealed and this replacement. It does not take into account the lives  that people are really living.   This is really a tax break bill. That is what this boils down to in  many respects, because the individuals who are going to be displaced  from this are those individuals who are the poor.   I just want to thank Congressman Veasey for the time that he has  given us this evening and all of our colleagues who are here and spoke  about the Affordable Care Act and what the African-American community  and what many Americans have to lose from this bill.   At this time, I conclude this CBC Special Order hour.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
