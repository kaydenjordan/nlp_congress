 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate a man who is part  of the Greatest Generation, Tom ``Pinky'' Funderburk of Rock Hill,  South Carolina.   Mr. Funderburk has been awarded the French Legion of Honor. Pinky  flew B-17 bombers, known as the Flying Fortress, with the Mighty 8th  United States Air Force during World War II.   The Legion of Honor was established by Napoleon in 1802 as the  highest French order of merit for military and civil merits.   The first dangerous missions for which Pinky was awarded the Legion  of Honor took place on the 14th, 15th, and 16th of April 1945 over  Royan, France. His crew's mission was to bomb the 30,000 encamped  German troops concentrated around Royan on the coast of France.  [[Page H7255]]    One day, they approached their target from an altitude of 25,000 feet  and noticed an absence of antiaircraft activity in the skies, so they  dropped down to 17,000 feet. The formation circled three times to drop  their bombs more accurately when a small flare used to follow bombs to  their targets ignited in their bomb bay, filling the aircraft with  thick, sooty smoke that covered all the windows.   Fearing they were hit by ground fire, the crew grabbed their  parachutes and prepared to abandon their plane over enemy territory.  Before jumping out, the crew made one last check to see if the pilots  were able to make it out safely. They yelled through the intercom to  see if they were coming but received no reply. Just as they were ready  to bail out, copilot Funderburk yelled out, ``Wait.''   The smoke was so thick that the pilots were worried about crashing  into the other planes in the formation and were too busy flying the  plane and clearing the smoke to worry about bailing out. The pilots  were able to clear the smoke and fly the airplane and crew safely back  to their home base.   The final mission took Pinky deep into enemy territory into  Horsching, Austria, where French prisoners of war had recently been  liberated from a POW camp. Pinky's crew reconfigured their B-17 bomber  to carry 31 prisoners of war back to Paris and their homeland.   Mr. Speaker, for these heroic duties and his selfless service, Pinky  Funderburk honors all South Carolinians, and I am proud to recognize  him today for receiving the prestigious French Legion of Honor.                            ____________________
