 Mr. Speaker, this past weekend I had the honor of being  back in my home State in Abilene, Kansas to honor our 34th President's  129th birthday, and to rededicate the newly remodeled Eisenhower  Presidential Library and Museum.   I got to see old friends. I got to play in an old-timers baseball  game. I got to hear part of Ike's story through the eyes of his  granddaughter, Mary Jean, and his great-grandson, Merrill Atwater.   I have had a special connection to this Presidential museum since I  was 9 years old when my dad was honored to be part of the honor guard  for Ike's funeral procession.   Though I have been to the Eisenhower Library and Museum numerous  times, I was once again enthralled with Ike's story. I was so impressed  with the beautiful new layout and the modernization of the museum. This  is, indeed, a great place to take children, to help them learn about  the story of America.   Ike's story, his words, his Kansas values from over 60 years ago,  ring as true today as they did then. Ike, who was born on the wrong  side of the track, literally, held hard work and education in the  highest regard. He often spoke of his home as the heartland of America.  He spoke of the value of being part of a community and a humble  lifestyle.   Ike was a visionary in many ways. He is now credited as being one of  the top five Presidents in American history, and perhaps one of the  greatest commanding generals of all time.   He started the fight for civil rights. He started NASA, the FAA, as  well as the Department of Education. And, of course, he was responsible  for the Interstate Highway System which we rely upon today. But of all  the things which I saw, what struck the loudest chord was Ike's battle  to end war, or as he called it ``waging peace.'' In Ike's words, ``I  hate war as only a soldier who has lived it can . . . `'   Ike was the first one to coin the phrase ``peace through strength.''   Ike went on to say: ``Our economic strength and military strength are  our Nation's shields--without which peace could never be preserved, nor  freedom defended.''   Dwight D. Eisenhower embodied the American ideal of success through  hard work, opportunity, and a purposeful life. I am thrilled this great  American and Kansan will soon be honored with a national monument here  in Washington, D.C. to celebrate his life and legacy.                        Breast Cancer Awareness Month     Mr. Speaker, for over 30 years, I wore a pink tie like  the one I have on today to work almost every day. October is Breast  Cancer Awareness Month, but what most people don't realize, is that one  out of eight women develop breast cancer in their life.   As an obstetrician and gynecologist, I have had to tell hundreds of  women that very bad news. That is why I try to remember every October,  remember to encourage women to go get their mammogram done. If you are  over the age of 35 and it has been over a year since your last  mammogram, please call your physician's office, talk to a nurse and ask  her: Is it time for you to go get your next mammogram done?   I think it is good for us to talk about risk factors for breast  cancer, and, of course, everyone knows that the risk of a family member  having breast cancer increases your risk, and that may encourage you to  get your mammogram done more often and at a younger age.   If you have more than one first-degree relative with breast cancer,  you want to talk to your doctor about some genetic studies to see if,  indeed, you are carrying some type of a gene mutation that would  increase your risk for breast cancer.   But there are other risk factors as well that people don't often  think about. A poor diet that is high in fat increases your risk of  breast cancer; obesity increases your risk of breast cancer; lack of  exercise increases your risk of breast cancer; smoking increases your  risk of breast cancer; and a history of radiation exposure to the chest  increases your risk of breast cancer.   So a good diet, regular exercise--30 minutes of walking every day-- will decrease your risk. What people often ask me about, though, are  the ways that you can prevent breast cancer and decrease your risk. I  have already mentioned a good diet and exercise, but  [[Page H8150]]  breastfeeding also protects you and decreases your risk for breast  cancer, one more reason why women should consider breastfeeding when  they have their baby.   But what I want to emphasize today is that most new people diagnosed  with breast cancer had no risk factors. Let me say that again: Most  women who are diagnosed with breast cancer have no risk factor at all.  That is why it is important to get your mammogram done on a regular  basis.   The mammogram can pick up breast cancer 2 or 3 years before you can  feel something, making the cancer much more treatable.                            ____________________
