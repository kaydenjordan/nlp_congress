 Madam Speaker, before COVID-19 more than 40  percent of San Diego kids were already living in families experiencing  poverty.   Childhood poverty was a problem before COVID-19, and we know it has  only worsened through this pandemic. America's kids deserve better.   That is why I was so proud to fight for them through the American  Rescue Plan and so proud to see the bill signed into law last week.   The American Rescue Plan makes historic investments to increase the  child tax credit and support our childcare infrastructure to help  working families and our care workers. These investments will be  transformational, cutting childhood poverty in half and lifting a heavy  burden off the shoulders of so many parents.   Today, I celebrate this progress. And, today, I commit myself to  working to support the 5 million American children who will still  experience poverty. Let's make the child tax credit increases  permanent. Let's revitalize our childcare infrastructure, and let's do  right by America's kids.                            ____________________
