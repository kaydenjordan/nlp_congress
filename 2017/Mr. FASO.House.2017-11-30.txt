 Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Shimkus for his leadership in this  regard. I thank the Speaker and my colleagues for the opportunity to  speak in support of H.R. 3017, the Brownfields Enhancement, Economic  Redevelopment, and Reauthorization Act.   Mr. Speaker, like many of my colleagues, my district has numerous  former industrial sites that have benefited directly from brownfields  grant funding.   Shortly after the program was authorized, the EPA selected the City  of Oneonta as a recipient of a $200,000 brownfields assessment grant to  prepare reuse plans for a 100-acre heavy industrial area. This modest  assessment grant helped accelerate ongoing efforts to support site  enhancement by providing essential financial support to the city.   Similarly, Montgomery County has been able to utilize designations to  assist it in the redevelopment of the former Beech-Nut manufacturing  facility in the Village of Canajoharie.   Mr. Speaker, I offer my full support for this bipartisan legislation  because  [[Page H9546]]  it works to better the lives of families and communities throughout my  district and across America. I urge all my colleagues on both sides of  the aisle to support this critical legislation.     Mr. Speaker, it is with great respect and sorrow that I  rise today to announce the passing of our former colleague, Congressman  Maurice Hinchey.   Mr. Hinchey passed away on November 22, just before Thanksgiving, at  the age of 79 in Saugerties, New York, leaving behind an extraordinary  legacy that was marked by fervent patriotism, political courage, and  forward-thinking leadership.   During his 20 years of service in the House of Representatives,  Maurice Hinchey represented a broad swath of New  [[Page H9560]]  York State, from the Hudson Valley and the Catskill Mountains, over in  the Southern Tier as well. Many of those areas make up what is today's  19th Congressional District, which I currently represent.   I also had the honor of working alongside Mr. Hinchey for 6 years in  the New York State Assembly. There, he developed and honed his  legislative skills as chairman of the assembly's Environmental  Conservation Committee.   We proudly note the service of Maurice Hinchey to the Nation, and I  am glad to be joined here by colleagues from the New York delegation  and the dean of the delegation, Ms. Slaughter, to extend our heartfelt  condolences to Maurice Hinchey's widow, and to the entire Hinchey  family.                            ____________________
