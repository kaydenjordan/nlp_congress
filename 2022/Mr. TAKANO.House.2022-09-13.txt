(a) In General.--Title VII of the Servicemembers Civil       Relief Act (50 U.S.C. 4021 et seq.) is amended by inserting       after section 705 (50 U.S.C. 4025) the following new section:       ``SEC. 705A. PORTABILITY OF PROFESSIONAL LICENSES OF                     SERVICEMEMBERS AND THEIR SPOUSES.         ``(a) In General.--In any case in which a servicemember or       the spouse of a servicemember has a covered license and such       servicemember or spouse relocates his or her residency       because of military orders for military service to a location       that is not in the jurisdiction of the licensing authority       that issued the covered license, such covered license shall       be considered valid at a similar scope of practice and in the       discipline applied for in the jurisdiction of such new       residency for the duration of such military orders if such       servicemember or spouse--        ``(1) provides a copy of such military orders to the       licensing authority in the jurisdiction in which the new       residency is located;        ``(2) remains in good standing with--        ``(A) the licensing authority that issued the covered       license; and        ``(B) every other licensing authority that has issued to       the servicemember or the spouse of a servicemember a license       valid at a similar scope of practice and in the discipline       applied in the jurisdiction of such licensing authority;        ``(3) submits to the authority of the licensing authority       in the new jurisdiction for the purposes of standards of       practice, discipline, and fulfillment of any continuing       education requirements.        ``(b) Interstate Licensure Compacts.--If a servicemember or       spouse of a servicemember is licensed and able to operate in       multiple jurisdictions through an interstate licensure       compact, with respect to services provided in the       jurisdiction of the interstate licensure compact by a       licensee covered by such compact, the servicemember or spouse       of a servicemember shall be subject to the requirements of       the compact or the applicable provisions of law of the       applicable State and not this section.        ``(c) Covered License Defined.--In this section, the term       `covered license' means a professional license or       certificate--        ``(1) that is in good standing with the licensing authority       that issued such professional license or certificate;        ``(2) that the servicemember or spouse of a servicemember       has actively used during the two years immediately preceding       the relocation described in subsection (a); and        ``(3) that is not a license to practice law.''.

The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days within  [[Page H7766]]  which to revise and extend their remarks and to insert extraneous  material on H.R. 7939, as amended.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 7939, as amended. This  comprehensive package from Economic Opportunity Subcommittee Chairman  Levin includes several improvements for student veterans.   The COVID-19 pandemic exposed many flaws in student veteran benefits.  We never could have anticipated the need to shift nearly all students  to remote learning, but without action, VA would have been forced to  cut housing benefits for hundreds of thousands of student veterans  nationwide because the students technically were no longer attending  classes in person.   However, this committee acted swiftly during 2020, passing several  crucial acts, including my Student Veteran Coronavirus Response Act of  2020, which was swiftly signed into law.   These actions meant student veterans were protected from losing their  benefits--but only for a limited time. While I am relieved we never  left student veterans without their benefits, we came close far too  many times.   H.R. 7939, as amended, does away with these artificial benefit cliffs  for student veterans and makes permanent many of the veteran  protections passed as short-term measures during 2020 and 2021.   That means the next time there is an emergency--be it a flood,  tornado, another pandemic, or another event that forces students to  take their classes online for a short period of time--VA will be able  to fully pay out benefits to student veterans who are forced to attend  classes remotely.   I thank Chairman Levin of the Subcommittee on Economic Opportunity  for introducing H.R. 7939, as amended, to safeguard these benefits. In  addition, included in this legislation is H.R. 5752, also from Chairman  Levin. This provision will allow servicemembers to get out of contracts  they may be wrongly bound to because of their orders.   Families suffered fines, excessive bills, and damage to their credit  scores due to circumstances completely outside of their control. Also,  from Chairman Levin, H.R. 7939, as amended, includes the text from H.R.  7369, the VENTURE Act, which allows more disabled veterans to use the  self-employment track for the Veteran Readiness and Employment Program.   Previously, this option was only available to a very small cohort of  veterans. The VENTURE Act keeps prioritization of several disabled  veterans but also allows additional veterans to pursue this option if  they wish.   Finally, this package includes countless additional improvements for  student veterans such as improving which programs are available for GI  bill approval and removing unnecessary red tape for schools so school  certifying officials can spend more time with students and less time on  paperwork.   This legislation is supported by Disabled American Veterans, Veterans  Education Success, Student Veterans of America, Veterans of Foreign  Wars, and VA.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1600     Mr. Speaker, again, I ask all of my colleagues to join me  in passing H.R. 7939, as amended, the Student Veteran Emergency Relief  Act of 2022, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 7846) to increase, effective as of December 1, 2022, the  rates of compensation for veterans with service-connected disabilities  and the rates of dependency and indemnity compensation for the  survivors of certain disabled veterans, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 7846         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Veterans' Compensation Cost-      of-Living Adjustment Act of 2022''.       SEC. 2. INCREASE IN RATES OF DISABILITY COMPENSATION AND                     DEPENDENCY AND INDEMNITY COMPENSATION.         (a) Rate Adjustment.--Effective on December 1, 2022, the       Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall increase, in accordance       with subsection (c), the dollar amounts in effect on November       30, 2022, for the payment of disability compensation and       dependency and indemnity compensation under the provisions       specified in subsection (b).        (b) Amounts To Be Increased.--The dollar amounts to be       increased pursuant to subsection (a) are the following:        (1) Wartime disability compensation.--Each of the dollar       amounts under section 1114 of title 38, United States Code.        (2) Additional compensation for dependents.--Each of the       dollar amounts under section 1115(1) of such title.        (3) Clothing allowance.--The dollar amount under section       1162 of such title.        (4) Dependency and indemnity compensation to surviving       spouse.--Each of the dollar amounts under subsections (a)       through (d) of section 1311 of such title.        (5) Dependency and indemnity compensation to children.--      Each of the dollar amounts under sections 1313(a) and 1314 of       such title.        (c) Determination of Increase.--Each dollar amount       described in subsection (b) shall be increased by the same       percentage as the percentage by which benefit amounts payable       under title II of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 401 et       seq.) are increased effective December 1, 2022, as a result       of a determination under section 215(i) of such Act (42       U.S.C. 415(i)).        (d) Special Rule.--The Secretary of Veterans Affairs may       adjust administratively, consistent with the increases made       under subsection (a), the rates of disability compensation       payable to persons under section 10 of Public Law 85-857 (72       Stat. 1263) who have not received compensation under chapter       11 of title 38, United States Code.       SEC. 3. PUBLICATION OF ADJUSTED RATES.         The Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall publish in the       Federal Register the amounts specified in section 2(b), as       increased under that section, not later than the date on       which the matters specified in section 215(i)(2)(D) of the       Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 415(i)(2)(D)) are required to       be published by reason of a determination made under section       215(i) of such Act during fiscal year 2023.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  to insert extraneous material on H.R. 7846.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 7846, the Veterans'  Compensation Cost-of-Living Adjustment Act of 2022.   This bill would require the Department of Veterans Affairs to  increase the amounts payable for wartime disability compensation,  compensation for dependents, the clothing allowance for certain  disabled veterans, and dependency and indemnity compensation for  surviving spouses and children.   Specifically, VA would be required to increase benefit amounts by the  same percentage as the cost-of-living increase in benefits for Social  Security recipients.   To me, the cost-of-living adjustment to veterans' compensation is  more than just a rate adjustment tied to inflation. It is a quality-of- life guarantee for veterans and their families.   This annual COLA is not only a source of personal comfort for former  servicemembers as they age; it assures that their survivors will not  see a decline in earned benefits should the economy fluctuate and costs  rise once their beloved veteran is no longer with us. I know this  because veterans and their family members from all over the country  relay these same exact sentiments to me.   The COLA is the continued recognition by a grateful nation of the  service and sacrifice of those who have stepped up to serve. This  gesture of appreciation is one of the most rewarding responsibilities  of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs. As chairman, I am honored to be  leading this effort to express our thanks.   I would like to recognize the Subcommittee on Disability Assistance  and Memorial Affairs for, once again, originating this legislation for  floor consideration today, and I thank Chair Luria and Ranking Member  Nehls for their sponsorship and steadfast assistance to our vets.   I am pleased we are voting on this bill early to alleviate any doubt  that this adjustment will be in place come December.   Mr. Speaker, I wholeheartedly support H.R. 7846, and I urge my  colleagues to do the same.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Virginia (Mrs. Luria). My good friend is the chair of the Disability  Assistance and Memorial Affairs Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I ask all of my colleagues to join me in  passing H.R. 7846, the Veterans' Compensation Cost-of-Living Adjustment  Act of 2022, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 7735) to direct the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to update  the appraisal requirements for certain loans guaranteed by the  Department of Veterans Affairs, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 7735         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Improving Access to the VA       Home Loan Benefit Act of 2022''.       SEC. 2. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR IMPROVING APPRAISAL DELIVERY                     TIMES.         Not later than 90 days after the date of the enactment of       this Act, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall submit to       the Committees on Veterans' Affairs of the Senate and House       of Representatives recommendations for improving the delivery       times for appraisals for loans guaranteed by the Department       of Veterans Affairs.       SEC. 3. UPDATE OF APPRAISAL REQUIREMENTS FOR CERTAIN LOANS                     GUARANTEED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS                     AFFAIRS.         (a) Updated Regulations Required.--Not later than 180 days       after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of       Veterans Affairs shall prescribe updated regulations or       program requirements to clarify when an appraisal is       required, how an appraisal is to be conducted, and who is       eligible to conduct an appraisal for a loan guaranteed by the       Department of Veterans Affairs under chapter 37 of title 38,       United States Code, for any purpose described in section       3710(a) of such title. In prescribing updated regulations or       program requirements under this section, the Secretary shall       take into consideration the recommendations of the Secretary       submitted under section 2.        (b) Waiver of Requirement for Certain Properties.--In       prescribing updated regulations or program requirements under       subsection (a), the Secretary shall consider making changes       applicable to--        (1) certification requirements for appraisers;        (2) minimum property requirements;        (3) the process for selecting and reviewing comparable       sales;        (4) quality control processes;        (5) the Assisted Appraisal Processing Program; and        (6) the use of waivers or other alternatives to existing       appraisal processes.        (c) Desk Top Appraisals.--In prescribing updated       regulations or program guidance under subsection (a), the       Secretary shall provide guidance for the use of the authority       under section 3731(b)(3) of title 38, United States Code,       taking into consideration--        (1) situations in which the use of such authority would       provide for cost savings for the borrower; and        (2) situations in which a traditional appraisal requirement       could cause a delay substantial enough to jeopardize the       ability of a borrower to complete a transaction.       SEC. 4. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS.         The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  insert extraneous material on H.R. 7735, as amended.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 7735, as amended, the  Improving Access  [[Page H7769]]  to the VA Home Loan Benefit Act of 2022. It directs VA to make needed  improvements to the appraisal portion of the program, where some  veterans have experienced delays.   The veteran home loan benefit is one of the most important transition  benefits afforded to servicemembers and veterans. Over the last few  years, during an unprecedented housing market, we have seen how even  slight delays in the program can put servicemembers, veterans, and  their families behind conventional home loan users.   The legislation from Ranking Member Bost directs VA to look  internally at where these delays might be and make needed changes to  make veteran home buyers as competitive as possible in a challenging  buying market.   During our committee's May markup, I was pleased the ranking member  supported my amendment to his legislation, which would ensure that the  changes VA is directed to make to the program only improve the product  for veteran home buyers without weakening home-buyer protections such  as inspections and appraisals.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, I am prepared to  close, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I ask all my colleagues to join me in  passing H.R. 7735, as amended, the Improving Access to the VA Home Loan  Benefit Act of 2022, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 5916) to amend title 38, United States Code, to allow for  the electronic request of certain records, and for other purposes, as  amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 5916         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Wounded Warrior Access       Act''.       SEC. 2. ELECTRONIC REQUEST OF CERTAIN RECORDS MAINTAINED BY                     THE SECRETARY OF VETERANS AFFAIRS.         (a) Electronic Record Requests.--Section 5702 of title 38,       United States Code, is amended--        (1) by redesignating subsection (b) as subsection (c); and        (2) by inserting after subsection (a) the following:        ``(b)(1) The Secretary shall establish and maintain a       secure website or online tool for a claimant or a duly       recognized agent or representative of that claimant to submit       an electronic request for such records.        ``(2) The Secretary, upon receipt of a valid request made       through the website or online tool established under       paragraph (1), shall provide to the requestor--        ``(A) not later than 10 days after receipt, confirmation of       such receipt; and        ``(B) not later than 120 days after receipt, such records       requested in the form selected by the requestor.''.        (b) Conforming Amendments.--Section 5702(a) of title 38,       United States Code, is amended--        (1) in the matter preceding paragraph (1), by striking ``in       writing'' and inserting ``in writing, including an electronic       request submitted through the website or online tool       established under subsection (b),'';        (2) in paragraph (1), by striking ``and'' at the end;        (3) in paragraph (2), by striking the period at the end and       inserting ``; and''; and        (4) by adding at the end the following:        ``(3) the format in which such copy is desired, including       whether in printed form or by downloadable file.''.

SEC. 3. WARNINGS TO CLAIMANTS UNDER LAWS ADMINISTERED BY THE                     SECRETARY OF VETERANS AFFAIRS REGARDING                     UNRECOGNIZED REPRESENTATIVES.         (a) In General.--Section 5901 of title 38, United States       Code, is amended--        (1) by inserting ``(a) In General.--'' before ``Except'';        (2) by adding at the end the following new subsection:        ``(b) Warnings About Potential Predatory Practices.--(1)       The Secretary shall ensure that, each time a claimant under a       law administered by the Secretary logs in to a website or       online tool of the Department, such website or online tool       issues to the claimant, in plain language--        ``(A) a warning about individuals who seek to act in       violation of this chapter;        ``(B) a link to an online tool of the Department through       which the claimant may report such an individual;        ``(C) a link to an online tool of the Department through       which the claimant may search for a recognized agent,       attorney, or other entity recognized by the Secretary for the       preparation, presentation, or prosecution of any claim under       laws administered by the Secretary; and        ``(D) a link to a website or an online tool of the       Department providing final decisions on discipline of agents,       attorneys, and entities, described in subparagraph (C), by       the Secretary for violations of this chapter.        ``(2) The Secretary shall provide all information under       paragraph (1) in the following languages:        ``(A) English.        ``(B) Spanish.        ``(C) Tagalog.        ``(D) The seven other languages most commonly spoken in the       United States.''.        (b) Implementation.--The Secretary of Veterans Affairs       shall carry out subsection (b) of such section, as added by       subsection (a) of this section--        (1) after consulting with stakeholders (including veterans       service organizations recognized under section 5902 of such       title) regarding the wording of the warning under such       subsection; and        (2) not later than one year after the date of the enactment       of this Act.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  [[Page H7770]]  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H.R. 5916, as amended.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5916, as amended.  Representative Aguilar's Wounded Warrior Access Act would require VA to  establish and maintain a secure, internet-based website to enable a  claimant or their representative to make records requests related to VA  claims and benefits.   Additionally, this bill would add a provision requiring VA to warn  claimants about benefit scammers, provide a way to report potentially  fraudulent activity, and provide a tool for claimants to search for  accredited representation.   Currently, to make records requests related to VA claims and  benefits, veterans or designated representatives must submit a Freedom  of Information Act, otherwise known as a FOIA, or a Privacy Act  Request.   Submitting this form followed by waiting for it to upload into the  individual's electronic claims file, and then waiting action on the  request can be very time-consuming and can negatively impact a  claimant's ability to understand what records VA is evaluating and what  information could better assist in a claim's positive adjudication.   Establishing and maintaining a secure, internet-based website to  enable a claimant or their representative to make requests related to  VA claims and benefits would modernize this essential process and  assist in more timely, positive claim outcomes.   This bill would also add another tool in the toolbox for veterans  when navigating the complexities of the claims process and will help  veterans gain a little more autonomy over their claim.   Mr. Speaker, it is my hope that my colleagues will join me in  supporting this legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, I am prepared to  close, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I ask all my colleagues to join me in  passing H.R. 5916, as amended, the Wounded Warrior Access Act, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 8260) to amend title 38, United States Code, to shorten the  timeframe for designation of benefits under Department of Veterans  Affairs life insurance programs, to improve the treatment of  undisbursed life insurance benefits by the Department of Veterans  Affairs, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 8260         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

(a) Improvement of Processes.--The Secretary of Veterans       Affairs shall improve the processes and procedures of the       Department of Veterans Affairs with respect to identifying,       locating, and paying hard-to-find beneficiaries of life       insurance policies issued under chapter 19 of title 38,       United States Code, including by--        (1) improving the search tools available on the website of       the Department;        (2) conducting outreach to veterans, veterans service       organizations, and the general public with respect to such       search tools;        (3) improving the processes for searching for information       relating to potential recipients through internal Department       sources and sources available through other Federal agencies,       State government agencies, and non-government entities; and        (4) ensuring the Department has sufficient dedicated staff       whose primary responsibilities are identifying, locating, and       paying hard-to-find beneficiaries, with the goal of       disbursing by not later than two years after the date of the       enactment of this Act, all funds that, as of the date of the       enactment of this Act, are owed to a beneficiary of a life       insurance policy issued under chapter 19 of title 38, United       States Code.        (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that       the Secretary of Veterans Affairs should work with       interagency partners to determine the types of records,       reports, and other materials that may be required to       identify, locate, and disburse undisbursed life insurance       benefits to hard-to-find beneficiaries.

SEC. 5. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS.         The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H.R. 8260, as amended.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 8260, as amended, the bipartisan Faster Payments to  Veterans' Survivors Act, will result in important help for the  surviving family members of recently deceased veterans. Families often  face financial hardship when a veteran life insurance policyholder  dies, making timely payment of these VA benefits is therefore  essential.   The VA does an admirable job of quickly paying the vast majority of  beneficiaries upon the death of a loved one. Yet, in other cases, for a  variety of reasons, VA is unable to determine the identity or location  of a surviving spouse, child, or family member. At the end of the  fiscal year 2020, the Department owed more than $150 million in  undisbursed life insurance proceeds to nearly 15,000 survivors.  Approximately 10 percent of this money had been owed for more than 5  years.   This legislation, introduced by Representative Chris Pappas ensures  that VA will make the necessary improvements to expedite these life  insurance payments with a goal of disbursing all unpaid benefits within  2 years.   The bill is cosponsored by more than 40 Members on both sides of the  aisle, and it has the support of a half-dozen veteran service  organizations, including the VFW, America Legion, Iraq and Afghanistan  Veterans of America, Vietnam Veterans of America, Military Officers  Association of America, Modern Military Association of America, and  Paralyzed Veterans of America.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Pappas for his work and urge all  of my colleagues to support this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from New  Hampshire (Mr. Pappas), my good friend who serves as chair of the  Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations of the Veterans' Affairs  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I ask all of my colleagues to join me in  passing H.R. 8260, as amended, the Faster Payments to Veterans  Survivors Act, and I yield back the balance of my time.
