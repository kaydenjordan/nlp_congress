 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the unborn.   Babies deserve the right to live, and we have a responsibility to  defend that right. Today, the Supreme Court is considering the most  critical abortion case since Roe v. Wade was tragically decided 50  years ago. It has been 50 years too long, 50 years of abortions, 50  years of abandoning the defenseless, and 50 years of Federal laws that  violate the conscience of the vast majority of Americans, Americans who  support life and who are opposed to their hard-earned taxpayer dollars  funding abortion.   But today, the Supreme Court has the opportunity to protect that  right to life. It is an opportunity that the State of Texas is  championing. Since the passing of the heartbeat bill in Texas on  September 1, almost 10,000 Texan babies have been saved, and now  pregnancy help centers and other women's health clinics outnumber  abortion clinics 20 to 1. The State now spends $100 million on abortion  alternative services, including medical care and counseling.   I want to put this in perspective. As somebody who served in the  military, most countries ascribe to the law of armed conflict. When an  enemy combatant asks for mercy and asks for their life to be saved, it  is the law of armed conflict that directs combatants to save that life.  Yet, in America, we are not saving the lives of innocent babies.   I am urging the Supreme Court to make the right decision. I am  praying for those Justices to save the lives of the unborn.
