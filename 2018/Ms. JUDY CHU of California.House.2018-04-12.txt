 Mr. Speaker, after years of irresponsibly  adding to our national debt in order to make the rich richer,  Republicans are now trying to con the American people with this  insidious and insincere balanced budget amendment.   I say insincere because Republicans have been the greatest  contributors to our national debt. They eagerly supported and even  extended President Bush's 2001 tax cuts, which added more than $5  trillion to the deficit over 10 years. And at the start of this  Congress, they rushed headlong into another $2.3 trillion tax scam that  the Congressional Budget Office says will put our deficit over $1  trillion within just 2 years.   And what do the American people get for all of that? Very little, if  you are not already rich, since 80 percent of that $2.3 trillion goes  straight to the top 1 percent.                                time  1330    Here is why I say this is insidious. First, they pass a Robin Hood  tax scam that robs the coffers and gives it to the wealthiest, then  they use that debt that they themselves created to justify draconian  cuts to the vast majority of Americans who are not millionaires.   In his budget, President Trump proposed cuts of $1.4 trillion from  Medicaid, $500 billion from Medicare, $65 billion from Social Security.   Fortunately, Democrats blocked these cuts, but if this amendment  passes, look out, America. The programs you depend on will be pillaged  to pay for the Republican tax cuts, despite our warnings that it would  result in exactly this situation.   In fact, the latest Center on Budget and Policy report said that the  cuts mandated by this amendment would result in Social Security being  cut by $325 billion in 2025 alone.    =========================== NOTE ===========================        April 12, 2018, on page H3169, the following appeared: Social  Security being cut by $25 billion in 2025 alone.      The online version has been corrected to read: Social Security  being cut by $325 billion in 2025 alone.    ========================= END NOTE =========================     On seeing the CBO's deficit report, Senator Bob Corker, referencing  the tax scam, said: ``It could be one of the worst votes I have ever  made.''   Well, we tried to warn you, but now the American people shouldn't be  the ones to pay for the mistake.   If Republicans want to balance the budget, there is nothing stopping  them. It is time that we stop the tax scam.
