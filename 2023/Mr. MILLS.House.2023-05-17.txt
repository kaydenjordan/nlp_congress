 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the brave men and  women in blue for Florida's Seventh District. I am honored to represent  Seminole County and Volusia County law enforcement officers.   While some of my colleagues on the left have called to defund and  dismantle our police, I, as well as my fellow Republican colleagues,  will always defend them. It is because of our police officers' bravery  and courage on the front lines that we live safely.   In times of crisis, they protect our communities by putting  themselves in harm's way, and many times not being able to make it home  to their loved ones. The officers we honor this week are not just  members of law enforcement, they are our neighbors, our friends, and  our family. They are individuals that represent the values we hold dear  as Americans with integrity, honor, and courage.   Madam Speaker, this week and every week, I honor their sacrifice and  dedication to keeping our communities safe.                            ____________________
