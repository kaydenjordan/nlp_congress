 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that there be up  to 4 minutes of debate, equally divided, prior to the votes on the  remaining amendments today.    Mr. President, I call up my amendment No. 30 and ask  that it be reported by number.   The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows:         The Senator from Nebraska [Mr. Ricketts] proposes an       amendment numbered 30.    The amendment is as follows:                   (Purpose: To require a certification)         Amend section 2 to read as follows:       SEC. 2. REPEAL OF AUTHORIZATION FOR USE OF MILITARY FORCE                     AGAINST IRAQ RESOLUTION OF 2002.         (a) Repeal.--The Authorization for Use of Military Force       Against Iraq Resolution of 2002 (Public Law 107-243; 116       Stat. 1498; 50 U.S.C. 1541 note) is hereby repealed 30 days       after the President certifies to Congress that Iraq, Israel,       and other United States partners and allies in the region       have been meaningfully consulted on the ramifications of       repeal.        (b) Description of Risks.--The certification submitted       under subsection (a) shall include a detailed description of       how Iraq, Israel, and other United States partners and allies       in the region perceive the risks and benefits of a repeal.     This amendment is very simple. It is less than 150  words long. So I ask that you take some time to consider it.   What it does is ask the administration to check in with our allies in  the Middle East--Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Israel, UAE--and let them know  what we are doing with this amendment.   I agree in principle that we ought not let these things hang out  there for 20 years, but I am concerned about the timing because, in my  trip to the Middle East last month, what I heard from our allies is  that it looks like we are withdrawing from the Middle East. And what  that does is it emboldens Iran, it emboldens China, and it encourages  our allies in the Middle East to start looking to hedge their bets from  America and start, maybe, bringing in the Chinese as part of their  security arrangements. And I think that is bad for our country, and,  certainly, I think we can all agree we do not want China to be leading  a world order here; that the United States is the best for providing  peace and prosperity.   What this amendment does is just ask the administration to check in  with our allies, issue a report back to Congress, and, in 30 days after  Congress, then the AUMF would expire. So I just ask that everybody  please consider that.   With that I yield back.    Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.
