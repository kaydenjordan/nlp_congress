 Mr. Speaker, I was unable to vote on February 25,  2019 due to inclement weather preventing my scheduled air travel from  Iowa to Washington, D.C. Had I been present, I would have voted as  follows:   YES on Roll Call No. 88, and YES on Roll Call No. 89.                            ____________________
