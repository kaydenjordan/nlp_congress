 Mr. President, I want to thank our ranking member on  the Finance Committee and all of my colleagues who are here to talk  about and celebrate two programs that for 53 years have changed the  lives of Michigan families and the families of our country for the  better.   The words of President Lyndon B. Johnson, who signed the programs  into law, are a great reminder of what life was like before Medicare  and Medicaid. He said:         No longer will older Americans be denied the healing       miracle of modern medicine. No longer will illness crush and       destroy the savings that they have so carefully put away over       a lifetime so that they might enjoy dignity in their later       years. No longer will young families see their own incomes       and their own hopes eaten away simply because they are       carrying out their deep moral obligations to their parents,       and to their uncles, and to their aunts. And no longer will       this Nation refuse the hand of justice to those who have       given a lifetime of service and wisdom and labor to the       progress of this progressive country.    Thanks to these two programs, we have come a long way toward building  that just Nation President Johnson envisioned.   Before Medicare, only about half of Americans age 65 and older had  health insurance. Today, more than 98 percent of Americans age 65 and  older have health insurance.   In Michigan, more than 675,000 people have gained health coverage  through Healthy Michigan, our Medicaid expansion, and 97 percent of  Michigan children can see a doctor when they get sick or hurt. The  number of people treated without insurance has dropped 50 percent. In  Michigan, we ended 2017 with $413 million more than it invested in the  program, which is a savings for taxpayers in Michigan because fewer  people were walking into the emergency room who didn't have insurance  and couldn't pay the bill.   It is good for State budgets, and it is good for family budgets too.  In fact, a recent study found that the finances of low-income residents  improved in States like Michigan that chose to expand Medicaid.   I know what a difference these programs make for Michigan families  because they share their stories with me.   Ann was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis when she was 40 years old.  She has very limited use of her arms and legs. Yet she feels so  strongly about Medicare and Medicaid that she traveled to Washington,  DC, at my invitation, to speak at a healthcare hearing last year.   Medicare and secondary insurance cover most of the costs of Ann's  medication, which costs an astounding $75,000 a year. That is nearly  her entire  [[Page S5487]]  household income, including Social Security benefits.   Ann had been caring for her aging mom, but when her mom's dementia  worsened, Ann didn't know where she would find $6,000 a month for  nursing home care. Fortunately, Ann's mom qualified for Medicaid. Here  is what Ann said:         It was only because of Medicaid that she was able to get       the help that she needed at the end of her life. . . . I       don't know how I could have cared for my mother on top of       managing my own care. My family would have lost our home and       all our savings trying to keep up with their bills.    In Felicia's case, she may have lost her life. In 2011, she was an  AmeriCorps member with no health insurance. When she started feeling  tired all the time and losing weight, she went to the Center for Family  Health in Jackson, MI. Felicia was diagnosed with stage 4 Hodgkin's  lymphoma. The Center for Family Health helped her get Medicaid and care  at the University of Michigan, including a stem cell transplant.   Felicia wrote:         Now I am feeling awesome, I am cancer-free, and I am       working part time while I am finishing up college. I feel       that I owe my life to the Center for Family Health.    Fifty-three years after they were created, Medicare and Medicaid are  more than just programs, and that is really why we are here on the  floor this evening. They are powerful tools to promote health, to  prevent poverty, and to protect families and give them the dignity of  knowing that they have healthcare when they need it for themselves,  their children, their moms and dads.   LBJ said 53 years ago:         There are men and women in pain who will now find ease. . .       . There are those fearing the terrible darkness of despairing       poverty . . . who will now look up to see the light of hope       and realization.        There just can be no satisfaction, nor any act of       leadership, that gives greater satisfaction than this.    I think we share those sentiments, which is why we are not only here  celebrating 53 years of Medicare and Medicaid but indicating in the  strongest possible terms our commitment to keep Medicare and Medicaid  strong for current families and for future generations.   I yield the floor.    Absolutely.
