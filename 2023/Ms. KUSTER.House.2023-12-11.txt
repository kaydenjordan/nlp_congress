 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge my colleagues to vote  in favor of the SUPPORT Act, comprehensive bipartisan legislation to  address the overdose crisis across this country.   In 2022, nearly 110,000 Americans died because of substance use  disorder or overdose. No community in this country is immune to this  crisis. As we head into the holidays, thousands of families will have  an empty seat at their table. We can and must do more to help save  lives, expand access to treatment, and address the substance use  disorder crisis. That is why passing the SUPPORT Act is so critical.   While I wish this legislation had been passed earlier this year  before these programs expired, I am pleased that the House is now  taking up this legislation to reauthorize the SUPPORT Act and to ensure  that local communities nationwide have the tools to address substance  use disorder at the local level.   Tackling the overdose crisis requires an all-of-the-above approach. I  hope this legislation can serve as a building block to strengthen our  national approach to this crisis and help save lives.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Guthrie and his team for his  partnership to get this over the finish line. I urge my colleagues on  both sides of the aisle to support this important legislation and to  work with us to address this crisis.
