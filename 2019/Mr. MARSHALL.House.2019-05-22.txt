 Mr. Speaker, I am often asked about what I value in  life, and I speak of the four pillars of my life: faith, family,  community, and education. Today I honor faith.  [[Page H4074]]    It is a thrill and honor of my life to have my pastor here today to  help us open this Congress like we do every morning: with prayer.   I honor Pastor Bill Johnson and all the pastors across the country.  Today, the pastor who baptized my four children, who married my  daughter, we are so glad, so proud to have him lead us and open this  House.   Mr. Speaker, there are many, many freedoms that we value, but there  is nothing I value more than freedom of religion.                            ____________________
