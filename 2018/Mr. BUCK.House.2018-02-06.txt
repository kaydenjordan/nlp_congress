Upon adoption of this resolution it shall be in       order to consider in the House the bill (H.R. 4771) to raise       the consolidated assets threshold under the small bank       holding company policy statement, and for other purposes. All       points of order against consideration of the bill are waived.       An amendment in the nature of a substitute consisting of the       text of Rules Committee Print 115-57 shall be considered as       adopted. The bill, as amended, shall be considered as read.       All points of order against provisions in the bill, as       amended, are waived. The previous question shall be       considered as ordered on the bill, as amended, and on any       further amendment thereto, to final passage without       intervening motion except: (1) one hour of debate equally       divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority       member of the Committee on Financial Services; and (2) one       motion to recommit with or without instructions.        Sec. 4.  The requirement of clause 6(a) of rule XIII for a       two-thirds vote to consider a report from the Committee on       Rules on the same day it is presented to the House is waived       with respect to any resolution reported through the       legislative day of February 9, 2018.        Sec. 5.  It shall be in order at any time on the       legislative day of February 8, 2018, or February 9, 2018, for       the Speaker to entertain motions that the House suspend the       rules as though under clause 1 of rule XV. The Speaker or his       designee shall consult with the Minority Leader or her       designee on the designation of any matter for consideration       pursuant to this section.     Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the  customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Hastings),  pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During  consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose  of debate only.                                time  1015                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the rule and the  underlying legislation. This rule makes in order two bills reported  favorably by the Committee on Financial Services and one bill reported  favorably by the Committee on Energy and Commerce. I just want to take  a moment at the beginning to point out that there are no amendments  made in order by this rule because there were no amendments offered to  any of these bills.   Both of the Financial Services bills were the subject of hearings in  the committee last year. Both bills were reported out of committee with  bipartisan support of 75 percent or more of the committee members.   The Energy and Commerce bill was reported favorably by the committee  with a large bipartisan vote of 39-14.   The rule also provides us with the necessary tools to ensure that we  can bring government funding measures to the floor quickly to prevent a  government shutdown.   Mr. Speaker, we have three bills before us today. Each of these bills  deals with one underlying problem: Washington overregulation. That is  it. These are not bills protecting Americans from some foreign hostile  force. These are bills protecting Americans from the overreach of their  own government.   It is a sad time in which we find ourselves when we must dedicate  legislative effort to undoing the harmful effects of the American  government on the American people.   Mr. Speaker, in 2013, the CFPB issued its rule commonly referred to  as the qualified mortgage rule, or the QM rule. The QM rule requires  creditors to make a good faith effort to determine a customer's ability  to repay a loan if the loan is secured by a home. However, the rule  creates a legal safe harbor from liability under the rule for qualified  mortgages.   One aspect of a qualified mortgage is that it cannot have total  points and fees exceeding 3 percent of the total loan amount if the  loan amount is at least $100,000. However, some fees may be excluded  from the points and fees cap if they are reasonable and the lender or  any affiliate of the lender receives no compensation from the service.   This all sounds well and good. We certainly don't want predatory  lending institutions referring business to themselves just to pad their  bottom line at the expense of unsuspecting borrowers.   But this is a great example of how massive, one-size-fits-all  Washington regulation often ends up hurting Americans. The result of  the points and fees cap within the QM rule has been to place low- and  moderate-income borrowers in a position where they end up spending more  money to secure a loan.   Mr. Speaker, my home State of Colorado has been experiencing  explosive population growth over the past decade and longer. Between  2009 and 2016, we added a net increase of more than 600,000 people. But  home prices also increased significantly over that time, more than 57  percent.   In 2016, according to The Denver Post, we had the lowest growth we  have experienced in many years at only a 30,000-person net increase. In  part, the slowing growth rate has to do with rising housing costs. This  is why it is vitally important that many first-time homeowners and  others have access to affordable loans. Government regulation should  not be a part of driving up housing costs.   Why does this happen? Why does a Federal regulation result in hurting  the very people it is intended to help?   It is simple: Washington regulators cannot take into account the  unique circumstances of each individual American. This is a crucial  difference between the common sense of Americans across this land and  the self-importance of some here in D.C.   Many in D.C. believe firmly that the Federal Government is able to  protect every American from every bad experience. They express enormous  faith in so-called experts who believe they can effectively govern from  afar the lives of Americans.   I reject this notion. I reject the belief that a class of enlightened  experts and bureaucrats in Washington can better run the lives of  individuals. That philosophy deprives Americans of the freedom to make  their own choices. When Washington's power expands, individual liberty  retreats. So we have to have bills like the ones before us today.   The Dodd-Frank financial regulatory bill required the CFPB to issue  the QM rule. The QM rule was supposed to help low- to moderate-income  borrowers save money, but, instead, the QM rule created a situation  where low- and moderate-income borrowers cannot take advantage of  discounted services offered by their lender.   The rule forces these borrowers to secure these services from third  parties which almost always charge more than the lenders would charge  for the same services. The negative impact of this rule is so  abundantly clear that half of the committee's Democrats voted with all  of the Republicans in support of fixing this provision of Dodd-Frank.   Passing this bill will not magically cause housing in Colorado to  become more affordable, but it will eliminate an unnecessary regulation  that needlessly drives up borrowing costs.   Mr. Speaker, in addition to rolling back Dodd-Frank regulations, the  second Financial Services bill that we have before us today protects  the ability of small banks to issue debt and raise capital.   The Federal Reserve generally discourages bank holding companies from  using debt to finance acquisitions, particularly the purchasing of  banks. However, the Federal Reserve carved out certain small bank  holding companies.   In order to be considered a small bank holding company, these  companies had an asset cap of $150 million. By 2015, the cap had been  increased to $1 billion. The bill before us today increases the cap to  $3 billion.    As we have heard last night during testimony at the Rules Committee,  there is no science or data behind the level of the cap. Think about  that for a second. The government has established a cap that has a  negative impact on our community banks, and the cap has no basis in  anything, not science, not data, not historical financial patterns,  nothing. The cap is simply a whim of Washington.   Mr. Speaker, this is absurd. It is time we allow our community banks  to have an avenue to continue being locally owned and based in our  communities rather than being bought out by Wall Street.   Today we have two Financial Services bills before us that reduce  regulations and allow Coloradans and all Americans greater freedom in  the choice of banking services. I urge support of these two bills.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I just want to point out to my friend from Florida that  we were both here on the floor as the House of Representatives passed  all 12 appropriations bills in early September.   As we look across to the other side of the Capitol, not much work has  been done on those appropriations bills since they left the House and  traveled to the Senate.   The answer to the continuing problem that we have with continuing  resolutions is to find Members of the Senate who are willing to work as  hard as the House has and pass appropriations bills and fund the  government.   Unfortunately, that doesn't seem to be happening right now, and I  hope we do pass a continuing resolution, I hope we do fund the  military, and I hope we give some more stability to this government.   But the finger pointing in this case I don't think is warranted in  the House.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from Utah (Mrs.  Love).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I want to turn now to the final bill made in order under  this rule, the Common Sense Nutrition Disclosure Act.   Mr. Speaker, in 2016, I had the privilege to visit with one of my  constituents, Lamont Muchmore. Lamont owns a Papa John's pizza  franchise and invited me to come to his restaurant. He even taught me  how to throw, or how to toss--maybe throw, maybe toss--a pizza. It was  a great experience. I got to meet members of his team and hear about  their professional goals. I am happy to say that the American Dream is  alive within the hearts of the people of Colorado.   However, my visit with Lamont was not without concern. You see,  recently, Washington had decided to push a hugely disruptive regulation  on our food service industry.   In the interest of ensuring Americans had information on their food  choices, Washington crafted a one-size-fits-all mandate that every menu  item be labeled with its nutritional content.   As someone who has become extremely aware of the quality of foods  that I consume, I certainly understand the do-good intentions behind  this kind of regulation. But the impact on businesses like Lamont's has  been substantial. In fact, some businesses have no realistic way of  complying with the rules.   Further, the law that put these regulations in place, ObamaCare,  placed criminal penalties on those who fail to comply. How ridiculous  is that? If you mislabel or fail to properly label the calorie count on  a menu item, you could be fined and go to jail.   The bill before us today rectifies some of the harm done by this  rule. The bill allows multiple avenues for businesses such as Lamont's  pizza restaurant to comply with menu labeling requirements in the most  cost-effective manner possible.   While I don't believe the Federal Government needs to require the  calorie count of a food item on a menu in Colorado, this bill offers a  compromise. Americans will still have access to nutrition information  about the food they are purchasing, while businesses will be able to  provide a variety of prepared and local foods without fear of major  penalties if one serving happens to be slightly different in its  calorie count than the last serving.                                time  1045    Mr. Speaker, I cannot tell you how frustrating it is to visit with  Coloradans who are working hard to build their businesses, provide for  their families and community, and employ people, only to be met with  the constant headwind that our Federal Government blows in their faces  through its Washington-knows-best regulatory schemes. Washington should  get out of the way and let Americans do what we do best: cultivate our  resources for the good of our family and neighbors.   I think often of Coloradans like Lamont. It is men and women like him  all across this great land that are doing the important work. I am  committed to ensuring that this Federal Government stops jeopardizing  their hard-won success, and that Washington's so-called experts give  honor where it is due: to the hardworking American people.   I thank Lamont for taking the time out of his day to visit with me.  This bill answers the needs of his team, and I urge its passage.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Will the gentleman yield?    He does.    I don't believe he owns more than 20.    I will pass that information on to Lamont, although I  disagree with your reading.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Washington is out of step with the vast majority of the American  people. It is true that we often do work here that moves our country  forward, that protects this great land, but it is also true that there  is a competing worldview in this City which seeks to rule over the  American people.   In Colorado, we have experienced the negative effects of overreach by  the Federal Government.   How is it that regulators living 1,700 miles away from us believe  they can create rules that take into account our needs and that respect  our way of life?   It is just not possible.   Washington is good at stamping out large Federal programs. The  problem is that it usually stamps out individual liberty in the  process. This City must stop telling the people of Colorado how to live  every detail of their lives. Washington's so-called experts must stop  burying Colorado businessmen and -women under piles of rules.   If we truly free our people to grow and pursue their hopes and  dreams, we will experience a renaissance of growth unmatched in our  history. This Congress has done good work in rolling back the strong  arm of the Federal Government, but there is more work to do.   These bills before us continue what should be a never-ending pursuit  of giving back to the people their personal liberty which has been  confiscated by overreaching Federal Government.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Hensarling and Chairman Walden for  their work on these bills. I thank Chairman Sessions for bringing these  bills to the floor.   Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of the bills and the rule.   The material previously referred to by Mr. Hastings is as follows:            An Amendment to H. Res. 725 Offered by Mr. Hastings         At the end of the resolution, add the following new       sections:        Sec. 6. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the       Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare       the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on       the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R.       4938) to address the opioid epidemic, and for other purposes.       The first reading of the bill shall be dispensed with. All       points of order against consideration of the bill are waived.       General debate shall be confined to the bill and shall not       exceed one hour equally divided and controlled by the chair       and ranking minority member of the Committee on Energy and       Commerce. After general debate the bill shall be considered       for amendment under the five-minute rule. All points of order       against provisions in the bill are waived. At the conclusion       of consideration of the bill for amendment the Committee       shall rise and report the bill to the House with such       amendments as may have been adopted. The previous question       shall be considered as ordered on the bill and amendments       thereto to final passage without intervening motion except       one motion to recommit with or without instructions. If the       Committee of the Whole rises and reports that it has come to       no resolution on the bill, then on the next legislative day       the House shall, immediately after the third daily order of       business under clause 1 of rule XIV, resolve into the       Committee of the Whole for further consideration of the bill.        Sec. 7. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H.R. 4938.                                   ____           The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means         This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous       question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote.       A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote       against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow       the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a       vote about what the House should be debating.        Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of       Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the       previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or       control the consideration of the subject before the House       being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous       question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the       subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling       of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the       House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes       the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to       offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the       majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated       the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to       a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to       recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said:       ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman       from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to       yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first       recognition.''        The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous       question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an       immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no       substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.''       But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the       Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in       the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition,       page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous       question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally       not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member       controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of       offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by       voting down the previous question on the rule. . . . When the       motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the       time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering       the previous question. That Member, because he then controls       the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for       the purpose of amendment.''        In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of       Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special       Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on       such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on       Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further       debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues:       ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a       resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control       shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous       question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who       controls the time for debate thereon.''        Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does       have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only       available tools for those who oppose the Republican       majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the       opportunity to offer an alternative plan.     Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I  move the previous question on the resolution.    Mr. Speaker, I have a motion at the desk.
