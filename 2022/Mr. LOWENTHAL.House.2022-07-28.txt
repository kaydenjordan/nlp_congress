 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 7283) to amend the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act to  make certain activities eligible for grants from the Abandoned Mine  Reclamation Fund, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 7283         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Safeguarding Treatment for       the Restoration of Ecosystems from Abandoned Mines Act'' or       the ``STREAM Act''.       SEC. 2. ACTIVITIES THAT ARE ELIGIBLE FOR GRANTS FROM THE                     ABANDONED MINE RECLAMATION FUND.         Section 40701(c) of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs       Act (30 U.S.C. 1231a(c)) is amended--        (1) by striking ``Grants under'' and inserting the       following:        ``(1) In general.--Except as provided in paragraph (2),       grants under''; and        (2) by adding at the end the following:        ``(2) Acid mine drainage abatement and treatment.--        ``(A) In general.--Not more than 30 percent of the total       amount of a grant made annually under subsection (b)(1) may       be retained by the recipient of the grant, if those amounts       are deposited into an acid mine drainage abatement and       treatment fund established under State law, from which       amounts (together with all interest earned on the amounts)       are expended by the State for the abatement of the causes and       the treatment of the effects of acid mine drainage resulting       from coal mining practices, including for the costs of       building, operating, maintaining, and rehabilitating acid       mine drainage treatment systems.        ``(B) Reporting requirements.--Each recipient of a grant       under subsection (b)(1) that deposits grant amounts into an       acid mine drainage abatement and treatment fund under       subparagraph (A) shall--        ``(i) offer amendments to the inventory maintained under       section 403(c) of the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation       Act of 1977 (30 U.S.C. 1233(c)) to reflect the use of the       amounts for acid mine drainage abatement and treatment; and        ``(ii) include in the annual grant report of the recipient       information on the status and balance of amounts in the acid       mine drainage abatement and treatment fund.        ``(C) Term.--Amounts retained under subparagraph (A) shall       not be subject to--        ``(i) subsection (d)(4)(B); or        ``(ii) any other limitation on the length of the term of an       annual grant under subsection (b)(1).''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in  [[Page H7396]]  which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous  material on the measure under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 7283, the Safeguarding  Treatment for the Restoration of Ecosystems from Abandoned Mines Act,  or the STREAM Act, introduced by our colleague, Representative  Cartwright of Pennsylvania.   The STREAM Act makes a technical correction to existing Federal law  so that States and Tribes can use a portion of the $11.3 billion that  Congress has already appropriated for abandoned coal mine cleanup to  restore streams that are polluted by acid mine drainage.   Acid mine drainage is heavily polluted water that flows out of  abandoned coal mines into streams, making them toxic to all wildlife  and often turning them a bright and unnatural orange.   Acid mine drainage renders streams biologically dead. They become  unusable, undrinkable, unfishable, and unswimmable. It also severely  limits a region's potential economic growth.                                time  1615    Thankfully, we know how to clean up this type of mining pollution,  and we know that doing so will bring enormous benefits to impacted  communities.   Investments made by existing Federal law for cleaning up abandoned  coal mines are expected to create over 4,000 jobs a year over the next  15 years. That is 60,000 new, good-paying jobs in communities left  behind by the coal industry.   Cleaning up acid mine drainage also restores natural areas and brings  back wildlife. Under the existing Abandoned Mine Land Program run by  the Department of the Interior, eligible States and Tribes can set  aside 30 percent of their annual funding allocations to cover the long- term costs of operating acid mine drainage treatment facilities.   Unfortunately, newer Federal law passed in this Congress does not  currently give States and Tribes the same authority for the $11.3  billion in supplemental funds.   The STREAM Act corrects this situation, giving States and Tribes the  same flexibility to treat this devastating issue with legislation that  has been passed in this Congress that they have had under the standard  program for years.   I want to emphasize that this legislation does not--I repeat, does  not--affect funding levels for any State. It simply changes the way  that States may choose to use funds, depending on their individual  needs when it comes to acid mine drainage.   The STREAM Act has strong bipartisan support. This legislation passed  out of committee with strong bipartisan support and is endorsed by  Governors, environmental groups, and the Interstate Mining Compact  Commission.   I include in the Record some testimony in support of the STREAM Act  from the Interstate Mining Compact Commission and letters of support  from Governor Mike DeWine of Ohio, Governor Jim Justice of West  Virginia, the Maryland Department of the Environment, the Illinois  Department of Natural Resources, and Trout Unlimited.                                          Office of the Governor,                                       Columbus, OH, April 25, 2022.      Hon. Raul M. Grijalva,      Chair, Natural Resources Committee,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Bruce Westerman,      Ranking Member, House Natural Resources Committee, House of           Representatives, Washington DC.        Dear Chairman Grijalva and Ranking Member Westerman: I am       writing to ask for your support of H.R. 7283, the       Safeguarding Treatment for the Restoration of Ecosystems from       Abandoned Mines Act (STREAMS), and its companion bill, S.       3957. These bills clarify that states with acid mine drainage       (AMD) set-aside programs can deposit a portion of the       Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) Abandoned Mine       Land (AML) grant funds into AMD set-aside accounts. The       authority to do so will improve our nation's water quality.        Ohio has a rich history of mining that began more than 200       years ago when the state was still a territory. It is, in       part, thanks to Ohio's miners and coal resources that the       industrial revolution grew. During the 19th and 20th       Centuries, more than 3.6 billion tons of coal were extracted       from Ohio, and, while mining has been an integral part of       Ohio's past economic prosperity, the after-effects of coal       production still endure.        Although laws and regulations on proper mining practices       and reclamation exist today, that wasn't the case for the       first 100 years of coal mining. Prior to the enactment of our       nation's first mining laws in 1977, mines were often left       abandoned and unreclaimed as mining companies moved on to the       next site. Thousands of abandoned underground mines exist in       Ohio and pose significant geologic hazards, as the acids that       discharge from mined rock leech into our streams and other       waterways.        Thankfully, funding mechanisms have been put in place to       confront this challenge. The IIJA includes $11.3 billion in       new funding for AML reclamation. These funds will       significantly increase states' ability to address legacy       safety and environmental hazards of coal mining.        An important aspect of restoring abandoned mine lands is       remediating acid mine drainage (AMD), which is caused by       surface water flowing over or through mined rock, making the       water highly acidic. AMD is addressed by building water       treatment systems to neutralize acidic water and remove       dissolved metals that harm water quality in streams and       rivers.        However, addressing AMD is different than the safety       hazards caused by AML, because a safety hazard can be       effectively eliminated through a one-time construction       project, but AMD requires a treatment system to be operated,       maintained, and rehabilitated in perpetuity for it to remain       effective. Accordingly, each AMD treatment system that a       state builds represents a long-term liability that must be       funded.        Ohio currently operates and maintains 33 treatment systems       with plans to establish more, and unfortunately, the IIJA       does not provide the ability to set aside a portion of the       funds made available for ongoing AMD remediation. Without       this authority, it will be extremely difficult to responsibly       build the treatment systems necessary to make significant       improvements in water quality that has been harmed by       abandoned coal mines.        H.R. 7283 and S. 3957 would clarify that states with       approved AMD set-aside programs can deposit up to 30% of       annual IIJA grant funds into the AMD set-aside account. This       legislation is imperative to Ohio, along with 10 other states       in the Appalachian and the Midwest regions who are committed       to addressing the legacy safety and environmental hazards of       coal mining.        As the 2021 Chair of the Interstate Mining Compact       Commission and former co-chair of the Appalachian Regional       Commission, I can attest to the importance of this       legislation in addressing water quality issues resulting from       abandoned mines in Ohio. The legislation provides the       flexibility and long-term financial stability necessary to       plan, design, build, operate and maintain critical acid mine       drainage treatment systems.        Again, I ask for your support of this important       legislation. Thank you for your attention to this issue.            Very respectfully yours,                                                       Mike DeWine,      Governor.                                   ____                                          Office of the Governor,                                       Charleston, WV, May 31, 2022.      Hon. Joe Manchin III,      U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Shelley Moore Capito,      U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.      Hon. David McKinley,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Alex Mooney,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Carol Miller,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Members of Congress: I am writing to you today on a       matter that urgently needs your attention. As many of you       know, the recently adopted Bipartisan Infrastructure Law       transfers $11.3 billion from the federal treasury to the       Abandoned Mine Lands (AML) trust fund. State AML programs use       this fund to address the adverse impacts from the centuries       of unregulated coal mining that took place prior to the       adoption of the federal Surface Mining Control and       Reclamation Act in 1977. This additional money will be       monumental to West Virginia's AML program, and AML programs       across the country, as we work together to eliminate safety       and environmental hazards caused by abandoned mines.        While we applaud the passage of the historic Infrastructure       Law, we want to call on our congressional leaders to pass the       recently introduced legislation that will allow states to       move a portion of the treasury funds into their Acid Mine       Drainage (AMD) Set Aside funds. This authority will provide       West Virginia and other states with even more resources to       address the impacts from mining's early years.        A key component in addressing AML sites in West Virginia       and the surrounding region has been building water treatment       systems to remediate AMD. Treating AMD presents a bigger       challenge than addressing safety hazards, which can often be       eliminated through  [[Page H7397]]       one-time construction projects. Once an AMD treatment system       is built, additional funding is needed for operations and       maintenance, so it remains effective. The expenses of this       work go on in perpetuity.        Historically, state AML programs have been funded through       grants from the AML trust fund and fees collected from coal       production. The federal AML program allows states to set       aside 30 percent of its grant funding into an interest-      bearing account to cover the long-term cost of treating AMD.       Although the Infrastructure Law authorizes continuation of       collection of AML fees on coal production and the authority       to set aside 30 percent of grant funds, it does not allow       states to set aside a portion of the treasury funds. The       ability to use these funds to cover the long-term costs of       treating AMD will be vital to keeping that burden off future       generations.        Much like traditional AML projects, treating AMD benefits       both the environment and the economy. Building and operating       AMD treatment systems helps facilitate the creation of       permanent jobs while cleaning up our rivers and streams--a       true win-win for all West Virginians.        Over the past four years, people from across the country       and all over the world have finally discovered what a great       place West Virginia is to live, work, and play. They want to       kayak and fish in our pristine waters and hike in our       beautiful mountains.        Passing this legislation will ensure that West Virginia's       resources will be protected and enjoyed by all citizens for       years to come.            Sincerely,                                                       Jim Justice,      Governor.                                   ____                                               Maryland Department of                                                 the Environment,                                        Baltimore, MD, May 10, 2022.      Hon. Chris Van Hollen,      U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.        Dear Senator Van Hollen: I am writing to ask for your       support of S. 3957, the Safeguarding Treatment for the       Restoration of Ecosystems from Abandoned Mines Act (STREAMS),       and its companion bill, H.R. 7283. These bills clarify that       states with acid mine drainage (AMD) set-aside programs, like       Maryland, can deposit a portion of the Infrastructure       Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA), Abandoned Mine Land (AML)       grant funds into state's AMD set-aside accounts. This       authority will improve our nation's water quality by       providing funding for AMD treatment projects as well as the       long-term operation and maintenance of treatment systems.        Western Maryland has a rich history of coal mining that       began more than 250 years ago and helped fuel the industrial       revolution. Hundreds of millions of tons of coal were mined       prior to the passage of state and federal laws requiring land       and water reclamation. The Surface Mining Control and       Reclamation Act (SMCRA or the Act) of 1977 instituted       national mining and reclamation standards that have reduced       environmental impacts from modern coal mining. SMCRA also       created the Abandoned Mine Reclamation Fund, by taxing coal       production, to address the legacy of health, safety, and       environmental hazards that existed prior to passage of the       Act.        The IIJA has significantly increased funding available for       AML programs by depositing $11.3 billion into the Abandoned       Mine Reclamation Fund to address the myriad of legacy health,       safety, and environmental hazards of coal mining.        An important aspect to restoring abandoned mines is       remediating AMD, which is caused by groundwater and surface       water flowing through abandoned deep mines and surface mines       resulting in very acidic water with high concentrations of       dissolved metals. Maryland currently has 60 AMD treatment       systems that have improved or restored over 100 miles of       stream, but hundreds of miles of streams remain degraded.       Treating AMD is costly and requires long-term funding for       operation and maintenance of the treatment systems. Without       continued funding for operation and maintenance, the       improvements will quickly be lost as the streams revert to       their pretreatment status.        S. 3957 and H.R. 7283 would clarify that states with       approved AMD set-aside programs can deposit up to 30% of       annual IIJA grant funds into the AMD set-aside account. This       legislation is imperative to Maryland, along with 10 other       states in the Appalachian and the Midwest regions who are       committed to addressing the legacy of coal mining. The       legislation provides the flexibility and long-term financial       stability necessary to plan, design, build, operate, and       maintain critical acid mine drainage treatment systems.        Thank you for your attention to this important issue of       improving water quality in Maryland and ask for your support       of this legislation.            Sincerely,                                                      Tyler Abbott,      Chief of Staff.                                   ____                                               Illinois Department of                                               Natural Resources,                              Springfield, Illinois, April 21, 2022.      Hon. Richard Durbin,      Washington, DC.        Dear Senator Durbin: The Abandoned Mine Land (AML) program       for the state of Illinois is under the purview of the       Illinois Department of Natural Resources. I am writing to       express our continuing strong support for the AML program       under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977       (SMCRA).        As you may know, Section 40701 of the recently adopted       Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL) transfers funds to the       Illinois Abandoned Mine Lands (AML) Division for use in       addressing the adverse impacts of coal mining that preceeded       SMCRA. An important aspect of the work is the remediation of       acid mine drainage (AMD). Treatment of AMD requires the       construction, operation, maintenance and rehabilitation of a       treatment system to remain effective, resulting in a long-      term liability. The historic fee-based AML program allows up       to 30 percent of its annual AML grant in an interest-bearing       account to cover the long-term costs of AMD. However, the BIL       does not confer parallel authority. Without this authority,       the amount available for long-term liabilities will dwindle,       thereby limiting AMD treatment.        Therefore, I am requesting your support for S. 3957, to       amend the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act to make       certain activities eligible for grants from the Abandoned       Mine Reclamation Fund, which was introduced by Senator Bob       Casey and Senator Mike Braun to allow not more than 30       percent of the total amount of the BIL grant to be deposited       into an AMD fund.        I have attached a summary about the importance of the AMD       Set Aside Authority and S. 3957, STREAM Act. Should you have       any questions or require additional information about the       valuable work our state has undertaken, please contact Lance       Range, Acting Manager of the Division of AML.        Thank you for your consideration of this request to protect       the physical, environmental, and economic health of the       people of Illinois.            Sincerely,                                                  Colleen Callahan,      Director.                                   ____                                                 Trout Unlimited,                                        Arlington, VA, June 8, 2022.      Re Trout Unlimited supports H.R. 7283, Safeguarding Treatment           for the Restoration of Ecosystems from Abandoned Mines           Act (the STREAM Act).       Hon. Alan Lowenthal,      Chair, House Natural Resources Committee, Environment and           Mineral Resources Subcommittee.      Hon. Pete Stauber,      Ranking Member, House Natural Resources Committee,           Environment and Mineral Resources Subcommittee.        Chair Lowenthal, Ranking Member Stauber and Members of the       Subcommittee: On behalf of our 300,000 members and supporters       nationwide, Trout Unlimited (TU) writes in support of the       bipartisan Safeguarding Treatment for the Restoration of       Ecosystems from Abandoned Mines Act (STREAM Act) to finance       long term cleanup of abandoned coal mines. This bill will       help finance and sustain the outstanding work that is       happening in coal country to clean up pernicious pollution       from abandoned coal mines. It will extend and enhance the       great value of the AML provisions of the Infrastructure       Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) by assuring projects completed       using those funds will continue to provide restoration in       perpetuity.        Abandoned Mine Drainage (AMO) treatment is often addressed       by building water treatment systems, which result in ongoing       Operation Maintenance and Replacement (OMR) costs that endure       in perpetuity. However, states often lack the financial       ability to support these types of long-term liabilities. If       enacted, H.R. 7283 would allow for up to 30 percent of a       state's annual allocation for Abandoned Mineland (AML)       reclamation under IIJA to be deposited into an interest-      bearing account to provide for the perpetual OMR expenses of       facilities to treat AMO. This language mirrors the authority       of current state programs that allow a 30 percent set-aside       from the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act's (SMCRA)       AML Trust Fund. This approach will help to ensure that       projects funded by the IIJA will have funds for this       necessary long-term OM&R expense, thereby sustaining long       term the thousands of stream miles that will be restored by       AMO treatment.        A recent study by TU demonstrated the long-term benefits of       ongoing cleanup work funded by SMCRA's AML Fund, recently       reauthorized and expanded substantially by the IIJA. On the       West Branch of the Susquehanna River in Pennsylvania, thanks       to AML funding and well-crafted projects by watershed groups,       the state, and Trout Unlimited, we are seeing watershed scale       benefits--hundreds of miles of stream and mainstem river       restored, recreation rejuvenated, jobs created, and       watersheds made more resilient and better able to withstand       the impacts of a changing climate. And this is but one       example of this restoration occurring throughout Appalachia,       much of it in areas rendered dead by mining that occurred       decades to over a hundred years ago.        Without the authority to set aside IIJA monies for the       perpetual Operation Maintenance and Replacement of these       facilities, communities and ecosystems impacted by legacy       mining issues are given the gift of restoration with no       certainty that it will continue in perpetuity. This       legislation provides a critical piece of the puzzle assuring  [[Page H7398]]       that future generations will continue to reap these benefits.        Thank you for taking up this important legislation and for       considering our views. We look forward to working with bill       sponsors and members of the committee to advance this bill       into law.            Sincerely,                                                       Steve Moyer,                              Vice President of Government Affairs.     Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague, Representative  Cartwright, for introducing this important bipartisan legislation and  working to build such an impressive coalition of support. I urge my  colleagues to vote ``yes'' on H.R. 7283, and I reserve the balance of  my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to  the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Cartwright).    Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests at this time.  I am prepared to close, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 5093) to direct the Secretary of Agriculture to transfer  certain National Forest System land in the State of Washington to  Skamania County, Washington, as amended.

SEC. 4. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS.         The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the measure under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5093, the Wind River  Administrative Site Conveyance Act. This bill would authorize the U.S.  Forest Service to convey a 23.4-acre portion of the Wind River Nursery  to Skamania County, Washington.   Congress authorized a land exchange that included a large portion of  the Wind River Nursery in 2001. The conveyance authorized by this  legislation will complete the transfer and place the entire Wind River  property under the stewardship of the county.   This legislation will allow the Skamania County Board of  Commissioners to continue rehabilitation of the buildings and the  grounds in the Wind River Historic District.   The bill also includes important and routine safeguards so the  property will continue to be managed in a manner that ensures the  preservation of its historic characteristics.   I thank the gentlewoman from Washington (Ms. Herrera Beutler) for  introducing this important legislation and championing this bill on  behalf of her constituents.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this bill, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for time. I am  prepared to close, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.
