 Mr. Speaker, the Biden administration has now issued at  least 42 executive actions, including 25 executive orders, by far the  most of any President during this span. Clearly, all his rhetoric about  unity is, to use his favorite word, malarkey.   This week, the President signed three more executive orders to  destroy progress we have made on immigration and border security.   He reversed President Trump's public charge rule. That rule prevented  immigrants likely to rely on social welfare programs--paid for by you  and me, the taxpayer--from accessing green cards.  [[Page H459]]    Asylum seekers will no longer be required to wait in Mexico while  being processed, which is a commonsense deterrent against dubious  asylum claims. Instead, it just waves them right in, with a backlog  already of years on asylum hearings.   This power has been transferred from the proper agencies now to the  White House, where immigration no doubt will be politicized.   Americans are suffering. Many need work because their jobs have been  shut down due to the corona China virus.   How can we justify closing our schools and businesses but putting our  borders wide open?   If the President wants to heal this Nation, he must pull together for  the needs of struggling Americans, not these others.                            ____________________
