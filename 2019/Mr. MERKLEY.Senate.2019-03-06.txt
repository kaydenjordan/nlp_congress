 I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum  call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my intern,  Mariah Shriner, may have privileges of the floor for the balance of the  day.    Mr. President, I am pleased to be here on the floor with  my colleague from New Mexico, who has been a champion for restoring our  democracy, working year after year over the last decade toward that  vision, and presenting tonight superb comments on the history of where  we have been and where we should go.   This last weekend, I went to Alabama. I went with Congressman   John  Lewis to be there to look into the history of discrimination in our  Nation, the history in which we had separate entries to buildings for  Whites and for Blacks and separate water fountains. We had front doors  for White America and back doors for Black America.   We were standing on the spot where Rosa Parks stood before she  stepped onto the bus and said: I will not sit at the back of the bus. I  will be treated like every other American. She asked for equality, and  she started a big movement to break down discrimination.   Last weekend, we also gathered together in Selma, AL, at the foot of  the Edmund Pettus Bridge. This spot is where   John Lewis and a whole  set of individuals took a stand. They were planning a march. They were  going to march for voting rights--for voting rights in America, voting  rights that had been taken away as a strategy of suppressing the voice  of the people, particularly the voice of African Americans.   We have struggled in the history of our country toward full equality  of opportunity--full equality to participate in this beautiful  democratic Republic we call America. We started with a Constitution  that was flawed by not recognizing the full equality of every American.   We fought a war over slavery, and after that war, a strategy was  devised to continue to strip the right to vote from African Americans  by taking African-American men, arresting them as felons, and then  saying that felons can't vote--a determined strategy both to reenslave,  because the constitutional amendment said that you could put people to  work if they were a felon, and to strip voting rights from them.   That is a history we should be putting behind us--a history of voter  intimidation and a history of voter suppression. Have we not come to  the point where we can recognize that the real vision in our ``we the  people'' democracy is that every person gets a full chance to  participate, that we should be looking for voter empowerment, not voter  suppression?   This beautiful document we have worked to perfect and fulfill over  time. It was President Lincoln who said: ``America will never be  destroyed from the outside. If we falter and lose our freedoms, it will  be because we destroyed ourselves.''   Aren't we at that point now, where the vision of government of, by,  and for the people has been corrupted by voter suppression, by voter  intimidation, by gerrymandering, and by dark money flooding our  campaigns? Aren't we at that point now that our very essence of our  constitutional vision of government by and for the people is being  destroyed by these corrupting forces?   Here is what we have in America right now. We have a circle of power  of those of great wealth and those of great privilege, and they want to  run this government and write our laws to benefit those inside that  circle.   That circle isn't that large. It is a small percent of our  population, but they use their great wealth and their great leverage to  continue to corrupt the vision of our Constitution because the last  thing they want is a government that serves the people.   What they are invested in, what they fight for is government by the  powerful few and for the powerful few. If anyone has any doubt that we  have reached this point of huge corruption in this country, look simply  at what happened in this Chamber in 2017 when the majority party said  that we have two missions: Mission one, take down healthcare for 20 to  30 million Americans; mission two, raid the national Treasury for $1\1/ 2\ trillion and give it to the very richest Americans and largest  corporations.   That is what happens in a corrupted government by and for the  powerful rather than by and for the people. That is what happens in  dictatorships around the world where the elite raid the National  Treasury and steal the money for themselves.   I will tell you what else happens. They don't invest in ``we the  people.'' They don't invest in the foundations for families to thrive.  We know what those foundations are: good public education, debt-free  college, employment programs that include apprenticeships and career  technical education, a healthcare system that is simple and seamless  and is there when your loved one is sick or injured, and it doesn't  send you into bankruptcy, a system where drug companies can't gouge you  and raise their prices dozens or even a hundredfold because the laws  were written to let them do it, a system that invests in affordable  housing so every family can have a decent home in a decent community,  investment in infrastructure, rural broadband, repaired highways,  expanded transit systems, all kinds of infrastructure that enable our  economy to thrive and our people to do well.   Did we see what this corrupted system now in place of government by  and for the powerful, did we see an investment in healthcare or housing  or education or infrastructure or living-wage  [[Page S1715]]  jobs? We did not because this Chamber is now run by and for the  powerful of the United States of America, not the people.   So along comes the other Chamber at the end of this hall, and this  other Chamber says: We want to restore the vision of our Constitution,  and they put together H. Res. 1. They said: Let's take this on. Let's  take on the gerrymandering. Let's take on the voter suppression. Let's  take on the dark money. They put together this bill for the people--for  the people, not for the powerful.   They proceeded to say: Let's start with that challenge of  gerrymandering. Let's make sure the people pick their leaders instead  of their leaders picking their electors. Then they proceed to take on  voter suppression and voter intimidation.   It was President Lyndon Johnson who said ``the vote is the most  powerful instrument ever devised by man for breaking down injustice.''   That powerful instrument is at the heart of our Constitution. It is  the instrument that the powerful and privileged want to diminish,  destroy, and take away so they can continue to run this country by and  for themselves.   So this bill says: Let's proceed to do voter empowerment. Let's  extend early voting to all States. Let's ensure that there is an  opportunity for people to register to vote, sign up to vote on the  internet, and have same-day registration. Let's encourage vote by mail,  which gives a full opportunity for everyone to participate without  having to get to a poll on a day that it is difficult to get there, and  let's make sure changes designed to suppress voting are not  automatically approved, that we will restore the Voting Rights Act,  which said we will protect the voting system, its sacred heart, the  Constitution, and we will not let people's rights be stripped away.   If you look back at November 6, and you look at what happened across  the country, you see the plot--the plot to prevent the poor from  voting; the plot to prevent minorities from voting; the plot to prevent  college students from voting. One State went so far as to say you can't  vote if your ID doesn't have an expiration date because the college IDs  in that State didn't have an expiration date--strategy after strategy,  purging people off the voting rolls without their permission right  before the election.   So this bill, the For the People Act that the House is working on  right now and that we will introduce right here in this Chamber says:  We believe in the Constitution of America; we believe in the power of  the people, and we will protect the right to vote. The For the People  Act takes on campaign finance. It proceeds to say: We will have  disclosure of contributions. There is sunlight on the system that  disinfects it--a phrase that so many of my colleagues used to say when  they were opposing the McCain-Feingold limits. They said: We oppose  caps on donations, but we support disclosure. It is the sunshine that  disinfects the system. Suddenly, when the bill that provides disclosure  was up before this body, the individuals who said that said: ``Oh, I  was wrong, I don't want sunlight in the system,'' and voted against  disclosure. So the House is saying: Let's do it. Let's create  transparency.   There is an honest ads component that says people need to be able to  know who is funding the ads they are seeing. I know I have seen in my  campaigns, attack ad, after attack ad, after attack ad funded by front  groups.   Wouldn't it be better for America if the folks behind those ads  actually have to disclose that they are behind those ads?   We have in this bill a small-dollar match so individuals who seek to  run for the House or the Senate with small-dollar donations, donations  up to $200, get a 6-to-1 match, encouraging breaking the grip of the  vast dark money and the money that comes from the most affluent in  large chunks, leveling the playing field for participation by regular  Americans, freeing our elections from the grip of dark money.   This bill, the For the People Act, says let's improve the ethics.  Let's reduce or try to eliminate the conflicts of interest that haunt  this Chamber and haunt the House Chamber down the hall.     John Lewis stood on that bridge on Bloody Sunday. Congressman    John Lewis, long before he was a Congressman, in 1965, stood on that  bridge. He stood, and he was the very first person in line as the  troops approached to beat up the protesters. They shoved him, they  pushed him down, they struck him in the head, and then they proceeded  to beat up and terrify the other protesters on that bridge.   Those protesters were standing for the vision of our Constitution,  were standing for voting rights, the most powerful instrument, as  Lyndon Johnson said.   They went back to that bridge the following Tuesday, and they marched  up and were stopped, and they agreed to turn back--``Turn Back  Tuesday.'' Then they reorganized again and more people joined. They  came back a third time and they marched over that bridge and they  marched all the way to Montgomery, AL, to fight for voting rights  because it is the heart and soul of an individual's ability to  participate in our democracy.   John Lewis has said this:         There is still work to be done. Get out there, push and       pull, until we redeem the soul of America.    The For the People Act that the House will pass and that we will  introduce here in this Chamber is the fight to redeem the soul of  America. Let's stand together--old-timers and new Members of the  Senate, those who sit on the left of the aisle and those who sit on the  right of the aisle, those who come from blue-collar communities and  those who come from circles of power--to stand behind the vision of our  Constitution, the ``we the people'' vision, so this Chamber will do the  work of the people. Let's restore the soul of America together.   I yield the floor.
