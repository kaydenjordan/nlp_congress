 Madam President, I call up amendment No. 5480, and I ask  that it be reported by number.    Madam President, this amendment is actually quite simple.  It is to make sure that we have a comprehensive plan in place before  title 42 is lifted. Very straightforward. This is not whether title 42  should ever be lifted or not; rather, it is about making sure that we  are doing the right thing at the right time, which I believe is when  the COVID-19 national emergency is lifted and when we have a plan in  place.   I would urge a ``yea'' vote.    Madam President, before I make my motion, I would just  say we were here earlier this week on a different bill that had nothing  to do with the Budget Act.   Madam President, pursuant to section 904 of the Congressional Budget  Act of 1974, I move to waive section 313 of that act for the purpose of  this provision, and I would ask for the yeas and nays.
