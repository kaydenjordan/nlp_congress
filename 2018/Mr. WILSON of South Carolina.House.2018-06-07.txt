 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to clause 1, rule  I, I demand a vote on agreeing to the Speaker's approval of the  Journal.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas  and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, last month, I visited  Dempsey Wood Products in Orangeburg, South Carolina, to get a firsthand  look at the positive impacts of the tax cuts creating jobs.   Owner Parker Dempsey explained that they were able to expand their  business due to the tax cuts. Dempsey Wood Products will be able to  launch a $15 million project, creating jobs.   Mr. Dempsey explained that: ``. . . we will have new equipment and  the best technology. The plan is to get it up and going and start a  second shift, and probably add another 40 jobs.''   Since President Donald Trump took office, the economy has created  nearly  [[Page H4859]]  3 million jobs. The numbers of employed persons are the highest ever in  the United States. The unemployment rate has fallen to 3.8 percent,  matching the lowest level in 50 years. African American and Hispanic  unemployment rates have reached record lows, and the unemployment rate  for women has fallen to the lowest level since 1953.   The National Federation of Independent Business, NFIB, small business  optimism index is at one of the highest levels in 45 years. I  appreciate the leadership of NFIB Director Ben Homeyer.   In conclusion, God bless our troops and we will never forget  September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.                            ____________________
