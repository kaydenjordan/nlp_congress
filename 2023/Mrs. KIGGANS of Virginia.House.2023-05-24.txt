 Mr. Speaker, over the past 2 years, our  Hampton Roads and Navy communities have been devastated by multiple  sailor suicides, in particular aboard the USS George Washington and at  MARMAC.   As a former Navy helicopter pilot and nurse practitioner, it  frustrates me that the number of sailors who die by suicide continues  to rise. It is clear for anyone to see we have to do better to serve  those serving our great country.   That is why last week I introduced the Sailor Standard of Care Act.  This important bipartisan legislation would increase mental health  resources and require mental health screenings for sailors assigned to  limited duty, address challenges servicemembers and their families face  accessing quality mental health care through TRICARE, implement a  system to track quality-of-life programs and their success rate, and  expedite the Navy's medical separation process that impacts limited- duty sailors.   It is imperative that we address the mental health and other quality- of-life challenges facing Active Duty servicemembers and veterans. This  is exactly why I came to Congress. We speak so much about providing our  military men and women with the necessary equipment, technology,  training, et cetera, to be ready to fight tonight, and rightfully so,  but we must take care of our people, too.   It is time for Congress to focus on quality-of-life issues for our  men and women in uniform and their families--not only mental health  care, but housing, childcare, and spouse employment support. There is  so much work to do.   By doing so, we will not only do right by the men and women who make  up our world's finest fleet, but we will also keep our Navy the best in  the world.                            ____________________
