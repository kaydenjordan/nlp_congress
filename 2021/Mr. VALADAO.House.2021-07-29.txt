 Madam Speaker, I rise today to express my extreme  disappointment in the majority's unwillingness to address the western  drought.   A couple weeks ago, I introduced three amendments to the Energy and  Water Appropriations bill, each of which would make strides toward  alleviating the devastating drought in California.   My first amendment, which would extend funding authorizations for  water storage projects under the WIIN Act for 1 year, would allow  California to make the most of our wet years and ensure families and  farmers have a clean, reliable source of water in times of drought. My  colleagues in the majority voted ``no.''   My second amendment would codify the 2019 Biological Opinions,  following the most accurate and best available science. Following the  science and putting the needs of people before fish should really be a  no-brainer. My colleagues in the majority voted ``no.''   My third amendment would create a grant program to fund the  acceleration and completion of repairs to damaged canal infrastructure  facilities to enable farmers to comply with State pumping limits. My  colleagues in the majority voted ``no.''   Real people need our help, and it is clear the majority is unwilling  to provide it. I will not stop fighting to bring a solution to the  Central Valley.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Arkansas for  yielding.   Madam Speaker, I rise today to express my frustration with the  majority's unwillingness to get involved in drought recovery and  prevention in the Western United States.   I am frustrated that my colleagues in the majority care so little  about real people suffering from a lack of water. Some of my  constituents have been forced to bathe with bottled water. Some of my  constituents have been forced to abandon entire fields of crops because  they simply don't have enough water for them. Some of my constituents  can't drink the little water they have in their wells because the water  contains arsenic and isn't safe to drink.   Madam Speaker, this isn't a looming crisis. We are in the middle of a  crisis. I am here today with several of my colleagues in the minority,  most of which that hail from the Western States, and I know they share  the same frustration as me.   We have repeatedly called for hearings to be called on the Western  drought, with no answer from the majority. We have tirelessly written  letters to Biden administration officials and Western Governors  requesting help, with no backing from the majority. We have introduced  bills and put forward amendments to help prevent future droughts, with  no consideration from the majority.   Madam Speaker, how many times do we have to tell our colleagues in  the majority that my constituents and the constituents of many of my  colleagues here today are hurting?   We are tirelessly trying to bring action in every way possible. We  just ask that you work with us to get it done. This shouldn't be  political. This is about real people and the desperate need for access  to clean and reliable water.   Madam Speaker, this isn't the first time you have heard from me on  this issue, and it certainly will not be the last.
