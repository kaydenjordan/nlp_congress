 Mr. Speaker, tomorrow, this House, the people's House,  will vote to take the first step in a blindly ideological crusade to  break our entire healthcare system and rip health insurance away from  more than 20 million Americans.   Repeal would cripple our Nation's hospitals and create a $723 million  budget shortfall in my congressional district alone, resulting in  countless job losses across our great country. Repeal would return  everyone to the days of big insurance companies and their denying of  needed care due to annual and lifetime limits on coverage. Repeal would  mean higher costs for individuals who seek routine preventative care,  like mammograms or birth control.   This is not what the people want. People are sick and tired of  Republicans playing political games with their health care. The  Affordable Care Act is not perfect. Deductibles, out-of-pocket costs,  and prescription drug prices are still too high for many working  families. People are frustrated when they are faced with narrow  networks or surprise medical bills.   Unfortunately, these are not the problems that Republicans are  focused on fixing. In fact, the only problem Republicans seem to be  trying to solve is that too many people have health insurance.  Republicans want to roll back the progress that has been made and  create a healthcare system that eliminates the guarantees of affordable  coverage, by which families will face even higher deductibles and  copays--a concept they euphemistically call ``skin in the game,'' and  those with preexisting conditions, including expectant mothers, would  again face a closed door instead of care.                            ____________________
