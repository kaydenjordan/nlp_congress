 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the dramatic  struggle for freedom and human rights that we are witnessing in the  country of Iran.   The oppressive, theocratic regime in Iran has a bloody track record  of abuses and has long neglected its citizens' most basic rights and  needs.   The Government of Iran has squandered the precious resources of its  people by supporting proxy armies throughout the Middle East and  wreaking havoc across the globe instead of providing for the basic  needs of its citizens. Courageous Iranians are proving each day that  they are no longer willing to accept the indignities and repression  from the ruling elite.   It is tragic, but not shocking, to see the regime in Iran respond to  the recent wave of protests with violence, cutting off communications,  media, and, predictably, blaming the United States of America.   I am a cosponsor of H. Res. 676, a resolution passed by the House of  Representatives yesterday in support of the rights of the people of  Iran to express themselves freely, and condemning the oppressive  Iranian regime for its crackdown on legitimate protests.   I stand with the brave Iranians who are facing down the violent and  brutal regime for the sake of liberty.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 6 o'clock and 55 minutes  p.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until tomorrow,  Thursday, January 11, 2018, at 9 a.m.                            ____________________
