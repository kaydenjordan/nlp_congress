 Mr. Speaker, young Americans vote at the lowest  rates of any age group, and this is rooted in the unique obstacles  faced by college students. When students move to a new campus, often in  a new State, having never voted or even registered to vote, they lack  the institutional support to help them navigate the voting process.   That is why Senator Booker and I have introduced the Help Students  Vote Act. Our legislation will take  [[Page H3494]]  three major steps in eliminating the obstacles students face in voting.   First, it requires every college and university to send voter  registration information to all its students twice a year, at least 30  days before registration deadlines.   Second, it requires every school to designate a campus vote  coordinator to answer students' questions about voting and to promote  voting.   And third, it encourages civic engagement by authorizing grants to  colleges and universities that take exemplary action to promote  political participation.   The Help Students Vote Act is essential and will help our country  better engage the next generations of American citizens.                            ____________________
