 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from the Sunshine State  of Florida for yielding, and I am so grateful that we have been able to  find some areas of common ground in this Congress on the issue of  cannabis reform.   I am very proud, Mr. Speaker, to announce that, in the coming days, I  will be joining the Judiciary chairman, the gentleman from Virginia  (Mr. Goodlatte), in introducing legislation that enjoys support from  across the ideological spectrum, and it will do several important  things:   First, it will increase the number of people who are growing medical- grade cannabis for research purposes.   Second, it will end the gag rule at the VA that precludes physicians  from being able to consult and speak with their patients about the laws  in their particular States.   Third, it will create a safe harbor so that some of the finest  medical institutions and universities in this great country will be  able to research and partner with private sector entities to determine  the potential that medical cannabis can have to improve people's  quality of life.   And finally, this legislation will end the prohibition from having  commercial, for-profit entities working in concert, in collaboration  with some of those very universities and medical institutions.   So my hope is that by focussing first on the issues that bring us  together, we will be able to advance legislation to democratize medical  cannabis research, and that, ultimately, can unlock cures and unlock  potential for a generation of Americans that shouldn't be lied to by  their government about the potential health benefits of cannabis.
