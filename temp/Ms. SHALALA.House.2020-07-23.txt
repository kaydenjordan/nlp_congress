 Madam Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I  call up House Resolution 1060 and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 1060         Resolved, That upon adoption of this resolution it shall be       in order to consider in the House the bill (H.R. 7608) making       appropriations for the Department of State, foreign       operations, and related programs for the fiscal year ending       September 30, 2021, and for other purposes. All points of       order against consideration of the bill are waived. An       amendment in the nature of a substitute consisting of the       text of Rules Committee Print 116-59 shall be considered as       adopted. The bill, as amended, shall be considered as read.       All points of order against provisions in the bill, as       amended, are waived. Clause 2(e) of rule XXI shall not apply       during consideration of the bill. The previous question shall       be considered as ordered on the bill, as amended, and on any       further amendment thereto, to final passage without       intervening motion except: (1) one hour of debate equally       divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority       member of the Committee on Appropriations; (2) the further       amendments described in section 2 of this resolution; (3) the       amendments en bloc described in section 3 of this resolution;       and (4) one motion to recommit with or without instructions.        Sec. 2.  After debate pursuant to the first section of this       resolution, each further amendment printed in the report of       the Committee on Rules not earlier considered as part of       amendments en bloc pursuant to section 3 of this resolution       shall be considered only in the order printed in the report,       may be offered only by a Member designated in the report,       shall be considered as read, shall be debatable for the time       specified in the report equally divided and controlled by the       proponent and an opponent, may be withdrawn by the proponent       at any time before the question is put thereon, shall not be       subject to amendment, and shall not be subject to a demand       for division of the question.        Sec. 3.  It shall be in order at any time after debate       pursuant to the first section of this resolution for the       chair of the Committee on Appropriations or her designee to       offer amendments en bloc consisting of further amendments       printed in the report of the Committee on Rules accompanying       this resolution not earlier disposed of. Amendments en bloc       offered pursuant to this section shall be considered as read,       shall be debatable for 30 minutes equally divided and       controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the       Committee on Appropriations or their respective designees,       shall not be subject to amendment, and shall not be subject       to a demand for division of the question.

All points of order against the further amendments       printed in the report of the Committee on Rules or amendments       en bloc described in section 3 of this resolution are waived.        Sec. 5.  During consideration of the amendments described       in sections 2 and 3 of this resolution, it shall not be in       order to consider an amendment proposing both a decrease in       an appropriation designated pursuant to section       251(b)(2)(A)(ii) of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit       Control Act of 1985 and an increase in an appropriation not       so designated, or vice versa.     Madam Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield  the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Burgess),  pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During  consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose  of debate only.                                General Leave     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  be given 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Madam Speaker, on Wednesday, the Rules Committee met and  reported a rule, House Resolution 1060, providing for consideration of  H.R. 7608, the State, Foreign Operations, Agriculture, Rural  Development, Interior, Environment, Military Construction, and Veterans  Affairs Appropriations Act, 2021, under a structured rule.   The rule makes in order 132 amendments. The rule provides 1 hour of  debate, equally divided and controlled by the chair and the ranking  member of the Committee on Appropriations.   The rule provides that the chair of the Committee on Appropriations  or her designee may offer amendments en bloc, which will be debatable  for 30 minutes.   Finally, the rule provides one motion to recommit, with or without  instructions.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the bill in this  rule. This appropriations package provides urgent and essential  resources not only for the American people, but particularly for my  fellow Floridians.   Among its provisions, the State, Foreign Operations, and Related  Programs bill provides emergency funding for coronavirus preparedness,  response, and relief.   There is much we do not know about this virus. The one thing we do  know is that it respects no border. South Florida, which is now the  epicenter of this pandemic, and as the capital of the Americas, knows  all too well how diseases can spread. This emergency funding will save  lives both at home and abroad.   The SFOPS bill provides robust funding to advance our global  priorities and strengthens the international partnerships that are  critical to supporting American influence and effectiveness across the  globe. This includes specifically restoring funding for the World  Health Organization, which this administration has threatened and is  trying to cut off.  [[Page H3709]]    Nearly 150,000 Americans have, tragically, died from COVID-19. It is  more important than ever that we are able to share information, best  practices, and our skill and deep knowledge with our international  partners. Many of those international partners were trained at the  Centers for Disease Control over the years, and we simply can't afford  to play politics with WHO funding.   Madam Speaker, I led the American delegation to WHO for 8 years. I am  well aware of its limitations and its strengths. We need WHO more than  ever. And, as I said, this virus knows no borders.   Madam Speaker, this bill also supports the people of Venezuela in  their fight to restore democracy to their country. It includes an  amendment I filed with Representative Murphy that increases the funding  made available for programs to promote democracy and the rule of law in  Venezuela.   I am also very proud that this legislation provides security  assistance to our friends and ally Israel, fully funding our commitment  to Israel's security.   Madam Speaker, also in this package is the Agriculture, Rural  Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies bill.   In this country, no one should ever be hungry, especially children,  as this pandemic has made it only harder for hardworking families in my  district and across the country to put food on the table. This bill  provides robust funding for food and nutrition programs, which have  never been more important.   The bill provides for more than $25 billion in mandatory funding for  the child nutrition programs. This is an increase above the fiscal year  2020 enacted level, and the bill provides for $68 billion in required  mandatory spending for SNAP. This includes $3 billion for the SNAP  reserve fund.   As my friend Marian Wright Edelman once said: ``If we don't stand up  for children, then we don't stand for much.''   Madam Speaker, also in this package is the Interior, Environment, and  Related Agencies bill, which provides funding for meaningful action on  climate change and protects our environment. I am particularly proud of  the provisions that provide robust funding for the Department of the  Interior bureaus working together to restore the Everglades, including  the National Park Service, the Fish and Wildlife Service, and the South  Geographic Program.   Lastly, among its most important provisions, this package upholds our  commitment to our troops, investing in housing, in medical care, in  programs to reduce veteran homelessness.   Simply put, with this legislation, we are fulfilling our obligations  to our planet, to our American values, to our veterans, and to our  children.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  Mississippi (Mr. Thompson), the distinguished chairman of the Committee  on Homeland Security.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Lee).    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentlewoman from California.    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from California.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Maine (Mr. Golden).    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Florida  (Ms. Wasserman Schultz), the Subcommittee on Military Construction,  Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies chairwoman.    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Maine (Mr.  Golden).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Minnesota (Ms. McCollum).    Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close. I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   With this appropriations bill we are responding to the crisis of  today while preparing for tomorrow. Americans are out of work,  struggling to make ends meet as this virus wreaks havoc on our health,  on our healthcare system, and on our economy.   The American people deserve a funding bill that makes smart  investments, and this bill does just that. It addresses the hunger that  is plaguing working families. It increases broadband access. It  strengthens our international alliances. It combats climate change. It  increases funding to provide healthcare for veterans. This bill invests  in America and our collective future.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on the rule and the previous  question.   The text of the material previously referred to by Mr. Burgess is as  follows:                     Amendment to House Resolution 1060         At the end of the resolution, add the following:        Sec. 6. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution, the       House shall resolve into the Committee of the Whole House on       the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R.       7733) to authorize the imposition of sanctions with respect       to the deliberate concealment or distortion of information       about public health emergencies of international concern, and       for other purposes. All points of order against consideration       of the bill are waived. General debate shall be confined to       the bill and shall not exceed one hour equally divided and       controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the       Committee on Foreign Affairs. After general debate the bill       shall be considered for amendment under the five-minute rule.       All points of order against provisions in the bill are       waived. When the committee rises and reports the bill back to       the House with a recommendation that the bill do pass, the       previous question shall be considered as ordered on the bill       and amendments thereto to final passage without intervening       motion except one motion to recommit with or without       instructions. If the Committee of the Whole rises and reports       that it has come to no resolution on the bill, then on the       next legislative day the House shall, immediately after the       third daily order of business under clause 1 of rule XIV,       resolve into the Committee of the Whole for further       consideration of the bill.        Sec. 7. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H.R. 7733.     Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I  move the previous question on the resolution.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
