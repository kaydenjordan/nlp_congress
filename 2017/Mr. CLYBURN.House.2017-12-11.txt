 Mr. Speaker, I stand before this House tonight as the  proud Representative of the congressional district that has seven of  the eight HBCUs in South Carolina within its borders: Allen and  Benedict in Columbia; Claflin and South Carolina State in Orangeburg;  Morris in Sumter; Voorhees, Denmark Tech in Denmark, South Carolina;  and Clinton College in Rock Hill, South Carolina.   I listened intently as some of the speakers spoke before me, and I  would like to give just a brief overview of the history of HBCUs.   You have heard from the previous speaker that the first HBCU was  Cheyney State in 1837. Well, it is kind of interesting. That school was  created a few decades before the Emancipation Proclamation, so it means  that before slavery was abolished, HBCUs existed.   Now, one of the interesting things that took place during the Civil  War was the creation of something called the Morrill Act. The gentleman  from Vermont, Justin Morrill, introduced legislation to train people  not just in agriculture, but in military training.                                time  2015    That law was signed by the President, President Abraham Lincoln, July  2, 1862.   Now, the interesting thing is that when the law was enacted, the  Southern States refused to implement that law on behalf of people of  color. They would not allow any person of color to attend those  schools. Consequently, Justin Morrill went back before the Congress  and, in 1880, created a second Morrill Act, this time mandating that  these schools be established in the former slave States for people of  color.   Now, I bring that up tonight because one of the speakers talked about  President Trump signing a bill earlier this year and issuing what we  call a signing statement. In his statement, he said that he is going to  sign the bill, though he questioned the constitutionality of that  section of the bill that funded Historically Black Colleges and  Universities.   Just think about this: the history of this country was to deny  educational opportunities to people of color, and now we have a  President of the United States today saying that those schools that  were established for the express purpose of educating those citizens,  that legislation is unconstitutional.   If nothing else we have heard from this President bothers you, that  one thing should bother every person in the United States of America.   Now, I have talked about those schools that I am proud to represent.  I met with the President. Unfortunately, I heard stuff all over the  weekend about the Congressional Black Caucus refusing to meet with  President Trump. That is not true. The leadership of the Congressional  Black Caucus did, in fact, meet with him, and though I don't hold a  leadership position, they invited me to go along.   So I sat with the President in the Oval Office, and I told the  President something that I want to share with the listeners tonight  about HBCUs.   I told the President the story of a young man whom a lot of people  have heard of, Ronald McNair. Ronald McNair was an astronaut who lost  his life in the blowup of the Challenger.   Ronald McNair came from the little town of Lake City, South Carolina,  in the Sixth Congressional District that I proudly represent, and I got  to know him and his family very well.   We were talking one day as he was getting ready to retire from  astronaut school. In fact, that accident of the Challenger was to be  his last flight. He was going to retire. He was coming home to be a  professor at the University of South Carolina, also in my district. He  said to me that when he graduated from high school in Lake City and  went off to North Carolina A&T, he had to take remedial courses.   Now, everybody talked about Ron McNair. I shared this with the  President. I told him, I said: Everybody talked about him having a  physics degree from MIT. Nobody talks about the fact that he went to  North Carolina A&T. And he said to me: Had it not been for North  Carolina A&T, he never would have made it. Why? Because it was on that  small campus he was nurtured. When they saw in him that he had the  ability to be a great physicist, the ability to be a great astronaut,  what he did not have was the background, the educational preparation  that was not provided for him in that little rural town that he grew up  in, and the same thing is taking place today.   There are communities in my congressional district where there are  gifted young people, but they come from what we call Gullah Geechee  communities from the seacoast, those islands off the seacoast where  they are smart, highly intelligent, but they know only the culture that  they grew up in. So they may not know how to make a subject and verb  agree properly, and, therefore, when they go off to college, would have  to take a remedial course in order to get those subjects and verbs to  agree. But they are very bright, very smart students, and they have  been intentionally undereducated by the States that many of them come  out of.   I know, for more than 20 years, the Legislature in South Carolina did  not fund these schools properly, and we went before the State supreme  court. That case lasted for over 20 years, and recently the Supreme  Court decided to take the school districts from under that order that  it issued some time ago.   So these communities have been intentionally underfunded for their  public schools, and these students graduate high school, go off to  college, and they need the nurturing that they get from an HBCU.   So if anybody tells you that HBCUs are unconstitutional, that ought  to tell you all you need to know to stay away from that person.   I want to close by talking up my alma mater, South Carolina State  University. There are a lot of good things to consider about South  Carolina State, but one is this, and I want all of you to go and check  the record.   You will find, if you check all the schools in the country that have  produced general officers in the military, general officers of color,  you will find that South Carolina State University, and South Carolina  State College before it, has produced more African-American general  officers than any other school in the country, and that includes the  service academies.   I am very proud of what HBCUs have done, I am very proud of that HBCU  that I attended, and I am very proud that Sister Alma Adams, who co- chairs the HBCU Caucus, has allowed me to speak about it this evening.
