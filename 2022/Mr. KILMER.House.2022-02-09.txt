 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Postal  Service Reform Act of 2022, bipartisan legislation to help the U.S.  Postal Service remain financially viable and ensure it provides the  high quality of service that Americans expect and deserve.   Even before this pandemic began, the post office and our postal  workers played a critical role in our country, ensuring that folks  across our Nation received essential packages and letters, including  medication, food, supplies, ballots, and notes from loved ones.   And this importance only grew during the pandemic.   Now, unfortunately the Postal Service has faced serious financial  challenges in recent years, even as postal workers serviced more  locations. It has been burdened by, among other things, a requirement  that no employer in private industry has, to prefund benefits for  workers who, frankly, haven't even been born yet.   That is why this week I voted for the bipartisan Postal Service  Reform Act. This bill makes some commonsense reforms to save the Postal  Service billions of dollars, to have the backs of the terrific  professionals who work for the Postal Service, to improve the service's  performance, and to ensure that folks in my region and around our  country can rely on the delivery of paychecks, prescriptions, tax  returns, and more.   We have got to get this bill signed into law.                            ____________________
