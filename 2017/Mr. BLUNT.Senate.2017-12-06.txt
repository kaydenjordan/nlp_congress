 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, last week I came to the floor to talk about  why we needed to pass the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. I am proud to say that  the Senate has passed that bill. I expect the Senate to move to  conference with the House this week, and I am confident that the final  bill will be an even better bill than the bill passed by either the  House or Senate. More importantly, I am confident that it will get us  on track for real tax relief for working families, and we will have  this bill on the President's desk by the end of this year.   Last week when the bill passed, I said that it isn't just about  changing the trajectory of our economy, it is about changing the future  we hand to our kids and our grandkids. I really think that is what this  bill will do.   There is a lot of talk in Washington about things that, frankly, will  never turn out to be the facts--maybe they are the alternative facts-- but one thing I think will happen is that working families will see, in  one of their first paychecks next year, that this tax bill and these  tax cuts really affect them. Whatever your paycheck is--reflected in  what you start getting paid on January 1--in virtually every case,  working families are going to have more take-home pay, and those  numbers are pretty big.   A few weeks ago, I was at Patriot Machine in St. Charles, MO, and  spoke to the employees who work there. The one thing they were  concerned about was, what does this mean to me? What does this mean to  my family? What is my take-home pay going to look like next year?   Mr. President, you and I said many times during this debate that the  two things we were committed to were more take-home pay immediately by  taking less out of it and even more take-home pay in the future by  doing things that make our economy more competitive and make that  paycheck bigger to start with.   Middle-class families, working-class families, and this country have  lost a lot of ground with the slow growth we have had and the almost no  growth in some years we have had in the past 10 years. We need better  jobs, we need higher wages, and we need the government to let people  take home more of what they earn.   This bill will allow them to do that. It will double the standard  deduction. That is the deduction that is about $6,000, and suddenly it  is $12,000, and for a couple, it is $24,000. You start the tax process  on something the size of a postcard by deducting that $12,000 or that  $24,000 off what your W-2 forms say.   The Senate bill doubles the child tax credit, so you go from a  thousand to another thousand, and you take that credit off your tax  obligation.   Ninety percent of the people are going to fill out their taxes just  that way. It is a form that you may not even have to turn over to sign  the bottom and say, here is what I need to send back; here is what my  tax obligation is.   Helping families has been and continues to be at the heart of what  this whole debate should be about--at one end, more take-home pay, and  at another end, more competition that allows us to have better jobs to  start with.  [[Page S7871]]    I am absolutely convinced that the United States of America has more  money on the sidelines right now than ever before in the history of the  country and more money overseas because of our barriers to bringing  money back, because our Tax Code didn't really anticipate international  competition in the way that it has developed. It has more money that  wants to come back than ever before. Those things are going to make a  difference to the security that our country has and the access to the  world marketplace. We couldn't be better located to compete all over  the world than we are now.   Those things, along with what has happened in the effort to stop the  regulatory overreach and the effort to put people on judicial benches  who are going to rule based on what the law says--this tax bill on top  of that, with capital coming in to our economy, is going to make a big  difference. It will help mainstream businesses that want to reinvest,  innovate, expand, create jobs. That is going to happen with this bill.   This bill came through the regular order process. It came through a  committee that knew how to defend it. Every Senator had the opportunity  to offer any amendment they wanted to offer to improve the final  product.   American families have been stuck with a broken tax code for the last  couple of decades, and that is going to end when the President signs  this bill into law. We shouldn't have to wait any longer. We need to  get this done this year, and we can.                             Funding Our Military    Mr. President, I want to talk a little bit about another bill that we  passed for the 56th consecutive time. There are a lot of things that  Congress doesn't manage to get to every year, but the No. 1 priority of  the Federal Government is to defend the country, and we show that in  how we prioritize that authorization bill that gives those who serve in  uniform the very best possible opportunity to serve us and serve us  safely.   Senator McCain would be the first to say that we have fallen behind  in the last 8 years in what we need to be doing to maintain the  advantage that we always want our troops to have, and, of course, he is  right. He and Senator Reed brought a bill to the floor, and that bill  was passed into law. That will make a big difference in our obligation  to provide for the common defense.   When we send men and women in uniform into harm's way, we never want  that to be a fair fight. We want to give every possible advantage--a  training advantage, an equipment advantage, an intelligence advantage-- to the people we have asked to defend us.   In the next few weeks, as we appropriate the money to do what the  authorization bill calls for, we are going to see a step-up in a way  that has not happened in 8 years now and will happen, I am convinced,  this year. This bill meets that responsibility.   I want to talk about a provision in that bill that I think  particularly is reflective of the families who serve.   The strength of our military is in the families of our military.  Somebody said to me not too long ago: We generally in the military  recruit single young adults, and we retire men and women with families.  Those families who become part of this process--soldiers, sailors,  airmen, and marines, during the time they serve--provide the real  backbone of our military strength. They have a million responsibilities  when somebody in that family deploys. They look at the holidays we are  now in the middle of different from the way most other families look at  the holidays. The person who is there keeping the family together when  somebody deploys often--more and more of the time now--has their own  career. They are paying the bills. They are keeping the kids in school.  They are facing, for the most part, the challenges that so many single  parents face today, but these are single parents based on one of the  two partners in that team being deployed somewhere else. They have to  do these things while they are worried about the person they care so  much about who is in harm's way. Then when that part of their life is  over, they become a family supporting a veteran and whatever challenges  that veteran has from their service.   So the bill we passed this year demonstrates our appreciation for our  military families by including the Military Family Stability Act. This  is a bill I introduced with Senator Gillibrand. That act provides for  more flexibility for military families. It allows military families,  for the first time, to meet one of the challenges they have when every  2 or 3 years they get a new assignment.   If you are trying to stay because your spouse needs to finish a job  or your kids need to finish a school year, that is really not part of  the process anymore, but it now can be. We have a provision in law now  that allows families to meet the challenges of a child finishing or  starting a school year when their family thinks they should or a spouse  completing a job or starting a job based on their schedule rather than  the military's schedule. This will help people stay in the military. It  rewards the support that families give to the military. It allows the  family to either move early or to remain at their current duty station  for up to 6 months while their spouse begins a new assignment or while  their spouse stays a little longer behind to complete that assignment.  The spouse has to assume the responsibility for how they take care of  themselves in that interim, but the money follows the family or stays  with the family.   Right now, we have said to the family who wants to deal with that  timing in a different way: Well, you can move early, but you have to  pay to move early, or you can stay later, but you have to pay to stay  later.   I have talked to so many people in the military, who have had a  career in the military, who have stories to tell about the reasons they  have left or the reasons they have almost left--because we just didn't  have this reasonable ability for a work purpose or an education purpose  or kids or spouses, either one--one woman we had in as a witness on  this was finishing her Ph.D., and she needed to go a little earlier to  get the semester started. Teaching as a graduate assistant, she needed  to get there a little early to get the semester started. I think she  was told at the time: Well, if you get a divorce from your husband, we  will see that you relocate, but as long as you are married, you are  going to have to go when he goes. And he didn't go at the time they  were told he was going to go. All those things can be much easier dealt  with now, and fortunately that is now part of our law.   I want to once again thank Chairman McCain particularly and Samantha  Clark on his staff, who worked so hard to finalize this provision.                         Tribute to Captain Sam Burke    Mr. President, I also would like to recognize an individual who has  been absolutely vital to my work on the National Defense Authorization  Act, my work on the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, and really the  overall national security issues we deal with. Capt. Sam Burke, our  military detailee, has been with us for the last year. I think this has  been a benefit for him, but I know it has been a benefit for us. Sam is  a proud Missourian. I have had a number of military detailees. He is  the first Missourian we have had. He is a military detailee who has  been absolutely instrumental in the Military Family Stability Act and  has brought his experience to our office. Sam was instrumental in  helping us finish that act.   Sam has been with us a year. His parents still live in Charleston,  MO. His father, Jim Burke, is a fourth-generation farmer in Mississippi  County. His mother, Jeanne, is a special education teacher who retired  recently. Sam's brother, Evin, is carrying on the farming tradition and  works with his father as a fifth-generation farmer.   As you would imagine, Sam was raised the right way, with strong  Missouri values, but those Missouri values were, I am sure, definitely  enhanced by the effect of the U.S. Naval Academy, where Sam went to  school and graduated in 2010. He has deployed to Okinawa, Japan, been  in support of multiple exercises throughout Southeast Asia, including  Cambodia and Thailand. He has been a real resource for us. He has  provided an important perspective on a number of foreign policy issues,  ranging from Colombia, to Australia, to Russia, to the Balkans. He has  been a great help on veterans issues and a tremendous asset to our  office from day one.   I wish Captain Burke all the best in the next chapter of his military  career.  [[Page S7872]]  I thank his fiancee, Sarah, and all his family and friends who support  him for the sacrifices he has made serving the country and will  continue to make. He is a first-class marine, a consummate  professional, and an exceptional individual. We are going to miss him,  but the country is going to continue to benefit from his service.   For Sam Burke and all those who serve, we are grateful. For the hard- working families in America, I think we are taking a right step with  the tax act, just as we took the right step for military families with  the Military Family Stability Act.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a military  fellow in my office, Capt. Sam Burke, be granted floor privileges for  the duration of my remarks.
