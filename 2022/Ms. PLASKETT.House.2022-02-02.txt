 Mr. Speaker, the 2020 election brought with it  tremendous opportunities for the territories, particularly, after the  devastation of unprecedented natural disasters in our global pandemic.   The American Rescue Plan of 2021 offered tremendous promise of full,  robust recovery for our islands. Our island governments will now  receive full Federal funding for important workforce development tax  credits, like the earned income tax credit, child tax credit, and the  child dependent care tax credit. This will be significant relief to  budget and revenue offices in the territories.   In the Virgin Islands, my home, the earned income tax credit alone  accounts for almost 40 percent of our tax returns in any given year. In  addition, each of the territories have received at least $500 million  in State and local government fiscal aid. These funds have broad  eligibility, including to provide services threatened by declining  revenue; make investments in water, sewer, or broadband infrastructure;  support public entities involved in transport of passengers or cargo;  special purpose units of local government, or nonprofits that aid the  homeless.   The Virgin Islands will also receive investments from the bold  Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act that became law in November. The  EPA, FAA,  [[Page H338]]  and the Army Corps of Engineers are agencies providing substantial  support.   Much of this funding will take us far, however, aside from  supplemental funds made available in the act, in the area of primary  formula funds for traditional infrastructure, surface roads and  highways, I am afraid the territories remain significantly underfunded  or under-included.   The territories have endured severe infrastructure funding cuts since  1998, when the preexisting set-aside formula for the Territorial  Highway Program funding was scrapped. Since then, the territorial share  of overall Federal highway program funding has progressively declined  by 50 percent. These severe cuts have negatively impacted everything  from safety to emergency response, law enforcement capabilities, to  commerce, to disaster relief management.   The Build Back Better Act would restore the significant equity  investment in infrastructure for the territories in the House-passed  bill. It contained $320 million in supplemental funding for the  Territorial Highway Program in order to restore the investment in the  territories to a similar share of overall Federal highway funding that  they once received before 1998. We must continue to fight for those  objectives.    The territories will have a hard time competing for any of the  billions in funding set up in the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs  Act for projects of national significance, or the Rural Surface  Transportation Grant program because project eligibility under these  new programs is mostly tied to States or projects connected to the  National Highway System, which by definition, does not include the  territories. That impediment, along with having sufficient private  partners to allow us to ramp up, have care, capacity and competence,  make it hard for us to go after the competitive grants. The territories  will need assistance with vying for the competitive funding that they  are eligible for, identifying those programs, and connecting those  programs to projects.   The viability and sustainability of energy in the territories is of  the utmost importance for the well-being of our rural communities. The  territories are not connected to the national grid, and energy costs on  our islands are higher than anywhere else in the country. Our  geographic locations leave us vulnerable to climate change but also  provide opportunities for adoption of innovative energy resources.   We need help from the Department of Energy and Agriculture, and many  others, for energy efficiency, energy storage, smart grids, microgrids,  as well as renewable energy technical training.   Mr. Speaker, Americans living in the territories live in areas with  brownfields and are susceptible to climate change unlike other areas.  We are rural-isolated and we have unemployment much higher than others.  However, we have geographic strategic advantages for our country. Our  young people disproportionately enter the military because they want to  work. They want to be productive. We sit in a vortex of alternative  energy raw resources, in a majority minority community.   As it says up here on the wall by Daniel Webster, ``Let us develop  the resources of our land, call forth its powers. . . . '' I am asking  my colleagues in Congress to ensure that the territories can do that  through this Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act.                            ____________________
