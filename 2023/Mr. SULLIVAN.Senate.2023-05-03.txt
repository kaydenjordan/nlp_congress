 Madam President, I want to thank Senator Capito and  Senator Barrasso for their leadership on an issue that matters to every  single American. This is one of those issues where the Congress of the  United States should be coming together in a bipartisan way to make  sure we have a permitting system that enables us to build things--every  kind of thing we need: roads, bridges, ports, energy, renewables, oil,  and gas.   The system is broken. Everybody knows it.   I like to show this photo when I am talking about permitting reform.  Why am I showing this very iconic photo of some men here building the  Empire State Building? Because we all know that one of the great things  about America is that we used to be able to build things--big things-- on time: 410 days to build the Empire State Building. The Hoover Dam  took less than 5 years to build. A little closer to home to me, the  1,700-mile Alaska-Canada Highway, what we call the ALCAN Highway,  through some of the world's most rugged terrain--11 months.   This was the great thing about America. With the best workers in the  world, we built huge things, on time, on budget--but not anymore, not  anymore.   I don't want to be too partisan here, but one of the things that we  all know we need is permitting. It is permitting. I am obsessed with  this issue.   But I will tell you this. Every time--and it is probably going to  happen again--we have a big permitting opportunity, a big permitting  bill on the floor, what happens? It usually is a battle between the men  and women who build stuff. The unions who build things, they want  permitting reform. They want to be back in action, like these men  decades ago.   The men and women who build things want it. The radical, far-left  environmental groups hate it because they want to block building  anything in America. They want to block producing any energy in  America.   Unfortunately, when it is a choice between the men and women who  build stuff and the far-left radical enviros on permitting, my  Democratic colleagues almost every single time go with the radical  left, not the men and women who build things. I hope it doesn't happen  again, but it happens all the time.   Here is the thing: As I mentioned, our country used to build  incredible things on time. Now we are a country that is tangled up in  redtape. A simple highway in the United States can now take as long as  19 years to permit and build. In Alaska, we are ground zero for these  kinds of projects where the permitting is delayed, far-left lower 48  environmental groups sue to stop, and they take advantage of NEPA.   Let me give an example. We had a gold mine in Alaska called the  Kensington Mine. If you include the litigation from the far-left  environmental groups, it took 20 years to permit--20  [[Page S1481]]  years. How does that help the country? How does that help my State? How  does that help workers? It doesn't. The only people who like that are  the far-left environmental groups and Xi Jinping and Putin, who want to  make sure America can't produce.   So what has happened is the National Environmental Policy Act--NEPA,  as we call it--has been abused. It was a great idea when it was passed  in the late 1960s. It required builders to engage with the public,  consider the environmental impacts of important projects. But back  then, it was usually a couple of hundred pages, a NEPA review that  would take about a year. Now that is several thousand pages. It takes  several years for the NEPA process to move forward.   We have, again, some of our great leaders in our building trades.  This is James Callahan, general president of the International  Operating Engineers. Here is what he said recently on a piece of  legislation that I moved forward last year, a CRA on a permitting  issues:         Since its modest beginning, NEPA has evolved into a massive       edifice, capable of destroying project after project--    Destroying, not helping--         job after job, in virtually every sector of the economy.    Whether it is the permitting bill that Senator Capito and Senator  Barrasso have done such a great job in leading; whether it is my  Rebuild America Now Act, which is a major reform of the NEPA process-- by the way, the vast majority of the building trades in America, the  men and women who build things, support my legislation.   We need permitting reform. It is that simple. When you talk to a  Governor in pretty much any State, whether they are Democrat or  Republican; when you talk to a mayor, Democrat or Republican--it  doesn't matter--they say: We have to fix our broken permitting system.   We had a hearing on airport infrastructure in the Commerce Committee  several years ago. The head of the Seattle-Tacoma Airport was  testifying. They had just built a new runway at Sea-Tac.   I asked him: How long did it take to build that runway?   In the hearing, he said: Three to four years.   I said: Well, that seems a little long, but I am not in construction,  so I don't know exactly, but it seems a little long to build a new  runway. How long did it take you to get the permits from the Federal  Government to build that runway?   I didn't know the answer, but I am obsessed with this topic because  it is killing our country. It is really hurting working men and women,  like James Callahan, one of our great union leaders.   This witness looked at me--the head of the Sea-Tac Airport--when I  asked him: How long did it take to get the permits?   He said: Senator Sullivan, 15 years.   Fifteen years to get a permit to build a new runway. You could hear  the entire hearing room just kind of collectively groan because  everybody knows it is bad for America.   Then he said: Senator, with the time it took to build the new  runway--4 years--and the time it took to get the permits--15 years-- almost 20 years.   The ancient Egyptians would have built the Pyramids by then. This is  killing us. Everybody knows it. This should be a bipartisan issue.   I will end with this: Last year, I was proud to lead the efforts on  what is called a Congressional Review Act, CRA. What it was for was--we  passed the bipartisan infrastructure bill. We got some OK permitting  reform in there--not as much as I wanted, but it was not bad. So that  was good. I voted for the bill. It wasn't perfect. But then the Biden  administration White House, at the behest of the far-left radical  enviros, issued rules on permitting that were undermining its own  bipartisan infrastructure bill. The CEQ put out rules that would make  it much harder to build things in America--not just energy projects,  all projects. It was crazy.   So I introduced a Congressional Review Act resolution to rescind the  Biden rule driven by the far-left radical enviros. Here is the good  news: My CRA passed in a bipartisan way on the floor of the U.S.  Senate. Over 40 groups--you name them--farmers, ranchers, people who  build things, all the building trades in America, all the unions--this  collective group of over 40 groups representing millions of Americans  who build stuff, who farm things, who grow things, all came and said:  We support the Sullivan Congressional Review Act.   That is what we should be doing now. The Barrasso-Capito bill;  Senator Manchin introduced his permitting legislation--we all know it  is the right thing to do.   To my Democratic colleagues: Listen to the men and women who build  stuff. Listen to the men and women who grow things. Don't listen to the  far-left radical enviros who don't want any permitting reform because  they love to crush projects. Be courageous. Vote with us on the  permitting reform that everybody in America knows we need.   I yield the floor.    Madam President, I thank the majority leader for his  fine compliment to me on the Senate floor about learned remarks. I  appreciate that.    I appreciate that very much.   Not if you are going to take away your compliment--if you are going  to keep it, I will yield.    Actually, I think you will appreciate these remarks.    Madam President, recently, there have been numerous  articles in the media about the U.S. Navy's lack of amphibious ships-- one that I would like to submit for the Record, headlined ``Grounding  of U.S. Marine Unit Spotlights Lack of Ships in Asia-Pacific,'' can be  found online at https://www.wsj.com/articles/grounding-of-u-s-marine- unit-spotlights-lack-of-ships-in-asia-pacific-757315b4.   (Mr. WHITEHOUSE assumed the Chair.)   In this piece, the writer leads with how the 31st Marine  Expeditionary Unit, a rapid response force of the Marine Corps designed  for quick deployment on three Navy ships--what we call an ``amphibious  ready group''--how they were forced to abandon a training exercise  because the amphibious warships that they are supposed to train on were  not available due to maintenance problems.   Here is what the article said in part:   The Marine unit's grounded status illustrates the larger obstacles  the United States is facing as it tries to pivot its military to handle  the challenges from China. Overall, defense officials said the Navy  doesn't have enough amphibious ships to transport marines, and a  central part of the Marine Corps's mission is to hop from island to  island in the Asia-Pacific and harry Chinese forces in the event of a  conflict.   By the way, Mr. President, the Marines are really good at this. They  have been doing it for decades. But they need ships.   Another article from Defense News is also a recent one about the lack  of amphibious ships and the problem that poses. This one is from  another part of the world but very recent. The article starts with how  hundreds of American citizens were stranded in war-torn Sudan.   It says:         Hundreds of Americans in war-torn Sudan last month needed a       way out of the country, but the U.S. Marine Corps, the go-to       service for such rescues [of American citizens] couldn't       help.    The article continued:         Typically, this kind of mission would be standard for the       Navy and Marine Corps' amphibious ready group--    A Marine expeditionary unit, or what we call in the Marine Corps a  MEU, a MEU-R, a Marine expeditionary unit, an amphibious ready group-- three ships, super well trained, special operations capable, can go  anywhere in the world, kick the door in, save American citizens.   The article continues:         For the Americans who fled to the coast [in Sudan] the       Pentagon sent an auxiliary transport ship--    that they contracted out, I believe, from another country--       to shuttle them safely to . . . Saudi Arabia.    It was, in essence, a self-evacuation of U.S. citizens.   Mr. President, NPR reported that the buses actually took hundreds of  Americans to the Port of Sudan. Imagine--imagine--my colleagues, what  would have happened had those Americans, traveling in contract buses in  the middle of a civil war, got caught in the crossfire.   The article that I just quoted was entitled ``Marines want 31  amphibious ships. The Pentagon disagrees. Now what?'' I ask unanimous  consent to have that article printed in the Record at the end of my  remarks.   Finally, Mr. President, there was another recent article from Defense  One. Its title was ``Navy On Path To Violate 31-Amphibious-Ship  Requirement in 2024.''   Now, Mr. President, this is what I wanted to get to. Last year, in  the Armed Services Committee, we held a number of hearings with the  Navy and the Marine Corps saying: What is the minimum number of  amphibious ships that would enable the Marine Corps to do its global  force response mission--the minimum number? After many hearings, after  much discussion with the Marines and Navy, we came up, in a bill of  mine, with a minimum of 31 ships.   This bill in the Armed Services Committee last year passed  unanimously. Every Democrat and every Republican voted for it.   The law now reads as follows. I know this is a little small, but here  is the new U.S. Code that has the new language. It says:         The naval combat forces of the Navy shall include not less       than 11 operational aircraft carriers and not less than 31       operational amphibious warfare ships, of which not less than       10 shall be amphibious assault ships--    What we call in the Marine Corps ``big-deck assault ships'' that can  carry helicopters and Ospreys and Harriers and now F-35 Bravos. That  was the law. That passed. The President signed it.   Here is the problem. The U.S. Navy is violating the law. The U.S.  Navy is treating that law--31 amphibs, a minimum--as a suggestion from  the Congress, as an option from the Congress.   How do I know? Because we had a hearing 2 weeks ago on the Armed  Services Committee, and the Secretary of the Navy essentially said: We  are looking at different options for the President's budget on how many  amphibs that the Navy is going to have.   And, currently, the Navy presented a budget that doesn't have 31  amphibs.   I had some cross words with the Secretary of the Navy, the CNO of the  Navy, because they are violating the law. And I will tell you, my  Democratic and Republican colleagues on the Armed Services Committee  were supportive of what I was saying. We had a hearing on the Armed  Services Readiness Subcommittee yesterday. The Vice Chief of Naval  Operations, Admiral Franchetti, said that the Navy was ``studying the  issue.''   The Navy can't study the issue anymore. The Navy needs to follow the  [[Page S1517]]  law. The U.S. Congress has done the studies. We need the ships.    But here is what the Navy presented to the Armed Services Committee 2  weeks ago. They provided us their 30-year shipbuilding plan for the  Navy. Right here is the 31 amphib ship statutory minimum that is  required by the law. Here is the Navy shipbuilding plan for the next 30  years. You see in the numbers, these are different options: plan one,  plan two, plan three.   You might notice the Navy never gets to 31 amphibs. So the Secretary  of the Navy, the CNO of the Navy, and the Vice CNO of the Navy came to  the Congress in the last 2 weeks and said: Your 31 amphib ship  requirement, we are going to ignore it. Your 31 amphib ship  requirement, Congress, United States of America, we are going to  violate that.   This is unacceptable. The U.S. Navy, the Secretary of the Navy, the  Secretary of Defense should not be thumbing their nose at the Congress,  and, worse, they should not be violating the law and not trying to  abide by the law. They are saying, for 30 years, we are going to ignore  the Congress, and we are going to ignore the laws of the United States  of America.   This cannot happen. This cannot happen.   Let me end with this. Whether you are a Democrat or a Republican,  whether you are a hawk on defense issues or a dove on defense issues,  if you are a U.S. Senator, this should make you really mad. This should  make you really mad.   Last year, the Congress spoke. And, again, on the Armed Services  Committee, on which I serve, it was unanimous. Every member of that  committee who had studied the issue said, at a minimum, the Navy needs  31 amphibs so the U.S. Marine Corps can do its mission around the  world. Everybody agreed. We passed the law.   The Navy, the Secretary of the Navy, and the Secretary of Defense are  thumbing their nose at this body, are breaking the law as we speak, are  intending to break the law for the next 30 years. That is their 30-year  shipbuilding plan. It never hits 31 ships.   But here is the worst thing they are doing, and this is a real  serious issue. They are putting the lives of American citizens at risk.  Why do I say that? Well, let me end where I began, with Sudan, the  rescue of American citizens. Again, normally, that is a mission tailor- made for the U.S. Marine Corps, whether in an embassy or another  dangerous part of the world--what we call a noncombatant evacuation  operation, a NEO. The Marines do them all the time. They bring up their  amphibs, launch helos, launch support craft, helicopters, fighters, if  they need the air support.   The capability of a MEU-R to go rescue American citizens--a lot of  them--is unsurpassed by any service in the world.   The U.S. Marines do it all the time. But guess what they can't do it  without? They can't do it without amphibious ships. And right now, we  don't have enough. So we dodged a bullet 2 weeks ago in Sudan.   American citizens were put on buses and driven across dangerous parts  of Sudan in a civil war, for hours after hours, and got to a port,  self-evacuated on some other country's ships. We are so lucky that  those Americans did not get killed or wounded--did not get killed or  wounded--because there was no Marine Corps to rescue them.   I am going to keep raising this issue. The Secretary of Defense,  Secretary of the Navy, today, are violating the law. Today, they have  no intention of meeting this 31 amphib ship requirement, and American  citizens are at risk. And the next time we might not be so lucky. The  next time Americans somewhere around the world need to be rescued, the  next time an enemy of our country does something nefarious to our  citizens, our national interests, and we don't have the ability to  respond as a Marine Corps because we don't have the ships, we are going  to know who is responsible.   I yield floor.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                      [From Defense News, May 2, 2023]    Marines Want 31 Amphibious Ships. The Pentagon Disagrees. Now What?                            (By Megan Eckstein)         Washington.--Hundreds of Americans trapped in war-torn       Sudan last month needed a way out of the country, but the       U.S. Marine Corps, the go-to service for such rescues,       couldn't help.        Typically, this kind of mission would be standard for the       Navy and Marine Corps' amphibious ready group and Marine       expeditionary unit, made up of 2,300 Marines aboard three       ships who are trained to fight their way into and evacuate       citizens from dangerous locations.        Instead, as violence surged, the Pentagon relied on drones       to monitor a 500-mile escape route from the capital of       Khartoum to the Red Sea city of Port Sudan. For the Americans       who fled to the coast, the Pentagon sent an auxiliary       transport ship to shuttle them to safety in Jeddah, Saudi       Arabia.        It was a complicated and risky self-evacuation.        At the same time, off the coast of Marine Corps Base Camp       Lejeune, North Carolina, the Bataan ARG and 26th MEU were       conducting a noncombatant evacuation simulation--training for       the very operation Americans in Sudan needed. But the group       stayed put because it wasn't yet certified for global       missions.        The Navy didn't have another set of ready amphibious ships       to deploy from the East Coast on short notice.        All of this followed a similar situation a few months       earlier, when service leaders were unable to send a team to       Turkey and Syria to provide aid after a 7.8-magnitude       earthquake rocked the region.        Maj. Gen. Roger Turner, the Marine Corps' operations       division director, told Defense News the naval forces ``have       this razor-thin capacity'' with amphibious ships, and when       emergencies arise, ``there's no capacity to react.''        It's a trend that could continue.        Today, the Navy has 31 amphibious ships--what the Marine       Corps considers the bare minimum it needs--but the Pentagon       plans to shrink the fleet below that number in fiscal 2024.       As a result, Turner anticipates the Corps will be more       challenged to respond to global crises.        Throughout last year and into this spring, that number--      31--has been at the center of debates, as the Navy, Marine       Corps, Defense Department, Congress and industry weigh in on       how many amphibious ships the military needs, what they       should look like and how much they should cost.        Now, the argument is about to come to a head.        In June, the Pentagon is expected to complete a study on       whether to continue buying amphibious ships and, if so, what       capabilities those vessels will have.        The final decision is expected to have major ramifications       for the Marine Corps and defense contractor Ingalls       Shipbuilding, a division of HII.        For example, the study might back a requirement for 31       ships and recommend continuing to build San Antonio-class       vessels at a cost of about $2 billion each. Or the report       could recommend a new design that would cost less per ship--      an idea the Corps already rejected, and one that could       disrupt Ingalls' production line.        Or there's a third option: The report could call for a       continued pause in the Pentagon buying amphibious ships,       which could force Ingalls to close its production line and       would force the Marine Corps to reevaluate its amphibious       operations plans.        But unless the Office of the Secretary of Defense approves       the continued construction of ships, or unless Congress       overrides the Pentagon, ``trying to maintain even a minimal       [amphibious] presence is going to be really difficult,''       Turner said.        This comes at a time when he said ``aggressive behavior of       the [People's Republic of China] is driving people to us;       they want us to be the security partner of choice,'' making       American amphibious presence all the more important today.        Outsider observers like Mackenzie Eaglen, an expert in       military readiness at the American Enterprise Institute think       tank, believe the debate itself is problematic.        ``Funding disagreements signal indecision to our       adversaries on the role of this capability,'' she warned.                            A 31-ship requirement         For years, the Marine Corps had a requirement of 38       amphibious ships, with the caveat it would accept 34 in a       fiscally constrained environment.        This requirement was based on the rationale that the       service needed 38 ships to move two entire Marine       expeditionary brigades into combat for a forcible entry.        In July 2019, Gen. David Berger took command of the service       and quickly released a document titled ``Commandant's       Planning Guidance'' that backed away from the requirement of       transporting those two brigades, saying the Corps would fight       differently in the future.        Since then, a range of concepts have emerged, focused on       the idea that small units would already be dispersed       throughout the Pacific region to be able to tamp down an       emerging conflict until additional forces arrive.        The Marine Corps began talking publicly about a 31-ship       requirement in 2021, and the Navy acknowledged that       requirement in 2022.        According to the director of the Maritime Expeditionary       Warfare Division, Shon Brodie, the 31-ship figure is based on       an idea that the fleet should do three things:        Keep two three-ship amphibious ready groups at sea at any       given time.        Support contingency plans that call for five three-ship       amphibious ready groups to deploy on short notice.  [[Page S1518]]         Allow for enough ready ships--those not tied up in       maintenance--that some would be available for training       Marines in events like fleet exercises.        The requirement is specifically divided up into 10       amphibious assault ships (made up of the America-class LHAs       and Wasp-class LHDs that host fixed-wing jets like the F-      35B), and 21 medium-sized amphibious vessels (either the       aging Whidbey Island-class LSDs or the newer San Antonio-      class LPDs). An amphibious ready group includes one       amphibious assault ship and two medium-sized ships.        Brodie told Defense News this 31-ship requirement is backed       by studies undertaken from 2008 to 2022, and reflects ships'       recent maintenance readiness rates, which hover around 40%.        That rate means in a fleet of 31 ships, 12 or 13 might be       available at any given time. If six are supposed to be       deployed, and another six are getting ready to deploy next,       that leaves little to no additional capacity for training or       surging in response to natural disasters or conflicts.        This low readiness rate has complicated the discussion and       is a key reason the Marine Corps considers 31 ships the bare       minimum.        Pilots with the 13th Marine Expeditionary Unit fly over the       amphibious transport dock Anchorage on Dec. 8, 2022. (Sgt.       Brendan Custer/U.S. Marine Corps)        Bryan Clark, director of the Center for Defense Concepts       and Technology at the Hudson Institute think tank, said 31       ships is the right number, but noted ``presence is now the       driver, rather than warfighting lift requirements.''        While the amphibious ready group and Marine expeditionary       unit, or ARG/MEU, team still can storm an island and take it       from enemy forces, the group is most often used to train       alongside partners and allies, respond to friendly nations       after a natural disaster, or rescue American citizens trapped       in dangerous countries.        Eaglen said this emphasis on presence as a means of       deterrence has contributed to the disagreement with the       Pentagon over the 31-ship requirement.        ``The rub as I see it between the Office of the Secretary       of Defense and the Marine Corps is over amphib ship       requirements for operational plans, versus the additional       duties of crisis response (and to a lesser extent building       partner capacity) the Marines have on a daily basis,'' she       told Defense News. ``To me, the commandant is saying he wants       and needs more ships for tasks scoped outside [of       warfighting].''        Dakota Wood, a senior research fellow for defense programs       at the Heritage Foundation, acknowledged concerns over the       amphibious ships' survivability against Chinese anti-ship       missiles, but said ``large-scale combat operations against a       highly capable enemy like China is only part of the story.''        ``Much has been made about China being the most substantial       security challenge for the U.S., but Navy-Marine Corps       forces, made possible with Marines embarked aboard Navy       amphibious ships, have repeatedly [proved] their worth across       a range of small crises in various parts of the world,'' he       told Defense News.                               Fleet under fire         Though the Marine Corps maintains it needs 31 ships, the       Pentagon has not committed to that requirement.        DoD officials have not spoken publicly on the matter. Asked       by Defense News whether the Office of the Secretary of       Defense backs the 31-ship requirement, Pentagon spokesman       Chris Sherwood said the requirement can't be considered in       isolation and the department is ``focused on having the right       mix of capabilities to meet the objectives of the 2022       National Defense Strategy.''        The Navy's fiscal 2023 budget request, shaped by the Office       of the Secretary of Defense and the White House before going       to Congress, called for truncating the San Antonio-class       production line after one final ship that fiscal year. This       move would end the San Antonio program after 16 ships, rather       than the planned 26.        The FY24 request advances that plan, including no       additional LPDs in the five-year spending plan.        With the Marine Corps and the Pentagon at odds, the Office       of the Secretary of Defense and the services are conducting a       capability and cost analysis to consider alternative ship       designs and acquisition strategies that might lower the cost       of future amphibious ships. That study is set to conclude in       June.        U.S. Navy vessels sail with a Royal Thai Navy ship and a       South Korean ship while transiting the Gulf of Thailand       during the exercise Cobra Gold on March 3, 2023. (MC3 Joshua       Martinez/U.S. Navy)        Marine Corps, and later Navy, leaders have pushed to buy       these ships in multiyear procurement contracts, which must       generate cost-savings as a condition of service secretaries       approving them. These savings are often on the order of 10%.       But a top Marine general told Defense News that the Office of       the Secretary of Defense wants larger savings by paring down       the ship design and capability.        Lt. Gen. Karsten Heckl, the deputy commandant for combat       development and integration, told Defense News in March that       Pentagon officials had presented him with several rough       drawings of ship designs that would be cheaper than the       current LPDs.        ``None of them are acceptable,'' he said. ``They're trying       to reduce cost by reducing my requirement. The answer to       reduced cost would have been to exercise [two previous       congressional authorizations for multi-ship contracts], one       of which was a five-ship and would have saved the American       taxpayers almost $900 million.''        Heckl, speaking at the annual Sea-Air-Space conference in       April, said the Marines had in 2014 worked with the Navy to       scale down the LPD design to the cheaper Flight II design,       now under construction at Ingalls Shipbuilding. ``We drove       out cost. We're done.''        Berger, who was part of that 2014 effort, made the same       point in an April 18 Senate Armed Services Committee hearing,       saying that ``every bit of efficiency [was] squeezed out'' of       the LPD design.        ``If there's another effort to reduce that further, I know       that we went to the minimums in 2014,'' the commandant added.        When Navy leadership first rolled out the plan to nix       future LPDs, Chief of Naval Operations Adm. Mike Gilday said       that as the service prepares for a potential fight against       China, it must prioritize programs most relevant to that       conflict.        But more recently, top Navy officials said they would like       to continue buying LPDs. Gilday told reporters in early       April: ``We agree on the 31 requirement, we agree on       leveraging the multiyear procurement in terms of doing a       bundle buy, and hopefully this study that ends in June       informs these next steps.''        Sherwood, when asked about the Pentagon's commitment to       restart LPD buys in FY25 and to use multiyear procurement       authority, said the Office of the Secretary of Defense plans       to ``address the next purchase in our FY25 budget.''        Lawmakers last year included a provision in the FY23       National Defense Authorization Act giving the commandant of       the Marine Corps the authority to set the requirement for       amphibious ships. That effectively makes the congressionally       mandated requirement 31.                                 today's plan         The Navy's FY24 long-range shipbuilding plan, released       April 17, envisions a dwindling amphibious fleet unless a       compromise can be reached on building a future LPD-like ship.        Until the amphibious ship study determines the future of       the San Antonio program--whether to continue or truncate it;       whether to buy ships one at a time or commit to a multi-ship       buy; whether to keep the Flight II design or pare it down       further--the Navy's existing long-range plan does not include       buying medium amphibious ships.        It continues retiring the aging Whidbey Island LSDs,       though, calling for six of the 10 remaining ships to be       retired from FY24 to FY26.        Under the baseline plan--the long-range ship plan includes       three potential options--the fleet of 31 amphibious vessels       today would sit at 29 in a decade, 24 in two decades and 19       in three decades.        If the Navy were to continue buying the San Antonio-class       LPDs every other year, for about a billion dollars a year,       the fleet could instead sit at 34 in a decade, 34 in two       decades and 33 in three decades.

Gavin Shelton/U.S. Marine       Corps)        Clark said the Office of the Secretary of Defense may not       want the Navy to spend $2 billion every other year for a ship       it doesn't highly value right now, particularly because that       cadence would generate a fleet slightly larger than the       Corps' 31-ship requirement.        On the other hand, if the Navy stops the production line,       lets the fleet size shrink and then later opts to restart the       production line, the cost might be exorbitant--if Ingalls       could even reconstitute its workforce and supply base.        ``Are you better off buying those ships? Is that actually       cheaper in the long run than it would be to stop the       production line and turn around and restart it?'' Clark said.       ``It may be that it almost becomes a wash.''        That's the case with aircraft carriers: The Navy       essentially pays HII's Newport News Shipbuilding to keep the       production line ``activated and fully manned'' in order to       keep the sole builder of nuclear-powered carriers viable,       Clark said. The line isn't perfectly optimized, as that would       create a larger fleet than the Navy needs, but it delivers a       new ship every five to six years, and the Navy retains the       industrial base to produce these complex ships.        This arrangement ``ends up being slightly cheaper than if       you started and stopped and started the construction line       multiple times,'' Clark explained. ``The question is: Does       Congress or [the Office of the Secretary of Defense]--mostly       Congress--want to take that longer term view and say, `We're       just going to keep building LPDs on two-year centers because       in the end it's cheaper than to stop and start this line,       unless you don't think you need LPDs [for future operations]?       ''        Several experts expressed concern the Pentagon won't take       long-term measures, like approving multi-ship contracts, to       build and maintain a 31-ship fleet.        Brent Sadler, a senior research fellow for naval warfare       and advanced technology at the Heritage Foundation, told       Defense News that the Office of the Secretary of Defense and       its Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation office ``don't see       value in amphibs in  [[Page S1519]]       a China fight, and therefore [they are] not worth the       money.''        Eaglen added that the the Office of the Secretary of       Defense ``is concerned some amphibs are too slow and       therefore easy targets after the shooting starts'' with       China, despite the Marine Corps seeing amphibious ships and       the surface connectors they haul as ``critical to fighting       inside the First Island Chain using Marines as a stand-in       force.'' (The first island chain stretches from Japan's       East China Sea islands through the Philippines.)        ``Ultimately, Congress will be the adjudicator, and they       will again side with the commandant,'' she predicted.                 The cost of falling short of a 31-ship fleet         Berger told the Senate committee that not having enough       ships puts at risk Marines' ability to deter or win a war,       plus their ability to respond to global crises.        ``You have to be there with allies and partners because       they have to believe that the United States is not running       away from them, is going to be there even when things get       tough,'' he said.        The commandant added that ``if you still believe . . .       three amphibious ships loaded up with 2,300 Marines, if they       have a deterrent value, and I think they do, then you want       them right in the adversary's grill, right in their face       where they can see them all the time . . . Can we afford       conventional deterrence? Absolutely yes, because the       alternative is a lot worse.''        U.S. Marines sit in formation in combat rubber raiding       crafts during a launch and recovery exercise with the       amphibious transport dock New Orleans in the Philippine Sea       on Aug. 6, 2022. (Lance Cpl. Yvonne Iwae/U.S. Marine Corps)        Assistant Commandant of the Marine Corps Gen. Eric Smith       during a panel discussion at Sea-Air-Space said the service       is providing as much airlift as possible for its forces in       the Pacific, allowing Marines to get to exercises and respond       to problems.        But there are still gaps when no ARG/MEUs are patrolling       the Pacific, and Smith warned those would increase if the       fleet size decreases.        If Americans traveling or working abroad find themselves in       the middle of a violent uprising, ``you better hope it's in       the months that we have an ARG/MEU ready to come get you. If       you're a combatant commander and somebody tries to close down       a SLOC, a sea line of communication, you're going to want to       hope that's during the months that we're there.''        Calling the ARG/MEU the ``crown jewel of our expeditionary       crisis response capability,'' Turner said ``with the minimum       of 31 ships that has been established and the readiness       challenges that we're facing that we discussed, really the       confluence between capacity and readiness has pinched that       capability in ways that are really not helpful.''        If the Navy continues down its path of decommissioning the       old LSDs and not replacing them with new LPDs, ``trying to       maintain even a minimal ARG/MEU presence is going to be       really difficult.''        ``At a time that we should be adding capability, we're       actually reducing capability,'' Turner said.                            ____________________
