 Mr. President, I rise today to honor the life of  R.D. Kinsey who passed away on July 11, 2022, at the age of 69. Mr.  Kinsey was a husband, father, veteran, civil servant and beloved leader  in the State of Arkansas with a reputation for wisdom and compassion.   A native of South Florida, Kinsey moved to Arkansas after his service  in the U.S. Air Force. After he was honorably discharged in 1972, he  realized his passion and desire to uplift and advocate for his fellow  veterans.   Stepping into a new platform of service with the U.S. Department of  Veterans Affairs, Kinsey spent much of his time counseling combat  veterans even  [[Page S3539]]  before post-traumatic stress disorder and traumatic brain injuries were  formal diagnoses.   Kinsey's friends recognized him as a man who actively worked to make  positive changes for veterans throughout his career. Upon his  retirement from civil service in 2000, he continued to blaze trails  within the American Legion, serving in local, State, and national  capacities. He was instrumental in founding American Legion Post 74 in  North Little Rock, where he served as founding commander and commander  for 14 years.   He made an annual trip to Washington, DC, during the American  Legion's testimony to Congress about its legislative priorities and  advocated on behalf of Arkansas veterans.   In 2018, he became the first African-American State commander of the  American Legion of Arkansas. Kinsey was not focused on the tag-line and  pressures that may arise from being the first minority to sit in the  State commander seat because, in his words, ``All our blood runs the  same.'' This was one of many examples of how he led his life with  humility and selflessness.   During his time in the Air Force, Kinsey specialized in security,  where he fought to protect his fellow airmen in combat. During his time  serving veterans, he fought to strengthen the benefits they earned.  Service, advocacy, and security were his life's tenets.   At the celebration of the American Legion's 100th anniversary, Kinsey  said his time as commander was his way of giving back blessings to help  others and what could be a more rewarding experience than to be able  and help a veteran in need.   He served in the greatest capacity alongside his wife, Dianna and  their two daughters, Meredith and Allison and their grandsons. He was a  loving father, caring coworker, servant leader, gracious husband, and  friend to all. His wife recently said that his motto was ``For God and  country.'' I hope we can learn from his example to remember the  American blood flowing through all of us and work together to make this  country better than we found it.   I join R.D Kinsey's family, friends, and all Arkansans in mourning  his passing. His fingerprint will forever mark Arkansas. From Florida,  North Little Rock, Washington, and everywhere in between, his legacy  will carry on with current and future generations. In his spirit we  will continue to advance the benefits for and meet the needs of  American veterans.                            ____________________
