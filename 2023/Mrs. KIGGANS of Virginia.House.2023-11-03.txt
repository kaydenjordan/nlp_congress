 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commend the  Virginia Beach lifeguards on a successful summer season and to thank  them for keeping our beaches in Hampton Roads safe.   Lifeguards are an essential part of any community, but back home in  Virginia's Second District, the Virginia Beach Lifesaving Service has  protected our oceanfront since 1930. Their mission of promoting beach  safety protects not only the citizens of Virginia Beach but the  millions of visitors we have each year.   Lifeguarding is one of the top choices for people searching for  summer jobs, including my two sons. While it is a rewarding job, it is  also a challenging one that demands personal responsibility.   Beaches and oceans are dynamic natural environments. Crowd  conditions, currents, waves, sharks, and other weather conditions can  rapidly change, putting swimmers in grave danger.   The average number of people saved each summer is between 400 to 600,  but during this year's summer season, which extended from May 13 to  September 17, the Virginia Beach Lifesaving Service performed more than  800 rescues on the beaches they patrol.    On behalf of a grateful community, I thank our lifeguards for the  level of skill they bring to this job and what they do for Virginia  Beach and Hampton Roads. Congratulations to the Virginia Beach  Lifesaving Service on a successful summer season.                            ____________________
