 Madam Speaker, here in Washington, we are  currently in the middle of an important debate on the Federal budget.   It is clear that dramatic changes need to be made in the way that  taxpayer dollars are spent. We need to get our Nation's fiscal house in  order.   As we consider important reforms, we would be wise to turn to my home  State of Indiana. Last week, Indiana State Auditor Tera Klutz announced  that our State currently has a rainy day fund of nearly $1.8 billion.  Contrast that with a nearly $20 trillion national debt here in  Washington.   As Auditor Klutz noted in a press conference last week: ``Hoosiers  can rest assured that their government takes the task of managing  taxpayers' money seriously. Just like people across the State live  within their means, Indiana has worked hard to spend less than we take  in, invest in our priorities, and retain resources in the event of an  economic downturn.''   To get our fiscal house in order, we need more of this Hoosier common  sense in Washington. The attitude and approach that has worked well in  Indiana should be a model for the Nation.                            ____________________
