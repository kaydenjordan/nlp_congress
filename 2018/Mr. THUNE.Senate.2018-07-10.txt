 Mr. President, there are a lot of things you need to know  when you are considering voting on a candidate for Congress--for  example, what are his or her views on healthcare, taxes, the military,  the economy, the First Amendment? The list goes on and on. When it  comes to judges, there are only two important questions: One, is this  individual well-qualified, and two, does this person understand the  proper role of a judge? Unlike legislators' opinions, judges' political  opinions should be irrelevant because a good judge will leave his or  her political opinions outside the courtroom door. A good judge knows  that her job is to  [[Page S4859]]  judge based on the law and the facts, not political opinions or  personal feelings.   Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, whom we lost in 2016, had this  to say about the proper role of a judge:         If you're going to be a good and faithful judge, you have       to resign yourself to the fact that you're not always going       to like the conclusions you reach. If you like them all the       time, you're probably doing something wrong.    Current Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch has said more than once  that ``a judge who likes every outcome he reaches is very likely a bad  judge.''   Last night, the President nominated Judge Brett Kavanaugh to be the  next Supreme Court Justice. This is another outstanding pick from  President Trump. Like Justice Scalia and Justice Gorsuch, Judge  Kavanaugh understands that the job of a judge is to interpret the law,  not write it; to judge, not legislate; to call balls and strikes, not  rewrite the rules of the game.   His qualifications are outstanding. He is a graduate of Yale Law  School. He clerked for a Supreme Court Justice. He is a lecturer at  Harvard Law School. Most importantly, he has had an outstanding career  as a judge on the DC Circuit Court of Appeals, where he has handed down  thoughtful, well-reasoned decisions that reveal his deep respect for  the law and the Constitution. His opinions have been endorsed by the  Supreme Court more than a dozen times and are regularly cited by courts  around the country.   I am looking forward to sitting down with Judge Kavanaugh during the  confirmation process. We are going to follow regular order on this  nominee, just as we did with Justice Gorsuch. The Judiciary Committee  will vet Judge Kavanaugh, and Senators of both parties will have the  chance to sit down with him before the full Senate votes on his  nomination this fall.   Unfortunately, a number of Senate Democrats have already made it  clear that they are going to make this process as partisan as possible.  One Democratic Senator--the senior Senator from Pennsylvania--put out a  statement yesterday announcing his intention to oppose the President's  Supreme Court nominee before the President had even made his  announcement. That is right--the Democratic Senator from Pennsylvania  decided he wasn't even going to pretend to examine the nominee's  qualifications. Instead, he announced his intention to oppose the  nominee before he even knew whom he was opposing. That is,  unfortunately, par for the course for the Democratic Party.   If one thing has been clear since Justice Kennedy announced his  retirement, it is that Democrats are not interested in a nominee's  qualifications or commitment to the rule of law; they are interested in  a nominee's political opinions. They are ready to disqualify any  nominee who doesn't share their political views.   Democrats' apparent belief that the only good judge is a judge who  will use his role to advance their agenda is deeply disturbing. It  betrays Democrats' failure to understand or their decision to ignore  the fundamental purpose of the judiciary. Our judicial system was  designed to secure the rights of citizens under the law, not to serve  as the arm of a particular political party. Nobody's rights can be  secure when judges start ruling based on political ideology instead of  on the law.   Fortunately for the rule of law, President Trump doesn't believe in  nominating judges based on their agreement with his personal opinions.  Instead, he believes in nominating judges who understand that their job  is to rule based on the law and the Constitution. That is exactly what  he has done with Judge Kavanaugh.   I look forward to the process the Senate will undertake, starting  with examining this judge's record, having hearings in the Judiciary  Committee, and ultimately having a debate on the floor of the U.S.  Senate and eventually a vote on this judge, this nominee's nomination  to the Supreme Court.   It is an important matter, one that the Constitution charges the  Senate with and one that we need to take very seriously. I intend--as I  hope most of my colleagues do--to give fair consideration to this very  qualified nominee, to examine his record, have him answer the hard  questions, and then to have an opportunity to vote up or down.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
