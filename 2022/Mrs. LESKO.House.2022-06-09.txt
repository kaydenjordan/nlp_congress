 Madam Speaker, I thank Representative Jordan for yielding  time.   I rise in opposition to H.R. 2377. I have five grandchildren. I would  do anything--anything--to protect my five grandchildren, including, as  a last resort, shooting someone if I had to, to protect the lives of my  grandchildren.   Democrat bills that we have heard this week want to take away my  right--my right--to protect my grandchildren. They want to take away  the rights of law-abiding citizens to protect their own children and  grandchildren and wives and brothers and sisters. This bill takes away  due process from law-abiding citizens.   Can you imagine if you had a disgruntled ex or somebody who hates you  because of your political views, and they go to a judge and say, ``Oh,  this person is dangerous''? That judge would take away their guns, lean  on the side of conservatism and take away their guns, without that  person even having knowledge that there was a court hearing that would  take away their guns. This is wrong.   When Republicans were in the majority, we actually passed legislation  that was signed into law that would have prevented mass shootings.  These bills will not. We need to join together, Republicans and  Democrats. I hope they can do it in the Senate and get something done  that actually saves children's lives.
