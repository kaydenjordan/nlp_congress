Upon adoption of this resolution it shall be in       order to consider in the House the bill (H.R. 6082) to amend       the Public Health Service Act to protect the confidentiality       of substance use disorder patient records. All points of       order against consideration of the bill are waived. An       amendment in the nature of a substitute consisting of the       text of Rules Committee Print 115-75 shall be considered as       adopted. The bill, as amended, shall be considered as read.       All points of order against provisions in the bill, as       amended, are waived. The previous question shall be       considered as ordered on the bill, as amended, and on any       further amendment thereto, to final passage without       intervening motion except: (1) one hour of debate equally       divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority       member of the Committee on Energy and Commerce; and (2) one       motion to recommit with or without instructions.        Sec. 4.  In the engrossment of H.R. 6, the Clerk shall--         (a) add the respective texts of H.R. 2851, H.R. 5735, and       H.R. 5797, as passed by the House, as new matter at the end       of H.R. 6;        (b) assign appropriate designations to provisions within       the engrossment; and        (c) conform cross-references and provisions for short       titles within the engrossment.     Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the  customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr.  McGovern), pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume.  During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the  purpose of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 949 provides for the  consideration of three important bills aimed at curbing the deadly  opioid epidemic plaguing this country and providing Americans with the  tools to overcome their addictions: H.R. 6, the Substance Use-Disorder  Prevention that Promotes Opioid Recovery and Treatment for Patients and  Communities Act, or the SUPPORT Act; H.R. 5797, the Individuals in  Medicaid Deserve Care that is Appropriate and Responsible in its  Execution Act; and H.R. 6082, the Overdose Prevention and Patient  Safety Act.   The three bills included in today's rule all seek to accomplish one  goal: assist Americans struggling with opioid addiction in controlling  their addictions and moving forward in achieving productive and healthy  lives.   The rule provides for 1 hour of debate on H.R. 6, equally divided and  controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on  Energy and Commerce. The rule makes in order eight amendments offered  by both Republicans and Democrats. Further, the rule provides the  minority with one motion to recommit with or without instructions.   The resolution also provides for a structured rule for H.R. 5797,  allowing 1 hour of debate to be divided and controlled between the  chair and ranking minority member of the Energy and Commerce Committee.  The rule also provides for debate on an amendment by Mrs. Mimi Walters  of California, an active member of the Energy and Commerce Committee.  Finally, the rule provides the minority with the customary motion to  recommit with or without instructions.   The final bill included in today's resolution, H.R. 6082, will also  receive 1 hour of debate on the House floor, equally divided and  controlled by the chair and ranking member of the Energy and Commerce  Committee. As the Committee on Rules received no germane amendments to  H.R. 6082, no amendments were made in order in today's rule. The  minority does receive the customary motion to recommit with or without  instructions.   The statistics that many of us have heard on numerous occasions--at  our district townhalls, in opioid roundtables with stakeholders,  constituent meetings in our offices, and in our committee hearings--are  truly heartbreaking stories, with more than 115 people dying in the  United States every day from an opioid overdose. That is five people  per hour.   According to national reports, emergency room visits and opioid  overdose deaths have more than quadrupled in the last 15 years, and a  preliminary analysis indicates those numbers are to rise. The misuse of  and addiction to opioids--including prescription pain medications,  heroin, and synthetic opioids such as fentanyl--is, indeed, an urgent  national crisis that continues to threaten our public health, social  fabric, and economic welfare. Both community hospitals and local  paramedics are frequently coming across people overdosing on an opioid  drug or a drug laced with fentanyl.   The opioid epidemic has affected families not only in my district in  north Texas, but in communities large and small from Maine to  California. It has also impacted American employers and businesses due  to lost productivity and difficulty finding qualified candidates for  employment. President Trump is right to call this epidemic the ``crisis  next door.''   The efforts of the Energy and Commerce Committee in the Comprehensive  Addiction and Recovery Act and the 21st Century Cures Act in the  previous Congress were a good start, delivering critical funding and  resources to communities hit most hard by the opioid epidemic. But  there was much more we still could do.   To start this process, the Energy and Commerce Health Subcommittee,  which I chair, held a Member Day last October, where more than 50  bipartisan Members of this body, both on and off the committee, shared  their personal stories from their districts and offered their  solutions. This was followed by a series of three legislative hearings  with markups where nearly 60 bills were considered and advanced to the  full Energy and Commerce Committee that acted on these bills shortly  thereafter.   The culmination of the work from the Energy and Commerce Committee  and other House committees has brought us to consider many of these  policies over the course of the last 2 weeks on the House floor. It  required an all-hands-on-deck approach, and I believe the American  people will see that, by this week's end, we did, indeed, come together  in a bipartisan fashion and worked to address this crisis.   Today's rule provides for consideration of three important bills that  will expand treatment options, deliver lifesaving services, and make  necessary public health reforms, including Medicare and Medicaid, to  bolster prevention and recovery efforts.   First, H.R. 5797, the Individuals in Medicaid Deserve Care that is  Appropriate and Responsible in its Execution Act, the IMD CARE Act,  allows State Medicaid programs to remove the institutions for mental  diseases exclusion for beneficiaries aged 21 to 64 with an opioid use  disorder for 5 years' time. The bill provides the continuum of care  [[Page H5296]]  by removing a barrier of care under current law, so Medicaid can cover  up to a total of 30 days of care in an institute for mental disease  during a 12-month period, and eligible enrollees can get the care that  they actually need.   The IMD exclusion is one of the treatment barriers consistently  identified by State Medicaid directors, health policy experts, and many  provider groups. Currently, this exclusion under Medicaid significantly  limits the circumstances under which Federal Medicaid matching funds  are available for inpatient services or for outpatient treatments.    Unfortunately, this policy has barred individuals with an opioid use  disorder and mental illness from accessing short-term, acute care in  psychiatric hospitals, or receiving treatment in residential substance  use disorder treatment facilities. A 2017 Medicaid and CHIP Payment and  Access Commission report stated that the Medicaid IMD exclusion is one  of the few examples in the Medicaid program where Federal financial  participation cannot be used for medically necessary and otherwise  covered services for a specific Medicaid population receiving treatment  in a specific setting.   In the midst of the opioid crisis, States must leverage all available  tools to combat this epidemic. Section 1115 demonstration waivers are  an important tool, but, so far, less than half of the States have  sought or received an appropriate waiver from the Centers for Medicare  and Medicaid Services to help patients with substance use disorder.   The IMD CARE Act also allows States the option to use the State plan  amendment process, which is generally faster than using waivers. Under  this process, once a State plan amendment is submitted, the Centers for  Medicare and Medicaid Services has 90 days to decide or the proposed  change will automatically go into effect.   H.R. 5797 amends an outdated law that has been in effect since the  enactment of the Medicaid program in 1965. Since that time, there have  been advances in behavioral health, and there have been advances in  addiction treatment services where more, improved treatment options now  exist.   It is long overdue to revisit this policy so that State Medicaid  programs can better meet patients' needs and physicians can determine  the most appropriate setting for care based on an individual's  treatment plan.   Next, H.R. 6082, the Overdose Prevention and Patient Safety Act,  makes timely reforms to a privacy law that affects patient access to  healthcare and creates barriers to treatment. Specifically, the bill  updates the Public Health Service Act to permit substance use disorder  records to be shared among covered entities and 42 CFR part 2 programs  by aligning part 2 with the Health Insurance Portability and  Accountability Act of 1996 for the purposes of treatment, payment, and  healthcare operations.                                time  1030    As a physician, I believe it is vital that when making clinical  decisions, I have all of the appropriate information to make the  correct determination in the treatment of a particular patient. Those  suffering from substance use disorder should receive the same level of  treatment and care as other individuals.   Patients afflicted with substance use disorder deserve to be treated  by physicians who are armed with all of the necessary information to  provide the best possible care.   I certainly do understand and respect that patient privacy protection  is paramount and should be held in the highest regard.   The Overdose Prevention and Patient Safety Act maintains the original  intent of the 1970s statute behind 42 CFR part 2 by protecting patients  and improving care coordination. In fact, this bill increases  protections for those seeking treatment by more severely penalizing  those who share patient data to noncovered entities and non-part 2  programs than under the current statute, with certain exceptions.   Lastly, it requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to,  among other things, issue regulations prohibiting discrimination based  on disclosed health data and requiring covered entities to provide  written notice of privacy practices.   The issue of the stigma associated with substance use disorder has  been a constant in many of the discussions members of the Energy and  Commerce Committee and the stakeholders have had in both our offices  and in our hearings.   This carefully crafted legislation seeks to help break the stigma and  help individuals with this complex disease gain access to healthcare  and support services critical to getting them on the road to recovery.   We should not continue to silo the substance use disorder treatment  information of a select group of patients if we want to ensure that  these patients are indeed receiving quality care. This information  should be integrated into our medical records and comprehensive care  models to prevent situations where physicians, not knowing a patient's  substance use disorder, may prescribe medications that have significant  drug interactions, or worse, may prescribe a controlled substance that  makes their patient's substance use disorder worse.   As it currently stands, 42 CFR part 2 is actively prohibiting  physicians from ensuring proper treatment and patient safety and,  paradoxically, it is perpetuating that stigma.   Providing high quality healthcare is a team effort, but physicians  leading the team must have the necessary information to adequately  coordinate care. We must align payment, operations, and treatment to  allow coordination of both behavioral and physical health services for  individuals with substance use disorder.   There is a reason why the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services  Administration and most of the health stakeholder community are asking  for this change. Clearly, there is an issue here that must be  addressed. H.R. 6082 achieves the goal and contributes to Congress'  effort in trying to stem the current crisis.   Finally, Mr. Speaker, H.R. 6, the Substance Use-Disorder Prevention  that Promotes Opioid Recovery and Treatment for Patients and  Communities Act, is a package of bills that reform Medicare, Medicaid,  and other health provisions to further combat this crisis by advancing  many critical initiatives.   As we all know, this opioid epidemic is in our hospitals, but it is  also in our living rooms and on our streets. Our partners at Federal  agencies must rise to the challenge and deliver vital resources for  States and communities most devastated by the crisis. The SUPPORT for  Patients and Communities Act will provide our Department of Health and  Human Services, including the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid  Services and the Food and Drug Administration, with the necessary tools  to address this crisis.   Title I of H.R. 6 addresses the ways in which Medicaid can be used to  increase access to quality care and management for individuals  suffering from substance use disorders. Some of these changes in  Medicaid reflect the success of our State Medicaid programs by  implementing State successes at the Federal level.   Section 101 under title I will expand protection for at-risk youth by  requiring State Medicaid programs to restore Medicaid coverage of a  juvenile following their release from incarceration. The next section  also allows former foster youth to maintain their Medicaid coverage  across State lines until they turn 26 years of age. These are  vulnerable populations of individuals that will greatly benefit from  increased access to treatment.   Section 105 builds on the current State Medicaid drug utilization  review, which saves money and promotes patient safety. This section  will require State Medicaid programs to have safety edits in place for  opioid refills, monitor concurrent prescribing of opioids and certain  other drugs, and monitor antipsychotic prescribing for children.   Care for mothers suffering from substance use disorder and their  babies who are born with neonatal abstinence syndrome is a growing  problem in the face of this epidemic. Section 106 requires HHS to  improve care for these infants with neonatal abstinence syndrome and  their mothers. It also requires that the General Accountability Office  study the gaps in Medicaid coverage for pregnant and postpartum women  with substance use disorders.  [[Page H5297]]    Section 107 of the bill provides additional incentives for Medicaid  health homes for patients with substance use disorder.   Mr. Speaker, these health homes will allow States to create a  comprehensive person-centered system of care coordination for primary  care, acute and behavioral healthcare, including mental health and  substance use. As our healthcare system moves towards caring for the  whole person, it is important that we enable our physicians and our  payers to provide that comprehensive care.   The SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act also enables better pain  management for our Nation's Medicare beneficiaries, ranging from  increased access to substance use disorder treatment, including through  the use of telehealth, to modification of physician payment for certain  nonopioid treatments in Ambulatory Surgery Centers.    Title II of the bill contains Medicare provisions that encourage the  use of nonopioid analgesics where appropriate and also aims to decrease  fraud and abuse regarding prescriptions by requiring e-prescribing for  the coverage of Medicare Part D controlled substances.   H.R. 6 strives to provide support for at-risk beneficiaries who might  fall victim to substance use disorder. Section 206 of the bill  accelerates the development and the use of drug management programs for  at-risk beneficiaries. While this program is currently voluntary, by  plan year 2021, it will become a mandatory program.   Lastly, the bill expands Medicare coverage to include opioid  treatment programs for the purpose of providing medication-assisted  treatment. Opioid treatment programs are not currently Medicare  providers, which forces Medicare beneficiaries who need medication- assisted treatment to pay out-of-pocket costs for those services. These  efforts should provide improved access to treatment for Medicare  beneficiaries who have substance use disorders while also incentivizing  the use of opioid alternatives, which hopefully will prevent the  development of substance use disorders.   Even though an estimated 46,000 Americans died from opioid overdoses  from October 2016 to October 2017, there is a lack of innovation and a  lack of investment in the development of nonaddictive pain and  addiction treatment.   A bill that I introduced, H.R. 5806, the 21st Century Tools for Pain  and Addiction Treatments, is included in section 301 on H.R. 6 and  requires the Food and Drug Administration to hold at least one public  meeting to address the challenges and the barriers of developing  nonaddictive medical products intended to treat pain or addiction.   The Food and Drug Administration is also required to issue or update  existing guidance documents to help address challenges to developing  nonaddictive medical products to treat pain or addiction.   Mr. Speaker, I did work closely with the Food and Drug Administration  to get the policy in this section correct and to ensure that it will  clarify those pathways for products that, in fact, are so desperately  needed by America's patients.   I have remaining concerns about the language in section 303 that will  allow nonphysician providers to prescribe buprenorphine. While I  understand and greatly appreciate the intent to increase access to  medication-assisted treatment, as a physician, I also respect how  complicated the treatment of patients suffering from substance use  disorder may be.   The Hippocratic Oath, we all know, is to first, do no harm. Patient  safety should be our highest priority.   This is a complex patient population, Mr. Speaker. On average, people  with substance use disorder die 20 years sooner than other Americans.   Additionally, buprenorphine is a schedule III drug that can be  misused and could exacerbate the underlying problem. I am unsure about  expanding these authorities to additional nonphysician providers at the  risk of making the problem worse. I have worked to strengthen the  reporting requirements of this section of H.R. 6 and look forward to  reviewing that report on this particular policy.   Taken together, H.R. 6, the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act,  will improve access to care for individuals suffering from substance  use disorder, provide our healthcare system with tools and resources  that it needs to care for patients, and to help prevent future misuse  of opioids.   Before I close, I would like to share a quote from President Trump.  He said: ``Together, we will face this challenge as a national family  with conviction, with unity, and with a commitment to love and support  our neighbors in times of dire need. Working together, we will defeat  this opioid epidemic.''   The number of bills and policies advanced on the House floor in the  last 2 weeks illustrates our shared commitment, and I am confident that  we will make significant progress in defeating this epidemic.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support today's rule and the  three underlying bills that are critical to our Nation's effort to stem  the opioid crisis.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Costello), a fellow member on the Committee of Energy  and Commerce.    I yield the gentleman from Pennsylvania an additional 1  minute.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute.   I do want to remind everyone that 18 months ago, in the previous  Congress, with the passage of the 21st Century Cures Act and the  Comprehensive Addiction Recovery Act, CARA, $1 billion was made  available for treating people with substance use disorder. That was  then supplemented with the passage of the more recent appropriations  bill last month--2 months ago, with $4 billion.                                time  1100    Unprecedented amounts of money have been made available in the last  18 months to combat this crisis.   And then, finally, it is very, very difficult to integrate care if  you don't reform the 42 CFR part 2, which is before us today.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 2 minutes.   Mr. Speaker, the good news is that all forms of medication-assisted  treatment are required for 5 years under H.R. 6. So I look forward to  the gentleman's support when we get to the vote, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I don't need to remind anyone that the lie of the year  for 2012 was: If you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor--words  that will ring through this body probably for the rest of time.   I want to read from the Statement of Administration Policy, back to  the business at hand, the rule on the three bills that we are  considering today. This is the Statement of Administration Policy:  ``Addressing the opioid crisis has been a top priority of the President  since day one, and the administration welcomes legislation that  complements its efforts to end the opioid crisis. The administration  strongly supports House passage of bipartisan bills to protect patients  enrolled in Medicare and Medicaid, create targeted programs for at-risk  populations, expand access to medication-assisted treatment for opioid  use disorders, and provide resources for States and communities  struggling to deal with the scale of the opioid crisis.''   The statement goes on, and it concludes: ``These initiatives  represent bold, evidence-based steps to prevent and treat opioid abuse,  and will help save the lives of countless Americans. The administration  commends the House on taking up these important bills. . . . The  administration supports House passage of H.R. 5797, H.R. 6082, and H.R.  6. . . .''   Mr. Speaker, today's rule provides for the consideration of these  three important pieces of legislation aimed at  [[Page H5302]]  addressing the opioid crisis affecting so many of our fellow Americans.   H.R. 6, the Substance Use-Disorder Prevention that Promotes Opioid  Recovery and Treatment for Patients and Communities Act; H.R. 5797, the  Individuals in Medicaid Deserve Care that is Appropriate and  Responsible in its Execution Act; and H.R. 6082, the Overdose  Prevention and Patient Safety Act, will all play a critical role in  treating patients and providing Americans the tools to put the pieces  of their lives back together again.   I commend Chairman Walden for his efforts on bringing so many Members  of this body into the discussion and taking the many ideas offered by  Members, incorporating them into the legislative products. The result  of those efforts is a legislative trio that this entire body can be  proud of, and this entire body can support.   I, therefore, urge my colleagues to support today's rule and the  three underlying pieces of legislation.   The text of the material previously referred to by Mr. McGovern is as  follows:            An Amendment to H. Res. 949 Offered by Mr. McGovern         At the end of the resolution, add the following new       sections:        Sec. 5. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the       Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare       the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on       the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R.       4501) to increase funding for the State response to the       opioid misuse crisis and to provide funding for research on       addiction and pain related to the substance misuse crisis.       The first reading of the bill shall be dispensed with. All       points of order against consideration of the bill are waived.       General debate shall be confined to the bill and shall not       exceed one hour equally divided and controlled by the chair       and ranking minority member of the Committee on Energy and       Commerce. After general debate the bill shall be considered       for amendment under the five-minute rule. All points of order       against provisions in the bill are waived. At the conclusion       of consideration of the bill for amendment the Committee       shall rise and report the bill to the House with such       amendments as may have been adopted. The previous question       shall be considered as ordered on the bill and amendments       thereto to final passage without intervening motion except       one motion to recommit with or without instructions. If the       Committee of the Whole rises and reports that it has come to       no resolution on the bill, then on the next legislative day       the House shall, immediately after the third daily order of       business under clause 1 of rule XIV, resolve into the       Committee of the Whole for further consideration of the bill.        Sec. 6. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H.R. 4501.          The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means         This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous       question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote.       A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote       against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow       the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a       vote about what the House should be debating.        Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of       Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the       previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or       control the consideration of the subject before the House       being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous       question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the       subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling       of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the       House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes       the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to       offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the       majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated       the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to       a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to       recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said:       ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman       from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to       yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first       recognition.''        The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous       question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an       immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no       substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.''       But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the       Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in       the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition,       page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous       question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally       not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member       controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of       offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by       voting down the previous question on the rule. . . . When the       motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the       time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering       the previous question. That Member, because he then controls       the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for       the purpose of amendment.''        In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of       Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special       Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on       such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on       Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further       debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues:       ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a       resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control       shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous       question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who       controls the time for debate thereon.''        Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does       have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only       available tools for those who oppose the Republican       majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the       opportunity to offer an alternative plan.     Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I  move the previous question on the resolution.    Mr. Speaker, pursuant to clause 4 of rule XVI, I move  that when the House adjourns on Wednesday, June 20, 2018, it adjourn to  meet at 9 a.m. on Thursday, June 21, 2018, for morning-hour debate and  10 a.m. for legislative business.    Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 949, I call up  the bill (H.R. 6082) to amend the Public Health Service Act to protect  the confidentiality of substance use disorder patient records, and ask  for its immediate consideration in the House.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their  remarks and insert extraneous material on H.R. 6082.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  [[Page H5327]]    Mr. Speaker, over the course of the past several months, the Energy  and Commerce's Subcommittee on Health held four legislative hearings on  bills to address the opioid epidemic and reported 57 bills to the full  committee. Of those 57 bills, only one received its own discrete  hearing. That bill was H.R. 6082, the Overdose Prevention and Patient  Safety Act, introduced by Representatives Mullin and Blumenauer.                                time  1245    As a physician, I believe it is vital that doctors have all of the  appropriate information to determine the proper course of treatment for  a patient, ensuring patient safety and privacy, as required by Federal  regulation known as HIPAA. The Overdose Prevention and Patient Safety  Act maintains the original intent of the 1970s statute behind 42 CFR  part 2 by protecting patients and improving care coordination.   In fact, the bill increases protections for those seeking treatment  by more severely penalizing those who illegally share patient data than  under the current statute. Current part 2 law does not protect  individuals from discrimination based on their treatment records and,  to this date, there have been no criminal actions undertaken to enforce  part 2.   This bill has a wide range of support from national and State  organizations. Since the bill was introduced, the Energy and Commerce  Committee has heard from over 100 organizations in its support.   Arguably, the most notable support for this legislation comes from  the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration in the  Department of Health and Human Services. Dr. Elinore McCance-Katz, the  Assistant Secretary for Mental Health and Substance Use, wrote to Mr.  Mullin in March, stating that SAMHSA ``is encouraged to see Congress  examine the benefits of aligning part 2 with HIPAA. Patient privacy is,  of course, critical but so too is patient access to safe, effective,  and coordinated treatment.''   I agree with Dr. McCance-Katz that in order to ensure patient safety,  physicians must have secure access to patient records, including  substance use disorder information. When this information is not  provided to healthcare professionals, they may end up prescribing  medications that have dangerous drug interactions or may lead a patient  who is in recovery to be inappropriately prescribed an opioid and fall  back into addiction.   One particular complication driven by 42 CFR part 2 directly impacts  the care for pregnant women and their infants. For women who are  pregnant, part 2 does not allow redisclosure of substance use disorder  medical documentation to the women's OB/GYN doctor, primary care  physician, or health home without their written consent. This leads to  fragmented care, which opens up the mother and her baby to potential  harm.   Centerstone, one of the Nation's largest not-for-profit healthcare  organizations, notes that ``mothers who continue to use during  pregnancy and who do not wish to sign secondary releases to allow their  care providers to treat them comprehensively put their unborn children  at risk for addiction.''   Centerstone watches these women and their infants suffer right before  their eyes, but, because of part 2, Centerstone cannot share the  information to ensure that the mother and baby are getting proper care.   As an OB/GYN physician myself, I cannot imagine having this  information withheld. Such a situation would leave me with the  inability to treat the whole patient and ensure that the mother is  healthy and her baby is not on a path for addiction.   In another situation, a patient was referred to a treatment center  following an emergency room visit for an overdose. The patient was not  able to give written consent to his providers due to acute  intoxication. Due to a lack of written consent and 42 CFR part 2, the  treatment facility could not communicate to the ER and learn about the  patient's condition or confirm that the patient had, indeed, enrolled  in a drug treatment center, further delaying critical care  coordination.   There is clear evidence that part 2 is a massive roadblock to  providing safe, quality, and coordinated care to individuals suffering  from substance use disorder.   The issue of the stigma associated with substance use disorder has  been a constant in all of the discussions that we have had, both in our  offices and in our hearings. In April, we heard from numerous  individuals who were parents of children who died from opioid  overdoses. Some noted that their children were afraid to seek help from  their families or from healthcare professionals because they were  embarrassed or they felt stigmatized.   We should enable physicians to fully care for these patients  suffering from substance use disorder as if they had any other disease.  The Overdose Prevention and Patient Safety Act will do just that.   The first step in addressing a problem is admitting that it exists. I  would like to pose a question to those who are arguing against this  legislation:   If we continue to silo the substance use disorder treatment  information of a select group of patients rather than integrating it  into our medical records and comprehensive care models, how can we  ensure that these patients are, in fact, receiving quality care? How  can we really treat substance use disorder like all other complex  health conditions?   H.R. 6082 ensures adequate patient data protection in accordance with  Federal law, with HIPAA. There are provisions in the language that  ensure that the data may only be used for purposes of treatment,  payment, or healthcare operations. Substance use disorder data cannot  be used in criminal, civil, or administrative investigations, actions,  or proceedings without patient consent or a court order.   Additionally, the legislation explicitly prohibits discrimination  against an individual on the basis of their patient needs. Currently,  part 2 includes no antidiscrimination protections and no protections  for individuals if there is a data breach or improper disclosure.   Think about that for a minute, Mr. Speaker. This was a 1970s-era law.  There were not data breaches back in the 1970s. 42 CFR part 2 was never  intended to protect a patient in the instance of a data breach.   Should any entity or individual share patient data under H.R. 6082,  they, in fact, will be severely penalized.   There is a reason why SAMHSA and most of the healthcare stakeholder  community is asking for this change. Clearly, there is an issue here  that must be addressed. This opioid crisis is devastating our country.  Passing the Overdose Prevention and Patient Safety Act will enable  greater coordination among healthcare providers in providing quality,  effective care for individuals across the country who are battling  substance use disorder.    My thanks to Mr. Mullin on the Energy and Commerce Committee and to  Mr. Blumenauer for introducing this legislation that is of utmost  importance.   I urge strong support for the bill, and I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Oklahoma (Mr. Mullin), the principal sponsor of the bill and a valuable  member of the Energy and Commerce Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Oregon (Mr. Walden), the chairman of the full committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 2 minutes for the purpose of  response before I yield to Dr. Bucshon.   Mr. Speaker, the tragic story that was just related to us really only  reinforces the need to change the statute behind 42 CFR part 2. There  are some important facts missing from the description of the situation  that occurred.   It appears evident that at least one or both of the parties involved,  the judge, and/or the methadone maintenance program, violated existing  regulations under both part 2 and HIPAA.   Under part 2, patient records may only be disclosed without patient  consent if the disclosure is authorized by an appropriate order of a  court of competent jurisdiction. There must be a showing of good cause  in which the court must weigh the public interest and need for  disclosure against the injury to the patient, the physician-patient  relationship, and treatment services. Further, the court must impose  appropriate safeguards against unauthorized disclosure.   It is not clear from the description provided in the letter how the  judge found out about the patient's participation in a methadone  maintenance program. If the information to the judge was provided  without an appropriate court order, then the methadone maintenance  program likely violated the requirements under part 2 to safeguard the  patient's records from such disclosure. If the information was provided  as a result of a court order, then it is possible that the judge  violated his or her ethical obligations to appropriately weigh the need  for the information and safeguard the information once received.   Under HIPAA, there is still an obligation for the parties seeking  information to confirm that reasonable efforts have been made to ensure  that the individual has been given notice of the request for personal  health information and the opportunity to object or that reasonable  efforts have been made to secure a qualified protective order.  Compliance with either of these requirements appears to have been  lacking in the situation described in the letter.   All of this suggests that part 2 currently is insufficient to protect  patients in these situations. The legislation before us today does not  decrease the protections against the use of the records in criminal  proceedings that already exist under part 2, but HIPAA makes the  protections stronger.   I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Bucshon), a  valuable member of our committee and our subcommittee that has heard  the testimony on this legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Shimkus), a valuable member of the Energy and Commerce  Committee.   (Mr. SHIMKUS asked and was given permission to revise and extend his  remarks.)    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from Illinois.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 3 minutes.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to point out that there are over 100 groups  in support of the Partnership to Amend 42 CFR part 2. A letter from  that partnership says, in part:         We are pleased that the bill aligns part 2 with HIPAA's       consent requirements for the purposes of treatment, payment       and operations, which will allow for the appropriate sharing       of substance use disorder records, among covered entities, to       ensure persons with opioid use disorder and other substance       use disorders receive the integrated care that they need.       Additionally, as we do not want patients with substance use       disorders to be made vulnerable as a result of seeking       treatment for addiction, this legislation strengthens       protections and limits the number of institutions that have       access to their records.    I am not going to read all of the names on the list, but some of the  notable ones are the National Alliance on Mental Illness, Mental Health  America, Hazelden Betty Ford Foundation, National Governors  Association, Healthcare Leadership Council, American Hospital  Association, American Society of Addiction Medicine, Centerstone, New  Jersey Hospitals, and National Association of Addiction Treatment  Providers.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the entire list of all of the  groups in favor of the Partnership to Amend 42 CFR.  Partnership To Amend 42 CFR Part 2--A Coalition of Over 40 Health Care  Stakeholders Committed To Aligning 42 CFR Part 2 (Part 2) With HIPAA To   Allow Appropriate Access to Patient Information That Is Essential for                        Providing Whole-Person Care                                                      June 15, 2018.      Hon. Markwayne Mullin,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Earl Blumenauer,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representatives Mullin and Blumenauer: The undersigned       members of the Partnership to Amend 42 CFR Part 2       (Partnership) and additional stakeholder organizations       applaud your leadership on the issue of substance use       disorder privacy records. We strongly support the Overdose       Prevention and Patient Safety (OPPS) Act, H.R. 6082, which       will align 42 CFR Part 2 (Part 2) with the Health Insurance       Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) for the purposes       of health care treatment, payment, and operations (TPO). The       Partnership is pleased that the OPPS Act was voted out of the       Committee on Energy and Commerce with a bipartisan vote.  [[Page H5333]]         The Partnership is a coalition of more than 40       organizations representing stakeholders across the health       care spectrum committed to aligning Part 2 with HIPAA to       allow appropriate access to patient information that is       essential for providing whole-person care.        We are pleased that the bill aligns Part 2 with HIPAA's       consent requirements for the purposes of TPO, which will       allow for the appropriate sharing of substance use disorder       records, among covered entities, to ensure persons with       opioid use disorder and other substance use disorders receive       the integrated care they need. Additionally, as we do not       want patients with substance use disorders to be made       vulnerable as a result of seeking treatment for addiction,       this legislation strengthens protections and limits the       number of institutions that have access to patient records.        Thank you both for your leadership on this issue and we       look forward to working with you on helping to address the       opioid crisis by passing this important bipartisan       legislation on the floor of the U.S. House of       Representatives.

Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, by continuing to segregate substance use disorder  records means that we are willing to allow some patients to receive  care that is potentially lower quality at a higher cost.   Treating patient substance use disorder in isolation from their  medical and mental health conditions--which predominated care in the  1970s--is not the standard for good practice today. There is now  overwhelming evidence that patients' substance use disorders cannot be  treated in isolation from other healthcare conditions. In the 1970s  when part 2 was written, this was not widely accepted, and treatment  for addiction was largely separate from treatment for other illnesses.   Mr. Speaker, further, I would say that the problem here is we need to  treat addiction just like any other medical illness and improve our  outreach to patients who meet the criteria for treatment. Maintaining a  decades old, ineffective confidentiality law simply is not going to do  that.   I urge my colleagues to support the bill. It is a good bill supported  by Mr. Mullin and Mr. Blumenauer.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve a point of order against the  motion.    Mr. Speaker, I withdraw my point of order.    Mr. Speaker, I claim the time in opposition to the  motion.    Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote on the motion to  recommit as it will destroy the intent of the bill.    Eliminating the sharing of records for the purposes of treatment,  payment, and healthcare operations completely negates the entire  purpose of this initiative.   Aligning 42 CFR part 2 with HIPAA for purposes of treatment, payment,  and healthcare operations is the entire purpose of the legislation.   Opponents of this bill have offered no evidence or findings to back  up their claim that HIPAA is inadequate to protect sensitive data  contained in substance use disorder treatment records.   HIPAA is currently functioning well in protecting sensitive patient  information in a number of areas.   Real integration of behavioral health and primary care simply cannot  happen until we align 42 CFR part 2 with HIPAA.   The opposition of H.R. 6082 is not based on protecting privacy. It is  based on very specific distrust of the healthcare community to properly  provide care to people with substance use disorder--the very people  whom we are asking to help us with this.   Yet, the ranking member is strongly in favor of numerous bills that  seek to expand access to evidence-based medication-assisted treatment,  telehealth and integration with mainstream medicine--the very things  that demand alignment with HIPAA. So the thinking, Mr. Speaker, to be  kind, is incongruous.   Prohibiting the sharing of addiction medical records for treatment,  payment, and healthcare operations makes it impossible to prescribe the  latest substance use treatment medications safely.   Like most pharmaceuticals, buprenorphine and methadone have drug  interactions and interact with other medicines. Adverse events from  drug interactions can lead to emergency hospital visits, serious  injuries, or death.   We must amend part 2 so we can safely prescribe medication-assisted  treatment for patients. Put simply, standard clinical practices like  medication reconciliation are not feasible under the current Federal  law. For that reason, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the motion  to recommit. Vote ``yes'' on the underlying motion.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I want to thank Mrs. Walters for introducing  this legislation.   Throughout this committee's and subcommittee's work on opioids, the  IMD exclusion has been consistently identified by many stakeholders in  conversations not only in my office but with the subcommittee as a  barrier to care for Medicaid patients who need inpatient treatment.   In the face of an epidemic that is taking the lives of 115 Americans  on average every day, I believe this policy strikes the right balance.  The IMD CARE Act targets limited resources to remove a barrier to care  by allowing States to repeal the IMD exclusion for 5 years for Medicaid  beneficiaries between the ages of 21 and 64 who have an opioid use  disorder. This approach will provide States the flexibility to increase  access to institutional care for those who truly need it.    While getting a waiver from CMS for the IMD exclusion is a good  option for many States, less than half the States have applied for a  waiver. We are losing too many of our friends and neighbors each day to  this crisis to ask States to go through what can be a lengthy and  uncertain process to secure a waiver.   The IMD CARE Act allows States to act now to ensure their patients  who are suffering now from a terrible disease can get the care that  they need and get it now.   I ask my fellow Members to join me in support of Mrs. Walters' bill.
