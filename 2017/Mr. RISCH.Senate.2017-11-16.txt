 Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Blackrock  Land Exchange Act of 2017.   The legislation supports a mutually beneficial effort between the  Bureau of Land Management and the J.R. Simplot Company in Idaho that  began over 20 years ago. Simplot proposed an exchange of their  privately owned land with superior natural resources and recreational  opportunities for a similar sized parcel of BLM land adjacent to a  Simplot phosphate processing facility. This facility adds significant  value to the Pocatello, Idaho area as a large employer that sustains  over 350 jobs with an over $55 million annual economic impact.   In 2007, BLM issued a Final Decision Record on the Environmental  Assessment concluding the exchange would have no significant  environmental impact, which was reaffirmed in 2009 by the Department of  Interior Board of Land Appeals. However, the exchange has been held up  since 2011 due to the District Court for Idaho ruling that BLM needed  to prepare a full Environmental Impact Statement including detailed  future use to comply with the National Environmental Policy Act of  1969.   This raises the possibility of a dangerous precedent for future land  conveyances, as the exchange itself does not authorize further  activities. Future use of the proposed adjacent land by the phosphate  facility would still be subject to NEPA with opportunity for public  comment. Halting the Blackrock Land Exchange for this reason could  largely increase the scope, length, and cost of the NEPA process.   This bill will allow for this exchange in Idaho that has support  from--State and local government as well as various land users. It will  also protect future exchanges from cycles of unnecessary review and  litigation. The Blackrock Land Exchange Act of 2017 is in the best  interest of Idaho land users, local economies, and future utilization  of government land.   Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.                                  ______                                         By Mr. DURBIN (for himself, Mr. Blumenthal, Mr. Booker, Mr.          Cardin, Mr. Coons, Ms. Duckworth, Mr. Franken, Mrs. Gillibrand,          Ms. Klobuchar, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Van Hollen, Mr. Whitehouse, and          Mr. Schatz):   S. 2148. A bill to authorize dedicated domestic terrorism offices  within the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Justice,  and the Federal Bureau of Investigation to analyze and monitor domestic  terrorist activity and require the Federal Government to take steps to  prevent domestic terrorism; to the Committee on the Judiciary.
