 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 583) to amend the Communications Act of 1934 to provide for  enhanced penalties for pirate radio, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 583         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Preventing Illegal Radio       Abuse Through Enforcement Act'' or the ``PIRATE Act''.       SEC. 2. PIRATE RADIO ENFORCEMENT ENHANCEMENTS.         Title V of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 501 et       seq.) is amended by adding at the end the following new       section:       ``SEC. 511. ENHANCED PENALTIES FOR PIRATE RADIO BROADCASTING;                     ENFORCEMENT SWEEPS; REPORTING.         ``(a) Increased General Penalty.--Any person who willfully       and knowingly does or causes or suffers to be done any pirate       radio broadcasting shall be subject to a fine of not more       than $2,000,000.        ``(b) Violation of This Act, Rules, or Regulations.--Any       person who willfully and knowingly violates this Act or any       rule, regulation, restriction, or condition made or imposed       by the Commission under authority of this Act, or any rule,       regulation, restriction, or condition made or imposed by any       international radio or wire communications treaty or       convention, or regulations annexed thereto, to which the       United States is party, relating to pirate radio broadcasting       shall, in addition to any other penalties provided by law, be       subject to a fine of not more than $100,000 for each day       during which such offense occurs, in accordance with the       limit described in subsection (a).        ``(c) Annual Report.--Not later than 1 year after the date       of enactment of the PIRATE Act, and annually thereafter, the       Commission shall submit to the Committee on Energy and       Commerce of the House of Representatives and the Committee on       Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate a report       summarizing the implementation of this section and associated       enforcement activities for the previous fiscal year, which       may include the efforts by the Commission to enlist the       cooperation of Federal, State, and local law enforcement       personnel (including United States attorneys and the United       States Marshals Service) for service of process, collection       of fines or forfeitures, seizures of equipment, and       enforcement of orders.        ``(d) Enforcement Sweeps.--        ``(1) Annual sweeps.--Not less than once each year, the       Commission shall assign appropriate enforcement personnel to       focus specific and sustained attention on the elimination of       pirate radio broadcasting within the top 5 radio markets       identified as prevalent for such broadcasts. Such effort       shall include identifying, locating, and taking enforcement       actions designed to terminate such operations.        ``(2) Additional monitoring.--Within 6 months after       conducting the enforcement sweeps required by paragraph (1),       the Commission shall conduct monitoring sweeps to ascertain       whether the pirate radio broadcasting identified by       enforcement sweeps is continuing to broadcast and whether       additional pirate radio broadcasting is occurring.        ``(3) No effect on remaining enforcement.--Notwithstanding       paragraph (1), the Commission shall not decrease or diminish       the regular enforcement efforts targeted to pirate radio       broadcast stations for other times of the year.        ``(e) State and Local Government Authority.--The Commission       may not preempt any State or local law prohibiting pirate       radio broadcasting.        ``(f) Revision of Commission Rules Required.--The       Commission shall revise its rules to require that, absent       good cause, in any case alleging a violation of subsection       (a) or (b), the Commission shall proceed directly to issue a       notice of apparent liability without first issuing a notice       of unlicensed operation.        ``(g) Pirate Radio Broadcasting Database.--        ``(1) In general.--Not later than 90 days after the date of       the enactment of this section, and semi-annually thereafter,       the Commission shall publish a database in a clear and       legible format of all licensed radio stations operating in       the AM and FM bands. The database shall be easily accessible       from the Commission home page through a direct link. The       database shall include the following information:        ``(A) Each licensed station, listed by the assigned       frequency, channel number, or Commission call letters.        ``(B) All entities that have received a notice of       unlicensed operation, notice of apparent liability, or       forfeiture order issued by the Commission.        ``(2) Clear identification.--The Commission shall clearly       identify in the database--        ``(A) each licensed station as a station licensed by the       Commission; and        ``(B) each entity described in paragraph (1)(B) as       operating without a Commission license or authorization.        ``(h) Definition of Pirate Radio Broadcasting.--In this       section, the term `pirate radio broadcasting' means the       transmission of communications on spectrum frequencies       between 535 and 1705 kilohertz, inclusive, or 87.7 and 108       megahertz, inclusive, without a license issued by the       Commission, but does not include unlicensed operations in       compliance with part 15 of title 47, Code of Federal       Regulations.''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the measure under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to support H.R. 583, the Preventing Illegal Radio  Abuse Through Enforcement Act, or PIRATE Act, a bill sponsored by  myself and Mr. Bilirakis. This measure is a bipartisan, commonsense  bill that passed the House last Congress.   Mr. Speaker, first, a heartfelt thank you to everyone who has worked  on this measure. I thank Representative Bilirakis for agreeing to lead  this effort with me in this Congress. I thank our former colleague,  Congressman Leonard Lance, for all his work on this bill in the past.  And I thank the New York State broadcasters for their dedication.   For years, I, along with many Members of the New York and New Jersey  delegations, have voiced our concern that pirate radio operators are a  threat to Americans' public health and safety. Yet these lawbreakers  are as prevalent as ever, and their actions have been met with few  consequences. This legislation responds directly to that threat.   The FCC has taken some positive steps to remedy this issue, but more  needs to be done.   In short, the PIRATE Act would increase penalties and restrictions on  pirate radio.   Whether a radio frequency is being used by first responders  coordinating to save lives, or parents who want to keep obscenity and  bigotry away from their children, for example, our communities are  better served when broadcasters respect the rule of law.   Previous drafts of the PIRATE Act included provisions creating  liability for those who facilitate illegal pirate radio operation.  These provisions were removed as being duplicative with existing law.  For example, under current law, the FCC can hold a property owner  liable for allowing a pirate radio operator access or other assistance.   Cutting these provisions should not be taken as limiting the  Commission's authority to assess fines against those who assist illegal  pirate operations. On the contrary, the consequences established in  this act would also apply in these contexts.  [[Page H2051]]    The text of the bill before us today includes changes that were  requested in the Senate last Congress.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record letters of support for H.R. 583  from the 50 State broadcast associations.                                                  January 18, 2019.      50 State Broadcasters Associations Urge Passage of the           Bipartisan PIRATE Act      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Speaker, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Mitch McConnell,      Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Kevin McCarthy,      Minority Leader, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Charles Schumer,      Minority Leader, U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Pelosi and Leaders McCarthy, McConnell and       Schumer: The undersigned broadcasters associations       representing local, over-the-air broadcast stations in all 50       States, the District of Columbia and the Commonwealth of       Puerto Rico urge your swift consideration and passage of the       Preventing Illegal Radio Abuse Through Enforcement (PIRATE)       Act (H.R. 583). The PIRATE Act would provide the Federal       Communications Commission (FCC) with critical new enforcement       measures to combat pirate radio operations. Last Congress,       substantially similar bipartisan legislation (H.R. 5709,       115th) passed the House of Representatives unanimously.        For years unauthorized pirate radio stations have harmed       communities across the country by undermining the Emergency       Alert System, interfering with airport communications, posing       direct health risks and interfering with licensed stations'       abilities to serve their listeners. The time has come to take       significant steps to resolve this vexing problem.        The PIRATE Act gives the FCC additional tools to address       the growing pirate radio problem. It provides the authority       to levy increased fines up to $100,000 per violation and       $2,000,000 in total. The PIRATE Act streamlines the       enforcement process and requires the FCC to conduct pirate       radio enforcement sweeps in cities with a concentration of       pirate radio stations. It recognizes the importance of FCC       coordination with federal, state and local law enforcement       authorities. Finally, the PIRATE Act would create a database       of all licensed radio stations operating in the AM and FM       bands as well as those entities that have been subject to       enforcement actions for illegal operation.        We are reaching the point where illegal pirate stations       undermine the legitimacy and purpose of the FCC's licensing       system to the detriment of listeners in communities across       the country. The PIRATE Act will help the FCC restore       integrity to the system. For these reasons, local       broadcasters across our great nation fully support the       bipartisan PIRATE Act and urge its swift passage without       changes.            Respectfully,        Sharon Tinsley, Alabama Broadcasters Association; Cathy       Hiebert, Alaska Broadcasters Association; Christopher Kline,       Arizona Broadcasters Association; Luke Story, Arkansas       Broadcasters Association; Joe Berry, California Broadcasters       Association; Justin Sasso, Colorado Broadcasters Association;       Michael Patrick Ryan, Connecticut Broadcasters Association;       C.

Mr. Speaker, H.R. 583 is a bipartisan, commonsense advance  in the laws that support our first responders and protect our  communities. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation so it can  be taken up in the Senate and signed into law.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further Members who choose to  speak. I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, to close, I believe that this measure, H.R.  583, moves us forward in a way that better protects public health and  safety. It has the endorsement of many in the field, including 50 State  broadcast associations.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage our colleagues to support H.R. 583, and I  yield back the balance of my time.
