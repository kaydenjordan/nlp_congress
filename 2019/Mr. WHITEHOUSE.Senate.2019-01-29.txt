 Madam President, I am very happy to be joined by my  colleague from New Hampshire, Senator Hassan. I ask unanimous consent  that she be recognized to speak at the conclusion of my remarks.    Madam President, we are here to talk about the risks  to our New England coastal communities from the climate changes coming  our way.   Despite the really dirty efforts of the fossil fuel industry to keep  the truth at bay, the tide of public understanding is turning. A recent  survey by Yale and George Mason Universities found that 73 percent of  Americans now see global warming happening. That number is up 10  percentage points since 2015. Similarly, the percentage of Americans  who consider global warming an important issue rose from 63 percent to  72 percent in the past 10 years. In just the past year, the number of  Americans who say they are worried about global warming jumped from 61  to 69 percent. One author of this research explained the results to the  New York Times this way:         People are beginning to understand that climate change is       here in the United States, here in my state, in my community,       affecting the people and places I care about, and now. This       isn't happening in 50 years, 100 years from now.    Dr. Katharine Hayhoe of Texas Tech University echoed these  sentiments, saying: ``Today, nearly everyone can point to a way that  they are personally witnessing and are being personally affected by the  impacts of a changing climate in the places where they live.''   Perhaps nowhere is this more true than along our coasts, where  manmade climate change is already flooding towns, driving fisheries  away from traditional fishing grounds, and bringing ashore stronger  storms riding on higher seas.   Last Tuesday, I picked up my home State paper, the Providence  Journal, and I saw this headline splashed across the front page  regarding climate change: ``Washed Away. . . . Home values lost to  rising sea levels.''   This is a study I have mentioned before. It was done by the First  Street Foundation and researchers at Columbia University and looks at  what escalating flood risk is doing to coastal housing markets. That  study started in Florida--peer-reviewed work in Florida--and they took  that methodology and have been working their way up the gulf coast and  the New England coast since then. They just reached my State and  Senator Hassan's State, and the report is not pleasant. They found that  Massachusetts, Maine, New Hampshire, and Rhode Island lost a total of  $403 million in expected property value between 2005 and 2017 due to  increased tidal flooding risks. Just between 2005 and 2017, Rhode  Island coastal properties lost nearly $45 million in expected value.  The study called out these particular properties in Warren, RI, that  lost over one-third of their value during that timeframe. Rhode  Islanders in the town of Warwick lost over $4 million in home values  due to the threat of climate change-driven sea level rise.   Several studies warned how climate change will affect coastal  property values. The First Street Foundation study is the first to  demonstrate value loss that has already occurred, as the study itself  says. A Columbia University researcher who worked on the First Street  study said this:         Each time we analyze a new state we see the same       phenomenon. Increased tidal flooding leads to a loss in home       value appreciation. As sea level rise accelerates, we expect       the corresponding loss in relative home value to accelerate       as well.    That hits home indeed. The latest scientific evidence shows sea  levels rising at a faster pace than expected. NOAA data shows that  Greenland lost around 280 billion tons of ice per year from 2002 to  2016. A National Geographic article covering this study noted: ``The  Greenland ice sheet is 10,000 feet thick in places and contains enough  ice to raise sea levels 23 feet.''   Another study shows that the Antarctic ice sheet has lost around 252  billion tons of ice per year over the last 10 years. Again, according  to National Geographic, full melting of the Antarctic ice sheet could  mean nearly 187 feet of sea level rise.   In Rhode Island, our Coastal Resources Management Council has been a  longtime leader in modeling flooding and sea level rise risks for Rhode  Island's coastal businesses, communities, and decision makers. Earlier  this month, CRMC partnered with the University of Rhode Island to  release a series of highly detailed risk maps for several coastal Rhode  Island towns.  [[Page S735]]  These maps provide a damage assessment for individual structures due to  flooding and storm waves for homes and businesses and critical  infrastructure, like the Warren wastewater treatment plant, which is  right there on the coast of Warren, RI; the facility will be almost  totally wiped out. CRMC's maps turn these general risks facing our  communities from a hazy sketch to a vivid, living-color, 3-D picture,  and that picture is grim for these coastal communities.   Rhode Island officials are currently preparing for a worst case  scenario of more than 9 feet of sea level rise overtaking our 400 miles  of coastline by the end of the century. This map is from Rhode Island's  CRMC's interactive STORMTOOLS application, which overlays the sea level  rise projections over our current topography. The blue all through here  is currently land that is flooded when 10 feet of sea level rise come.  This extra little rim of green on some of the edges is when you push it  up to 12 feet. As we see all of the blue here, think of homes and  businesses and properties that are owned by people and that are going  to literally disappear into the ocean if we don't pay attention. These  are the homes and businesses of my constituents.   A 2017 report from the real estate database company Zillow identified  over 4,800 homes in Rhode Island, valued at near $3 billion, that would  be underwater by 2100, using an optimistic estimate of only 6 feet of  sea level rise.   In this snapshot from Upper Narragansett Bay, you can see some of  Rhode Island's larger coastal communities stranded as a scattered  series of new islands, a Rhode Island archipelago. Today's map of Rhode  Island--the map that we have known since our founding--will become  unrecognizable as Warwick Neck here breaks off to become its own  island, Newport south of this map splits, and Bristol through here  comes apart.   A recent report from Climate Central and Zillow looked at new homes  being built in risky coastal areas--ones expected to suffer from annual  floods by 2050 under a moderate greenhouse gas emissions model--and  they show Rhode Island has seen more growth in risk areas than in safe  areas. Obviously, if emissions don't meet these moderate goals, things  are going to get a good deal worse, and well before water actually  overtakes your home, well before the water is coming through the front  door will come the economic effects of rising oceans, and they will be  big.   In 2017, GAO reported that coastal areas face particularly high  financial risks and that annual coastal property losses from sea level  rise and increased storms will run into the billions of dollars every  year in the short run and over $50 billion every year by late century.  EPA has estimated ``$5.0 trillion in economic costs to coastal property  from climate change through 2100''--$5 trillion, and that is the Rhode  Island part of that. The Union of Concerned Scientists reports that sea  level rise will double the number of coastal communities facing what  they call ``chronic inundation and possible retreat''--meaning you are  out of there--by 2035.   The market is awakening to these risks. Moody's evaluates municipal  bonds. It has begun evaluating the bonds of coastal communities with an  eye to this flooding risk. Banks, mortgagors, insurance companies, and  appraisers are starting to incorporate these risks into their work for  coastal properties.   A recent issue of the Appraisal Institute's Valuation magazine quoted  Rhode Island appraiser Brad Hevenor, warning that homes that receive a  30-year mortgage this year ``might be completely different types of  property [by the end of their mortgage] than they are today.'' Good  luck getting a 30-year mortgage on a property that the bank believes  will be ``completely different'' by the end of the mortgage.   The coastal housing market is on the precipice of a dangerous  financial cliff. First Street, Zillow, NOAA, GAO, EPA, Climate Central,  the Union of Concerned Scientists, and others all make the same  warning.   Federal home mortgage giant Freddie Mac said it this way: ``The  economic losses and social disruption may happen gradually, but they  are likely to be greater in total than those experienced in the housing  crisis and Great Recession.''   The editor of the insurance industry trade publication Risk &  Insurance said this: ``Continually rising seas will damage coastal  residential and commercial property values to the point that property  owners will flee those markets in droves, thus precipitating a mortgage  value collapse that could equal or exceed the mortgage crisis that  rocked the global economy in 2008.''   These are serious warnings, and they are deadly serious warnings for  our coastal States. Here in Congress, these warnings fall on deaf  ears--ears plugged deaf by the fossil fuel industry's persistent  mischief.   We have to get serious about our duty to our constituents. Polling  shows that millions of Americans want us to face up to this threat, to  safeguard their coastal property, and to curb the carbon pollution that  is distorting our Earth's climate and raising our Earth's oceans. It is  seriously time for us to wake up.   I yield the floor.
