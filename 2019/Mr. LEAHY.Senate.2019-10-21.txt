 Mr. President, oceans, lakes, and rivers across our planet  are filled with debris that litters shorelines and threatens public  health, navigation safety, wildlife, and the environment. This debris  causes serious damage to the health of ocean ecosystems and marine life  and, due to ocean currents, often travels great distances and poses  threats to nations that are not responsible for the mismanagement of  such waste.   One of the most common forms of marine debris is plastic, which is  abundant in our everyday lives, often in the form of single-use  packaging. Countless seabirds, sea turtles, seals, and other marine  animals are killed each year after ingesting plastic or getting  entangled in it. And most commonly used plastics never fully degrade  but, rather, break down into smaller and smaller pieces, known as  microplastics, which pose unique problems of their own.   The negative health, environmental, and economic impacts of marine  pollution, both to countries that discharge waste and to those on whose  shorelines such waste washes up, are steadily mounting. Billions of  pounds of plastic and other debris can be found in our oceans and  waterways.   In the Senate version of the fiscal year 2020 Department of State and  Foreign Operations appropriations bill, which was reported unanimously  by the Appropriations Committee on September 26, the committee  recommended funding to respond to this global threat. In this bill, the  committee directs the Department of State and the U.S. Agency for  International Development to redouble their diplomatic and programmatic  support for regional and global efforts to address this urgent problem,  including through grants, technical assistance, and new multilateral  mechanisms, and provides $10 million to support such efforts.   While the funding provided is minuscule compared to what is needed,  the committee's intent is clear. The United States must increase its  leadership and visibility on this issue and become more engaged in  efforts to prevent and mitigate the impacts of marine debris. The  committee recognizes that the United States cannot address this problem  alone. Nothing connects countries of the world more than oceans and  waterways, and strong international cooperation is necessary to  guarantee their conservation for generations to come. It is imperative  that the United States increases its engagement both bilaterally and  multilaterally to tackle this challenge.   It is not an understatement to say that what I am speaking about--the  protection of the oceans, lakes, and rivers of our planet--is essential  to our existence. I hope other Senators will join me, Senator  Whitehouse, and others who have taken up this cause in calling for  additional resources to address ocean plastic pollution.                            ____________________
