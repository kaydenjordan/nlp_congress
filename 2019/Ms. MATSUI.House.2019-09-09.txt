 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of my bill, the  Diesel Emissions Reduction Act, otherwise known as DERA, and I urge my  colleagues to support this critically important and bipartisan  legislation.   The mission of the EPA DERA program is simple: reduce air pollution,  improve public health, and make our communities better places to live  and raise a family. That is why this commonsense program has  continually garnered broad bipartisan support since it was first  proposed.   The reason for that is equally simple: DERA gets results and saves  taxpayer dollars in the long run. By replacing or retrofitting older  and dirtier diesel engines, the program has made meaningful strides in  boosting public health, reducing air pollution, and improving the  quality of life in communities across the country.   Over the last 10 years, the EPA has awarded over $600 million in  funds, and those dollars are making the difference. Over 67,000 engines  have been retrofitted or replaced. We have saved nearly $20 billion in  realized health costs. We have prevented millions of tons of carbon  monoxide and particulate matter from entering our air, and we have  saved over 450 million gallons of fuel at the pump.   Mr. Speaker, that is why we need to continue authorizing the DERA  program, so that it can continue to do its great work for years to  come.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my friends and colleagues, Congressman Lowenthal  from California, Congressman Long from Missouri, and Congressman  Wittman from Virginia, for coleading this bill with me and for helping  usher it to the floor.   My duty to my constituents is to fight for cleaner air and cleaner  communities. In fact, we all owe that to those we serve.   Mr. Speaker, as we prepare to vote on the Diesel Emissions Reduction  Act, I ask my colleagues to support my bill and this critically  important EPA program.
