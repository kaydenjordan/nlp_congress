 Mr. President, I want to thank my colleague Senator  Warren for beginning this debate, and we will move to a consent  shortly. I want to thank her for working together with me on this most  important issue.   At this moment, there are millions of women who face an uncertain  future after the repeal of Roe v. Wade, millions of women who no longer  have the right to make their own decisions about their own bodies. It  is a heart-wrenching choice, no doubt one of the hardest decisions  anyone will ever have to make.   But in the midst of this, in this post-Roe landscape we find  ourselves in, there are organizations, as has been discussed here,  known as crisis pregnancy centers that are preying on the fears of  women, exacerbating the problems caused by the Dobbs decision.   Make no mistake, crisis pregnancy centers are anti-abortion  organizations that cloak themselves in benign language about  ``providing answers'' and ``offering advice.''   They have an agenda; namely, to steer women away from abortion  through a combination of guilt, concealment, harassment, and downright  lies.   Crisis pregnancy centers in my State of New Jersey pretend that they  are there to educate, support, and empower women facing unplanned  pregnancies. And yet at the bottom of their websites, in very small  print, you will find a disclaimer that lays it all bare.         Crisis pregnancy centers do not offer or refer for       pregnancy terminations or birth control. Information should       not be relied on as a substitute for professional and/or       medical advice.    That is a disclaimer. You can hardly read it, but it is there. This  is pulled straight from the web page of one center in my State. I will  repeat that ending again.         Information should not be relied on as a substitute for       professional and/or medical advice.    Ironically, this is the only objective and accurate piece of  information you will find on the site and others like it.   As Senator Warren mentioned, crisis pregnancy centers are not  required to have a physician or a registered nurse on staff. Very few  of them do.   They are not required to provide contraceptive care or even stick to  medically sound claims. And because they claim to only provide so- called education services, they can promote blatant lies about how  abortion increases risk for breast cancer.   Women in America do not deserve to be lied to. They shouldn't be  preyed upon during moments of vulnerability or any other time. When  assessing healthcare, they shouldn't have to shift to what is real and  what is not.   And they certainly shouldn't have to parse through the carefully  constructed language of crisis pregnancy centers that promote an anti- choice agenda.   Our bill, the Stop Anti-Abortion Disinformation Act, would empower  the Federal Trade Commission to issue rules prohibiting false  advertisement of abortion services. It would allow the FTC to penalize  those who are found in violation. And it would provide greater  oversight over crisis pregnancy centers that profit from the pain of  unplanned pregnancies--sometimes while double-dipping on the taxpayer's  dime.   Senator Warren and I are leading this bill to end the practice of  deceiving women and girls through false advertisement. We are leading  this bill to promote truth in advertisement, to end misinformation and  disinformation, and to protect women from harassment. Yes--harassment.   As Senator Warren said, crisis pregnancy centers have no duty to  uphold HIPAA privacy protections--the most significant information that  you can give about your health and the status of your health and your  condition. You do that thinking that you are in a medical center. And  now you have given all this information that has enormous consequences  to it if it is misused to these deceptive entities.   And after divulging personal information to them, they can freely  sell it to scammers who would want to take advantage of them.   So I ask my colleagues, let's end the assault on bodily autonomy and  the right to access reproductive care.   Let's end the barrage of attacks on their healthcare. Let's end  deception in any delivery of any service. Let's end the fraud in any  delivery of any ``service.'' Let's end the barrage of attacks on their  healthcare.   Join us in passing our bill so that in the hardest moment of their  lives, women all across our country can rest assured in knowing that  what they are getting is the truth, not some biased agenda pretending  to be medical advice, not some one-sided talking point that steers them  toward one outcome, the truth--the truth.   Pregnant women in America deserve the truth, and that is what this  bill does. To oppose our unanimous consent request is to promote  deception, is to promote fraud. I don't think anybody really wants to  do that.   As in legislative session, I ask unanimous consent that the Commerce  Committee be discharged from further consideration of S. 4469 and the  Senate proceed to its immediate consideration; further, that the bill  be considered read a third time and passed and the motion to reconsider  be considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action  or debate.    While my colleague is still here, I would like to  propound a question to him through the Chair.   Does the First Amendment allow you to promote fraud? Does the First  Amendment allow you to promote deception? Is it great work to lie to  someone about what you are providing them? Is it great work to allow  someone to get your vital health information believing that you are a  health provider and then being able to use that private information?    Mr. President, if I may continue to ask my colleague  through the Chair, is it right, no matter who gets the information by  fraud, to give your most private health--surely, as a doctor, the  Senator would say that no one should give up their health information  to an entity that does not preserve it under HIPAA laws.   So could the Senator not join us if we limit it to fraud that  ultimately has that fraud create the insecurity of HIPAA information?    I would like to answer the Senator's question, and that  makes eminent sense that we would protect HIPAA information, regardless  of who is in a position to maybe have access to collecting it. And  therefore, in the first instance, you shouldn't collect it, if you are  not a medical entity, but if you do, you should be ultimately bound by  the same guarantees that anyone else would be guaranteed. You know, it  would baffle me that particularly a medical professional, a doctor,  would suggest that HIPAA information is something that we shouldn't  protect.    I think that at a minimum, we should all be able to agree to that.    Mr. President, I was happy to listen to my colleague  from Colorado's erudite exposition of what the opportunity is before us  and what it means for the American people, and so I very much  appreciate it.                          Tribute to Keith Roachford    Mr. President, I come to the floor today for a very important reason.  I rise not to introduce a bill nor to ask my colleagues for unanimous  consent. No.   I am here for one simple reason, and I want to make sure that the C- SPAN cameras are capturing this moment for posterity.   I come to the floor today to honor Keith Roachford, a member of my  staff who has faithfully served the State of New Jersey, the U.S.  Senate, and the United States of America for more than 35 years.   As you can see from Keith's face, it is clear that he had no idea  this was happening. We told him he was coming for another reason, and I  don't think we would have gotten him otherwise.   But, nonetheless, I rise today because, after 35 years and 18  Congresses, Keith is retiring from the Senate, and as result, I wanted  to come to the floor to send him off with a tribute befitting his  legendary career.   A native son of Willingboro, NJ, Keith has served not one, not two  but four U.S. Senators for the Garden State. He is the very definition  of institutional knowledge, and countless fellow staff members can  attest to his experience, which has saved the day on more than one  occasion.   Keith has sometimes said that he has been here so long he came with  the furniture. It is a classic Keith line, a glimpse not only into his  sense of humor but also his view of how staff work behind the scenes  gets things done.   Now, that may be the case, but today, Keith, I rise to shine a  spotlight on your illustrious career.   To start, I would like to share some of the stories that his  colleagues have sent me:         Keith has not only been a mentor to me, he's also been a       friend to anyone lucky enough to come into contact with him.        When I think of Keith, the words that come to mind are       helpful, generous, thoughtful--a patient and understanding       team player.    Another one said:         He is so kind to everyone, from interns to the Chief of       Staff, and is always--always--willing to share his knowledge       with others.    So it brings me immense joy to speak these words into the  Congressional Record so that, like Keith's legacy, they may stand the  test of time.   But beyond his accolades, beyond his track record and sterling  reputation, Keith, at heart, is a humble man. I know it isn't easy for  him to be sitting here, listening to me shower praise on him, but to  that I say: Well, you are still on the payroll so you will have to bear  with it.   But above all, Keith is a family man, a devoted husband to his wife  Sandy and an incredible father to his beloved children, Rick, Daniel,  and Lauren.   He is a man that every day for the last 36 years has braved the  brutal beltway traffic to come into work in the Hart Senate Office  Building. And he is a man that every weekend has made a similar trip  with his family to attend  [[Page S4032]]  services at St. George's Episcopal Church here in DC.   Keith credits his faith for guiding him throughout his life, and he  would be the first to tell you that it has been a moral compass for  him, season after political season. But as the Book of James asks,  ``What good is someone who says they have faith but does not have  works?''   Fret not. In addition to his duties as senior warden of the Vestry at  St. George's, Keith takes the time to give back to his community. He is  a member of the Brotherhood of St. Andrew. He serves as the secretary  of the convention of the Episcopal Diocese of Washington, and he is a  Boy Scout leader.    At every opportunity, he goes out of his way to give back. It is a  trait he learned growing up. As the son and grandson of public  servants, Keith was taught from an early age that service to others is  the highest calling.   His grandfather was a transit operator for the city of New York,  while his father, a veteran of the U.S. Army and the New Jersey Army  National Guard, worked for the sanitation department for 37 years. It  is no surprise, then, that Keith has followed in their footsteps. He is  a throwback to a previous era, one where individuals spent years, if  not decades, working for the same organization.   I know Keith never intended to spend 36 years working in the Senate.  He used to joke with colleagues that he came to Washington fresh out of  the college just to try it out. But in the process, he has gone from  working as a constituent liaison, to mail director, to deputy chief of  staff, and so much more.   Today, Keith is an indispensable resource for our legislative staff.  He is our go-to person for appropriations, defense, veterans' issues,  homeland security, and the budget.   He has had a hand in passing countless initiatives for our office,  from supporting community development financial institutions to shoring  up supply chains and expanding senior housing, to inserting provisions  in the PACT Act--that is how we got him here, telling him that is what  we were going to talk about--that addresses the needs of veterans  suffering from Gulf war illness.   Keith has had a hand in far too many legislative wins to count, but  suffice to say, the legend of Keith Roachford has led to what we call  ``the Roachford Rule,'' which is simple: With every appropriations  letter I sign on to, with every bill I cosponsor, for something to pass  the Roachford Rule, it needs to have a tangible benefit for New Jersey  families.   Much like the man it is named after, the Roachford Rule is about  connecting what we do here in DC to the people whose lives it affects  back home.   Long after Keith has left the Senate, his rule will live on, a  testament to his relentless pursuit of good government, a trademark for  a public servant devoted to the common good, a namesake that all of us  in this Chamber would do well to emulate.   I will end with this: Last March, I came to this floor to rebuke the  words that a colleague used in reference to the January 6 attack. I  won't use the time to rehash what I said; instead, I will use this time  to once again lift up the bravery and the courage of the man who  compelled me to act.   Late one night, Keith sent me an email that outlined the pain and the  outrage he felt after reading our colleague's comments. In personal  terms, he relayed how his entire life he has had to endure--in overt  and covert ways--the harmful legacy of racism and the stain of White  supremacy.   Knowing Keith, it could not have been easy to type that message to  his boss, a sitting U.S. Senator.   But as I said in that speech, there comes a time when you either  ruffle some feathers and speak the truth or you fail to do justice to  the values you hold dear.   The U.S. Senate is a better institution, and I am certainly a better  Senator, for having Keith Roachford work in these Halls. He is man of  principle, a man of God, a man who has put every ounce of his being  into the work that New Jerseyans have sent us here to do.   He is the first person to tell you that he is not perfect, the first  to say that he has certainly seen it all over 36 long years of service,  but, by God, I cannot help but feel so thankful, so grateful that we  have been blessed with his presence. He is a calm and steady hand that  has helped guide our office since 2006.   He is the quiet one, the one who keeps his powder dry and plays the  long game; the one who never loses sight of the ultimate goal, which is  to improve the lives of hard-working American families.   John Madison, one of the Framers of our Constitution, once said:         If men were angels, no government would be needed.    I have never met an angel, but I have worked alongside Keith  Roachford for 16 of those 36 years. He has served with me longer than  any other of the U.S. Senators he has worked with. And it is why I can  truthfully say without pause or equivocation that Keith Roachford is  truly doing God's work here on Earth.   When Keith first mentioned to me that he was thinking of leaving, he  said the most incredible thing. He said:         You know, Senator, it's just that with the pandemic and       with work from home, I've just gotten to spend more time with       Sandy and the kids.        We don't want to wait any longer to get started.        We make breakfast and we take walks. . . .        I just don't want to wait any longer to do that.    That is Keith in a nutshell. That is who he is. So I want to  congratulate Keith on an incredible 36 years of Senate service. We are  going to miss you, certainly so. But to you, to Sandy, and to your  three children, we wish you all the best on a well-deserved retirement.   Thank you, Keith.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
