 Madam Speaker, this Congress must keep our promises to the  American people. Our first responsibility is to institute policies that  will grow our economy and create jobs.   For 8 years, Americans looking for work have suffered while the  regulatory state sucked nearly $2 trillion out of our economy. We must  rescind these burdensome regulations and enact a commonsense approach  to regulations.   ObamaCare has failed, and it is time to repeal or replace it with a  patient-driven plan that incorporates free market-based principles. We  have to repeal the mandates and taxes of ObamaCare and make sure no one  falls through the cracks.   Finally, we have to reform our Tax Code. It is far too long and  complicated. We have to cut the tax rate from a maximum of 15 to 20  percent.   These policies will jump-start the American economy from a stagnant  growth rate to more than 4 percent GNP growth rate. Only a vibrant  economy can provide for a strong national security and robust  infrastructure capable of supporting jobs.                            ____________________
