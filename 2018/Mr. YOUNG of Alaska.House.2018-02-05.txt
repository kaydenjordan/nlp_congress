 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 219) to correct the Swan Lake hydroelectric project  survey boundary and to provide for the conveyance of the remaining  tract of land within the corrected survey boundary to the State of  Alaska.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 219         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Swan Lake Hydroelectric       Project Boundary Correction Act''.       SEC. 2. CONVEYANCE OF FEDERAL LAND WITHIN THE SWAN LAKE                     HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT BOUNDARY.         Not later than 18 months after the date of enactment of       this Act, the Secretary of the Interior, after consultation       with the Secretary of Agriculture, shall--        (1) survey the exterior boundaries of the tract of Federal       land within the project boundary of the Swan Lake       Hydroelectric Project (FERC No. 2911) as generally depicted       and labeled ``Lost Creek'' on the map entitled ``Swan Lake       Project Boundary--Lot 2'' and dated February 1, 2016; and        (2) issue a patent to the State of Alaska for the tract       described in paragraph (1) in accordance with--        (A) the survey authorized under paragraph (1);        (B) section 6(a) of the Act of July 7, 1958 (commonly known       as the ``Alaska Statehood Act'') (48 U.S.C. note prec. 21;       Public Law 85-508); and        (C) section 24 of the Federal Power Act (16 U.S.C. 818).   [[Page H762]]     The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from  Alaska (Mr. Young) and the gentlewoman from Hawaii (Ms. Hanabusa) each  will control 20 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Alaska.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the bill under consideration.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Alaska?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the bill under consideration.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Alaska?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, first, let me thank my good friend from Hawaii (Ms.  Hanabusa) for coming over here to help manage the bill. I know it was  an imposition, but I thank her. It means a great deal to me.   Mr. Speaker, the Swan Lake hydroelectric project is a remote facility  in southeast Alaska that provides electric power to nearly 20,000 of my  constituents in the cities of Petersburg, Wrangell, Ketchikan, and the  surrounding areas.   In 1994, the project's operator began work to raise the dam height by  15 feet, working with the State of Alaska to secure 1,500 acres of land  from the Federal Government inside the reservoir's new coverage area.  The land was surveyed by the Federal Government and transferred to the  State of Alaska in 1997.   In 2012, the project operator discovered an error in the Federal  Government's survey and determined an additional 25.8 acres of Federal  land would be inundated if the water level were raised. There is no  disagreement among the Federal and State agencies concerned that an  error occurred. H.R. 219 will fix the error by requiring the Secretary  of the Interior to correct the survey and transfer the remaining  acreage to the State of Alaska.   This is a commonsense bill that promotes green energy development at  zero cost to the Federal Government. Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of  the measure, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I wish my good friend from Hawaii  good luck in the upcoming election. I know it is against the rules, but  I am going to say it anyway. The gentlewoman will make a fine Governor  as she made a fine Congresswoman; believe me.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the  gentleman from Alaska (Mr. Young) that the House suspend the rules and  pass the bill, H.R. 219.   The question was taken.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds  being in the affirmative, the ayes have it.    Mr. Speaker, I object to the vote on the ground  that a quorum is not present and make the point of order that a quorum  is not present.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further  proceedings on this question will be postponed.   The point of no quorum is considered withdrawn.                            ____________________
