 Madam Speaker, the American Rescue Plan is going to  help get kids back to full, in-person learning in Massachusetts' Fourth  Congressional District. Since even before taking office, opening the  schools has been my top district priority.   With the rescue plan, we are not only boosting the production of  vaccines that protect teachers and staff, but we are also providing  money for HVAC upgrades and for ongoing COVID surveillance testing in  the schools. This testing catches outbreaks early and breaks  transmission chains. It provides confidence and transparency as we  reopen.   I am proud that scientists and operators in my district are  developing these cutting-edge, low-cost school testing technologies,  including at Ginkgo Bioworks, CIC Health, and Project Beacon.  Classrooms must open, and they must be safe for students and teachers  alike. With vaccines and testing, they will be.                            ____________________
