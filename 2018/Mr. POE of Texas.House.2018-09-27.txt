 Mr. Speaker, the State Department has released its  annual country report on terrorism.   Terrorist attacks are down worldwide, but there are still frustrating  details that we must expose. The biggest frustration is that Pakistan,  a so-called major non-NATO ally, continues to harbor terrorist groups  that target the United States and its allies.   The report says that the Taliban, the Haqqani Network, LeT, and JeM,  all terrorist groups, they all still operate in safe havens in  Pakistan. Some are able to raise money, recruit, and train in Pakistan.   For too long, I, as well as others, have come to this floor to point  out Pakistan's duplicitous behavior. When will we stop appeasing  Pakistan and sending billions in American money to these fake friends,  money that ends up in the hands of terrorists who make war on America?   We must designate Pakistan as a state sponsor of terrorism, then  revoke their major non-NATO ally status. Then we must go after these  terrorist groups.   And that is just the way it is.                            ____________________
