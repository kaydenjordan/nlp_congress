 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Madam Speaker, I think no one in this Chamber can dispute when I say  that America's Tax Code is broken. I rise today to stand with my  colleagues in support of progrowth tax reform because our Tax Cuts and  Jobs Act works for the middle class.   For too long, a complex Tax Code, high rates, and burdensome  regulations have held back opportunities for hardworking families. The  Tax Cuts and Jobs Act offers much-needed tax relief for low-income and  middle-income Americans.   It focuses on middle class tax cuts that allow hardworking Floridians  to keep more of their paychecks so that they can save for their  children's college fund, so that they can invest in their retirement,  so that they can enjoy vacations with their family.   Florida families know how to spend their money better than the  government, and this plan allows them to keep more of the money that  they earn instead of waiting for tax returns and deductions to give  them their money back.   This bill is profamily. It is probusiness, and it will give our  economy a boost. Nothing will address our debt more than growth.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill.
