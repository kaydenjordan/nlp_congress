 Mr. Speaker, last week, as we counted electoral college  votes, I said this day marks a crossroads for our American democracy.  We didn't know then what an ominous statement that was. We do now.   Congress was attacked by a violent mob, incited by the President, to  stop us from doing our constitutional job. The President not only  encouraged the mob; he said he loved them and made no serious effort to  stop them.  [[Page H136]]    Lives were lost and put in danger. Constitutional government was  urgently threatened. The President's actions were not only wrong; they  were dangerous.   He lives in an alternate reality. He is a continuing threat to  America.   Vice President Pence should invoke the 25th Amendment, assume  Presidential duties until the inauguration next week, and save us from  a President who is unable to function, unable to protect our country.   I urge all, including my Republican colleagues, to put politics  aside. Act to secure the safety of our country. We truly are at a  crossroads for our American democracy.
