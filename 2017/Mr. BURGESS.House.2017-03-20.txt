 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous materials on the topic of the Special Order.    I thank the Speaker for the recognition.   Mr. Speaker, October of last year, October of 2016, Bill Clinton,  speaking in front of a group of people in Michigan, said:         So you have got this crazy system. There are all these       people out there who are busting it sometimes 60 hours a       week, and they wind up with their premiums doubled and their       coverage cut in half. It is the craziest thing in the world.    Mr. Speaker, I don't often agree with former President Bill Clinton,  but that quote pretty much sums up why we are here doing what we are  doing this week with trying to fix the problems inherent in the  Affordable Care Act.   Now, sometimes people turning in and watching these hours must wonder  how can it be we are talking about the same thing where one side says  it is good and one side says it is not. Mr. Speaker, it may help to set  some of the historical context. I would like to do that tonight. I  would like to talk about the beginnings of what we now know as the  Affordable Care Act. Some people refer to it as ObamaCare.   This is a bill that was signed into law 7 years ago this month, but  it didn't just spring forth. There was a lot of work involved in  bringing it forward and getting it heard and getting it voted on on the  floor of this House. I was part of the Energy and Commerce Committee  that summer, as I still am today. The Energy and Commerce Committee did  hear what was then H.R. 3100, several hours of markup in the committee,  several days of markup. Other committees marked it up, and H.R. 3100  was a 1,000-page bill that left our committee. I didn't vote for the  bill. I didn't think it was a good idea, but it did have Republican  amendments at the end of that process.   That bill then went to the Speaker's Office--not to the Budget  Committee, but to the Speaker's Office. Speaker Pelosi put it together,  and when it emerged, it was a 2,000-page bill that really didn't have  much to do with the bill that was marked up in the committee. But,  nevertheless, the bill came to the floor of this House; and in November  of 2009, after a significant amount of debate, a significant amount of  anxiety expressed on the Republican side and even some on the  Democratic side, the bill was passed by a very slim majority. The bill  went over to the Senate, and that was the end of that bill.   What happened next was there were--it was not exactly a bill--several  drafts of several ideas that people had over on the Senate side; and  the Senate took up a bill that the House had previously passed, H.R.  3590 was the number of that bill, and the Senate debated and passed  that bill on Christmas Eve of 2009. You may remember there was a  snowstorm that was descending upon Washington, kind of a familiar  story, a snowstorm that was coming to town. The Senators wanted to get  home before the snowstorm hit, and they passed H.R. 3590.   Remember, back in those days, the Democrats had a 60-vote majority in  the Senate. They were able to cut off debate and pass the bill on a  party-line vote with 60 Democratic Senators voting in favor of that  bill.   Then something strange happened. The Democrats actually lost a Senate  seat in a special election in the State of Massachusetts that they  weren't expecting to lose. As a consequence of losing that Senate seat,  now, instead of a 60-vote majority, they had a 59-vote majority, so  they actually could not cut off debate. It was not a filibuster-proof  majority.   Harry Reid told Nancy Pelosi, who was then the Speaker of the House:  Well, I have done everything I can do. You are just going to have to  pass our bill as it is. I can't make any changes to it.   Speaker Pelosi wisely said--I am paraphrasing here because I don't  remember the exact quote--but I think she said: I haven't got 100 votes  for that thing over here in the House.   I think she was right. But they worked on it, and President Obama  worked on it, and 3 months later, in March of 2010, indeed, they did  bring that vote up in the House, passed exactly what had passed in the  Senate. As a consequence, since the Senate bill was actually an  amendment to a House bill that didn't have anything to do with health  care in the first place, but since it was only an amendment to a House  bill that had passed the House, so many as are in favor agree with the  amendment to the Senate bill, the number being 218, that bill went down  to the President for a signing ceremony that very same week. Thus was  born the Affordable Care Act.   Now, what has led us to the point where former President Bill Clinton  would say that it is a crazy system? Well, there is a lot of discussion  back and forth.   Certainly, Republicans took the majority shortly after that bill was  signed into law. I would submit that because that bill was signed into  law, Republicans regained the majority in the House of Representatives  in 2011 and since that time have had a number of votes either trying to  repeal the Affordable Care Act or improve the Affordable Care Act. A  number of those votes have, indeed, been bipartisan votes, that is,  Democrats have voted with Republicans.                                time  2030    I think the total count is there have been 47 Democratic votes to  either repeal, replace, reform, or repair the Affordable Care Act. It  really has been a bipartisan effort these past 7 years.   We are where we are today because of the problems that exist in the  bill. Despite the talk that we heard in the last hour, people are  suffering under this.   There is a gentleman back home in my district. I think he is a  plumber by profession. He has previously been diagnosed with bladder  cancer. He says, under his Affordable Care Act policy, he gets to go  see his primary care doctor once a year. His primary care doctor says,  Well, you need to go to a urologist to have your cystoscopy, but his  deductible is so high, he doesn't do it. He has got access to  insurance, but he doesn't really have access to the kind of care that  he needs that could be lifesaving and could prevent him from having a  much greater problem down the road.   We can all bring our individual stories out, but the fact of the  matter is, access to coverage is not the same thing as access to care.   During the course of the campaign this last fall--and I remember this  very specifically because November 1 was the day that the new rates  came out--the open enrollment period for the Affordable Care Act opened  up on November 1, and people got a glimpse of what their marketplace  rates were.   As a consequence of those marketplace rates, people started to pay  attention. There was still another week to go before election day, and  people started to pay a significant amount of attention to what the  rates were.   It isn't just the rates. It is the access. One-third of U.S. counties  have only one insurer willing to sell in marketplace in those counties.  I think the number is either five or seven States that have entire  States with only one insurance company. That is not really choice. That  is not really access. That, in fact, is a monopoly.   2017 was a year marked by a sharp rise in premium increases across  the country. Seven States saw premium increases of more than 50  percent. Texas was about 25 percent. Some States went up over 100  percent.   The individual mandate, which was part and parcel of the Affordable  Care Act, the most coercive Federal legislation passed since the income  tax passed 100 years ago--the individual mandate is the reason that the  Affordable Care Act has never achieved widespread popularity. But even  with the individual mandate--that is, we are going to send the Internal  Revenue Service out and make them make you buy health insurance--over  19 million taxpayers elected to pay the mandate penalty or claim a  hardship exemption.   There were 6.5 million individuals who paid the penalty and over 12.5  million people claimed a hardship exemption, according to the Internal  Revenue Service's own files.   The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services reported that 10.5  million individuals enrolled in an exchange plan through the first half  of 2016. More than twice that number chose to either exempt themselves  through a hardship waiver or just simply pay the fine and walk away  from the obligation to purchase insurance.   I am firmly of the belief that the individual mandate has no place in  a free society. The one central thesis of the  [[Page H2234]]  Affordable Care Act that I long to see repealed is the repeal of the  individual mandate. While we are at it, we might as well take care of  the employer mandate.   By the way, President Obama delayed the employer mandate for 2 full  years, not by a House passed bill, but by administrative fiat. He  simply decided, prior to the Fourth of July in 2013: You know what? The  employer mandate is going to cause trouble in the next congressional  election, so I will just suspend it.   In a blog post put up by Valerie Jarrett on the evening of July 2,  2013, the employer mandate was simply suspended for a couple of years  because it was felt to be too onerous and because of the effect that  they feared it would have on the midterm elections in 2014.   Time after time, the Obama administration took it upon themselves to  delay or turn back a portion of their own law, and there were multiple  times where there were votes taken on this floor.   I think of the 1099, the paperwork that was going to be required in  the business-to-business transactions; the 1099 forms that were  required under ObamaCare that were repealed by this House in a  bipartisan fashion because it did pass in the Senate, and the Senate  was controlled by Democrats at the time.   Also, the CLASS Act, a particularly onerous part of the community  living access ostensibly to provide some help with long-term care,  except it really didn't. It was in an actuarial death spiral even  before it was enacted. It was one of those things in the Affordable  Care Act where you paid for 10 years of taxes and got 6 years of  benefits. When they got finished collecting the taxes, it was decided  they better do away with the benefit because, in fact, there was no  benefit there at all.   Time after time, in a bipartisan fashion, this House has taken action  to restrict or remodel or repair or repeal portions of the Affordable  Care Act. We are now coming up on a time where significant change is  going to occur in the issuance of health care in this country. The  change is going to be tough. We always knew it would be, but it is the  right change.   The Energy and Commerce Committee, the Ways and Means Committee, and  the Budget Committee have put together legislation that we will be  hearing up in the Rules Committee later this week; the American Health  Care Act, which will come to the floor before the end of this week. Let  me just make a prediction: it will pass the floor of this House.   I see that I am joined by a colleague this evening. I yield to the  gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Carter) to talk on this issue or any issue  that may come to his mind.    Well, as the gentleman knows, he and I spent--what was  it--27\1/2\ hours in a committee markup 2 weeks ago getting us to this  point. So the gentleman from Texas thanks the gentleman from Georgia  for his part and his participation. That was a very long markup, but he  stayed attentive and asked good questions and offered good insights all  the way to the end. We were very fortunate to have him on the  committee. I have been on the committee a few more years, but it was  certainly one of the nights on that committee that I will long  remember.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman.    Will the gentleman maintain his position for just a  moment so perhaps we can engage in a brief colloquy?    Of course, the gentleman was not here in 2009-2010 when  this thing came down the pike, but you may remember the townhall  meetings from that summer, that August of 2009, and they were pretty  intense. We hear a lot about townhall meetings today, but I promise you  they were every bit, if not more so, intense during August of 2009.   When I look back on that, Mr. Carter, what I remember is really two  things that people were asking. Yes, it wasn't nearly as long as what  the Affordable Care Act ended up being, but still a thousand-page bill,  people have to dig through it, have to understand it. And the two  things that I took away from those townhall meetings back in the  district were people were telling us, number one: Don't mess up what we  have got. We have something, and it may be imperfect, but by golly, it  is working for us and our families right now, so don't hurt that.   The other thing they would ask is: If you are going to do anything at  all, could you please help us with cost, because we are concerned about  the cost of these products and we are concerned what the trajectory may  be for the costs going up over time?   I will just ask the gentleman from Georgia--since he was a citizen at  that time, how does the gentleman from Georgia think we did with those  two requests that were coming to us from our constituents?   I use the term ``we'' advisedly. Obviously, I voted against that  bill.   But as things turned out with the Affordable Care Act, how did that  turn out for the American healthcare consumer?    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for participating  this evening. It means a lot to me individually that he was willing to  come up and stay up late with us tonight yet one more night dealing  with the Affordable Care Act.   But the gentleman is quite direct. The journey of a thousand miles  starts with the first step. It is a three-part program. This was the  first part, the first phase that will happen on Thursday night. This  deals with some of the more egregious aspects of the Affordable Care  Act, those things that can be tackled through Senate rules of  reconciliation that only require 51 Senators to get passed. So that is  one part of this.   Another part is the administrative part. And our former colleague  from Georgia, Tom Price, a physician, who is now Secretary Tom Price  for the Department of Health and Human Services, he has an  administrative part that is actually already underway. We don't have to  wait for that to happen. It is already occurring.   Then there is the third part, the so-called regular order part, the  part that will require 60 votes on the Senate side, the part that is,  by its very nature, going to be bipartisan. We have reported two rules  out of the Committee on Rules tonight, one on the McCarran-Ferguson  changes that I think the gentleman is well aware of. There are already  additional bills that will be coming to the floor of the House that are  separate and apart from this reconciliation bill, which is just the  first step in repealing the Affordable Care Act.   I do want to point out that Secretary Price sent a letter to the  Governors last week or a week and a half ago now talking about some of  the waivers that he is bringing forward right now, the 1332 waivers,  which are waivers for parts of the Affordable Care Act.   Quoting from his letter here: ``Under Section 1332 of the ACA, states  can apply for State Innovation Waivers and pursue innovative strategies  to adapt many of the law's requirements to suit the state's specific  needs.''   So many details to receive approval, what a State has to do, but he  really stresses in this letter and in one of the last paragraphs: ``We  encourage states interested in applying for Section 1332 waivers to  reach out to the Departments promptly for assistance in formulating an  approach that meets the requirements of Section 1332.''   I know the gentleman hasn't served here that long, but I will just  tell you, that is a sea change of difference from the Federal agency  which time after time told our Governors: No. Stop. Go back to go. Do  not collect $200. You can't do that.   Now we have a Secretary at the agency who is reaching out to the  Governors: Governor, we want to help you make this work for you. We are  going to provide the flexibility that you need.   One of the things that I think is perhaps most promising is the  hybrid, high-risk pool, State-operated reinsurance programs that have  been proven in several States already. States that were in a so-called  death spiral because of guaranteed issue community rating, the premiums  were going up, people were dropping their coverage. And now these  States have expanding coverage even without the things that we are  providing in the American Health Care Act that we are going to be doing  later this week. But already by providing that flexibility at the  agency level, States are able to provide some relief for their  citizens.   Then, finally, the part three of this. There are going to be some  must-pass healthcare bills that will be coming up through our  committee. We will have an opportunity to work on those things. We are  going to work on the Food and Drug Administration user fee agreement  reauthorization. So we will have that, which can happen as a bipartisan  exercise in our committee.   I will just stress, the Committee on Energy and Commerce has a  history of doing things in a bipartisan fashion. One of the reasons why  I enjoy serving on that committee is it is a thoughtful committee and  it does do things in a bipartisan fashion. Generally, that is one of  the strengths of the committee as it brings legislation to the floor.    This is an important first step. It is a necessary first step. This  is the key that gets us through the door of actually making a  meaningful impact on cost and coverage in these United States. It has  been 7 long years, but I am anxious and eager to get started on the  next part of the process.   I thank the gentleman from Georgia for joining me here this evening.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
