 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I  thank him for his words.   As well, I thank Mr. Cline for his words in support of this  legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 693, the National POW/MIA Flag  Act.   In May, I had the privilege of visiting America's longest running  POW/MIA vigil, in my district, in Meredith, New Hampshire. There, on  the shores of Lake Winnipesaukee, participants have been gathering  every Thursday evening for more than 30 years to honor and remember  servicemembers listed as prisoners of war, missing in action, or  otherwise unaccounted for.   It doesn't matter if it is a night in the depths of a frigid winter  or a sweltering summer, every vigil brings out a strong community of  veterans, family members, and supporters who call on all of us to  remember these heroes. Vigils like these happen all across this great  country to ensure no servicemember's sacrifice is forgotten.   Flying over these vigils with the Stars and Stripes is the POW/MIA  flag. This flag was conceived in the early 1970s during the Vietnam war  by family members who awaited the return of their loved ones. It was  adopted by Congress ``as the symbol of our Nation's concern and  commitment to resolving as fully as possible the fates of Americans  still prisoner, missing, and unaccounted for in Southeast Asia, thus  ending the uncertainty for their families and the Nation.''                                time  1630    It has become an enduring national symbol of POW/MIAs from conflicts  throughout our history.   That is why I was proud to introduce this bipartisan companion  legislation in the House, along with my colleague, Representative  Bergman, which would display the POW/MIA flag alongside the American  flag at all Federal buildings, memorials, and all national cemeteries  throughout the year.   Under current law, the POW/MIA flag is required to be displayed by  the Federal Government only 6 days per year. This flag is  representative of profound courage and sacrifice, and it is only right  that those who served their country honorably but never returned home,  are remembered appropriately at our Federal buildings, cemeteries, and  memorials.   This bipartisan legislation passed the Senate unanimously, and it is  endorsed by Rolling Thunder; the National League of POW/MIA Families;  the Veterans of Foreign Wars; the American Legion; the National  Alliance of Families for the Return of America's Missing Servicemen;  and American Ex-Prisoners of War.  [[Page H8355]]    It is fitting that this bill has garnered such a strong show of  support. I urge my colleagues to pass this legislation, to continue  working with a sense of common purpose when it comes to supporting our  servicemembers, military families, and veterans.   Members of Congress display this flag in front of our Washington and  district offices because we believe we must honor the more than 81,000  servicemembers our government says are missing or unaccounted for since  World War II.   Let's ensure these displays happen across Federal properties  throughout the year. Let's ensure the words emblazoned on the POW/MIA  flag continue to communicate our support and commitment for our  Nation's heroes and their families. You are not forgotten.
