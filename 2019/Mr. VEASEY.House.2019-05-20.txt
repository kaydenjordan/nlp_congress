 Madam Speaker, I am here today to talk about the Annual  Clay Competition held by the Congressional Sportsmen's Caucus. I would  like to take the time now to congratulate my good friend, Austin Scott,  [[Page H3996]]  who was the captain of the Republican team.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Austin  Scott).    Madam Speaker, I really appreciate Representative Scott,  Representative Hudson, and just everybody that makes this competition  very special.   I would like to announce the Democratic nominees: from Northern  California, the top gun on the Democratic side, with 53 shots, was    Mike Thompson; and also on the Democratic side, top skeet, from  Minnesota, was Collin Peterson.   Madam Speaker, I would like to maybe step it up a little bit for next  year's competition and use this time to maybe encourage my Republican  colleagues, because we didn't have any women at all participate on the  Republican or the Democratic side this year. So I am going to encourage  Mr. Scott, and I am going to encourage them to recruit some women  shooters. I am going to do the same thing; and I think that that is  going to be the key to us winning next year; so good luck.    Madam Speaker, 2020 is right around the corner.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today in memory of Muhlaysia Booker,  a courageous 23-year-old Black transgender woman in Dallas who was  found fatally shot this weekend.   Muhlaysia's name has been in the news a lot. Recently, she suffered a  brutal beating by a group of men who screamed transphobic slurs at her  as they assaulted her. The attack was captured on video, and it made  you sick to your stomach to see the level of transgender hate that is  so strong and prevalent in this country.   Muhlaysia's death is devastating for the Black transgender community  in Dallas, but it is also part of a much larger trend that shows the  violence, discrimination, and fear that the transgender and LGBTQ  communities face on a daily basis.   Deaths in the trans community are underreported, and the adversity  they face is on clear display.   The unemployment rate for the Black transgender community is 20  percent, close to four times the national average; 38 percent have  lived in poverty, and 42 percent have experienced homelessness.   Even with all the odds stacked against them, Black transgender women  like Muhlaysia choose to live their life in truth. They show courage,  strength, and great personal sacrifice in the fight for equality.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues in the Senate to join the House by  passing the Equality Act. We must do everything in our power to stop  the discrimination and violence in our neighborhoods.   Our brothers and sisters are dying out there. We need the inaction to  stop.                            ____________________
