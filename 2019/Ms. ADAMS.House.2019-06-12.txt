 Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Chair, I want to first offer my thanks to Chairwoman  DeLauro and our other appropriators for their tireless work on this  year's Labor-HHS bill.   I offer this amendment to recognize the important work of the  National Center for College Students with Disabilities and to press the  Senate to act.   The national center, located in Huntersville, North Carolina, sets as  its mission to improve retention and graduation rates of U.S. college  students with disabilities. It accomplishes this through technical  assistance and outreach and the dissemination of peer-reviewed research  that tries to determine the needs of disabled college students, their  families, disabled service providers, and higher education staff and  faculty.   Additionally, the center has developed and is constantly updating a  public clearinghouse that contains disability resources at institutions  of higher education across the U.S. This allows disabled students to  access crucial information to intelligently assess their higher  education options.   Last but not least, the center empowers its students through the  dissemination of a weekly newsletter that reports current events and  news about the disabled in higher education, promulgated by its student  group DREAM, or Disability Rights, Education, Activism, and Mentoring.   To sum up, the center has been a godsend for the 20 percent of  college students who have some form of disability since its $2.5  million authorization in 2015, and that expires at the end of this  fiscal year.   Madam Chair, this amendment would add $500,000 to the higher  education account, which funds the national center. If passed, it will  be used in conference with the Senate to justify a new authorization.   Without more funding, the center will close in June 2020, wasting 5  years' worth of taxpayer dollars used to create groundbreaking research  for our disabled students. It would leave thousands of higher education  staff, faculty, and students without support for the disabled in higher  education.   The center has bipartisan support on the Education and Labor  Committee, and it is expected to be included in the next Higher  Education Act reauthorization.   I thank the chair of the Higher Education and Workforce Development  Subcommittee, Representative Susan Davis, as well as Representatives  Huffman, Moulton, Bonamici, and Lowenthal for cosponsoring this  amendment, and I urge the House for its support.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  0115     Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Connecticut (Ms. DeLauro).    Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Chair, my amendment would add $3 million to the  Children and Families Services Programs account.   I do want to thank Chairwoman DeLauro for her work on the Labor-HHS  bill, particularly the inclusion of  [[Page H4607]]  a line item for the Social Services/Income Maintenance Research  program, as well as report language to support Community Resource  Centers.   These centers, or CRCs, as they are called, help administer social  programs such as Medicaid, WIC, and SNAP. But, unlike other State one- stop shops, CRCs have completely integrated services, which allow for  greater efficiency.   Instead of repeating their story to multiple administrative staff  during the screening process, customers can be screened and assessed at  one central administrative service area, which provides initial  screening and assessment for all programs and services offered in the  CRC.   If a customer needs to access multiple county services or partner  agencies, staff arranges cross-service coordination, which allows  individuals to assess their eligibility and apply for multiple Federal  programs in a quick, efficient manner.   H.R. 2740 will, for the first time, allow the Federal Government to  evaluate the viability of CRCs and determine whether their expansion  can help save taxpayer money and make social services more accessible  to everyday Americans.   That is not all that CRCs do. They also partner with local workforce  development boards to connect job seekers with employers, putting a  dent in our Nation's skills gap.   If this amendment passes, an additional $3 million will be provided  to the Children and Families Services account, which will fund the  research into CRCs. We then will work with Senate colleagues to ensure  that the funding is used for the purpose of this groundbreaking  research.   Madam Chair, Congress should support initiatives that make Federal  programs more accessible for Americans and do it in a way that saves  taxpayer money.   Community Resource Centers are a perfect example of that, and I  applaud H.R. 2740's recognition of that fact. I urge the House to  support my amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Connecticut (Ms. DeLauro), our distinguished subcommittee chair.    Madam Chair, I respectfully challenge my colleague and  would certainly invite him to go to the Community Resource Center in  Mecklenburg County to see the work that they do every day, to see how  they stabilize families and help reduce the need for those seeking  social services to travel multiple times to access Federal programs.   The last thing we should be doing is burdening working Americans by  increasing their costs to receive the helping hand that programs like  Medicaid and SNAP provide.   Madam Chair, I would just, again, urge support for the amendment, as  our most important job as Members of Congress is to make the lives of  Americans better.   The CRCs do that work, and let's do ours and ensure that they have  the resources they need to continue that progress.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
