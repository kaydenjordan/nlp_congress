 Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of this  resolution to hold Attorney General Barr and Commerce Secretary Ross in  contempt of Congress.   Madam Speaker, we have reached a point that we, as Congress, must  have the courage--and we have a duty to our constituents of these  United States of America--to uphold the Constitution.   Congress has an obligation to conduct oversight of the executive  branch, yet this administration complains each time we request  information critical to fulfilling our investigative responsibilities.   Today, the full House will vote to hold Attorney General Barr and  Secretary Ross in criminal contempt of Congress for their complete  disregard of the Constitution--not of Democrats, of the Constitution-- and their refusal to provide our committee with relevant documents  relative to the investigation of our 2020 Census.   It is 100 percent within our congressional responsibility to ensure  the Federal Government is ultimately working in the best interests of  the people it serves.   I urge my colleagues to support this resolution, to stand up and  fulfill their duty and responsibility to the Constitution, which says  we must take care of the people of this great country and that Congress  will maintain its power as a separate but equal branch of government.   Madam Speaker, I thank the chairman for his leadership.
