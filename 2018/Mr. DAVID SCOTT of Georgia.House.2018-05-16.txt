 Mr. Chairman, let me make it very clear  at the very beginning, that this is a racist farm bill. Make no mistake  about it.   The good Lord said: Ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make  you free. And the truth is that this is, unfortunately, a racist farm  bill. Let me tell you why.   After the Civil War when the South was utterly destroyed, they  established land-grant colleges, and then 30 years later, because there  was so much struggle without adequate freedom for my people--African  Americans--they established the 1890 land-grant colleges because they  had Plessy v. Ferguson, the separate but equal doctrine. Yeah, they  were separated already, but never equal.   These 1890 colleges have never gotten the financial support that they  have needed to even come close to the White 1860s that were there. And  so we tried to make amends in this farm bill to come up with a very  noble idea. With the shortage of younger people not going into  agriculture, not going into science and technology and research to feed  the future, we established scholarships to go to the 1890s.   But you know what? When they took our bill, put it into the farm  bill, they took the money out--just like they did back in the 1890s.  Black people in this country have suffered too long, and we need to put  a stop to it. I am here. I know that this House will not put the money  back in. It was just $1 million a year for each of the 5 years to try  to get people in. And these land grants knew.    Every Black man does not necessarily want  to play football or basketball. They want to feed the future. This is a  terrible bill.    * * *    * * *
