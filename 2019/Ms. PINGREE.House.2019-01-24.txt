 Madam Speaker, I am pleased we are able to be here  tonight to have an hour with some of my colleagues to continue this  conversation about the hardships people are facing due to this shutdown  and the impact it is having on our country.   We have had so many interesting stories and tragic recollections of  exactly what people are going through. As our Speaker, Speaker Pelosi,  just said, we are holding Federal employees hostage; we are holding the  safety of our country hostage; we are holding the American people  hostage; and it is time to get the government going again and resolve  our differences.                                General Leave     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on the subject of my Special Order.    So today is the 34th day of the longest government  shutdown in history. It is a shutdown that has no excuse, and it has  taken a great toll on dedicated public servants and their families  across America.   Americans who have jobs are actually standing in line at food  pantries here in Washington and back home in my State of Maine.   This Chamber, as of today, has voted 11 times to fund the government,  to pay 800,000 workers, and to restart essential services.   President Trump's unwillingness to reopen the government is tone deaf  to the financial circumstances of working Americans. Most are living  paycheck to paycheck, pay mortgages and healthcare premiums, and need  to keep food on the table. Government workers and contractors cannot  afford these weeks being held hostage.   People who rely on government programs like SNAP and housing vouchers  are feeling the stress. They cannot afford these weeks of being held  hostage.   Businesses that are losing opportunities to expand and grow their  businesses cannot afford these 3 weeks of being held hostage.   The consequences of this shutdown have rippled through our State and  national economies. Members of Maine's Coast Guard, who protect us  every single day, are about to miss their second paycheck while  actively serving to protect our working waterfronts.   The USDA's partial closure in Maine has put Maine farmers in  financial limbo, and SNAP benefits for Maine's most vulnerable are on  the verge of a lapse. Many of Maine's craft brewers, who added $260  million to our State economy last year, have had to put new products  and their businesses on hold.   At this time, I will share a few of the stories about what is  happening and what we are hearing from our constituents in Maine as a  result of this shutdown. I will read just a few clips from letters I  received and the stories Mainers have shared with the local news, and I  will outline some of the broader problems this historic shutdown has  created for real people.   We heard from a brewery in the process of expanding to a second  location. They had all their paperwork in with the Alcohol and Tobacco  Tax and Trade Bureau in the Department of the Treasury when the  shutdown began, but now that brewer is waiting with an empty  storefront.   Another brewery is just waiting for approval to open six new types of  beer, all sitting and ready to be sold. As the owner says:         January is already a tough time in Maine, as I hope you       know, and to lose out on weeks of sales because of the       shutdown may cause us to close our doors. Please, I implore       you, do what you can to get the shutdown over with.    We hear from a lot of Federal employees in our State. Here is one  that says:         Please do whatever you can to reopen the government. I have       28 years of Federal service and do not appreciate my       financial security being jeopardized by the President.    Another says:         Please do everything you can to help end the government       shutdown. As a furloughed Federal employee, the anxiety of       not knowing when or if I will be paid grows with every day of       the shutdown. I have savings to cover a few months of living       expenses, but I know many in this situation don't. We just       want to get back to work, and we don't want to be used as       pawns.    Another says:         I am exempted from furlough, and I am mandated to work       without pay. This shutdown is crushing me. I am a single       father of three who just went from a one-income household to       a no-income household. I keep hearing the President insist       that Federal workers support this. I must have missed that       poll. No one has asked me for my input. Please help end this       shutdown soon. This is not sustainable for me.    Another says:         This shutdown is the worst one that I have been involved       with since joining the Federal Government decades ago.       Earlier this week, I went to my credit union to take out a       personal loan to pay my bills. It is the first time ever in       my life I have had to do that.    Another says:         I work under a government contract, and I have just been       informed that I cannot come back to work until this       government shutdown is over. This is a terrible time of year       for myself and my fellow coworkers to not know when we can       continue our work, not that there is ever a good time for a       shutdown.    Well, the good news is, I have a lot more stories like this, but I  want to share some of the time with my colleagues, and I will get back  to reading them more.   So I now yield to the gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. Underwood).    I thank the gentlewoman very much for her thoughts.   I am now happy to yield to my friend from Colorado (Mr. Perlmutter).    I thank the gentleman for taking the time to share those  stories with us. It is so important that everybody understand the  impact this is having in many areas that most people don't know  anything about.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Minnesota (Ms.  McCollum).    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for sharing those  stories.   I yield to the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Perlmutter).    Madam Speaker, I thank everyone here tonight for  providing the diversity of stories that are really coming from States  across the country which we all represent. And I know it is just a  small bit of what we are all hearing every day in our offices.   I yield to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Raskin).    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Maryland for  his comments.   I know it is particularly challenging in a district where so many  people are close to Washington and so many Federal employees have a  multitude of challenges. So I appreciate the gentleman's good work and  his thoughts.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Alabama (Ms. Sewell),  my friend and colleague.    Madam Speaker, I thank Ms. Sewell from Alabama for being  here tonight.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms.  Schakowsky).    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman so much for  sharing that and for hosting a roundtable in her district.   Madam Speaker, I think every time we have a chance to have people  gather to talk about this, at least they know we are listening to them,  even if we haven't fixed the problem.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Soto).    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Florida for  reminding us of some important compromises. Some I liked, some I  didn't. But were it not for the Missouri Compromise, we wouldn't have  Maine, so I am glad about that one anyway.   Also, as you said, we can compromise without holding hostage all of  these workers we have been talking about tonight, without shutting down  the government, and without shaking up people's lives. This is our  challenge, to work it out as Members of Congress, as members of the  executive branch. We can't ask our hardworking Federal employees to  bear the brunt of all this.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Massachusetts (Ms.  Clark), who is also the vice chair of our Caucus. I thank her for being  here tonight and for fitting us into her busy schedule.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from  Massachusetts for sharing those stories, which we are hearing  throughout New England, and are so challenging and meaningful to all of  us.   We have heard tonight from all regions of the country: north, south,  east, and west, and so many of the stories are the same. We heard from  families affected by the fact that our Coast Guard personnel are not  being paid, the only branch of the military that doesn't get paid.   This is a hardship not only on them, but on their families as well  who are home trying to make ends meet when they are off deployed; the  TSA and the FAA, which we depend on every single day in our airports  across the country  [[Page H1204]]  for our safety, for our security; people who work in the Federal  courts; people who are not working, but are government employees. They  are not essential, so they are furloughed, but they can't go out and  get another job in the middle of all of this. They just have to wait  until it is all over to collect that back pay.   There are so many contractors I hear from who can't continue with  their contracts, because maybe they work with the Coast Guard or other  Federal agencies, and they can't keep the funding going, and they can't  give any certainty to when jobs will be completed or to their own  employees.   I have a couple of minutes left and I am going to read a long story,  but it might just take up exactly the right amount of time.   We talk so much about all of the employees, but there are so many  others who are impacted by this, and, particularly, in the agriculture  sector in Maine. We are very proud of our farmers. We are very proud of  seeing new, young farmers getting into the business, of farms being  revived and finding new markets.   This was a story from the Grace Pond Farm in Thomaston. They shared  their story of how the USDA shutdown has impacted them. They said: ``We  are often a little removed from the issues affecting others. We can  sigh and rejoice, cry and shake our fists at the air with just a little  bit of safe distance from way up here; but not this time. This shutdown  affects everyone and that everyone includes us.   ``We have planned, schemed and dreamed our way onto this historic  farm property in Thomaston. Gregg and I have spent countless late  nights, after catching chickens and milking cows, staring at screens  and numbers, and putting together business plans and spreadsheets to  grow sustainably.   ``Our goal--to be able to just milk cows, grow chickens and turkeys,  feed our kids and neighbors, and drive a car that runs. Gregg grew up  learning how to enjoy dark mornings, working on a dairy farm in rural  Pennsylvania. I grew up in central Maine, spending mornings waiting for  the Skehan's dairy truck and learning how to beat my brother to the  cream on top of that glass bottle.   ``We want to ensure that both of these experiences are available to  our kids, and to everyone in Maine, for years to come.   ``Our farm is financed the old-fashioned way--on a tightrope. We  operate on a faith-based budget, and that keeps things exciting. The  FSA and the USDA rural development loans are valuable resources for  poor folks that want to work hard and eat well--and we make good use of  them.   ``About a year ago, with a shifting dairy market impacting our  current situation, we poured ourselves into the process of financing  the new farm we'd found to fit our needs.   ``Utilizing a community lender, we managed to secure that property,  and relying on our faith-based budget, we went for it. Thanks to CEI  for taking that chance on us. We also began the laborious process of  financing the dairy infrastructure at the new property using the FSA as  our security lender, because that's what they do for us.   ``This is all contingent on our selling the `old' farm property--we  cannot in any way carry two farms. After gratefully securing a buyer  for the `old' farm, we were moments away from closing when the  government was shut down. Just like that, we lost access to our  mortgage holder and all of the necessary documentation and signatures  that they alone can provide.   ``Not only that, we were just a few weeks away from the deadline for  our Maine DACF-based dairy loan, and found ourselves suddenly without  the proof of security necessary. No skin in the game equals no dairy  loan.   ``We are now weeks past our closing. We continue to accrue heating  bills, taxes, and mortgage interest on the `old' farm property, while  we pay all of the same on the `new' one. We had to scramble to find  another bridge loan for the dairy infrastructure, and due to the lender  being anyone but the USDA, the interest rate is more than 5 percentage  points higher--this translates to an annual number that made our  `numbers guy' take a few breaths before commenting when he heard the  news. We are thousands of dollars into this shutdown now.   ``We operate on razor-thin margins. We are not alone. The companies  that sell us grain, and chicks, and poults, are all actual people,  employing other actual people, all operating on a faith-based budget,  trying to preserve a way of life that we believe has value and merit.  We need an end to the shutdown before we have to shut down and the way  life should be is that much more lost to us all.''   Madam Speaker, I thank all of my colleagues for being here tonight  and thank everyone who shared their stories and allowed us to let you  in on a little bit of how this tragedy proceeds. I encourage a  negotiation and a settlement.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
