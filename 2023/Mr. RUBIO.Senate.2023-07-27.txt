 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I call up my amendment No. 523 and ask that  it be reported by number.    Mr. President, this is my amendment that is going to be  voted on here by agreement. It is pretty straightforward. The Federal  Thrift Savings Plan is the largest defined contribution plan in the  world. It has 22 China-only funds. Every single one of them has money  going towards companies that are sanctioned, that are on the Entity  List--companies that are responsible for the human rights violations  against Uighurs; companies that our own government has said are helping  the Chinese build their military--Chinese-sponsored companies. And so  this amendment, basically, is geared towards that. It tells the TSP-- the Thrift Savings Plan--board that they can no longer invest your  money--the money of Members of Congress, members of the military,  Federal employees.   Federal employee retirement money is being invested in companies that  are undermining American national security according to our own  government. We are investing in those.   Think about the irony. You are a member of the military and your  retirement money is being invested in companies that are building  missiles designed to blow up the ship that you serve on.   So if we are serious about this, we need to cut this off. This is not  a ban on Chinese investment. This is a ban on the Thrift Savings Plan  and its money--your money, the investment money of Federal employees-- being used to invest in companies that our own government has placed on  lists for human rights violations and posing a threat to the national  security of the country.                          Vote on Amendment No. 523
