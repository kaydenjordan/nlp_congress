 Mr. Speaker, just a few minutes ago on this floor, we  were admonished for not wrapping up our budget in time. That is a fair  thing. We are supposed to take care of our budget.   Another thing we are not taking care of, and the American public  ought to be appalled until we do, is the new news on the border. I  talked to a prior expert down there and got even more terrifying  information.   Now, first of all, in November, we had 73,000 what they call got- aways, people not even touched by the Border Patrol, breaking the  previous all-time high by 24 percent in one month.   Isn't that something we ought to come back next week to take care of?   Not only that. I had suspected this, but apparently the Border Patrol  is concerned about where the unaccompanied minors are winding up. These  are minors who come here without their parents. All they have is an  address. We don't confirm--or they believe we don't confirm--that  parents or aunts or uncles or somebody is at that address or if they  show up at a house and maybe there are 10 single males in the house, a  young woman--we don't even know.   It is time this place began to do some committee hearings on where  the unaccompanied children, who should be spun back around to their  home country, wind up.                            ____________________
