 Madam Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules,  I call up House Resolution 198 and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 198         Resolved, That upon adoption of this resolution it shall be       in order to take from the Speaker's table the bill (H.R.       1319) to provide for reconciliation pursuant to title II of       S. Con. Res. 5, with the Senate amendment thereto, and to       consider in the House, without intervention of any point of       order, a motion offered by the chair of the Committee on the       Budget or his designee that the House concur in the Senate       amendment. The Senate amendment and the motion shall be       considered as read. The motion shall be debatable for two       hours equally divided among and controlled by the chair and       ranking minority member of the Committee on the Budget or       their respective designees and the chair and ranking minority       member of the Committee on Ways and Means or their respective       designees. The previous question shall be considered as       ordered on the motion to its adoption without intervening       motion.     Madam Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield  the customary 30 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Burgess), pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume.  During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the  purpose of debate only.                                General Leave     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks.    Madam Speaker, today, the Rules Committee met and  reported a rule, House Resolution 198, providing for a motion to concur  with the Senate amendment to H.R. 1319, the American Rescue Plan Act of  2021.   The rule provides 2 hours of debate on the motion, equally divided  and controlled by the chairs and ranking minority members of the  Committees on Budget and Ways and Means.   Madam Speaker, a once-in-a-century pandemic brought us the need to  act, and a Democratic Congress and a Democratic President have seized  the moment, not as a chance to help big corporations or the already  well-off, as those on the other side have done over and over again, but  as an opportunity to invest in our workers, our students, our  communities, and the very people who need help the most.   More than 18 million Americans are receiving unemployment benefits  today. Nearly 24 million adults are going hungry. Roughly 12 million  children are living in households with food insecurity. Up to 40  million people cannot afford to pay rent and fear eviction. Over 2  million women have been forced to leave the workforce. Eight of 10  minority businesses are on the brink of closure. That is what COVID has  wrought in America today.   This is more than a Band-Aid; this is a lifeline, Madam Speaker. It  will put more vaccines in arms, put more kids back safely in schools,  put more money in people's pockets, and put more people back to work.  It is hard to overstate just how important this is.   This bill, Madam Speaker, attacks inequality and poverty in ways we  haven't seen in a generation. This legislation makes the biggest  investments in our workers and our middle class that I have seen in my  two-and-a-half decades of service here.   Make no mistake, I am disappointed to see the cut in the unemployment  insurance made over in the Senate, and we are going to keep fighting to  raise the minimum wage so that no one who works full time lives in  poverty. We are going to keep focusing on the hunger crisis in this  country until we end it once and for all. These should be fundamental  priorities of the wealthiest nation on the planet.   But let's be clear. Today, we are on the doorstep of history. We are  about to send the most sweeping and progressive economic investment in  modern times to the President of the United States: $1,400 in direct  payments, a historic child allowance, school infrastructure, an  expansion of the Affordable Care Act, student loan relief, billions in  rental assistance, aid that will cut child poverty in half, and I could  go on and on and on.   Everything included in this final package is necessary to crush the  virus and revitalize our economy.   As I have noted, I have been in Congress for more than 20 years, but  this, Madam Speaker, this is among my proudest moments.   I want to thank our distinguished Speaker, Nancy Pelosi, and my  fellow committee chairs who worked so hard on this bill. I want to  thank Budget Committee Chair Yarmuth and all of my colleagues here in  the House for getting us to this point.   Democrats on both sides of the Capitol, together with the Biden  administration, have crafted something historic. In 1 day, with a  single vote in favor of this bill, we will change the lives of millions  of Americans for the better.   For all of our important work, day in and day out, we don't get many  chances like this. I urge all of my colleagues to join me in voting for  this rule and the underlying rescue plan.   Let us rise and meet this moment, and let's send this historic bill  to the President's desk for his signature.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I include in the Record an article that  appeared in Politico entitled, `` `Check Partisanship At the Door':  Biden finds GOP allies for rescue money.''                       [From Politico, Mar. 5, 2021]    `Check Partisanship at the Door': Biden Finds GOP Allies for Rescue                                   Money                            (By Kellie Mejdrich)         Republicans in Congress attacking President Joe Biden's       plan to pour hundreds of billions of dollars in pandemic       relief aid into local governments are facing resistance--from       GOP-run states and cities.        Republican mayors in Texas, Arizona, Florida and Oklahoma       are among those backing Biden's state and local government       funding plan as part of the $1.9 trillion coronavirus aid       bill that's before the Senate, defying GOP lawmakers in       Washington, who are broadly resisting the spending.        ``In a crisis and an emergency, you check partisanship at       the door, and you get through the crisis,'' said John Giles,       the Republican mayor of Mesa, Ariz. ``You can get back to       playing politics when the crisis is over. And so this is one       of those times.''        The clash between local and national Republicans is a rare       public division in a party that has generally been united in       opposition to policies being pushed by Biden and Democrats in       control of Congress. It's a breach that Biden and House       Speaker Nancy Pelosi have gone out of their way to exploit as       the coronavirus legislation enters the final stretch.        Lawmakers including Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell       of Kentucky, Sens. Rick Scott and Marco Rubio of Florida, and       Ted Cruz of Texas have been among the most vocal national       Republicans in rejecting the aid, calling it a ``bailout'' of       what they say are poorly run Democratic states and arguing       that state budgets fared much better than expected during the       pandemic. They also say that a good chunk of the money doled       out to the states by Congress last year remains unspent.        McConnell slammed the relief package in his opening remarks       Friday, calling it ``an ideological spending spree packed       with non-Covid-related policies'' and panning the $350       billion targeted for state governments as a ``massive cash       bailout for mismanaged state and local governments.''        But Giles and other mayors say their residents are locked       in a struggle to fill pantries with food as municipal       reserves and other dedicated funds are running dry.        ``There has been an overwhelming backlash from our       Republican congressmen and senators because of how much money       is in this bill,'' said Arlington, Texas, Mayor Jeff       Williams. ``For us, the reality is the need is very much here       for cities.''        Williams said that when he talks with his counterparts in       Washington he tells them ``we have seen the great economists       of our country all come together'' in support of these       additional funds for state and local governments.        He also draws on comments by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome       Powell. While Powell hasn't taken a specific position on       state aid or the coronavirus legislation itself, he has often       spoken of the drag on the economy from the loss of more than       a million state government jobs during the pandemic.        Biden underlined the conflict within the party by inviting       a bipartisan group of governors and mayors to the White House       last month to discuss local funding issues. Pelosi late last       month said Republicans in Congress were choosing to ``mock''       the aid package despite its broad support, citing a       bipartisan letter signed by mayors across the country       requesting more aid--including signatures from more than 30       Republicans.        Miami Mayor Francis Suarez, a Republican who attended the       White House meeting, told POLITICO, ``We're hoping that it       doesn't become a partisan punching bag.'' He said he hoped       that ``hearing from local officials that are on the ground,       day in and day out, will be something that motivates elected       officials from both parties'' to support the funding.        GOP lawmakers say that a surge in tax revenue for most       states following last year's massive aid packages makes more       help unnecessary now. But while the financial picture is       brighter than many officials projected, some of the states       hardest hit by the pandemic are represented by these       lawmakers.        A recent report from Moody's Analytics showed that five of       the 10 states with the biggest budget shortfalls are       Louisiana, Oklahoma, Alaska, Florida and Kansas. They were       among 19 states where Moody's identified looming budget       shortfalls even after accounting for federal aid and local       reserves. Ten of the 19 are represented by at least one GOP       senator.        ``It would be a dereliction of duty for me not to try to       fight for $116 million that would allow us to restore our       police, fire and other core services,'' said Oklahoma City       Mayor David Holt, a Republican.        City and county leaders are amplifying calls for support       because the new bill sets aside more than $100 billion for       municipal and county governments--just over $120 billion in a       ``local fiscal recovery fund,'' according to the latest       Senate version of the bill.        So while just 38 cities got funding in the first round in       March, the United States Conference of Mayors estimates the       new formula expands eligibility to 19,000 cities, towns and       villages. That's why more than 30 Republican mayors signed on       to the letter in support of the package last month that       Pelosi touted, with Giles, Holt, Suarez and Williams among       them.        Giles said the city of Mesa was lucky enough to get $90       million in the first round of aid, but added, ``We could have       turned in twice that much in receipts that were tied to virus       relief; our expenses have gone higher.''        ``Because we're in the food bank business, we're in the       buying laptop computers for school business, we're in the       rent, utility business. We're doing all of these things that       we weren't doing a year and a half ago,'' he said.        Even some Republican governors have publicly vouched for       the plan, including Asa Hutchinson of Arkansas and Larry       Hogan of Maryland, citing the financial stakes ahead.        Meanwhile, 22 Republican governors in a statement issued at       the end of February criticized Biden's funding plan--but only       because their states will see a smaller share of the direct       grant funding compared to what Congress sent them in March.        ``The new stimulus proposal allocates aid based on a       state's unemployed population rather than its actual       population, which punishes states that took a measured       approach to the pandemic and entered the crisis with healthy       state budgets and strong economies,'' read the statement,       whose signatories included Republican Governors Ron Desantis       of Florida, Kevin Stitt of Oklahoma and Doug Ducey of       Arizona.        Many of Florida's tourism-dependent cities have taken a       financial beating, and the state faces a big shortfall for       the coming budget year. Local media reported last month that       the state deficit was estimated at $2 billion.        Yet the same day that Miami's Suarez traveled to Washington       to discuss local funding with the president, Republican Sen.       Scott slammed Biden's proposed aid package for the states in       an editorial, saying the money would be used to ``bail out       fiscally irresponsible governors in New York and Illinois.''       Rubio, Florida's other Republican senator, has also spoken       critically of more local aid, saying that some states ``see       this as the latest opportunity to get bailed out.''  [[Page H1166]]         But even with better outcomes for states overall, state and       local government employment still hasn't recovered from the       pandemic downturn. The latest Bureau of Labor Statistics data       show that they are still down about 1.4 million jobs from a       year ago--about 1 million of which are in education.        Teryn Zmuda, chief economist of the National Association of       Counties, said states do need the help.        ``Local government specifically is down 1 million of those       10 million jobs that the nation is short right now,'' Zmuda       said. ``So, aid to local governments will get those 1 million       workers back in the workforce.''     Madam Speaker, I raise that because the only place  where this bill isn't bipartisan is here in Washington. Republican  mayors and Republican Governors all across the country want this bill.  Seventy percent of the American people want this bill. But here in  Washington, my Republican friends think they know better than their  constituents. They have what we call Potomac fever or they have gone  Washington on their constituents.   The bottom line is people back home need help. People back home are  struggling, businesses back home have been devastated because of this  pandemic. This is a bill designed to help the American people.   Before I yield to the gentlewoman from Connecticut, we are about to  be treated to a little bit of theatrics, and I understand that they  want to delay the passage of this bill and bring up an alternative, a  bill that they claim is going to help our schools but provides no new  funding.   What we are doing here, Madam Speaker, is we are not only providing  funding to help our schools reopen safely, we are also providing money  to help those who are unemployed, to help those who are hungry, to help  our cities and towns that are on the verge of laying off first  responders.   In a moment, everybody in this House needs to stand and be counted;  and on this side of the aisle--and I hope some of my Republican friends  will join with us--we are going to stand with the people. We are going  to stand with the people.   Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Connecticut  (Ms. DeLauro), the distinguished chairwoman of the Committee on  Appropriations.    Madam Speaker, I will not yield for that purpose. All  time yielded is for the purpose of debate only.    Madam Speaker, it is interesting that we just saw a  parade of Republicans come before the microphone and urge us to move on  a bill, and they read the short title of the bill. But the real title  of the bill, and let me read it to you, is: ``To encourage local  educational agencies to resume in-person instruction at elementary and  secondary schools.'' That is what the bill does.    Now, let me just say to my Republican friends, I don't know if you go  home and you don't talk to principals, superintendents, teachers,  parents, and students, but our schools don't need encouragement. What  they need are resources to be able to reopen safely.   This bill that you are talking about here doesn't provide one  additional cent to help schools reopen. Nothing. No money. No  resources. Nothing. Give me a break. Come on.   Madam Speaker, the bill that we are about to debate here will provide  $130 billion to help K-12 schools reopen safely. That is not  encouragement. It is real resources to make it a reality.   By the way, this bill also requires States to award K-12 funds to  local school districts no later than 60 days after receipt and school  districts to develop plans to ensure that schools return to in-person  learning.   I could have saved you a lot of time and a lot of embarrassment. That  was bad theater. It was terrible theater.   Madam Speaker, people need help. We are trying to crush this virus,  get this economy back on the right track, and reopen our schools, and  this is what we get. Look, I hope everybody takes note of those who  went before the mike to argue against this bill and for a symbolic bill  that provides no resources, because, at the end of the day, people need  to know who was on their side in the middle of this crisis, who stood  up and fought for them and provided much-needed Federal relief to our  local communities and our schools. That was pathetic.   Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman from North  Carolina (Ms. Ross), a distinguished new member of the Committee on  Rules.    Madam Speaker, I am happy to yield to the gentlewoman  if she could tell me how much money is in her bill.   Madam Speaker, I yield 15 seconds to the gentlewoman from New York  (Ms. Tenney) to ask how much money is in the gentlewoman's bill.    Madam Speaker, I reclaim the balance of my time.   Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, here we have a Republican colleagues coming to the  floor basically advocating nothing. Their bill--read the long title  again--is to encourage local educational agencies to resume in-person  instruction at elementary and secondary schools. Not one new cent in  money.   Schools don't need to be encouraged. They need the resources to be  able to deal with issues like ventilation, to be able to make sure that  the infrastructure is such that it is safe for students and teachers  and others to come back to the schools.   And my Republican friends, while they are coming here and trying to  find ways to delay the American Rescue Act, they are going to vote  against it. They are not advocating for one additional cent for  vaccines. They are not advocating for any additional help for those who  are unemployed, for small businesses and restaurants that are  struggling. They don't want any more resources to go to cities and  towns.   So I hope that we don't see some of my Republican friends show up at  announcements announcing money and resources for schools and cities and  towns, for those who are struggling, trying to take credit for  something that they voted against.   Madam Speaker, I would, again, urge my colleagues on both sides to  look at this for what it is. This is not about trying to help people.  This is about a continuing effort to delay much-needed resources to our  schools, to our struggling families, and to our small businesses.   Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms.  Lois Frankel).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, let me just state for the record and respond to the  gentlewoman. The bill she is talking about is not an appropriations  bill. Let's be clear. Let's make sure we are clear about what we are  talking about here. This is not an appropriations bill.   She is talking about money that was previously allocated in previous  bills. The bill that my Republican friends are bringing forward  allocates zero. It encourages schools to open up.    Again, our schools don't need encouragement. What they need are  resources. And if my friends would go home and listen to their  superintendents, to the principals, to the teachers, to the parents, to  the students, they would understand how desperate the situation is.   Now is the time for action, not more empty rhetoric, not more  political theater, not more words. People need resources and they need  it now.   Madam Speaker, I am happy to yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Pennsylvania (Ms. Scanlon), a distinguished member of the Rules  Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, we all want schools to reopen, but we want them to  reopen safely. There is such a thing called science that we need to  respect, and we need to make sure that our schools are reopened safely.   This is a deadly disease that has invaded our country. We have all  lost friends and loved ones to COVID-19. We lost a congressman-elect  and a sitting Member of Congress on the Republican side to COVID. So to  get up here and to talk like this is much ado about nothing? Come on.  What are my friends thinking? This is serious.   Communities after communities all throughout this country are trying  to find ways to reopen schools safely. Some of them are trying to  invest in infrastructure for better ventilation to make sure that it is  safe. Some are talking about additional school buses to be able to  transport kids to and from school safely. They need resources, not  encouragement.   Give me a break. How insulting to somebody watching this debate in  any of our districts to hear Members of Congress get up and say, you  know, you don't need any help, you don't need any resources, you don't  need any money to be able to help institute these changes so we can get  kids back to school safely, but we are going to give you encouragement  instead.   Come on. We can do better than that.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I would encourage all of my colleagues on both sides  of the aisle to read the bill, to look at what is in this bill, and to  look at the people who it will help. To claim somehow that this is not  going to help with reopening of schools or helping our small businesses  or helping children struggling in poverty or helping people who are  hungry shows that people are not reading the bill.   This is a big, bold, appropriate response to a horrific pandemic that  has struck our country and struck the world. So we are acting, and it  is the right thing to do.                                time  1615    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Connecticut  (Mrs. Hayes).    =========================== NOTE ===========================        March 9, 2021, on page H1172, the following appeared: 1615  Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Madam Speaker, we can talk and talk and talk and talk, and it might  make us feel better, but it doesn't do any good for the people we  represent who are in desperate need. They are crying out for help.  People are struggling, people are hungry, and businesses are shutting  down.   My friends talk about reopening schools. They offer a measure that  [[Page H1173]]  would encourage our schools to be reopened but don't offer one  additional penny in resources to help them reopen, which is so tone  deaf and so disconnected from reality. People need help, and they need  it now.   Madam Speaker, let's be really honest here. My Republican friends do  not have a problem spending $2 trillion. They spent that with their tax  cut bill that benefited mostly people who are well-off and well- connected, and they were willing to spend that on COVID when Donald  Trump was President.   What they have a problem with is where this is going: to our workers,  not the wealthy; and to our communities, not corporations. That is the  fundamental difference in how we govern. Democrats govern for the  people.   Right now people are hurting, Madam Speaker. An overwhelming majority  of the American people across all party lines and divisions support the  American Rescue Plan. We have seen that in poll after poll after poll.  My Republican friends just say that they are uninformed, including  their Republican mayors and Republican Governors. How insulting.   This bill will put more vaccines in arms. It will put our kids back  to school safely. It will put food on dinner tables and put workers  back in jobs.   This pandemic is an all-hands-on-deck moment. After weeks and weeks  of work, Congress doesn't have a moment to spare.   I urge all of my colleagues to support these historic investments in  our Nation. We have told our neighbors and communities that help is on  the way. Let's deliver on that promise.   I am proud to be on the House floor today. I am proud to speak in  favor of the American Rescue Plan. And I am proud to vote in favor of  this important piece of legislation. This will help save lives and will  help save our economy.   The material previously referred to by Mr. Burgess is as follows:                     Amendment to House Resolution 198         At the end of the resolution, add the following:        Sec. 2. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution, the       House shall resolve into the Committee of the Whole House on       the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R.       682) to encourage local educational agencies to resume in-      person instruction at elementary and secondary schools, and       for other purposes. The first reading of the bill shall be       dispensed with. All points of order against consideration of       the bill are waived. General debate shall be confined to the       bill and shall not exceed one hour equally divided and       controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the       Committee on Education and Labor. After general debate the       bill shall be considered for amendment under the five-minute       rule. All points of order against provisions in the bill are       waived. When the committee rises and reports the bill back to       the House with a recommendation that the bill do pass, the       previous question shall be considered as ordered on the bill       and amendments thereto to final passage without intervening       motion except one motion to recommit. If the Committee of the       Whole rises and reports that it has come to no resolution on       the bill, then on the next legislative day the House shall,       immediately after the third daily order of business under       clause 1 of rule XIV, resolve into the Committee of the Whole       for further consideration of the bill.        Sec. 3. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H.R. 682.     Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and  I move the previous question on the resolution.
