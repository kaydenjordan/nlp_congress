 Madam Speaker, I rise to mark 3 weeks since my  constituent, Danny Fenster--pictured here--was captured and imprisoned  by the Burmese military simply for doing his job as a journalist, 22  days spent on the phone and with my arms wrapped around his traumatized  but determined family, upwards of 500 hours reading our community's  outpouring of comments about Danny's dignity and his career of standing  up for people around the world.   I have called on ambassadors all throughout the region. I have called  on our own State Department to ask why, what is the justification for  our Embassy not having access to our citizen? And they have no reason.   It is a violation of international law, and it is a violation of  human rights.   The U.S. Embassy needs access to Danny while we keep fighting for his  immediate and unconditional release and to protect the freedom of the  press.   I will not stop fighting and our community will not stop fighting  until we bring Danny home.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, it is great to stand here with  Representative Bowman, with our colleague Jan Schakowsky, with Mr.  Kahele, with all of our brothers and sisters in Congress to say that we  can and we must, and we will do so much better right now for our  working parents, our workers, our kids.   As we recover from the pandemic and Build Back Better, we can't  forget about the people who make up what we call the care economy-- nursing home workers, home caregivers, childcare providers, and others  who work every day to better the lives of other people.   Why is care work so important? The care economy has been central to  my own life. I started my career helping nursing home workers organize  with SEIU, but I think most parents can tell you about the importance  of childcare in their own words.   Personally, I think back to the birth of my first son, Koby, and how  so much of those early years were spent juggling schedules with my wife  to raise our son. I would stay home with the baby during the day so  Mary could teach in public school, and then she would rush home and tap  in while I took law school classes in the afternoon and evening.  Ultimately, we had three kids under 5 in the house and later four kids  altogether. It was joyful and exhilarating, but it was challenging and  there was just no way we could have done it alone.   Providing quality childcare to every family in this country means  providing every parent the opportunity to cherish raising their child  or their children without fear of losing their income, of losing their  job, of losing their career. Right now, in Michigan a year's worth of  childcare for an infant costs well over $10,000 on average. Who can  afford that?   A record number of women have dropped out of the workforce during the  pandemic. From August to September of last year alone, in one month,  865,000 women left the workforce. They didn't become unemployed. They  left the workforce because of their responsibility for caregiving. And  job gains in the recovery so far are disproportionately going to men.   In this crisis, we have an opportunity to Build Back Better and right  this historic inequity. President Biden's American Families Plan and  its investment in childcare won't just save families money by fully or  partially covering their childcare costs. It will also create good- paying jobs that will go predominantly to women and people of color.   The poverty rate for early educators in my State of Michigan is 18.9  percent, much higher, almost double compared to the 10.8 percent rate  for Michigan workers overall. Nearly half of U.S. childcare workers  receive public income support. These statistics are totally  unacceptable.   We need to take better care of the people taking care of our children  and our seniors, and we can start by raising their wages to $15 an hour  by 2025 with no subminimum wages. That would lead to higher quality  care and allow workers to provide for their own families.   Let's remember, high quality childcare and preschool don't just  benefit working parents and the workers involved. They benefit our kids  most of all. The data on the return on investment of investing in early  education in childcare is overwhelming in terms of these kids' whole  lives, their academic accomplishment, their earnings later in life.   There is so much at stake. We can't afford to let childcare become a  bargaining chip in the next round of negotiations. Strengthening  families, creating jobs, and giving kids the support they need to  thrive should be the centerpiece of our work, not an afterthought. I am  thrilled that the President's plan recognizes that.   Our work in this space won't end once we get the American Families  Plan signed into law. I believe we need to create a system of free  universal childcare and that our caregivers deserve far better pay,  benefits, training, and protection across the board. The American  Families Plan is a great start and brings us closer to that goal. Let's  get it done.    Madam Speaker, I thank Mr. Bowman for his leadership in this.
