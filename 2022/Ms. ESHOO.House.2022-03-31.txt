 Madam Speaker, I rise in full support of this legislation.  Seated here on the floor, listening to our Republican friends--price  controls, socialists, killing innovation. I am not going to use all of  my time using their language.   How about this? Diabetes kills. Diabetics need insulin. They have to  be able to afford it. They have paid their taxes all of their lives,  hardworking people.   So the cost for this? Sign me up for it. Sign me up for it to help  people, to invest in our own people.   This is absurd, the prices in our country, when it costs $15 to  manufacture.   So today, we stand with your constituents as well as ours to lower  the price of insulin for those that need it so that they can go on with  their lives.
