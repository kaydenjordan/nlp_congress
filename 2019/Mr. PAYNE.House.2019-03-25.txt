 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the great work of  tuberculosis survivor Kate O'Brien.   Kate visited my office in Newark earlier this month, along with the  staff from the Global Tuberculosis Institute of Rutgers University. She  shared with me her inspiring story about surviving TB and the need for  global and domestic TB funding.   Tuberculosis is a curable, airborne infection that kills more people  worldwide than any other infectious disease. It is the leading killer  of people with HIV worldwide.   Tuberculosis is also a problem here in the United States. In 2016,  the disease was reported in each of the 50 States, with more than 9,000  cases reported across the country that year.   Though it is curable, TB has a huge economic impact. In my State of  New Jersey, TB costs the economy $5.7 million a year.   We have made tremendous progress to combat TB here in the United  States. Because of the work of advocates and survivors like Kate  O'Brien, we can raise awareness about tuberculosis, increase funding  for research and treatment, and save lives at home and abroad.                            ____________________
