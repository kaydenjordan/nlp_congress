 Mr. President, I do, I have to thank my friend and  colleague Senator Warner from Virginia. He has been a leading voice on  this issue and the importance of passing this legislation, not just  because it addresses our national security. It gives us an economic  advantage in this country. But he also realizes the jobs it creates,  and it positions not just Nevada but every State--this country--to lean  into the future and be prepared for the challenges of the 21st century.   So I thank you because I know that you have been at the forefront of  this, and you have not relented. Thank you, thank you for everything  that you have done.                                   Medicare    Mr. President, there is another issue that is important for Nevada  that I want to talk about. It is not just Nevada but for so many across  the country.   You know, I was elected to the Senate, and ever since then, in 2017,  I have stood up for Medicare and Nevada seniors. I have fought against  the Trump administration's cruel proposals to cut Medicare funding, and  I championed provisions to expand Medicare funding and services.   That is why I was shocked when, last week, hundreds of Nevadans began  calling my office. They were anxious and alarmed over a deliberately  misleading ad that is running on TV, on Facebook, and via a text  campaign.   In Reno, this past weekend, Nevadans came up to me because they were  concerned about these false accusations. This ad incorrectly claims  that I support a bill that would strip $300 billion from Medicare. This  couldn't be further from the truth.   What I do know is that the ad is a deliberate lie, and what they are  being funded by, unfortunately--these ads--is a dark money group. They  are being funded by American Prosperity Alliance. This is exactly the  kind of group I have been raising the alarm about for years, because  here is the truth, here are the facts: I am standing up for Medicare,  just like I always have. I am pushing legislation, just like many of  our colleagues, just like the Presiding Officer is, as well, to lower  prescription drug costs for Nevadans and save Medicare and so many  other seniors across the country really almost $300 billion.   It saves the government. What we are doing, our legislation, in  total, saves dollars--almost $300 billion--for the government and,  ultimately, the taxpayers.   The bill would not cut anything but Big Pharma's profits, and seniors  in Nevada and across the country can expect even stronger benefits  under the legislation that I am working on, that the Presiding Officer  is working on, as so many of us are. So why would the ads lie about  something so important to the American public when we are working to  lower their costs and give them access to affordable healthcare in this  country?  [[Page S3670]]    Here is why: Because powerful interest groups out there don't want  this legislation to succeed. So they are pouring dark money into  efforts to stop it.    Now, we don't know who really funded this ad, and the organization  that wrote the check doesn't have to disclose that information. So  nobody can be held accountable, and that is part of the problem. And  that is why I have been calling for this accountability and this  transparency about who is funding all of these ads.   That is what we know--that the dark money is out there, and the only  one that is going to benefit from these ads at the end of the day is  Big Pharma, because they don't want their profits cut. So they are  trying to frighten Nevadans and pressure me to vote against a bill that  would help my very constituents.   Well, let me just say this: It won't work. I stand up to bullies, and  when I was attorney general, I was very proud that not only did I take  on the big banks during the foreclosure crisis, but, during my tenure  and continuing now, I stood up to Big Pharma, suing Pfizer for millions  after the company misled Nevada consumers about the safety of its  drugs.   So I am not going to be intimidated by advertisements spouting false  information to my constituents.   So I am here today to set the record straight and make sure that  Nevadans understand what is really going on, because here is what is  happening: The very legislation that I am working on, that the  Presiding Officer is working on for New Mexico, and so many of us are,  would dramatically lower prescription drug costs and strengthen  Medicare. It would do this by capping out-of-pocket costs for  prescription drugs. It would punish drug companies that try to raise  the prices of their drugs faster than the rate of inflation. And, oh,  yes, it would allow the government to negotiate fair prices for drugs  from pharmaceutical companies.   Our legislation will save the government almost $300 billion. Now,  that is not a cut; that is a savings. Every household in the country  knows the difference between the two. Under this plan, Nevadans will be  getting more benefits for less money, period. That is the truth.   Here is my question to Big Pharma: Why do you go out and scare  individuals, put ads out there that you are paying for that are lies,  when in actuality you could be working with us?   Because here is what I know, at the end of the day, from my  constituents: Nobody in this country, whether you live in the State of  Nevada or in any other State, should have to make a tough decision of  whether you can afford your healthcare, your prescription drugs, or put  food on the table or pay your electric bill. That is not what this  country is about.   So to Big Pharma, I will call you out. You want to really be a part  of the solution? Then come support this legislation. Help us in this  country lower costs for so many families who literally need access to  medications that they cannot afford. That is not what this country  stands for.   So that is the truth, and to anyone--anyone--who wants to come out  and challenge that, I am ready to debate you any time of the day.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
