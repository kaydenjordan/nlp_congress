 First of all, I want to thank Congressman Perlmutter  and Congressman Huffman who have been, again, diligent in terms of  coming to the floor on a regular basis to push back against what is  clearly a pretty coordinated, concerted effort to discredit the Mueller  investigation. It is really pretty disturbing on many levels,  fundamentally because it is an attack on institutions within our  country which we all took an oath to uphold and defend.  [[Page H4131]]    The rule of law is, frankly, one of the fundamental pillars of this  country in terms of being a free society. When you have folks who,  again, are holding public office going beyond just disagreements of  opinion regarding actions that all of us as public officials have to be  held accountable for, but really to attack the institutions themselves,  which is clearly the drumbeat of criticism of the Mueller investigation  and where it is headed, is something that really we need to speak out  and push back against.   Again, the 1-year anniversary is, I think, a very important moment to  step back and reflect in terms of where this investigation started and  where it is today.   Again, if you go back a year ago and look at the reaction that  greeted this appointment from, again, Republican leaders, Newt  Gingrich, Robert Mueller is a superb choice to be special counsel. His  reputation is impeccable for honesty and integrity.   Speaker Paul Ryan: ``My priority has been to ensure thorough . . .  investigations are allowed to follow the facts wherever they may lead.  . . . The addition of Robert Mueller as special counsel is consistent  with this goal, and I welcome his role at the Department of Justice.''                                time  1945    Senator Cory Gardner:         Robert Mueller had an incredible reputation.    Senator Orrin Hatch:         I commend the Department of Justice for bringing an       independent voice to help clarify this situation.    The list goes on and on. And again, why not? I mean, Robert Mueller  is somebody who has a record of service to this country going back to  when he was a marine in Vietnam. He led a rifle platoon, was wounded,  received a Purple Heart as well as the Vietnamese Cross of Gallantry  and two Navy Commendation medals for his military service.   He went on, obviously, to become a distinguished legal practitioner.  He was appointed by President Bush to be the head of the FBI and did  such a great job that, after his 10-year term, the U.S. Senate extended  his term 2 years by a vote of 100-0.   So when you are talking about somebody who has really earned a  reputation for being, really, a pretty conservative prosecutor, both in  terms of his time as a U.S. attorney and also in terms of his term as  head of the FBI, we are dealing with someone who is beyond reproach,  frankly.   And as was pointed out by Mr. Perlmutter, the decision came down at  the Washington, D.C., district court by Federal Judge Amy Berman  Jackson in a 37-page opinion which, again, pushed back very powerfully  about the notion that somehow he has strayed from his mission that the  Department of Justice gave him.   Again, her decision, just in case after case, points out that the  indictment of Manafort fell perfectly within the charge that he was  given by Assistant U.S. Attorney Rosenstein, which, again, is to  investigate other issues that ``may arise from the investigation.''   Again, in the case of Manafort, we are talking about somebody who was  squarely within the intelligence community's conclusion that the  election was basically under attack from Russians. Manafort's  connections to Ukrainian interests, which clearly were sort of on the  Russian side of Ukrainian politics, is just an obvious place for the  special counsel to pursue.   Again, as you point out, the number of indictments, the number of  convictions, clearly show that this is not a fishing expedition, it is  not a witch hunt. It is a serious prosecution whose every-step-of-the- way actions have been ratified by the courts and also ratified by the  appointing authority, Mr. Rosenstein.   It is time for all elected officials to step back and let this  process proceed. Again, the forensics on this in terms of just the  endorsements to Mr. Mueller's credibility and experience and knowledge  in this area scream out for all of us to respect the rule of law and  let this investigation proceed.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for holding this event on the 1- year milestone of the Mueller investigation.    Mr. Speaker, real briefly, again, as I mentioned  earlier and the two gentlemen have alluded to, we are talking about an  effort to discredit the Mueller investigation that I think, really, as  all Americans, we really should be concerned about the questions about  whether or not our court system is truly fair, whether or not the FBI,  the leading law enforcement agency of this country, is corrupt, which  is, again, some of the language that has been sort of tossed around by  the President's defenders. The harm that does in terms of really basic  institutions in this country is something that I just think you can't  treat as normal political discourse. We are talking about real long- lasting harm to the country.   Right now there are FBI counterterrorism agents who are hard at work,  literally, as we are standing here on this floor, keeping this country  safe. They are involved in investigations of mass shootings. You see  the FBI jackets when these events happen, and they were in Connecticut  when Sandy Hook took place.   I would just say, from a personal standpoint, my parents both served  in the FBI. My dad was a G-man back in the day, and my mother actually  was a clerical worker there. That is how they met, actually. So I guess  you could say I was born under the watchful eye of the FBI.   But the fact of the matter is that he was somebody who was very proud  of his service. Again, it was during World War II. His job was actually  tracking fifth columnists in the U.S. who were looking to cause  sabotage to critical facilities in the country.   Again, there are always, in every organization, instances where there  are bad apples. But the fact of the matter is, as an institution, in  terms of law enforcement, these agents are out there every single day  protecting this country; and to attack not just an individual decision  but an institution is, again, the real sort of level that we are  watching happen here with the pushback on the Mueller investigation,  and it is just totally unacceptable.   As I said, on the 1-year anniversary, it has proved its credibility,  the Mueller team, in terms of concrete, real results. And the courts  and, as I said, the Department of Justice have repeatedly reconfirmed  and reaffirmed the rationale for the creation of the Mueller  investigation and the fact that it is operating totally within the  mission and charge that was given.   So I think it is important for all of us to continue to raise our  voices and defend the rule of law and institutions that are out there  to protect our Constitution and our democracy.
