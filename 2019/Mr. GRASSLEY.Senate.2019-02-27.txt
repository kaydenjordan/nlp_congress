 Mr. President, I come to the floor to talk about the  IRS and tax issues and the tax bill last year, but following on what  Senator Perdue said, I want to, first of all, compliment him for not  only this speech but several times he has talked about how the Senate  has stalled time after time on nominees.   I want to bring to my colleagues' attention that at one time, there  was a lot of concern by President Obama that his nominees were not  being confirmed fast enough. We started hearing that in January 2013.  All of a sudden, there was a feeling that we ought to have a bipartisan  solution to this issue to speed along President Obama's nominees. At  one time, the Democratic leader then was talking about using a nuclear  option to accomplish a change in rules. Both Republicans and Democrats  thought that wasn't a very good idea, so Republicans and Democrats got  together and agreed to reduce postcloture debate time for the rest of  the 113th Congress, although, before that Congress ended, Senator Reid  decided to use the nuclear option anyway, and he did that at a later  time.   If Republicans and Democrats could get together in the 113th Congress  to speed up the time and have less postcloture debate time, why can't  we do it now? The problem, of course, is for the Trump nominees being  held up in the Senate, the time is far worse than it was under  President Obama or, for that matter, any other President before that.   It seems to me, as we are talking about changing the post-debate time  again--because there is a resolution out of our Rules Committee--I  think it is about time that we think that what is good for the goose is  good for the gander, and we ought to reinstate that bipartisan  agreement. I hope we can get the support of Democrats to do that like  they had the support of Republicans to do that when we had a Democratic  President.   I thank Senator Perdue for what he spoke about on a longer basis than  I just did, but I want to back him up fully.
