 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.  [[Page H8451]]    Mr. Speaker, I rise today to join my colleague in remembering the  36th anniversary of the appalling terrorist attack on American troops  stationed in Beirut, Lebanon, on October 23, 1983.   This horrific attack took the lives of 241 U.S. troops and injured  countless others. This incident marked the highest single-day death  toll for the United States Marine Corps since the Battle of Iwo Jima.   My friend and fellow Hoosier,   Greg Pence, was stationed in Beirut  just 10 days before the terrorist attack and lost many fellow marines  in the bombing.   Here with us today, seated in the gallery, are a few of the Gold Star  families who lost their loved ones and family members on that fateful  day.   Mr. Speaker, freedom truly is not free, and I thank them for their  sacrifice and pay tribute to the brave servicemembers who paid the  ultimate sacrifice to defend and protect the United States of America.
