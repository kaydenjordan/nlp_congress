 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for the excellent  work that he has done on the BRICK Act, and also Mr. Johnson, who  brought this legislation forward and who has worked so closely with  individuals, with companies in his district to address their concerns  on this.   Now, what brings us here today is the fact that, once before, the  brick industry faced an EPA rule that went on the books, hadn't gone  through judicial review. This happened in 2003.   Over a period of 5 years, they began ramping up to make these  changes. This is expensive because most of the brick manufacturers in  our country are small businesses. They have two kilns, and they are  working very, very hard to keep the jobs and keep people employed. When  they look at having to change to this new equipment, the investment is  going to be $3 million, $4 million, $5 million, depending on the size  of their business.   Now, previously, a rule went through the process of judicial review,  and then it was withdrawn. What this legislation does is to say, look,  let's finish this entire process before we move that expense to the  industry, because when you put it to the industry and they are  incurring this cost that could end up being an unnecessary cost, what  happens? Brick costs more. Building materials cost more.   Who ends up paying for that? Consumers, purchasers, individuals who  are buying homes, individuals who are remodeling homes, individuals who  are building commercial buildings.   So what we are saying is let's exercise some wisdom. Let's exercise a  little bit of experience that comes from having been here before, and  let's delay until this entire process is finished.   As we have talked about bricks, we are also addressing the wood  heater industry, which is a primary source of heat for many of our  homes, and just saying let's be mindful, let's be careful, let's put  consumers and taxpayers in front of the bureaucrats who are looking to  implement these rules and regulations.
