 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to bid farewell to my dear  friend, Representative Steve Stivers, as he embarks on a new adventure  leading the Ohio Chamber of Commerce.   A career soldier, Steve has served more than 30 years in the Ohio  Army National Guard and holds the rank of major general. He served the  United States overseas during Operation Iraqi Freedom where he led 400  soldiers and contractors. For his leadership, he was awarded the Bronze  Star. In a battle closer to home, Steve served on the front lines in  America's fight against the opioid epidemic. Steve was a champion for  the cause of civility not just in politics, but in our daily lives and  founded the Congressional Civility and Respect Caucus.   Just as Steve has left his mark here in the Halls of Congress and in  the lives of so many Americans, I know he will continue to do big  things as president and CEO of the Ohio Chamber of Commerce and as a  champion for job growth across our State.                            ____________________
