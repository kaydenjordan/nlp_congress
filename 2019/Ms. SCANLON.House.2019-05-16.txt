 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chair, I rise today in support of an amendment to require greater  accountability from the Department of Health and Human Services with  respect to the Affordable Care Act.   Time and time again, we have seen Republicans and the administration  attempt to undermine the important work of the Affordable Care Act.   In addition to attempting to strip away protections for preexisting  conditions or reducing coverage for Medicaid recipients, the  administration is trying to depress coverage by cutting consumer  outreach and marketing for the ACA. Not only does sabotaging the  enrollment process make it harder for the American people to get health  coverage, but it also drives up costs.   Unfortunately, this strategy has been working. We are currently at  our highest uninsured rate in 4 years, with Affordable Care Act  enrollment rates declining every year this President has been in  office.   Everyday Americans, like the folks in my district in southeastern  Pennsylvania, can't afford more barriers to healthcare. When their  choice is often between putting food on their table or going to the  doctor, it is important that people have more information and access to  the Affordable Care Act marketplaces, not less.   My amendment would require greater transparency from the  administration by requiring the Secretary of Health and Human Services  to provide vital statistics on plan enrollment, outreach, and  advertising, and the overall performance of the programs within the  ACA.   This information will allow Congress to perform better, quicker  oversight on Health and Human Services' attempts to roll back  information and outreach for potential Affordable Care Act enrollees.   No longer will the administration be able to hide its lack of  investment in ACA outreach and education or refuse to turn over data on  how its say-nothing sabotage is hurting Americans.   Mr. Chair, I encourage Members on both sides of the aisle to support  this commonsense amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1600     Mr. Chairman, I would just, again, urge Members from  both sides of the aisle to support this bill, and I yield back the  balance of my time.
