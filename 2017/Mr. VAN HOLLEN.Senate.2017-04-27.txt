 Mr. President, I oppose the nomination of Alexander  Acosta to be Secretary of the Department of Labor.   Our Nation's Labor Secretary has a responsibility to protect the  safety and legal rights of the American workforce. From prosecuting  civil rights violations to monitoring workplace safety, the Department  of Labor ensures fair treatment. The Labor Secretary must also evaluate  our economy and advocate for fair and equal pay and benefits for  American workers. The Department provides the data and expertise for  policymakers, employers, and workers to make economic decisions.  [[Page S2589]]    Unfortunately, Mr. Acosta's testimony on these points at his  confirmation hearing was disappointing. He would not commit to support  updating overtime rules to make sure that employees get fair pay for  the hours they work. He would not commit to prioritize closing the  gender pay gap. He would not commit to keeping workplace safety  inspectors on the job.   Moreover, when Mr. Acosta led the Civil Rights Division of the  Department of Justice during the George W. Bush Administration, the GAO  reported that there was a ``significant drop in the enforcement of  several major antidiscrimination and voting rights laws.'' The  Secretary of Labor must be a vigilant defender of the rights of  workers.   In a Cabinet where too many department heads are looking out for  millionaires and billionaires, we need a Secretary of Labor who will  look out for the American worker. I am not convinced that Mr. Acosta  will do that job.
