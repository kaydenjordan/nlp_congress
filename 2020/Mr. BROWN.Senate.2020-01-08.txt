 Madam President, I rise today to honor a heroic Ohio  veteran whom we lost this month, CPL Fred B. McGee. Corporal McGee  served in Korea, where he and his squad leader were both wounded in the  bloody Battle of Hill 528.   With his leader down, and despite his own injuries, Corporal McGee  took command--he wasn't next in line, but he stepped up, and he saved  lives. He was hit again, and his squad was given the order to withdraw.  Yet still, with shrapnel in the face and leg, he voluntarily remained  behind to evacuate his fellow soldiers who were wounded and killed. His  acts of bravery earned Corporal McGee a Silver Star and two Purple  Hearts.   For too long, he did not receive the recognition he earned serving  our country. Like so many veterans, Corporal McGee rarely spoke about  his service and never drew attention to his own courage. While  recalling the battle earlier this year he said, ``No, I'm not brave. I  just did what was a necessity.''   And in the 1950s, the color of his skin surely also contributed to  the lack of recognition for Corporal McGee's heroism. He was drafted in  1951 into a newly integrating Army and was one of the first African- American soldiers to serve in Korea. Jefferson County's sheriff talked  about how someone made a comic book in 1953 illustrating 10 stories of  soldiers' heroics, they depicted Corporal McGee as a White man.   We owe a hero like Corporal McGee a tribute that befits his service  and sacrifice. At the end of last year, the Jefferson County Veterans  Service Commission honored Corporal McGee as its Veteran of the Year.  And I ask all my colleagues to join me in honoring him on the Senate  floor today.   We thank CPL Fred McGee for his heroism and his sacrifices for our  country and we send our thoughts to Corporal McGee's family. May the  tributes from the many lives he touched bring you comfort, and know  that we will keep alive the story of his heroism.                            ____________________
