 Mr. President, I am proud to recognize Olivia Van  Ledtje of Durham as March's Granite Stater of the Month. Olivia, a 12- year-old book activist, creates videos--called LivBits--that seek to  encourage children around the globe to love books as much as she does.   Olivia began creating LivBits when she was 8 years old as a way to  overcome bullying that she experienced. The videos gave Olivia a  purpose and allowed her to find her voice.   Olivia's first video, which was uploaded to her mother's social  media, went viral and has more than 500,000 views. Since then, Olivia  has created many more LivBits about some of her favorite books and even  hosted a podcast with authors as a way to get children her age excited  about reading.   Over the last few years, Olivia has travelled across the country and  around the world to promote her love of reading and inspire others. Due  to the COVID-19 pandemic, Olivia hasn't been travelling as much, but  because her work is built for the digital age, she is still able to  share her message with children and teachers around the globe.   Olivia's passion for and dedication to promoting literacy and  inspiring children in New Hampshire and around the world to love  reading represents the best of our State. By promoting self-reliance  and self-empowerment through discovery and learning, I know that she  will continue to do incredible things, and I look forward to everything  she will go on to accomplish.                            ____________________
