 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R.  1, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.   This crucial legislation before us today marks the first time in 31  years that Congress has considered a major overhaul to the current Tax  Code that  [[Page H9384]]  is overly cumbersome, wildly outdated, and riddled with special- interest loopholes.   Mr. Speaker, it is obvious there is a great deal of frustration and  anxiety in our country. I truly believe it is due to the fact that the  economic recovery has not reached every household. Throughout south  Florida, I hear from families and small businesses who are worried  about saving for their kids' college or making payroll.   While the stock market is humming and unemployment is low, wages have  been stagnant, and the so-called recovery has left way too many people  behind.                                time  0945    That is why this bill is so important.   This legislation will collapse and lower current tax rates to ensure  a typical middle-income family in south Florida will receive about  $1,500 in tax relief. For married couples, it doubles the standard  deduction from $12,000 to $24,000, drastically simplifying the process  of filing taxes each year for over 90 percent of Americans while  allowing taxpayers to keep more of their hard-earned money.   The bill also expands the child tax credit from $1,000 to $1,600 per  child, a benefit that will be seen by 43,768 taxpayers in Florida's  26th District, while we are also making it easier to save for college  by expanding 529 plans to cover more expenses, including apprenticeship  programs. All these benefits will directly help alleviate the  increasing cost of raising a family.   On the business side, this bill gives American companies of all  sizes, especially our smaller enterprises and entrepreneurs, a chance  to compete and win in the new globalized economy. By providing  businesses with lower tax rates, we will make it easier for job  creators to invest here at home and increase paychecks for American  workers.   Mr. Speaker, as a proud Member of the Ways and Means Committee, I  commend Chairman Brady, his staff, and the Members of this House who  will soon support this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to ensure we  provide all Americans, especially the most vulnerable, the opportunity  to find their economic success.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Chairman Brady for working with me to  begin addressing the important issue of helping our fellow American  citizens in Puerto Rico. After the devastating effects of Hurricanes  Irma and Maria, our committee delivered immediate results for the  island through a disaster tax relief package targeted to help people  get back on their feet.   While it will take at least months for the island to fully recover,  we are providing even more assistance to Puerto Rico with the  legislation being considered today.   I want to thank Chairman Brady for helping us extend the rum cover- over to $13.25 per proof gallon to be paid back to the treasuries of  both Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands through 2023. I am also  grateful that under this bill, companies operating in Puerto Rico can  deduct income attributable to domestic production activities  retroactively for the year 2017.   Moving forward, I am hopeful we can work together to find creative  solutions to better target the child tax credit to serve more Puerto  Rico families and study the expanded use of the earned income tax  credit for the Commonwealth. In addition, I look forward to continuing  to work on solutions to ensure the businesses operating on the island  have the certainty they need in terms of tax planning to hire more  workers and strengthen Puerto Rico's economy.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Brady for that.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Brady for that.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Brady for that.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Brady for that.
