 Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to this budget  resolution.   A budget is a moral document. It reflects our values. This budget is  a stark reminder that the majority and the Trump administration are  waging a war on the middle class and eviscerating the social safety net  programs that help our most vulnerable citizens.   The social safety net was built on a bipartisan basis. Why is the  majority hell-bent on destroying it?   Older Americans will suffer under this budget. It cuts $1.5 trillion  from Medicare and Medicaid. It betrays middle class job seekers by  cutting job training, education programs, and other nondefense programs  by 34 percent over the next 10 years.   It decimates the Food Stamp program, SNAP benefits and assumes the  enactment of the House-passed repeal of the Affordable Care Act,  targeting American families who are struggling to get by.   If we were serious about addressing the problems that face middle  class families, we would be voting on a budget resolution that invests  in their priorities: job training, apprenticeships, paid family and  medical leave, fair trade, and equal pay for equal work.   Instead, we are considering a budget that is merely a means for the  majority to jam through their tax cuts for the wealthy and for  corporations.   The biggest economic challenge of our time is that too many people  now are in jobs that do not pay them enough to live on. We should be  growing the middle class and looking for solutions that work for  America's families.   We ought to be prioritizing the needs of working families, the ones  who have entrusted us to come to Washington to fight for them and to  fight for their families. Instead, this budget puts corporate profits  first. It caters to those with the most lobbyists.   This budget is a disgrace to the promises that we have made to the  American people, and I urge my colleagues to oppose it.
