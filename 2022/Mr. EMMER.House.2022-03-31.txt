 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to address a crisis eroding the  budgets of hard-working Americans.   Earlier this month, the price of unleaded gasoline rose to the  highest level on record, and President Biden's anti-energy policies are  directly responsible.   On the campaign trail, Joe Biden promised to end fossil fuels. Since  assuming office, President Biden has worked to make good on that  promise, imposing 81 individual anti-energy policies.   Coincidentally, the price of gasoline has risen 81 percent since the  beginning of his presidency.   Analysts estimate that President Biden's anti-energy agenda will cost  American families an additional $2,000 per year in gasoline costs  alone. This is staggering for the 64 percent of Americans who live  paycheck to paycheck, thanks to rising costs.   President Biden claims he can't do much right now to reduce gas  prices. This simply is not true. President Biden can end the Federal  freeze on new oil and gas projects, fast track LNG export permits,  expedite approval of all pipeline and energy development, and stop the  regulatory barrage on U.S. energy development.   There is so much that can and should be done right now, and this  crusade against American energy dominance must end.              Recognizing the Sherburne County Sheriff's Office     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the extraordinary  achievement of the Sherburne County Sheriff's Office.   Sheriff Joel Brott, his deputies, and the Sherburne County Jail and  clinic staff have earned the prestigious Triple Crown accreditation  from the National Sheriffs' Association.   As one of only 50 sheriffs' offices in the country to earn the Triple  Crown accreditation, this is a major achievement.   In fact, this accreditation is so rare that, according to the  National Sheriffs' Association, fewer than 100 sheriffs' offices have  qualified since its establishment in 1993.   The Triple Crown requires simultaneous accreditation by four law  enforcement organizations. Achieving one of them is a feat, but gaining  all four at once is truly remarkable.   Congratulations, Sheriff Brott. We applaud you and your entire staff  for your exceptional work and commitment to excellence in law  enforcement.                       Owen Lipinski Hockey Tournament     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a young hockey  player in my district who embodies the spirit of our great sport.   For Minnesotans, hockey is a way of life. Like many young people in  our State, Owen Lipinski grew up with a love for the game.   Sadly, when Owen was just 2 years old, he was diagnosed with Marfan  syndrome, a connective tissue disorder that makes it difficult for him  to play.   One rough hit could cause Owen to lose his eyesight or possibly even  threaten his life.   However, this didn't stop him from playing. Owen participated in  Minnesota Special Hockey and enjoyed it, but he still wanted more.   Recently, Owen organized a tournament with six teams composed of  friends from his neighborhood. He organized the entire event on a pond  in his back yard, complete with a public address system and a small  concession stand.   As a fellow Minnesotan who loves the game, Owen is an inspiration. I  am inspired by Owen and his great work. Congratulations on the  tournament, Owen, and I hope you continue to inspire us for years to  come.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the outstanding  accomplishments of one of my constituents, Ms. Rebecca Booker.   Rebecca has served the Blaine community as a certified fire and life  safety educator for the last 20 years. Recently, Rebecca was honored  with the 2022 Dr. Anne W. Phillips Award for Leadership in Fire Safety  Education by the Congressional Fire Services Institute and the  International Fire Service Training Association.  [[Page H4013]]    Among her many contributions to fire safety education, Rebecca helped  develop the nationally recognized Home Safety Survey, a voluntary home  inspection program that looks for potential fire, injury, and crime  hazards while offering solutions. Rebecca has completed nearly 4,000 of  these surveys herself and trained many colleagues across the country to  perform these surveys in their communities.   Ms. Booker also helped establish New America Academy in Minnesota, an  organization that provides fire safety education for culturally diverse  and immigrant communities.   Rebecca, congratulations on earning this prestigious award and thank  you for all you do to increase fire safety education in Minnesota's  Sixth Congressional District.                           Recognizing Abby Honold     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Abby Honold, one of  the strongest Minnesotans I have ever met and a leader in the fight  against sexual assault.   Sexual assault is a life-shattering event, the trauma of which lasts  a lifetime but can be compounded in the immediate aftermath by improper  care. When Abby, then a student at the University of Minnesota,  reported her assault to police in 2014, she worked with a healthcare  professional proficient in trauma-informed care to recall important  details about her assault to law enforcement and bring the perpetrator  to justice.   Survivors like Abby deserve justice, and I was pleased to see that  the Abby Honold Act got signed into law earlier this month.                            ____________________
