 Mr. President, I know I am interrupting a very, very  important debate, and I appreciate my colleagues being out here to  discuss this. I know the Senator from Illinois, the leader, is also  here to discuss this issue. I am asking if I could interrupt that for a  second.   I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate  consideration of Calendar No. 591, S. 3773.    I ask unanimous consent that the bill be considered  read a third time and passed and that the motion to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table.
