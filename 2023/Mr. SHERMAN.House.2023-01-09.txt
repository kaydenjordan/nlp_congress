 Mr. Speaker, for 3 days and 3 long nights, every class  of Republican came to this floor to argue about which of them hated the  national debt more. Now, as the first thing, they bring forth a bill  that will increase the national debt by $1.6 trillion, according to six  bipartisan Secretaries of the Treasury.   Working people can't evade taxes. They get W-2s and 1099s.   Republicans support this bill, because every time a billionaire  successfully cheats on his taxes, a member of the Freedom Caucus earns  his wings.   As co-chair of the bipartisan CPA Caucus, and former head of the  second largest tax agency in America, I say we need staff to put the  Service back into the Internal Revenue Service.   One employee for every 2,000 tax returns filed, that is the staffing  level that Ronald Reagan insisted upon. It is the level Democrats would  restore.   Trump took outrageous positions on his returns, and counted on a  light audit. Whereas Ronald Reagan paid his taxes and staffed the IRS.   Don't make honest taxpayers feel like suckers. Stand with Ronald  Reagan and vote ``No.''
