 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, in the 3 days since the President  returned from his humiliating display of obsequiousness in Helsinki, he  has offered numerous explanations for his behavior.   First, he said the media was too focused on the negative and that his  summit with Putin was a great success. Then, admitting there was, in  fact, a problem, he attempted to walk  [[Page S5081]]  back some of his comments, but even he couldn't commit to that and ad- libbed that other people could also have been responsible for  interfering in the 2016 elections. A mere 24 hours later, the President  was back to claiming it was not his fault and that the media was  biased.   Then, astoundingly--the President not having learned his lesson--when  he was asked yesterday whether Russia was still attacking our election  system, the President replied ``no.'' This was, of course, followed by  yet another implausible clarification when--surprise--his Press  Secretary told reporters that was not what the President meant.  Although, when you actually look at the tape, it is clear as a bell it  is what the President meant. He was saying Russia was not still  attacking our election system--once again, disbelieving all of the fine  men and women who have reported this, who labor quietly, diligently in  our intelligence agencies.   The constantly shifting, insincere, and thoroughly unconvincing  explanations for the President's performance reveal that the President  and his team do not understand the depth of President Trump's blunders  with Putin. Frankly, any post hoc clarification cannot substitute for  or repair the President's failure to confront Putin face-to-face. All  of his walk backs, which then get undone, are done in the wrong place  at the wrong time.   Where is this man who prides himself on being strong but is then  afraid to say these things to Putin and has to wait until he is 6,000  miles away to say them? It is unbelievable.   One of the most stunning things about the summit was the President's  openness to a request by President Putin to question former U.S.  Ambassador to Moscow Michael McFaul and other Americans. In Helsinki,  the President described the request as part of an ``incredible offer.''  The President's spokeswoman was asked about it yesterday. She confirmed  the President and his team would discuss it.   That President Trump would even consider handing over a former U.S.  Ambassador to Putin and his cronies for interrogation is bewildering.  No President should have the power to gift wrap American citizens, let  alone former Ambassadors, to our known adversaries. How can President  Trump and his team spend even a moment considering Putin's request? How  can they equate the democracy and rule of law and system of open and  fair prosecution we have in this country with what Putin does? It is  just amazing.   Every day, this President demeans the United States. So many  Americans are saying they are ashamed to have him as their leader when  he behaves like this.   Certainly, if the President were to agree to such a request, Congress  must do everything in its power to block it. There can be no room for  debate, no room for discussion. We must be clear--and clear quickly.  This morning, Senator Menendez, Senator Schatz, and I plan to offer a  simple resolution that states: ``It is the sense of Congress that the  United States should refuse to make available any current or former  diplomat, civil servant, political appointee, law enforcement official,  or member of the Armed Forces of the United States for questioning by  the government of Vladimir Putin.'' This body must agree on the  importance of protecting our Ambassadors. We should pass it today, not  wait, not show any equivocation.   This incredible offer, as President Trump so casually and incorrectly  called it, raises other serious questions. What else has President  Trump agreed to behind closed doors? What else has he discussed with  President Putin? President Trump and President Putin met for nearly 2  hours behind closed doors. No one else was present but a translator,  and hardly anyone knows what was said.   Has Secretary Pompeo been briefed on that private, behind-closed- doors meeting? Nobody knows. He hasn't said so. Does our military know  if President Trump made commitments about our nuclear arsenal? Nobody  knows. Defense Secretary Mattis hasn't said whether he has been  briefed. Do we know if President Trump made commitments about the  security of Israel or Syria or North Korea or about any of the other  issues the President said he discussed with Putin?   It is utterly amazing that no one knows what was said. This is a  democracy. If our President makes agreements with one of our leading-- if not our leading--adversaries, his Cabinet has to know about it and  so do the American people. These questions and more need a full and  complete accounting before Congress, in an open setting, as soon as  possible   That is why I have called on the Republican leadership to demand that  Secretary of State Pompeo, Ambassador Huntsman, and, crucially, the  translator who was present at the closed-door session be made to  testify before the Senate. They should come immediately--now. What are  our Republican friends waiting for?   The events of this week raise serious questions about the President's  ability to responsibly and safely conduct this Nation's foreign policy,  about his ability and willingness to defend the United States and her  citizens, about his very ability to govern in so many areas.   Confronted with these grave questions, I believe the Senate must act  to show our country's resolve to punish Putin for his interference and  never allow such a thing to happen again and to ensure the President is  doing what is necessary to stand up for American interests.   So I have proposed--and many of my colleagues on this side of the  aisle have proposed--a bunch of things we can do right now to take  action in the wake of President Trump's indefensible summit with  President Putin. Democrats are not in the majority. We don't control  the floor. We need our Republican colleagues, who control the Senate  floor, to join us on these measures. The lack of action--action, not  just words--by our Republican colleagues is stunning and deeply  disappointing not just to Democrats but to all of the American people.   Since Monday, sadly, we haven't seen movement from our colleagues in  the majority, just more slow-walking. I understand my friends, Senators  Coons and Flake, are working on introducing a resolution to support the  consensus of our intelligence agencies and to request congressional  oversight. We are all for it. I hope it passes with the unanimous  consent it deserves. My Republican friends can and must do more-- actions, not just resolutions and statements of disapproval. We  shouldn't need this resolution. The things asked for in this resolution  should have been happening already.   The burden of patriotism and of protecting America's security is on  Leader McConnell's shoulders. I know he has a difficult situation. I  know he has a President who can sometimes be vindictive. The bottom  line is, our country's security, our country's direction, our country's  honor demand it.   We need to bring Secretary of State Pompeo, Ambassador Huntsman, and  the rest of President Trump's national security team from Helsinki,  including the translator who was present in the one-on-one meeting with  Putin, right here before the Congress, in open session, so we all will  know what happened.   We need to pass legislation to protect Special Counsel Mueller. There  is bipartisan legislation already that was passed out of the Judiciary  Committee under Senator Grassley's leadership and support. It is on the  floor. What is our Republican leader waiting for?   We need to see the President's tax returns, which has been the common  practice of all Presidents in recent memory, but it is needed far more  now because one of the most logical explanations of the President's  obsequious and almost inexplicable actions toward President Putin is  that Putin has something on him. Maybe it would be revealed in the tax  returns, and if there is nothing there, the President should have no  problem with releasing them.   We need to implement sanctions against Russia, not weaken them. We  need to demand that Putin hand over the 12 Russians who have been  indicted for election interference. We also need to harden our election  infrastructure so that what happened in 2016 never happens again.   These are all commonsense measures, and most of them have bipartisan  support already. They will accomplish for America what the President  has been unwilling or unable to do. If my Republican colleagues refuse  to pursue any--if not all--of these items, they are de  [[Page S5082]]  facto consenting to the President's capitulation in Helsinki. They  cannot stand by. The American people will not allow it.                            ____________________     Madam President, finally, on healthcare, ever since  Republicans have been handed the keys to both Houses of Congress and  the White House after the 2016 election, they have engaged in a  protracted campaign of sabotage against our healthcare system. Premiums  are going up, coverage is going down, and it is all falling in the laps  of our Republican colleagues in the House and Senate.   President Trump and congressional Republicans proposed legislation  that would have gutted Medicaid and allowed insurers to charge more and  deny coverage just because a person had gotten sick. The legislation  would have excluded critical benefits and imposed lifetime or annual  limits on care.   Under cover of night, the Republicans dismantled the healthcare law's  coverage requirement without putting anything in its place.   The Trump administration canceled the Federal program that helped  low-income customers afford insurance and expanded the availability of  junk insurance plans that sucker Americans in with low premiums but  that hardly cover anything. When people have these plans, they ask: Why  did I even buy insurance? They were duped.   Now, worse yet, the administration has directed the Justice  Department to stop defending the constitutionality of protections for  Americans with preexisting medical conditions--turning its back on the  most popular and humane advancement in our healthcare system over the  last decade.   I would say to my Republican friends: Go to your constituents. Ask if  people have someone who is sick in their families. You will get a lot  of hands. Then ask them if they should be excluded from gaining health  insurance to help that sick member and see how many support these  ideas.   If they try to do this in the dark of night, it is not going to work.  In August, we Democrats are going to be talking about this over and  over again. Believe me--this will probably be the most important factor  in the 2018 election as the American people will rebel from the taking  away of healthcare.   Imagine going back to the days when a mother with a child who has  cancer can no longer find affordable healthcare for her daughter. When  hard-working Americans who fall on hard times are made to suffer by  being denied healthcare coverage precisely because they need it, how  wrong, how backward, how immoral. That is where President Trump wants  to take us, and that is where all of our Republican colleagues seem to  be following.   Later this morning--actually, right now--a group of Democrats is  announcing how we plan to fight back against this lawsuit and preserve  the protections for up to 130 million nonelderly Americans who have  preexisting conditions. The elderly, fortunately, are protected since  we still have Medicare, despite some efforts by some on the other side  to cut it back.   As millions of Americans watch their healthcare costs go up, as they  read the news about the latest Republican effort to undo healthcare  protections, they fear for the future and wonder who in Washington will  be fighting for them. In November, they will have the chance to vote  for a party that will check the President's dangerous healthcare  sabotage, that will work to bring down costs and improve quality, that  will never undermine the protections of Americans with preexisting  conditions.   I look forward to the response to my colleagues' announcement.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I want to thank my friend, the Senator  from Vermont, for this outstanding resolution. It is a resolution. I  don't see who can object to it. We ask for five things in this  resolution: that our government accept the assessment of our own  Intelligence Committees about Russia's interference; that we move  aggressively to protect our election systems; that the sanctions that  this body passed 98 to 2 finally be implemented by the Trump  administration; that there be no interference in Mr. Mueller's  investigation; and that there must be cooperation.   Who in America would object to that? Maybe a small group of hard- right ideologues, but no one else.   Who in this body will object to it? This is an outstanding  resolution.   I know my friend from Vermont would agree with me. We need action in  addition to resolutions, but this is an excellent start. I urge all of  my colleagues to support this fullheartedly. Our country is at risk.   The Senator from Vermont is sounding a clarion call and saying in a  bipartisan way that we should strengthen our country, not weaken it, as  the President has done over the last week. I hope this will get  unanimous support from every Member of this body--whether they be  Democrat, Independent, or Republican; whether they be liberal,  moderate, or conservative. If you love America, if you care about our  security, support this resolution.   I thank my colleague for yielding.    Madam President, first, before I talk about the  resolution Senators Menendez, Schatz, and I have authored that will be  voted on at 1:45 p.m., I would like to say a few words about the work  the Senators from Delaware and Arizona did and my severe disappointment  that there was objection from the Republican leadership.   The bottom line is very simple. President Trump has put our country  in a foreign policy crisis. President Trump has weakened the security  of this country. A resolution is the minimum we can do. We should be  acting.   The idea that we cannot even pass a resolution in this body because  of the objection on the other side, when this was done in a bipartisan,  careful way by the Senators from Arizona and Delaware, shows something  very bad. Our colleagues on the other side of the aisle are so cowered  by a President that they cannot stand up for national security. They  cannot stand up to Vladimir Putin, just as the President seems not to  be able to.   I have one more point. From what I am told, one of the major  objections from the other side was that Congress wished the  contemporaneous notes from that secret 2-hour meeting be made  available. That is key.   What are they hiding? What are they afraid of? The American people  have a right to know what went on in that meeting, particularly when  President Putin gets up and talks about some agreements that it seems  not even our high-ranking officials in the State and Defense  Departments and intelligence agencies know about. This is amazing.   We have come to a really low moment in this body when a bipartisan  resolution that is rather modest and limited--I had talked to the  Senator from Delaware. He knows I wanted much more in this resolution,  but in an effort to get something done, we limited it.   In my view--the view of most Americans--the notes should be made  available. The translator should be made available. The translator  wasn't specifically referred to in this resolution, but when they  talked about relevant people coming, my view--and I believe the view of  the Senator from Delaware--was that would include the translator. I am  not sure if it was the view of the Senator from Arizona. It doesn't  matter. We are not even passing this resolution.   I have to say, this was a moment for bipartisanship. This was a  moment for America pulling together. This was a moment, when the  President doesn't served the country well, that Americans of all  parties, all ideologies come together and fill that void and undo the  misdeeds that occurred in Helsinki.   Unfortunately, because of weakness, fear--my guess is, if you looked  inside the hearts and minds of every Member on the other side, all but  maybe one or two would feel this is the right resolution, but they are  afraid. Fear will not get us anywhere. Letting a bully push us around,  meaning President Putin, as he pushed President Trump around, will not  serve this country well. It is a sad moment that this resolution was  rejected.                                 S. Res. 584    Madam President, before I yield to my good friend, the hard-working  and very able ranking member of the Foreign Relations Committee, I want  to talk about our resolution which we are going to vote on. Lord knows  what would happen if we couldn't have even gotten a vote on that.   The idea that an American ambassador, who served us so well, should  be brought before Putin and his minions to be questioned, when there is  no charge against him, no issue against him--it is not like the 12  Russians who are indicted for trying to interfere with our elections.  It is not even an analogy. There is not an evenness. President Trump  amazingly called this an ``incredible offer.'' Our President is saying  that one of our Ambassadors being hauled before an authoritarian regime  that twists the truth, that lies at will, that even seems to kill  people they want to with poison in other countries is an incredible  offer?   Well, this resolution is a fine resolution. It will pass. It doesn't  undo what just happened. It doesn't make up for the fact that our  colleagues are afraid to take real action, even a resolution that  posits action in terms of the major misdeeds at Helsinki. At the very  least, we are protecting the integrity of the men and women who serve  us, because if today it is the Ambassador, tomorrow it could be  somebody in the military or somebody in the intelligence agencies or  elsewhere.    This resolution is very clear. What it says is, when President Trump  called Putin's offer an ``incredible offer,'' he was incredibly wrong.  No President can put one of our fine servants at risk who has worked  hard, in this case, for the diplomatic corps. This resolution is a bare  minimum of what we should be doing here. I am glad it will be on the  floor, and I suspect it will pass--hopefully, unanimously.   I yield to my colleague from New Jersey.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the consideration of S. Res. 584 as under the previous order  and that I then be permitted to speak briefly about it.    Mr. President, I am hopeful that we will come together  on this resolution, which I introduced with the Senator from New Jersey  and the Senator from Hawaii, that it is neither the policy nor the  practice of the United States to submit our citizens, let alone our  Ambassadors, to the interrogation of a foreign adversary.   Let this resolution be a warning to the administration that Congress  will not allow this to happen. I call on President Trump to say once  and for  [[Page S5099]]  all--not through his spokespeople--that the lopsided, disgraceful trade  he called an incredible offer is now off the table. There should be no  equivocation on the matter.   One more point. I am so disappointed in the failure of the  resolutions earlier today. We had a real chance for bipartisanship. The  resolutions were modest and mild, and they were just resolutions, but  we couldn't even come to agreement on those. Our Republican colleagues,  given the crisis we have in foreign policy, have to step up to the  plate and join us not just in resolutions but in bipartisan action that  is so important.   I was told that one of the reasons the resolution was objected to was  because we couldn't--they didn't even want us to get the notes, let  alone hear from the translator of this 2-hour, mysterious meeting where  nobody seems to know what happened. The American people should know  what happened. The Senate should know what happened. Our leaders in the  State Department and Defense Department should know what happened. Our  colleagues on the other side of the aisle seem to be too afraid to let  us bring that up. That is so wrong for the security of America.   I am hopeful--there are bipartisan efforts going on today--that we  cannot do what we did earlier and block the resolution by the Senator  from Vermont and the bipartisan resolution from the Senators from  Arizona and Delaware but move together in real action to undo the  damage--try to undo the damage that the President has done to this  country this week.   I yield the floor.    I ask for the yeas and nays.
