 Mr. President, the brutal war in Yemen has raged for  3 years. At least 10,000 civilians have lost their lives in this  conflict. More than 8 million Yemenis are on the brink of starvation.  The worst cholera outbreak in modern history has afflicted over 1  million people, including over 600,000 children. Millions more are  displaced from their homes. As the years wear on, the cycle of  desperation, destruction, and death continues unabated.   Make no mistake: The Houthis and their Iranian backers bear great  responsibility for the civilian toll of this war. However, the Saudi- led coalition, with U.S. military support, continues to conduct  hundreds of airstrikes each month. According to the United Nations,  almost two-thirds of reported civilian deaths are the result of these  airstrikes.   The administration claims U.S. military support for the coalition, in  the form of aerial refueling, munitions sales, and targeting  assistance, provides leverage in the conflict; yet the Defense  Department appears to know  [[Page S1939]]  disturbingly little about how U.S. military assistance is used on the  battlefield, including whether our refueling enables the bombing of  civilians. Most critically, with both sides at a total impasse, the  prospect of a political settlement is farther from reach now than at  the beginning of this devastating war.   In. short, U.S. policy in Yemen has been an abject failure, and by  continuing our military assistance unmitigated, we are complicit in  this tragedy.   This complicity is fueled by President Trump's unquestioning embrace  of the Saudi monarchy, and his apparent inability to use our leverage  to place meaningful restraints on the Saudi attacks in Yemen. In  addition, more than a year after his inauguration, the President has  not put forward nominees to fill key diplomatic posts that would be  responsible for addressing this conflict, including the Assistant  Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs or the U.S. Ambassador to  Saudi Arabia. He has alienated our counterparts at the United Nations.  In action and in deed, President Trump has all but ensured the  onslaught in Yemen will continue.   I believe it is incumbent on the Congress to hold the Saudi-led  coalition accountable and no longer to abdicate our responsibility in  decisions of peace and war. S.J. Res. 54 reins in the President's  largely unencumbered war making powers and ends unconditional U.S.  military support for the Saudi campaign in Yemen without an  authorization from Congress. For these reasons, I voted against the  motion to table this resolution.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I want to discuss S. 2155, the banking  bill, and explain the provisions of the bill I supported, those I  opposed, and my reasons for ultimately opposing this legislation.   Over the past year, I have appreciated the opportunity to meet with  Maryland community bankers, consumers, and an array of stakeholders who  would be impacted by this bill. I have organized roundtables on  economic development in Howard County and Baltimore. I have met with  consumer groups who want a strong regulatory framework to ensure fair  lending and to protect taxpayers from excessive risk-taking by some of  the biggest banks. Most recently, I held a forum with my State's  attorney general, Brian Frosh, where hundreds of passionate Marylanders  came out on a rainy night to talk about consumer protection.   We need a healthy banking system that serves Maryland businesses and  consumers, and banking regulations should be appropriately tailored to  the risks a bank poses to consumers, taxpayers, and the economy.  Community banks should not have to comply with all of the regulations  that apply to large Wall Street banks. That is why I support many of  the reforms in this bill to relieve community banks of some unnecessary  regulations. I also support provisions to modernize the Federal Deposit  Insurance Act, so that reciprocal deposits are not considered to be  brokered deposits.   While I supported most of the reforms relating to community banks and  credit unions, I have concerns with provisions in the bill that will  encourage excessive risk-taking in systemically important banks and am  disappointed by the absence of strengthened protections for consumers.   For example, this legislation significantly raises the threshold for  enhanced prudential standards for systemically important financial  institutions, SIFIs. While I can support an increase in the threshold,  I believe this bill goes too far. Gary Gensler, the chair of the  Maryland Financial Consumer Protection Commission, and the former  chairman of the Commodities Futures Trading Commission, has pointed out  that this bill dials down prudential oversight for about 20 percent of  U.S. banking sector assets. Mr. Gensler also noted that section 401  could be construed as possibly requiring the Federal Reserve to raise  the threshold at which foreign megabanks are subject to the enhanced  standards, thereby potentially allowing the very biggest banks to  escape some of the current regulations.   I am also concerned that section 402 of the bill modifies the  supplementary leverage ratio by excluding custodial assets for  custodial banks. This provision allows for greater risk-taking among  megabanks. Removing custodial assets from the denominator of the  supplementary leverage ratio will allow these banks to take on risk in  all areas. Former Federal Reserve Governor Daniel Tarullo said that  removing one type of asset from a ratio on the grounds that it is safe  ``would defeat the whole purpose of a leverage ratio, which is to place  a cap on total leverage, no matter what the assets on the other side of  the balance sheet may be.'' Former FDIC Chair Sheila Bair wrote that  ``Section 402 will create an uneven playing field by giving big  systemic banks a special capital break not applicable to community and  regional institutions.'' Moreover, this could create a slippery slope  where we start excluding other items banks deem ``safe'' from the  ratio.   Additionally, I cannot ignore the fact that this bill does very  little to help strengthen consumer protections at a time when the Trump  administration is eliminating rules that protect consumers. If we can  reach bipartisan agreement to modify regulations for banks, surely we  can find agreement on ways to help protect consumers from the abuses we  have seen from the likes of Wells Fargo and Equifax.   I am particularly troubled by two last-minute changes that benefit  Equifax. Section 310 has the admirable goal of increasing competition  in the credit scoring industry. However, the primary beneficiary of  this provision is VantageScore, a company jointly created by the three  consumer credit reporting agencies, Equifax, TransUnion, and Experian.  This means that a company that is essentially owned by the credit  bureaus will also have the ability to determine your score. In short,  this bill gives the credit bureaus a key tool to take over the credit  reporting and scoring markets. Be assured that I will closely watch how  the Federal Housing Finance Agency implements section 310.   After both Republicans and Democrats spent the past 6 months saying  that we would hold the credit reporting agencies more accountable, this  bill makes a second last-minute change that would prevent members of  the armed services who receive a free credit freeze from suing the  credit reporting bureaus for wrongdoing.   We hear time and time again about how poorly the credit reporting  bureaus treat consumers. False information in credit reports can do  great harm to consumers; yet the credit rating agencies face no real  sanctions for their culpability. That is unacceptable. We need to  change the system so that these companies have better incentives to  produce accurate credit reports, including sanctioning them for  inaccurate and breached data. We must give consumers the power to  control their own data and provide them with the ability to take legal  action against the bureaus when they have been wronged. Providing the  bureaus with a shield from legal liability and opening the door for  them to manipulate the credit reporting industry is going in the wrong  direction.   In conclusion, while I support many provisions in the bill,  especially those relating to community banks and credit unions, I  believe other provisions in the bill create excessive risks. Those  risks, as well as the failure to use this opportunity to further  protect consumers, led me to oppose this bill.                            ____________________
