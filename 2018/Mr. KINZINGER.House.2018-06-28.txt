 Mr. Speaker, there is really a tragic situation that  has been unfolding for a long time in Syria, and I think it is  important that we have a brief discussion today about what is at stake  and what is happening.   To start that discussion, Mr. Speaker, I am happy to yield to the  gentleman from California (Mr. Royce), the honorable chairman of the  House Foreign Affairs Committee, and a champion for the people of Free  Syria.                                time  1300     Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the chairman for his  leadership on this issue and for his very eloquently delivered speech  on the seriousness of what is happening.   The Syrian civil war is now in its eighth year, and it is approaching  a very serious crossroad. While the media focus fades away after some  chemical attack or a picture that steals our hearts for a moment, the  war crimes being committed and the atrocities taking place in Syria are  happening in full force right this very minute.   For the last 9 days, the southern border of Syria has been under  constant bombardment from airstrikes and barrel bomb attacks. Despite a  ceasefire  [[Page H5969]]  pact from Russia in July of 2017, we know Syria's main military ally  has continued to carry out attacks on behalf of the Assad regime.   This critical moment will affect the future of Syria, the security  interests of the United States, and stability within the international  community. So what are we going to do about it?   Since World War I, we have held that chemical weapons have no place  on the battlefield. We have held strong to this principle and its core  to the values of our country.   We know that the President of Syria, the brutal dictator, Bashar al- Assad, and his ruthless regime have committed countless war crimes, and  they are responsible for murdering more than half a million Syrians.   We know Assad has used chemical weapons countless times to attack and  murder innocent civilians.   We know that Russian and Iranian regimes have supported and helped  Assad in his genocide on the Syrian people, including airstrikes and  attacks that account for more than 50,000 dead Syrian children.   We have seen the Assad regime, along with his Iranian and Russian  backers, starve the people in cities like Madaya, Aleppo, and eastern  Ghouta by using food as a weapon.   We know the Assad regime has often refused U.N. and other  humanitarian organizations from delivering critical humanitarian  assistance to the most ravaged cities in Syria.   Because we know this, we cannot turn a blind eye. We cannot just  sweep this under the rug and ignore the horrific reality in Syria right  now. We cannot isolate ourselves from this crisis.   What happens in Syria and what happens in the Middle East has a very  real impact on our national security and the security of future  generations. If we fail to act in Syria and fail to inflict punishment  over the use of chemical weapons, we will ultimately see the end of the  nonproliferation treaty of chemical weapons and open the world to  ghastly horrors, perpetual insecurity, and extreme danger.   I support the President's enforcement of those red lines, but we must  not be naive enough to think that, if we show weakness elsewhere, it  will not happen again.   To be clear, I am not suggesting that the United States invade Syria,  put 100,000 troops in, and start a regional war, not in the slightest.  What I am suggesting is that we take a stand for what is right, what is  just, and what is in the best interests of the United States and the  freedom-loving people around the world.   We need a long-term strategy in Syria that leads to a solution of  peace and an end to the ongoing, deadly, and horrific conflict. This  strategy should also include the end of the Assad regime and a place at  the table for all people at the table of government.   First, we must maintain a presence in Syria and we must uphold the  deescalation zones that have already been established. By bolstering  these areas and making it known that the United States remains in the  region, we can thwart the strongmen of Russia and Iran from pushing  into these areas and targeting civilians.   Internally, both Russia and Iran are fractured and tired. They both  view Syria as a power-grab opportunity to take on their enemies: the  United States and Israel. It comes as no surprise, as we know the true  intentions of these bad actors anyway.   That being said, we cannot allow Iran to complete its land bridge  through the middle of Syria, and we cannot trust the Russians ever on  anything. Russian strikes have obliterated residential areas in Syria,  displacing thousands. The area's major hospitals and makeshift  hospitals have been targeted and destroyed.   Let me say that again. The region's hospitals have been targeted and  destroyed. We must take measures to punish Russia and Iran for their  crimes.   Next, given the dire situation in places like Daraa, we need to  establish no-fly zones and maintain a presence to ensure they are being  enforced by us and our allies. This is vital for the safety of our  coalition units, the humanitarian aid volunteers, and the Syrian  civilians who have been forced to flee their homes and their  communities.   We need to hold Assad, his regime, and the Russian and Iranian  supporters accountable.   In April, I spoke on the House floor in support of a bill I  introduced with my House Foreign Affairs Committee colleagues, H.R.  4681, the No Assistance for Assad Act. This bill, which passed the  House and now sits in the Senate, is a step in the right direction in  taking actions in Syria and punishing the Assad regime for its horrific  war crimes.   H.R. 4681 needs to be implemented, as do the sanctions passed last  year against the supporters of the Assad regime for their role in the  genocide of Syrian civilians.   Most importantly, the United States needs to remind the people of  Syria that we stand with them. We stand for freedom, and we stand  against the inhumane crimes committed against them by this barbaric  regime and their Russian and Iranian backers.   If you are a 10-year-old kid in Syria and your dad was killed by an  airstrike, you might see ISIS as the only opponent to Bashar al-Assad,  the butcher of Damascus who brutalized your family, who destroyed your  home, who bombed your school, and who left you without an education or  opportunity. If you are this 10-year-old kid in Syria right now, you  are likely to be a rich target of ISIS recruitment. Sadly, the next  generation of terrorism will likely stem from these regions that have  no hope or opportunity, that feel completely abandoned and ignored by  the international community.   I spoke to a Syrian regime defector yesterday named Caesar. Caesar  defected from the Assad regime and brought with him thousands of  pictures and documents proving that the regime tortures, starves, and  kills innocent people every day. And, if that isn't enough, they  document these atrocities with cold precision, reminiscent of the  actions of Nazi Germany. It is chilling.                                time  1315    Caesar risks his life by sharing his experiences. In our meetings, he  selflessly focuses on others. He emphasized how gravely the people of  Syria are suffering every single day. And every single day, the people  of Syria cling to the hope that America will speak up and stand with  them.   I pray for peace, and I urge the administration to position the  United States as the global leader this world needs right now.   I also implore the Senate to pass the Caesar Act, sanctioning regime  officials involved in the torture and opening the path to their capture  and trial as war criminals. They must be held accountable.   We have passed this bill repeatedly, and we will do so again if we  must. But the Senate has an opportunity to make this law and stand with  the values that we hold dear.   Mr. Speaker, the people of Syria need to know that there is hope.  Right now, our lack of a strategy in Syria is leaving many with little  hope or faith in the United States or our allies.   I believe America has a mission in the world, and it is to be an  example of self-governance in a world drowning in strongmen, cruelty,  and chaos. I believe we have an opportunity to show the people of  Syria, and the world, that the American Dream continues. We are still  that shining city on a hill and a beacon of hope for peace and  prosperity.   When that light dims, it doesn't give America an opportunity to look  within and relax, regain ourselves, and look coldly and detached at the  rest of the world. History has shown again and again that a dimming  light in American leadership only guarantees a future fight, a future  calling up of a generation of Americans to, once again, defeat an  enemy.   But if we remember this God-given mission and the light on the hill  continues to beam bright, then we can create a generation within the  camps of our enemies who rejects their ideology and implements change  from within. Behind the Iron Curtain, it wasn't America's military  action that sliced it in half. It was people behind it seeing our  light, peering over that wall, and tearing it down so they, too, could  enjoy those freedoms.   As a great President, John F. Kennedy, said: ``Let every nation know,  whether it wishes us well or ill, that we shall pay any price, bear any  burden, meet any hardship, support any friend, oppose any foe to assure  the survival and the success of liberty.''  [[Page H5970]]    Bashar al-Assad will ultimately pay an awful, eternal price when he  meets his Maker. Let's move that appointment up so that justice here or  in the afterlife is swift and soon. Let's shine our light on the  actions of Iran and Russia. Let's expose with that brightness the  torture and the bombing of aid convoys and hospitals. Let's shine that  light on the plight of people simply trying to live their lives and to  raise their children to be police officers, doctors, farmers, factory  workers, and mothers and fathers.   Let's speak out for the freedom-loving people who so desperately need  our voice. Let's shine our light on the oppressive darkness around the  world.   Mr. Speaker, let's save Syria.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
