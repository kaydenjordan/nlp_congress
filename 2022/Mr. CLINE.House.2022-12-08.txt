 Mr. Speaker, American families are ready for a joyous  holiday season. Unfortunately, the Biden administration is the grinch  that stole Christmas, as its failed Green New Deal agenda is forcing  folks to pay record-high costs to heat their homes, fuel their cars,  and feed their families.   From diesel to fuel oil, energy prices have skyrocketed. Households  will pay an average of $1,359 on energy bills this winter, the highest  in 25 years.   Diesel prices are up 50 percent, and we shouldn't be surprised.  President Biden likes to say: ``I guarantee you, we are going to end  fossil fuel.'' He has worked with the Pelosi majority to continue to  push anti-energy policies.   Just last week, the Biden White House doubled down, saying they are  still committed to phasing out fossil fuels. Well, they should look at  what is happening over in Europe. After the European Union struck a  deal to ban new fossil fuel cars and speed up the switch to electric  vehicles, Switzerland is now going to ban electric vehicles if it faces  blackouts this winter. You can't make it up.   It is time for this administration to end its war on American energy.  If we are going to regain our energy independence, we need an all-of- the-above approach.                            ____________________
