 Madam Speaker, the Declaration of Independence says  that our God-given freedoms are life, liberty, and the pursuit of  happiness. As Members of Congress, we made a commitment to uphold those  freedoms equally for everyone, but Democrats and their radical allies  are chipping them away.   Let's be clear. The Hyde amendment is not discriminatory. Instead, it  is an essential safeguard that not only protects Americans' right of  conscience, but also has saved more than two million lives from  abortion since its first enactment in 1976.   Until recently, it was also overwhelmingly bipartisan. In fact, one  of the most vocal supporters in Congress was then-Senator Joe Biden. He  told one of his constituents in 1994, ``The government should not tell  those with strong convictions against abortion, such as you and I, that  we must pay for them.''   Well said, Mr. President.   Since then, the purpose of Hyde hasn't changed. The strong  convictions of American people against abortion hasn't changed. In poll  after poll, they tell us they strongly support a wall of separation  between abortions and taxpayers.   And the science hasn't changed. If anything, it has proven beyond a  shadow of doubt that human life begins at conception.   One thing, however, has changed: The Democrats. By putting Hyde on  the chopping block, the message they are sending is clear and chilling;  that the radical demands of the socialist left drown out common sense,  science, and the views of most Americans; that the party of ``safe,  legal, and rare'' is now the party of abortion on demand, until or even  after the point of birth, and funded by taxpayers; and that the  government will compel taxpayers to violate their strongest  convictions.   Madam Speaker, the question before us today is a simple and  straightforward moral issue. To represent the values of all Americans,  Congress must respect their rights of conscience and not disregard  them.   Therefore, I ask unanimous consent that the Committees on Energy and  Commerce, Ways and Means, and the Judiciary be discharged from further  consideration of H.R. 18, the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion, and ask  for its immediate consideration in the House.                                time  1930     Madam Speaker, on the Republican side, it is cleared,  so there is only one party denying it.                            ____________________
