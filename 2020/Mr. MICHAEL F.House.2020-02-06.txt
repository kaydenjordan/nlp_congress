 DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I have a strange  feeling of deja vu today because, once again, Democrats are down on the  floor, speaking out against another attempt by the Trump administration  to take away people's healthcare.   This should go without saying, but let me say clearly: Block grants  do not strengthen the Medicaid program, and they do not protect  Americans.   It makes sense that when the economy is bad, more people might need  Medicaid, and when the economy is good, Medicaid payments shrink. This  is common sense and good public policy. Medicaid should be there when  people need it the most, yet the Trump administration wants to undo  that. Instead, the amount of money that a State would receive would be  flat, and States would have to adjust their coverages accordingly.   That means one of two things: either fewer people can be covered or  fewer services can be covered. In fact, this policy encourages States  to cut coverage and divert Medicaid money to other parts of their  budgets.   We should be trying to improve people's healthcare and investing more  so that American families don't have to.   Republicans have been trying to cut Medicaid for 30 years. This is  just the latest attempt. They most recently failed to cut Medicaid  coverage when they were in the majority and tried to repeal the  Affordable Care Act because the American people were overwhelmingly  opposed to their plan. Now the Trump administration is trying to go it  alone.   But the American people will see through what you are doing, and they  will see the Republicans in Congress, once again, turning a blind eye  while this President and his administration try to take healthcare away  from millions of Americans.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this resolution to  condemn this outrageous and unwise proposal.
