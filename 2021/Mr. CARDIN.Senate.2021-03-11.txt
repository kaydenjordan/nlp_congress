 I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, I rise to celebrate Harriet Tubman, one of  the most notable individuals in Maryland's history. Congress began  officially recognizing March 10th as Harriet Tubman Day in 1990 and I  am always grateful to speak to her accomplishments. Throughout her life  she served as an abolitionist, soldier, spy and, most famously, as a  conductor on the Underground Railroad. I would like to reflect on her  contributions to human rights, civil rights, and women's rights in our  Nation and to renew my commitment to addressing the shameful legacy of  slavery in Maryland and across the U.S.--particularly as it pertains to  environmental justice.   Harriet Tubman was born Araminta Ross to enslaved parents in  Bucktown, Maryland in 1822. After emancipating herself, she dedicated  her life to the advancement of freedom and the fight against slavery.  Araminta adopted the name ``Harriet'' at the time of her marriage to  John Tubman, a free Black man, around the year 1844. Tubman and her  husband continued to live in Dorchester County until her escape from  slavery in 1849, at the age of 27. She would courageously return to  make over thirteen dangerous trips to lead nearly 70 enslaved people  seeking freedom, repeatedly risking her life in pursuit of our Nation's  highest aspirational ideal.   Throughout the American Civil War, Tubman served the Union at various  times as a cook, nurse, scout, and even spy. She helped orchestrate the  Combahee River raid in South Carolina that freed over 700 enslaved men,  women, and children. After the war's end, Harriet focused her efforts  on women's suffrage. In 1908, Tubman established the Harriet Tubman  Home for the Aged in Auburn, New York. Five years later, she died of  pneumonia on March 10, 1913. Although she spent her final decades in  New York, the marshes and forests of Maryland's Eastern Shore are where  Harriet Tubman first grew spiritually and physically strong.   Harriet Tubman made an indelible impact on my State and our Nation's  history and I am proud to have played a role in memorializing her story  to future generations. I worked to secure the authorities and funding  for the Harriet Tubman Underground Railroad Byway, which tells the  story of her life in Dorchester and Caroline counties, and for the  Harriet Tubman Underground National Historical Park. The National Park  Service administers the national historical park Congress created in  December 2014 and the national monument authorized by President Obama  in 2013 as a single unit. The Park Service works in partnership with  the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, which manages the Blackwater  National Wildlife Refuge, and the State of Maryland, which owns and co- manages the Harriet Tubman Underground Railroad Visitor Center, to  commemorate and interpret Tubman's remarkable story. Visitors can  access the marshlands, largely preserved since her time, at the Visitor  Center and nearby Refuge. The Harriet Tubman Underground Railroad  National Historical Park centers her life's work not in physical  structures, but instead through the landscape in Tubman's native  Dorchester County, which we must defend against the social and  ecological hazards of climate change.   While climate change is a global issue, it is felt on a local scale.  Dorchester County's low-lying landscape of  [[Page S1503]]  tidal marshes, narrow peninsulas, and country roads linking isolated  communities is threatened by sea level rise and land subsidence. Over  one-half of the county lies in the 100-year floodplain, much of it in  the tidal floodplain; even minor storms and routine high-tide events  can flood vast portions of the county. In addition to flooding,  saltwater intrusion threatens the failure of rural septic systems, and  damage to roads, bridges, and other critical infrastructure. Climate- driven changes to the coastal ecosystem are also making it harder to  earn a living through the primary local sources of income: agriculture,  forestry, and the seafood industry.   Local communities are at the frontline of adaptation, and initial  social inequality causes the disadvantaged groups in those communities  to suffer disproportionately from the adverse effects of climate  change, resulting in greater subsequent inequality. Dorchester County  is no exception. After the Civil War, freedmen and women settled the  land, which was often less arable and therefore more affordable. Today,  the county has a population of 32,000, 26 percent of whom are Black.  Black individuals are almost twice as likely to be unemployed or live  below the federal poverty level as their white neighbors, attributable  to systemic racism that has roots in Harriet Tubman's time of  enslavement. The Union of Concerned Scientists developed a Climate  Equity Tool to identify communities that face conditions that heighten  their vulnerability to harm and are therefore high-risk environmental  justice areas, including Dorchester County. UCS projects that the  county will see a six-inch rise in sea level by 2030 and 13-inch rise  by 2045.   Absent national or international climate policy direction under the  Trump administration, cities and towns on the Eastern Shore and around  the world have been focusing on solving their own climate problems.  They are working to build flood defenses, plan for heatwaves and higher  temperatures, install water-permeable pavement to better deal with  floods and stormwater, and improve water storage and use. Dorchester  County has a flood mitigation plan that identifies projects to protect  resources at risk of being lost, including historic and cultural sites.  However, implementation of such plans requires significant funding. It  is essential that Congress enhance the resilience of vulnerable  communities in Dorchester County and across the Eastern Shore--and the  Nation--whose residents have been forced to manage periodic flooding  and other climate impacts in relative social and political isolation.  Frontline communities in Dorchester and neighboring Eastern Shore  counties with strong historical and cultural ties require sufficient  federal financial and technical assistance now to help plan for the  future and make choices about how best to protect themselves from tidal  flooding, saltwater intrusion, and coastal disasters.   Environmental justice is an essential component to carry on with  respect to the anti-racist work that Harriet Tubman pioneered. The  American Rescue Plan Act will provide debt relief and assistance to  socially disadvantaged farmers and ranchers who have faced  disproportionate impacts from the pandemic as a result of longstanding  discrimination, as well as $50 million in funding to reduce the air  pollution that is linked with contributing to COVID-19 deaths, targeted  to low income communities and communities of color. These provisions  present only a small down payment on the types investments needed to  address inequality, and have yet to squarely address climate change.   The local communities on the Eastern Shore that served as Harriet  Tubman's training ground in resistance are rarely credited for their  outsized influence on Maryland's maritime industry, culture, and  environment. We must do better to enshrine their place in our  historical consciousness and provide them with the tools necessary to  prepare for climate change. I am grateful for the opportunity to  showcase the exceptional efforts of one particular Marylander and honor  her by pursuing climate and environmental justice policies.                                  ______                                         By Ms. COLLINS (for herself, Mr. Cardin, and Mrs. Shaheen):   S. 723. A bill to amend the Small Business Act and the CARES Act to  extend the covered period for the paycheck protection program, and for  other purposes; to the Committee on Small Business and  Entrepreneurship.
