 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, thank you for presiding today, and to  all who are here at this moment of extreme challenge for our country  and for the world, we must rise to the occasion and unite to fight a  common enemy, COVID-19, also known as the coronavirus.   What we are witnessing is Americans from all backgrounds and all  walks of life doing that around the country--coming together and  uniting, not physically close, but spiritually close to one another as  we work our way through this crisis.   In my State of Maryland, people are doing exactly that. Our  healthcare workers on the frontlines--whether they be nurses, whether  they be people working in clinics, in the hospitals, whether they be  doctors, they are all pulling together to get the job done.   Elected officials from the Federal, State, and local governments are  working together, as are nonprofits and businesses.   Three nights ago, I held a telephone townhall meeting on COVID-19,  and more than 5,000 Marylanders joined that call. They called in to  share their hopes, their concerns, and their determination.   Yesterday, in Maryland, we lost the second life to COVID-19, and our  medical services are being stretched thin. But people are coming  together to get the job done, and as we address the healthcare  challenges, we must also deal with the financial and economic pain that  is arising from that and spreading quickly.   Most of all, Marylanders, like other Americans, told us they want  clear guidance from public health officials and a united and effective  response to both the healthcare crisis and the economic fallout.   Since Marylanders are united and Americans are united, we, too, in  Congress must unite to do our job. And to date--to date--we have risen  to meet the moment. The question is, What comes next?   Over a few weeks ago, we did unite to pass emergency legislation to  provide $8.3 billion to provide funding to our public health systems  and to direct more dollars toward developing a vaccine and  therapeutics.   Last week we passed a measure to ensure that tests for the  coronavirus are free. It makes no sense to have any American  discouraged from getting a  [[Page S1884]]  test because they can't pay for it. That hurts them; that hurts the  entire community. That was an important provision, as was the emergency  food assistance for people in need.   In States that have closed schools, we have lots of students who are  now home. Many of those students get one of their best meals at school  during lunch, so that emergency food assistance has been absolutely  vital. In Maryland, we have about 350 schools that are now being used  for families to pick up food for their kids and for others in the  community.   We help provide more resources to State insurance systems, which are  being stressed more and more as we speak, and we need to do a lot more  on that front.   We passed emergency sick leave measures because we do not want to  have anybody feeling that they have to go to work in order to get the  paycheck to pay the bills if they are feeling sick. That is bad for  them, and obviously it is bad for their coworkers who would risk  getting the virus. So we took an important measure there, although  there, as well, there were big gaps in the paid sick leave provisions,  which we must close as we work on round 3 of this legislation.   So that brings me to what we are going to face now in the coming 12  to 24 hours, which is coming up with an economic package--a package  that deals with the economic fallout, and I want to address what I  think should be our priorities there.   But before I do that, I do want to take a moment to talk about the  healthcare situation that we are witnessing right now because, of  course, to the extent that we can stop the spread of the virus, to the  extent we stop the contagion from the virus, that is also the fastest  way to try to get our economy back on track. What we are seeing is so  many businesses going under and being threatened because of precautions  people are taking--understandable precautions--to make sure that we  don't spread the virus.   So in that fight on the healthcare front, I want to salute--I want to  salute--and thank all those healthcare workers who are on the  frontlines: the nurses, the hospital and clinic staffs, the doctors who  are doing heroic work and putting their lives and their health at risk  to help others and save the lives of others.   We here in this Chamber must do everything in our power to support  them in that important work--to support them as they support others.  That begins with making sure they have all the equipment they need to  protect themselves, but that is not happening. That is not happening as  we gather here.   There are severe shortages in the supply of masks, shortages in  supplies of simple but essential items, like gloves and gowns.   It took far too long, but the President finally invoked his authority  under the Defense Production Act, which helps spur domestic production  of some of these supplies. But even as we gather now, it is not clear  whether that is really up and running as it should be. In fact, it is  suggested from reports that we are falling short.   At the same time, we know others in the world are experiencing these  shortages. They are also being hit hard by the coronavirus. So here in  the United States, we cannot continue to expect to get these necessary  supplies from overseas when they are going to need them and keep them  in their own countries, and that is why it is essential that we ramp up  efforts yesterday to make sure that we have these supply chains here at  home.   Testing of the coronavirus--it is clear that the coronavirus got an  8- to 10-week head start in this country, and we were woefully  unprepared, especially with respect to tests to try to identify the  spread of the virus and where it was and how fast it was moving. We  were also unprepared on our testing infrastructure.   While we are now ramping up, we are still far behind. There are still  far too many bottlenecks in the system. At Johns Hopkins University in  Baltimore, they are doing their own testing, but their testing has been  limited by shortages in reagents. That was true a week ago; it  continues to be true today. And the University of Maryland Medical  System, another major research hospital system in our State, has not  yet begun to do their testing because of continued shortages of  reagents. That is absolutely unacceptable.   We are also hearing of shortages in swabs--simple swabs--simply to  take the test. We need to ramp up the testing supply. We also need to  knock down the barriers to getting tests. We need to adopt the South  Korean model, and many of us have been calling for this for a long  time. We see States and Governors moving forward with this, but the  Federal Government needs to take a much more active role in  establishing that infrastructure.   Ventilators--we have more and more sick patients, and if the  trajectories continue, it is clear we will face a shortage in  ventilators. We have to ramp this up much faster than we are doing  right now because, otherwise, we are going to have a lifesaving  treatment intervention that will not be available for those who need  it.   Mr. President, we are witnessing shortages in hospital beds overall  and shortages of beds in ICUs. We need the Army Corps of Engineers to  be working and building out this necessary emergency infrastructure.   As we take these emergency measures, we also need to continue to do  the urgent work of developing therapeutics and a vaccine.   I visited the National Institutes of Health about 3 or 4 weeks ago.  It is a national treasure. We are proud to have it located in the State  of Maryland along with the FDA. At NIH, I met with scientists who are  on the frontlines of developing the vaccine. They are working 24/7.   I think this moment is appropriate to salute all the men and women  who work at NIH. I hope I never see another budget proposal coming down  that cuts the vital medical research that is conducted there and around  the country.   They are working on a vaccine, and they are working on therapeutics.  They are in the process of conducting clinical trials on both. As we  have heard reported, they are conducting clinical trials on some off- label drugs. These are drugs that have been developed to try to fight  against other diseases. They may not have worked against other  diseases. They may work as a therapeutic in this case of the  coronavirus, but as Dr. Fauci has warned us, nobody will know until we  do a clinical trial and nobody's hope should be unrealistically raised  until the evidence is in.   On the vaccine front, we have been told by the scientists--by Dr.  Fauci and others in his lab--that it will take a minimum of 12 to 18  months to develop a vaccine, and that is much faster than the usual  timetable to develop a vaccine. People are working overtime to get this  done. Clinical trials have already begun on a vaccine, as well, but 12  to 18 months, while fast for developing a new vaccine, is a long time  given the immediate crisis that we face now.   So what do we do now on the healthcare front? First, no more mixed  messages--let's let the healthcare authorities speak and provide the  guidance that the American people need at this time.   For far too long, the President of the United States downplayed the  crisis, even calling it a hoax at one point. We know it is not a hoax.  We know the death toll and the number of sick continues to rise, and we  must pull together in a fact-based way to address it. We have to listen  to people like Dr. Fauci and others who have called for dramatic social  distancing measures.   One of those measures we must take is teleworking wherever we can do  it. We have seen offices here in the Senate and the House rapidly move  toward teleworking and make changes in their offices to facilitate  teleworking. Just a few days ago, the President finally said to the  country that employers should facilitate telework--a little late, but  it was the right message. Unfortunately, there has been a lot of foot  dragging in the executive branch itself when it comes to teleworking. I  and a number of our colleagues have asked the President to issue an  Executive order on teleworking. The President has not done that yet.   The head of the Office of Personnel Management resigned a few days  ago. This is the person who is in charge of all the Federal Government  personnel from an operational standpoint and who resigned in the middle  of this crisis. We don't know why. Finally, OMB,  [[Page S1885]]  or the Office of Management and Budget, issued a directive to agencies  saying to maximize telework. But I represent a lot of Federal  employees, and I am hearing from lots of them that their agencies  apparently haven't gotten the message. The President needs to issue  that Executive order, and he needs to do it today. Too many Federal  employees are being put at risk because agencies have not taken the  time to expand telework opportunities. We need to lead by example, not  from behind.   Many Governors are leading by example and States are doing that, as  are local officials. They are directing the necessary social distancing  measures. In my State of Maryland, Governor Hogan has closed schools to  prevent the spread of the virus. Restaurants are closed, bars are  closed, gyms are closed, and many other gathering places are closed.  There are all of those social distancing steps being taken--whether by  government directive or voluntarily, by our constituents heeding the  calls to take these precautionary measures. All of those necessary  steps have resulted in a huge and escalating economic fallout.   Thousands of workers have already been furloughed or laid off around  the country. Small businesses are being crushed. No customers in the  door, no sales, and no income mean you can't pay your employees. It  means you can't pay your bills. Whether they are mortgages on your  restaurant or mortgages on your home, those bills are still due and  coming.   So what do we do? What do we do as we approach round 3 here in the  U.S. Senate and House, having successfully worked on a bipartisan basis  to address rounds 1 and 2? First of all, as for unemployment insurance,  because of rapidly escalating layoffs around the country, claims are  rising, and we need to rise to the occasion. We need a far more robust  system, and, certainly, during this emergency period, we should provide  100 percent wage replacement to workers who have lost their jobs  through no fault of their own as a result of this crisis.   We also need to address the totally antiquated aspects of our  unemployment insurance system. Some of that will have to wait until  after the crisis, but on an emergency basis, we need to address the  needs of people who are working as self-employed individual  contractors.   Let's say you are an event planner, and all of your events got  canceled. You are not currently in the unemployment system in most  States, probably, but you are no longer getting any income. We need to  make sure the unemployment system in this emergency addresses those  workers and we need to work on a long-term fix. There is the gig  economy. We all know the gig economy is a larger and larger share of  our economy. A lot of those workers are not covered. If you are a  worker who is in the taxi business or working for one of the other  transportation agencies, you are not able to pick up folks at the  airport anymore because people aren't coming to the airport, and you  are not covered by other unemployment systems.    So if it is Uber or others, we need to address those workers and make  sure they have wage replacement during this terrible shutdown of parts  of the economy. We need to focus on that. Senator Wyden has introduced  a bill--I am proud to cosponsor it with him--that addresses many of  these issues, but we need to tackle it as part of the bill that we are  dealing with right now, because these people are losing their jobs  right now.   Second is no foreclosures or evictions during this period of time.  You lose your job. You got no money. We are working on wage  replacement, but we haven't done this yet. In the meantime, bills are  coming due. Someone is demanding a mortgage payment. Someone is  demanding a rent payment. We need to freeze collections of these  payments and defer payments until after the emergency.   This is easier said than done, because when we say to a landlord that  they can't collect the rent, we also need to say to the bank who loaned  money to the owner of the building that they have to exercise  forbearance on that loan.   That is why a group of us and I organized a letter recently that went  to the heads of the financial regulatory agencies--the Fed, the OCC,  the FDIC--asking them to use the full extent of their powers to address  this issue in a way that deals with the entire economic food chain,  from the lenders at the top of the chain to the borrowers at the bottom  of the chain, because they are the ones in a position to do it.   I just got a letter back last night from the FDIC. I hope to hear  from the others quickly, but we don't have time to wait. We should  address that issue to the maximum extent in our powers in round 3,  which we are working on right now.   Third, small businesses and medium-sized businesses are crushed--no  customers in the door, no revenue, bills mounting, trying to make  payroll. Of course, many of them have already had to lay off some of  their employees because their bills are coming due, and they have to  try to figure out how to simply stay afloat.   A lot of people have said: Well, let's give these small businesses  emergency loans. Well, if you think about it, if you are a small mom- and-pop operation, another loan at this point, when there are no  customers coming in the door, is simply going to saddle you with more  and more debt at the end of this emergency. So extending a loan is, in  some ways, for these small businesses throwing them an anchor, because  they are never going to be able to recover. They are only going to have  more and more debts to pay off at the end of the day when they are  trying to restart their businesses and get people back in the door.   I have a wonderful local example. Her name is Julie Verratti. She is  the co-owner of the brewery and restaurant in Maryland called Denizens.  It is a family business. She wrote to me a number of days ago, because  she is undergoing exactly these kinds of stresses and pressures. She  writes:         Small businesses need a bailout right now without delay.       The number one thing we need is cash retention and cash       infusion.        Here are specific actions that will help make that happen:        1. [An] immediate moratorium on all commercial debt       payments (loans and credit cards) mortgages, and rents. If       you have to choose, focus on SBA loans because small       businesses are the only ones that go the SBA backed route.    She also says:         Immediate moratorium on all evictions and foreclosures.    We have to work on that front. I talked about that. But we also have  to attack this from all angles. That is why this small business relief  is so essential, and it must take the form of grants, so long as the  businesses use that money for prescribed purposes: maintaining  payroll--whatever payroll may be left--and paying their ongoing debts  and obligations. Loans, as Julie says, will not fix this for small  businesses. It must be in the form of grants--again, so long as the  recipient complies with the terms of that grant.   Small businesses like mom-and-pop organizations that already had to  lay off employees should not be penalized. They should be eligible for  the grants to pay their mortgages to keep themselves afloat.   Many midsized businesses are in this position as well. We need to  address that because they are in many cases laying off employees in  large numbers.   Just for a local example, people who live in this area may be  familiar with Silver Diner. Unlike Dunkin' Donuts, which works on a  franchise model, the Silver Diner owns its different Silver Diners  throughout the region. They have 1,800 employees. Their employees, in  most cases, have had to be furloughed or laid off because of no money  in the door. But the Silver Diner is too big an operation to meet the  strict requirements of the Small Business Administration. So, in this  emergency situation, we need to provide flexibility that allows us to  help some of these middle-sized businesses that are undergoing  incredible stress because we want to make sure we help their workers  and help them retain as many workers as they can, but also to make sure  they can pay their bills when no customers are coming in the door. They  need to pay the bills so that, when this is over, they can open up  operations and rehire those employees.    That is why Senators Murphy, Merkley, and I introduced a proposal  yesterday to address these stresses on small and medium-sized  businesses, not with emergency loans that they are not going to be able  to afford to repay later, but with emergency grants so long as those  grants are used for the  [[Page S1886]]  purposes indicated. That would put these small and midsized businesses  in a position to rehire their employees once this economic storm passes  through.   There are, of course, other major industries that have been hard hit,  and we should consider what kind of relief is appropriate for them,  like the airlines. We have to be very careful that we don't repeat some  of the things that went wrong in the past when it came to helping big  businesses. Yes, we would like to help their workers through this  storm, but we need to make sure that any funds that go to the airlines,  for example, are not used for more stock buybacks that simply help  their stockholders and executives and CEOs.   The airlines have engaged in a huge amount of stock buybacks in the  last year, including after the $2 trillion tax cut that was provided.  Instead of using a lot of that revenue to invest in their workers and  plant equipment, a lot of it went out the door in the form of stock  buybacks, and it would be unacceptable for any relief monies to go for  that kind of purpose or to go for any kind of bonuses.   In fact, if the taxpayers are going to be making some investments to  keep some of these big industries afloat, we should look at what we did  in some of the earlier cases later in the game with respect to  preferred stock so that taxpayers get fully repaid and we also have a  stake in the future success of that investment.   One other big area that has not gotten much attention in discussions  here on Capitol Hill until the last few days has been the huge needs  being faced by State and local governments--States like my State of  Maryland, cities like Baltimore City, and other cities and towns in  Maryland. They are on the frontlines in many respects, and they are  facing huge pressures, which is why we received a letter, an emergency  plea from the National Governors Association, just the other day.   This is a bipartisan point from Governors Larry Hogan and Andrew  Cuomo, and they point out, No. 1, that Medicaid is a major source of  Federal help that they use to provide for the medical needs of people  in their States, and they are asking for an increase in FMAP. We  provided some increase in FMAP in one of the earlier bills we passed,  but they desperately need more as the health impact of the virus  continues to spread.   As you can imagine, transit systems, whether paid for by States or  local jurisdictions, are essentially seeing all their revenues dry up  as people understandably don't get on those crowded systems. So no  revenue means that they are in a world of hurt. We need to provide  emergency help.   The National League of Cities has also sent us a letter talking about  similar kinds of needs, and we need to address those needs in this  bill, round 3, and not, as some are suggesting, postpone that to some  future date. We don't know when that would be because the emergency is  now, and the need is now.   Finally, this healthcare crisis has exposed some huge fissures in our  society in the kind of safety net that we provide. I am not going to go  into the entire list because it is too exhaustive to go through, but I  want to highlight a couple of things.   We had, in the first instance, the question of whether people are  going to have to pay for the coronavirus tests. We all recognize that  it is a public health imperative. It would be a mistake to have people  have to pay for tests because, if you can't afford it and therefore  don't get it, then it not only hurts you, but it hurts other people   There has been a lot of discussion about the vaccine. When we develop  a vaccine--and we hope we will--that also needs to be available to all  Americans without cost. That is something we need to address.   Senator Scott from Florida and I have pointed out that a lot of the  drugs that are developed by pharmaceutical companies are drugs that  benefited from the research at the National Institutes of Health. And  who pays for the research at the National Institutes of Health--at NIH?  Well, the taxpayer, to the tune of about $40 billion a year.   So it makes no sense at all for the taxpayers, who made this big  investment in research and development of a drug, to then be price- gouged by the pharmaceutical companies that take the benefits of that  good work and then add a big, big pricetag. Our proposal would make  sure that where you have that kind of public investment in research and  development, you essentially have a process to make sure that there is  a reasonable price. Ultimately, when it comes to a public health  vaccine, as is being developed now, we need to make sure that it is  available to everybody and that nobody cannot afford that.   Second, as our schools have been shut in many States, we are seeing  the results of the digital divide--just one piece of that--because  there are a lot of students who don't have access to the internet, and,  therefore, they are not going to be able to engage in distance learning  if this crisis continues and schools decide to try to expand distance  learning. Why? Because they are not connected to the internet or they  don't have a computer at home, so many of us have introduced proposals  on this. I have introduced a bill to close the digital homework gap. We  are asking the FCC to use emergency authorities to direct funds to buy  devices--simple devices--that a student who is not connected to the  internet could use to get some reception to be able to do their  homework. We should do that right now, but then, of course, we have the  longer term challenge of building out that broadband infrastructure to  deal with the digital divide.   Then there are things we should do to make sure we are better  prepared. There is a long list of those, but one of them is pretty  simple. Senator Angus King and I have sent a letter to the folks who  are finalizing and putting this bill together to require that the  office at the White House that had previously existed under the Obama  administration--the office that was set up specifically to be an early  warning system for a pandemic response like the one we are witnessing-- that that be a permanent office within the White House and that no  future President would be able to dismantle that office. We are  learning now, the hard way, what happens when you don't have that early  warning system and strategic response at the highest levels of the U.S.  Government.   So those are some of the things we should be doing. As we gather  here, America's best minds--our top scientists around the world--are  looking to answer questions about the virus and help develop a vaccine.  Brave healthcare workers are treating the sick and preparing for many  more patients. The people who produce and deliver our food and other  essentials, who keep our water, power, and internet on are all at work,  whether in their work spaces or teleworking. First responders are on  duty, and our military continues to defend the Nation.   Marylanders and Americans are doing their part--staying at home,  social distancing, finding ways to be together while apart, and,  perhaps most challenging for kids, staying busy and not going  completely stir-crazy. Teachers and students are embracing distance  learning. Families are marking birthdays and other special occasions  with e-cards and video chats. Those at the lowest risk are doing what  they can to protect the most vulnerable among us.   The fundamental decency of all these Americans is shining through. I  draw strength and faith from their actions, and I know that, together-- if not physically together--working together, we will succeed. We will  succeed if we come together here in the House and the Senate like  Americans are working together around the country. If we can do that at  this moment, as we approach round 3 of our actions, then I am  absolutely confident that the country will have the resources and  direction it needs. Let us be as united and determined as the American  people.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
