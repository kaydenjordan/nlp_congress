 Madam Speaker, for everyone here, this is a subsidy  bill. And this is the classic difference between the left and the  right. They are functionally subsidizing. We on the right actually want  to change the market. We want competition.   So I am going to pull out one very simple example. In here, we have  $2.5 billion of subsidies for our ports to get greener and more  efficient. But then the Democrats slip in language that says human- operated, meaning you are not going to take on the unions, you are not  actually going to make it more efficient, you are not going to actually  embrace disruption and technology.   We keep coming to the floor and talking about things that would make  our ports greener, faster, more efficient, feed the supply chain--these  electric rail cars, except you functionally just made them not happen.   This is a subsidy for those unions, those folks who right checks to  the left. You claim you are making the environment better and cleaner,  but then you build the very barriers in the language that stop those  good things from happening.
