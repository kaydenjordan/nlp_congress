 Mr. Speaker, every year the Greater Longview United Way  hosts a fundraiser known as their annual campaign to raise money for  nonprofit organizations in the Gregg County area.   In recognition of the 75th year, the United Way's campaign theme was:  ``Past. Present. Future. We are UNITED.''   This year, the organization surpassed their goal by over $25,000,  raising a grand total of $1.1 million, which will be used to help fund  nearly 40 programs across 20 nonprofits in the Gregg County area.   United Ways are a vital part of communities across the Nation,  bringing people together to volunteer, advocate, and give back to their  community.   Their core belief is that only when a community is united to benefit  all people, regardless of race, creed, class, school district, or place  of origin that true change can happen.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the executive director, Dr. Evan Dolive;  campaign and community outreach manager, Heather Stevenson; and front  office coordinator, Raven Atkinson for their dedication to the United  Way and our Gregg County community.                            ____________________
