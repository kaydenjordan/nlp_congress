 Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Plaskett for leading  this Special Order on behalf of the Congressional Black Caucus.   It is extremely important that we first thank our Caribbean brothers  and sisters, as my sister Yvette Clarke so eloquently stated, the  history of so many individuals that have made substantial contributions  to make this a more perfect union, who, but for their labor and hard  work, we would not be the country that we are.   But also as Representative Plaskett has indicated, when I think about  the average, everyday person who came across to America from the  Caribbean Islands--the schoolteachers, the plumbers, the lawyers, the  doctors, the sanitation workers, and the individuals that come even  just to cut grass--when you think about the contributions, what they  have committed is those individuals have raised children who become  Members of Congress, like Stacey Plaskett and Yvette Clarke, who  continued that tradition of making this a much better place to live for  all Americans, a shining example of what this great Nation is when it  is so inclusive.   Yvette Clarke talked about Alexander Hamilton and the contributions  that were made from the very beginning. But when you look at that and  when you think of who we are and the hemisphere that we share--you see,  the Caribbean Islands are the same hemisphere, and we have to make sure  that we are together in lockstep. We can never forget that, when  America catches a cold, many individuals in the Caribbean now get  pneumonia.   So as a result of understanding the contributions that they have made  in this country, and continue to make, we are really one on the same  continent and we are only as strong as we are together.                                time  2030    And so we would have to stop and think of our brothers and sisters  from the Caribbean and those who are still living there as just places  that we go visit for tourism and vacation. Yes, we want to make sure  that we do visit there to strengthen those economies, but we want to  also make sure that, as a government, as a people, we are also doing  the appropriate investments there in their infrastructure, because it  only helps us here in the United States of America.   We are only as strong as we can be together. E pluribus unum, from  many one, that is what this Nation is supposed to be, and I think that  we have come a long way to accomplish it, which brings me to the second  phase of what I want to talk about this evening, because this is not  supposed to be a system of the haves versus the have-nots. It should  not be where we have a reverse Robin Hood syndrome where you are taking  from the poor to give to the rich. No, that is not the Nation that we  want this country to be. In fact, people fled from a king who was  wealthy and didn't care about the poor.   So here we are now as a nation, when the most important thing to  anybody is health, because if you don't have health, you don't have  anything. I don't care whether you are Black or White, whether you come  from the East or the West or the North or the South--health. The one  thing that we have in common, everyone, is that we are human beings.  And one thing that we know for sure, humans' bodies, at times, break  down.   So, yes, if you are young and healthy, and, yes, if you are wealthy,  then maybe this bill that they are looking at on the Senate side is for  you. But if you are young and healthy today, believe me, tomorrow you  won't be young if you are lucky.   And believe me, the human body gets sick. And when that happens, the  question is: Will you have the ability to access the healthcare that  you need to keep you healthy?   Well, under this bill, based upon the American Medical Association,  hospitals, AARP, you can go to almost any health provider, they will  tell you that, no. 22 million Americans, as the CBO score showed, would  lose their access to healthcare, and many of those are in the middle,  the middle class. They talk about healthcare. We are not just talking  about healthcare; we are talking about adequate health coverage so that  when you are sick, you can go to a doctor and receive the care that you  need and know that you are covered, because my Republican colleagues  have forgotten where we were before the Affordable Care Act.   You see, before the Affordable Care Act, more Americans were going  bankrupt in trying to stay alive, for healthcare. These are middle  class, hardworking, everyday individuals who thought they had coverage.  But when they were sick, they went to the doctor, then they found out  that what they thought they were covered for, they were not, and so  they had to take out loans and re-mortgage and refinance their homes,  give up everything that they had to try to stay healthy and alive. We  don't want to go back there.   Before the Affordable Care Act, we were not talking about making sure  that those individuals with preexisting diseases were covered.   If you listen to my Republican colleagues, they will tell you that  the Affordable Care Act is the worst thing in the world. But before the  Affordable Care Act, we weren't talking about children being able to  stay on their parents' health insurance until they were 27 years old.   Yes, indeed, before the Affordable Care Act, many seniors saw their  coverage capped, and, after a certain amount of payout, they had to  come out of their pockets, which were not deep, and just hang in there  with their families and suffer and go bankrupt.   So what we are talking about now is saving the lives of individuals.   I want to thank my friend and sister from the Virgin Islands for  leading this for the Congressional Black Caucus, because the camera of  history is rolling and it is recording, and it will record her and the  members of the Congressional Black Caucus standing on the right side of  history.
