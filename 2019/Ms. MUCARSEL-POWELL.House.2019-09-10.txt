 Madam Speaker, today I rise in support of the  Coastal and Marine Economies Protection Act and the Protecting and  Securing Florida's Coastline Act.   It is estimated that 11 percent of Florida's plant species and 883  vertebrate and invertebrate species are endemic to our State. Florida  has 114 federally endangered or threatened species in our community.   The Florida reef is the third largest reef in the world and the only  living coral reef in the continental United States.   Florida's unique ecosystem is too delicate to put at risk to the  hazards of the drilling process. Offshore drilling puts our tourism  industry and fishing industry at risk, two of the biggest factors in  our economy here in Florida.   Drilling should never take priority over keeping our ecosystems  healthy or our fishermen's jobs. It is time to put the health and the  well-being of our community over the greed of corporate polluters.                            ____________________
