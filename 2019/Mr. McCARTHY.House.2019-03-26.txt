 Madam Speaker, I want to thank the Speaker for  yielding, and I also want to wish her a very happy birthday.   Madam Speaker, I rise to celebrate a milestone in the history of open  and accessible government. Now, many of us here and across the country  were first introduced as a child to how government works through our  Saturday morning cartoons in Schoolhouse Rock's ``I'm Just a Bill on  Capitol Hill,'' but giving life to the animation, C-SPAN has taken the  education and turned it into experience.   Over the last 40 years, C-SPAN has ensured the country experienced  some of the most consequential and memorable moments that transpired  right here in this body.   On the 50th anniversary of the Selma civil rights march,   John Lewis  reminded us of the quiet dignity of the 600 Americans who put their  lives on the line that this Nation might live up to the promises made  in its founding documents. As   John Lewis said, Our country will  never, ever be the same because of what happened on this bridge. C-SPAN  was there.   At the height of the Iraq war, Sam Johnson, a Vietnam veteran and  POW, gave a powerful salute to our soldiers and taught us an important  lesson about patriotism and service before self. We are better as a  country because of the example Sam Johnson set. C-SPAN was there.   Throughout these 40 years of experiences that have changed the  culture of history, from the Contract with America to the election of  the first woman Speaker, even capturing the lighthearted moments of  humor that can make their way in to times of very serious debate, C- SPAN captured it all.   This is important because the rise of the internet and the new media  environment has only reinforced the need for C-SPAN's unfiltered  coverage and unbiased programing. Now more than ever people must be  able to form their own opinions. They need objective coverage, access  to balanced analysis, and the opportunity to debate their views with  others in good faith. C-SPAN does just that.   Madam Speaker, James Madison believed that representative government  did more than cater to individual interests. He said that one of its  key advantages was that it refined and enlarged the public view about  the common good. For the last 40 years, C-SPAN has been an  irreplaceable tool for accomplishing Madison's vision.   I know I speak for the whole House in congratulating C-SPAN for four  decades of coverage.                            ____________________
