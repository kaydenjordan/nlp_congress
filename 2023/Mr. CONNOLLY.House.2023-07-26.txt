 Mr. Chair, Americans are not fighting and dying in  Ukraine, Ukrainians are. All they ask of the great country they admire  and they want to emulate is that we help with equipment and training.   Putin benefits from this amendment. Putin, a sociopath, who is  engaged in the most depraved behavior in our lifetime: killing innocent  men and women, targeting hospitals, targeting schools, and showing no  restraint.   This Congress must stand with Ukraine. This Congress can never be  seen as Putin's enabler. That is what this amendment does. That is what  is behind it.   The author of this amendment has already said she wants to give zero  to Ukraine, so we know the motivation behind the amendment. Let's  reject it.   Let's stand with Ukraine and make sure Putin gets that message loud  and strong with a forceful voice here on the floor of the House of  Representatives.
