 Mr. Speaker, this isn't about changing the rules to get  things done. This is about changing the rules to hide what is done and  who has done it.   This rule would change what is going to happen shortly here, which is  a bill that provides another $1 trillion to State and local governments  in addition to the funds provided under the CARES Act. Now, much of the  $1 trillion already sent to the States has yet to be spent.   Take my home State of Pennsylvania, Mr. Speaker, where the Governor  there has withheld CARES Act funding and extorted the counties to go  along with his indefinite shutdown, the untimely deaths of hundreds and  thousands in nursing homes, and the bankruptcy of many of our citizens.   This unnecessary and unconstitutional mandate has resulted in 1.8  million Pennsylvanians losing their jobs. We are fifth in population,  number one in unemployment, and one or two in untimely deaths in  nursing homes.   Despite all the CARES Act funds that we have already given, 41 days  is what it takes, on the average, for somebody to receive unemployment  benefits run by the State.   More money isn't going to help anything here, Mr. Speaker, not one  more cent.  [[Page H2039]]         Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I will tell you this bill, among other things--we can  talk about all the wish list of things that are in it, and I am sure  many have and many will. I want to talk about the trillion dollars of  additional spending to the States and talk about my State of  Pennsylvania, where we spent and sent billions of dollars where, right  now, the Governor is holding hostage that money that is supposed to go  directly to the counties. He won't give it to the counties that are  going bankrupt right now.   What he is doing, Mr. Speaker, is making sure that our nursing home  patients get exposed to COVID-19. It is a directive in Pennsylvania, if  they have COVID-19 and the hospital releases them, they have to go back  to the nursing home. So our nursing homes are 74 percent of the deaths  across the State. Seventy-four percent of the deaths in Pennsylvania  are because of the Governor's policy.   Meanwhile, he says he doesn't have enough money. We are going to  spend more money in Pennsylvania when the money hasn't already been  spent   Oh, by the way, the unemployment compensation money that we sent to  Pennsylvania, it takes 41 days right now to have your claim answered.  People cannot exist on policies and promises. They need money.   Mr. Speaker, spending more money, sending more money to buttress  failed policies doesn't fix the policies. They don't fix anything. They  don't help anyone.   Let's fix the policies. Let's make sure the people get the money that  we have sent to them instead of just sending more to the Governor, who  is going to extort the counties and kill our elderly.
