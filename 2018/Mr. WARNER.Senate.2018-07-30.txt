 Mr. President, family obligations unfortunately have kept  me from being present for the cloture vote today on the nomination of  Britt Grant, of Georgia, to be a U.S. circuit judge for the Eleventh  Circuit. I have grave concerns about Justice Grant's qualifications and  her record, and, had I been present, I would have voted against cloture  on her nomination.                            ____________________
