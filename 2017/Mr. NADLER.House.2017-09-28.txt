 Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 2792, the  hopelessly misnamed Control Unlawful Fugitive Felons Act.   As has become sadly routine in this Chamber under Republican rule,  this bill considers those merely accused of a crime as if they were  convicted felons without bothering with little niceties like due  process. Having dispensed with basic constitutional protections, the  bill then cuts off vital government assistance to some of the most  vulnerable people in our society.   Under current law, the Social Security Administration helps law  enforcement track down individuals with an outstanding arrest warrant  for an alleged felony or an alleged violation of probation or parole.  Those who are actively fleeing law enforcement can also have their  Supplemental Security Income, or SSI, benefits terminated. Under this  bill, however, SSI benefits, which serve as a lifeline for low-income  seniors and people with disabilities, would be terminated, whether or  not people are actually attempting to evade justice.    The mere issuance of a warrant or an alleged parole violation with no  arrest,  [[Page H7599]]  no trial, and no conviction would be enough to cut off vital benefits  to the neediest among us. This is not just unconstitutional, it is  inhumane. The bill would ensure that many low-income seniors and people  with disabilities will lose their benefits unfairly and unnecessarily.   The vast majority of people affected by this bill have outstanding  warrants that law enforcement chooses not to bother serving, often  because they are for very old or minor offenses. Many people do not  even know that an arrest warrant has been issued for them, but this  bill would consider them as felons fleeing justice.   Many warrants are issued on the basis of mistaken identity,  inaccuracies, or paperwork errors. It can take months to resolve such  errors, which might involve traveling to a distant jurisdiction, hiring  an attorney, and working through an overloaded court system.   And supporters of this bill expect people living on less than $750 a  month to do all of this: to go to a different jurisdiction, to hire an  attorney, to do all of this while the benefits they rely on to subsist  are cut off?   That is outrageous.                                time  1000    We heard from the gentlewoman from South Dakota about various  exceptions to the bill, you can go through this process and that  process. With what attorney? With what money? Does this bill have an  appropriation in it to supply attorneys for people faced with this  cutoff, people who, by definition, are the poorest people, who can't  afford an attorney?   This legislation is a blatant violation of due process, and it will  cause untold suffering to the people who need our help the most. At a  time when Republicans are unveiling their proposal for massive tax cuts  for the wealthy, this bill is a shameful illustration of the majority's  priorities.   It is also a shameful illustration of something we have seen on this  floor too often, and that is the assumption that anyone accused of  something is guilty and that we don't have to bother with a trial, we  don't have to bother with proof, and we don't have to bother with due  process. That eviscerates much of the reason for the existence of this  country, to vindicate due process, to give people rights and not to  assume that anyone who a judge or someone thinks may have committed a  crime is automatically guilty. We believe in due process in this  country.   Mr. Speaker, I urge this bill's defeat.    Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to recommit at the desk.    Mr. Speaker, I am opposed in its current form.    Mr. Speaker, I offer this motion to recommit on behalf of  Ms. Velazquez. This is the final amendment to the bill, which will not  kill the bill or send it back to committee. If adopted, the bill will  immediately proceed to final passage, as amended.   It is unfortunate that we are here today debating inadequate policies  while our fellow Americans in Puerto  [[Page H7611]]  Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands are hurting.   While I do not doubt the underlying bill was made with good  intentions, it is not just inadequate for all the victims of the  hurricanes, and it is insulting to the people of Puerto Rico. They are  hurting. They have no food, no water, no power. They need our help.   Estimates suggest the storm caused $40 billion to $85 billion in  insurance claims throughout the Caribbean, with 85 percent of those  losses in Puerto Rico. Nearly all of the island is without power, and  85 percent of cell towers were knocked out. The hurricane ravaged 80  percent of the crop value in Puerto Rico--a $780 million loss. This  will result in higher food prices at a time when Puerto Rico faces  shortages.   These are only the initial estimates. Each day we learn more about  the scale of devastation, and likely won't know the measure of damage  for some time.   FEMA has indicated that it has ``provided more than 1.5 million  meals, 1.1 million liters of water, nearly 300 infant and toddler kits,  and nearly 12,000 emergency roofing kits to the U.S. Virgin Islands and  Puerto Rico since Hurricane Maria's landfall.'' That is a quote from  FEMA.   Yet the total population of American citizens in Puerto Rico is 3.4  million. The total in the U.S. Virgin Islands is over 100,000. It has  been 7 days since the storm. The math simply doesn't add up, and  neither does the bill as it is written.   This motion to recommit would do more for the people of Puerto Rico  and the Virgin Islands than the underlying bill. Unlike the underlying  bill, this motion will give them funds to help them rebuild. The  dollars are directed for rebuilding and other economic support.   It considers specific provisions to ensure long-term growth is  capable on the island, and it strives to treat disaster victims  equally. By taking the politics out of natural disasters, all of our  constituents, from New York, and Puerto Rico, to Florida, Louisiana,  and Texas, will automatically have the necessary aid to rebuild. Giving  them this peace of mind will give them the ability to focus on what  matters: their families and communities.   Rather than putting forth a fig leaf to offer themselves cover, as  the underlying bill does, this motion would provide immediate, greater  benefits to the people of Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. They  cannot wait for assistance.   By voting for this motion, you would be voting to help our fellow  Americans. I urge all Members to vote ``yes.''   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
