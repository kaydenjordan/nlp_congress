 Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I  call up House Resolution 668 and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 668         Resolved, That upon adoption of this resolution it shall be       in order to take from the Speaker's table the bill (H.R. 1)       to provide for reconciliation pursuant to titles II and V of       the concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2018,       with the Senate amendment thereto, and to consider in the       House, without intervention of any point of order, a motion       offered by the chair of the Committee on Ways and Means or       his designee that the House concur in the Senate amendment.       The Senate amendment and the motion shall be considered as       read. The motion shall be debatable for 20 minutes equally       divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority       member of the Committee on Ways and Means. The previous       question shall be considered as ordered on the motion to       adoption without intervening motion. Clause 5(b) of rule XXI       shall not apply to the motion.     Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield  the customary 30 minutes to the gentlewoman from New York (Ms.  Slaughter), my friend, the ranking member of the Rules Committee,  pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During  consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose  of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their  remarks.    Mr. Speaker, I rise this morning in support of this  rule and the underlying legislation. The rule provides for  consideration of the Senate amendment to H.R. 1, an act to provide for  reconciliation pursuant to titles II and V of the concurrent resolution  on the budget for fiscal year 2018, also known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs  Act.   Mr. Speaker, last evening, the Senate, on a vote of 51-48, passed the  Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which I believe is in the interest of the  American people.   This is a bold, progrowth plan that will overhaul our Tax Code and  unleash the free enterprise system. It lowers tax rates on businesses  of all sizes so that job creators can focus more on bringing not only  more work to their workers, but also hiring more workers, increasing  paychecks, and growing a competitive marketplace all around the world.   Mr. Speaker, we are trying to expand our economy, and there is  nothing more important for any Member of this body than to know that  the things that are happening in their own local communities are about  the ability for people, whether they are just graduating from high  school, whether they are graduating from a technical school, whether  they are graduating from college, or whether they are looking for a  second job or a longer career, to be successful in the marketplace in  their own area, in their own home--not having to move somewhere to find  a job, but in their own community. That is what we are trying to do.   We are trying to increase wages for every single community across  this country. My home of Dallas, Texas, has been home to so many people  who have moved there as a result of the, really, unlimited  opportunities that we see right now in Texas, and that comes because  Texas has found itself to be their home because so many other companies  have literally been run out of their States because of high taxes--high  taxes that are placed on those companies and the employees to where it  makes living and being competitive more difficult.   During consideration of this legislation in the Senate, a few,  relatively small provisions were removed through points of order in the  Senate under what is called the Byrd rule, a parliamentary tool used  during reconciliation.   The first change made by the Senate under the Byrd rule strikes the  language that allowed 529 accounts to be used for homeschool expenses.   The second change modifies a provision that imposes an excise tax on  the investment income of certain educational institutions. The change  strikes a reference to ``tuition-paying'' students, making the  exception to the excise tax available only if the institution has less  than 500 students or if 50 percent or less of the students are located  in the United States.  [[Page H10253]]    A third small change simply strikes the short title.   Mr. Speaker, all of these provisions were included in the underlying  bill as it first passed the Senate and came to the House and passed.  However, at the time that this was done, there were no parliamentary  points of order which were raised, which were later done.   Mr. Speaker, these minor changes will allow us to advance exactly the  same discussion that we had in this body, exactly the same discussion  that we have had with the American people, exactly the things that we  have talked about up in the Rules Committee and across this country, as  Republicans have talked about the importance of the status quo tax laws  that we presently have--moved so many companies overseas, moved jobs  overseas, and is not encouraging American companies to be competitive  because America, when combined with State and local taxes and Federal  taxes, is among the highest in the world, which means that American  business finds itself in a competitive marketplace, may be a great  product, but, on price, we are not as competitive.   This will allow America to achieve the greatness that it needs for a  great people who want and need to be great, also.   This legislation is about making sure that the rising worker, whether  they are brand-new in the marketplace or whether they are an  entrepreneur, or a mother or a father out in the marketplace looking  for a job, will find the ability to be successful.   The United States is already the best place in the world to live. We  are an incubator always for new ideas and small business, but we are  now going to be able to celebrate that to make it easier. We are taking  the Tax Code, instead of being the highest taxed Nation in the world,  to be one of the lowest. It is going to mean great things for the  American people, the American worker, and, most of all, for people who  believe that we want America to be great again.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from New York. She  has, as the Rules Committee has, taken a lot of time on this bill--we  have spent hours not only discussing and debating the effects of the  bill, what the bill is about, why we would do it--but most of all, her  abiding ability to stand up and represent her party in their context,  and I respect that.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Alabama (Mr.  Byrne), a distinguished member of the Rules Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, we do recognize we have a difference. We recognize we  had a difference at the time we announced we were going to do this bill  and we were going to change the direction we were going. This was part  of a debate that happened during the Presidential election, where we  had an argument. The Democratic Party very clearly said: We need to  raise taxes.   Every year we see where they are on the floor during budget time to  raise spending $1 trillion and raise taxes $1 trillion. That is more  than what they had done under President Obama, Speaker Pelosi, and Mr.  Reid; except what happens when you do that is you kill the economy, you  kill the investment in families, in jobs, and in small businesses.    In the year after we had the massive tax increase, we had a GDP rate  of zero. That is because there was this huge transfer from free  enterprise to Uncle Sam, so the economy failed to grow. Then as the  economy began to normalize, it normalized over the next 7 years at 1.2  percent.   That is what the election was about, Mr. Speaker. Since the election,  what has happened is we have added over 1 million net new jobs, despite  a huge storm summer that impacted a lot of employment. Our stockmarket  has risen dramatically, meaning that America wants to be great again,  too. We are going to make it together.   So we do recognize differences. They want a $1 trillion increase in  spending, and they want a $1 trillion tax increase. We want to move it  the other direction.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Woodall), who is a member of the Rules  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Georgia.    Mr. Speaker, how much time is remaining on both sides?    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Messer), the chairman of the Republican  Policy Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Burgess).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Roskam), the chairman of the Subcommittee on Tax Policy  for the Ways and Means Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  [[Page H10259]]         Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from New York not only for her  service to the Rules Committee, but also for her service to this body  and to her party.                                time  1115    Mr. Speaker, the bottom line is, I will take her up on that. We will  bet that this works because we looked at what happened when President  Obama, Harry Reid, and Speaker Pelosi put a $1 trillion tax increase on  the American people; then spent $870 billion on a surplus; then added  in $1 trillion of debt when they worked the deal that was for student  loans; then we did cash for clunkers; then we did cell phones for all;  and it just went on and on and on and on. And now they want to place  the $20 trillion deficit on Republicans.   What we are trying to do is to recognize that we did look at what  happened economically during the 8 years that President Obama was here:  1.2 percent annual GDP growth, while our trading partners around the  world--Germany, Japan, India, China--all raised their GDP numbers off  growing economies because the average rate in Europe for corporate tax  is 23.6 percent, while America was at 39 percent, and States all across  the United States raised their taxation just like President Obama  encouraged them to do: to grow government, to make it more expensive.   But what happened is, then the free enterprise system was not  competitive. We began losing jobs all across the country. We began  losing our competitiveness because of the high taxation rate. That is  why we are going to do something about it.   So when you raise taxes $1 trillion and spend an extra $10 trillion  over 8 years, there is an impact. Of course, there is an impact. What  we are trying to do is respond back to the American people, who last  November said: Instead of going that way, why don't we go this way; why  don't we be the world's leader; why be 24th in the world in  competitiveness for business; why not be first or second; why not add  jobs; why not do something that places Americans, the middle class of  this country in a better position?   That is the call that we are about. That is what Republicans have  been trying to do, and we are responding with a bill that is going to  take Americans--instead of being the most expensive tax country in the  world, we are going to make us among the best. We are going to be an  attractor of jobs, of investment dollars, of opportunity.   The real problem with this country, the gentleman from Massachusetts  (Mr. Neal), a Member of Congress, spoke about it to the Rules  Committee, tens of thousands of jobs that pay up to $60,000 in his home  State are going begging right now. Thousands of jobs in this country  are going begging because we do have a problem where America doesn't  want to come and take these jobs; where we cannot have people who pass  drug tests; where we have people who say: Well, I don't have those  abilities. Well, in Dallas, Texas, my home, we have $21-an-hour jobs  begging for people who could come and work.   Mr. Speaker, what we are trying to do is to encourage America and  Americans, let's get to work. Let's make this happen. Let's not blame  it on somebody else. There are jobs available in America, and we are  going to answer the question. We are going to answer the bell. The  Republican Party is going to stand on what we do right now, and we are  willing to take what comes that way.   And I will tell you what comes that way. When you go from 39.6  percent, the highest corporate tax in the world, to where you mark  yourself down where virtually the rest of the world is at 23, in this  case 21, we are going to be competitive. Americans are winners.  Americans want to win. Americans are the best at entrepreneurism. They  are the best at being innovative.   We are now--instead of Uncle Sam taking 39 percent and making us  drain our resources, we are going to incent Americans to go do it.   Mr. Speaker, my staff, Ron Donato, my tax man, who has spent a lot of  time working with me listening to people back in Dallas, Texas, we  think this is a good deal to make the free enterprise system, which is  the greatest system in the world. We are going to fuel it; we are going  to fund it; we are going to make it work.   Mr. Speaker, for that reason, we will be willing to land on what  happens here, so mark your calendar right now. Go look at where we are,  and watch where we are going. For this reason, I urge my colleagues to  support this rule.   The material previously referred to by Ms. Slaughter is as follows:            An Amendment to H. Res. 668 Offered by Ms. Slaughter         At the end of the resolution, add the following new       sections:       ``SEC. 2. POINT OF ORDER AGAINST ANY TAX BILL THAT RAISES                     TAXES ON MIDDLE CLASS FAMILIES BY ELIMINATING                     OR LIMITING THE STATE AND LOCAL TAX DEDUCTION.         (a) Point of Order.--It shall not be in order in the House       of Representatives to consider any bill, joint resolution,       motion, amendment, amendment between the Houses, or       conference report that repeals or limits the State and Local       Tax Deduction (26 U.S.C.

The question of consideration shall be       debatable for 10 minutes by the Member initiating the point       of order and for 10 minutes by an opponent, but shall       otherwise be decided without intervening motion except one       that the House adjourn.''       SEC. 3. POINT OF ORDER AGAINST ANY TAX BILL THAT REPEALS THE                     INDIVIDUAL MANDATE UNDER THE PATIENT PROTECTION                     AND AFFORDABLE CARE ACT.         (a) Point of Order.--It shall not be in order in the House       of Representatives to consider any bill, joint resolution,       motion, amendment, amendment between the Houses, or       conference report that repeals or limits the individual       mandate under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act       (26 U.S.C. Sec. 5000A).  [[Page H10260]]         (b) Waiver in the House.--It shall not be in order in the       House of Representatives to consider a rule or order that       waives the application of subsection (a). As disposition of a       point of order under this subsection, the Chair shall put the       question of consideration with respect to the rule or order,       as applicable. The question of consideration shall be       debatable for 10 minutes by the Member initiating the point       of order and for 10 minutes by an opponent, but shall       otherwise be decided without intervening motion except one       that the House adjourn.''                                   ____           The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means         This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous       question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote.       A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote       against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow       the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a       vote about what the House should be debating.        Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of       Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the       previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or       control the consideration of the subject before the House       being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous       question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the       subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling       of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the       House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes       the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to       offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the       majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated       the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to       a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to       recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said:       ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman       from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to       yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first       recognition.''        The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous       question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an       immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no       substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.''       But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the       Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in       the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition,       page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous       question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally       not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member       controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of       offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by       voting down the previous question on the rule. . . . When the       motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the       time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering       the previous question. That Member, because he then controls       the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for       the purpose of amendment.''        In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of       Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special       Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on       such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on       Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further       debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues:       ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a       resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control       shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous       question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who       controls the time for debate thereon.''        Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does       have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only       available tools for those who oppose the Republican       majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the       opportunity to offer an alternative plan.     Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I  move the previous question on the resolution.
