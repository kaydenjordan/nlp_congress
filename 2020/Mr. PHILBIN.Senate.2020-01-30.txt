 Mr. Chief Justice, Senators, thank you for the question.   I think it does directly contradict their claim now that they need  more  [[Page S731]]  witnesses. They said for weeks that it was an overwhelming case. They  came here and they have said 63 times that it is overwhelming or proved  beyond a reasonable doubt. Manager Nadler said twice today that based  on what they have already shown you, it has been proved beyond any  doubt.   All right, if that is their position, why do they need more witnesses  or evidence? It is completely self-contradictory.   I would like to address a couple of other points while I am here and  I have the time, and we have gone back and forth on this, and I don't  know why I have to say it again, but the House managers keep coming up  here and saying and acting as if, if you mention Ukraine in connection  with election interference, if you even mention it, you are a pawn of  Vladimir Putin because only the Russians interfered in the election and  there is not any evidence in the record--they say--the Ukrainians did  anything.   I read it before; I will read it again. One of their star witnesses,  Fiona Hill, said that some Ukrainian officials ``bet on Hillary Clinton  winning the election,'' so it was ``quite evident'' that ``they were  trying to curry favor with the Clinton campaign,'' including by  ``trying to collect information . . . on Mr. Manafort and on other  people as well.'' That was Fiona Hill.   There was also evidence in the record from a POLITICO article in  2017. There was a whole bunch of Ukrainian officials who had done  things to try to help the Clinton campaign and the DNC and to harm the  Trump campaign.   In addition, two news organizations, both POLITICO and the Financial  Times did their own investigative reporting, and the Financial Times  concluded that the opposition to President Trump led ``Kiev's wider  political leadership to do something they would never have attempted  before: [to] intervene, however indirectly, in a US election''--the  Financial Times.   So the idea that there is no evidence whatsoever of Ukrainians doing  anything to interfere in any way is just not true. They come up here  and say it again and again, and it is just not true.   The other thing I would like to point out, Manager Schiff is  suggesting that somehow we are coming here and saying one thing and the  Department of Justice is saying something else in court about  litigation. That is also not true.   We have been very clear every time. The position of the Trump  administration, like the Obama administration, is that when Congress  sues in an article III court to try to enforce a subpoena against an  executive branch official, that is not a justiciable controversy, and  there is not jurisdiction over it. The House managers in the House,  though, take the position that they have that avenue open to them.   So our position is when we go to court, we will resist jurisdiction  in the court, but if the House managers want to proceed to impeachment,  where they claim that they have an alternative mechanism available to  them, our position is, the Constitution requires incrementalism in  conflicts between the branches, and that means that first there should  be an accommodation process, and then Congress can consider other  mechanisms at its disposal, such as contempt or such as squeezing the  President's policies by withholding appropriations or other mechanisms  to deal with that interbranch conflict or, if they claim they can sue  in court, to sue in court. But an impeachment is a measure of last  resort.   Now, earlier, Manager Schiff suggested that today in court, the  Department of Justice went in and said: There is no jurisdiction. And  when the judge said: Well, if there is no jurisdiction to sue, then  what can Congress do? And the DOJ, the key representative, simply said:  Well, if they can't sue, then they can impeach--as if that was the  direct answer to just go from if you can't sue, the next step is  impeachment.   Now that didn't seem right to me, because I didn't think that was  what DOJ would be saying, and DOJ put out a statement. I don't have a  transcript of the hearing. They don't have the transcript ready yet, as  far as I know, but DOJ said, and this is a quote from the statement:         The point we made in court is simply that Congress has       numerous political tools it can use in battles with the       executive branch--appropriations, legislation, nominations,       and potentially in some circumstances even impeachment. For       example, it can hold up funding for the President's preferred       programs, pass legislation he opposes, or refuse to confirm       his nominees.    This is continuing their statement:         But it is absurd for Chairman Schiff to portray our mere       description of the Constitution as somehow endorsing his rush       to an impeachment trial.    Thank you.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Senator from Connecticut.
