 Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the  amendment offered by Ms. Sherrill to the underlying bill.   While I support the underlying bill, this amendment is overly broad  in that it would prohibit qualified individuals from being employed  under the bill if they had ever been convicted of a drug felony or any  violent crime, even a misdemeanor. I support the other exclusions  included in the amendment.   The collateral consequences faced by individuals convicted of drug  felonies, such as denial of employment when otherwise qualified, is  counterproductive to the goal of reducing recidivism.
