 Madam Speaker, I rise today with a heavy heart to  honor the memory of an American hero, Jacksonville Fire and Rescue  Engineer Michael Freeland.   On November 11, Engineer Freeland tragically lost his life while  saving another life at the scene of a horrible accident. He died as he  lived: a hero. He was 36 years old.   Engineer Freeland was a firefighter with Jacksonville Fire and Rescue  for 7 years and was assigned to Station 73. He is an example of the  best of America: a hero who dedicated his life to the service of  others.   Our community mourns this great loss, and our hearts are with his  family and friends. I pray that his sacrifice will never be forgotten  and that his loved ones may find peace in this difficult time.   Madam Speaker, I ask that the House observe a moment of silence.                            ____________________
