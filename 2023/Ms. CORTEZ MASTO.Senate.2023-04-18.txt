 Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the  75th anniversary of Sky Tavern. In 1948, determined to help young  Nevadans learn how to ski, Marcelle ``Marce'' Herz filled her station  wagon up with kids and drove up the Mt. Rose Highway, fit them with  equipment and gear, and began teaching them about the sport and the  environment around them. Ms. Herz's efforts eventually led to the  creation of the Sky Tavern's Jr. Ski Program, which has taught over  100,000 Reno area youth how to ski and snowboard and continues to serve  over 2,000 children each winter.   Today, Sky Tavern is a nonprofit organization that provides summer  and winter outdoor sports training, competitions, recreation, and  events that are open to all in the region. Sky Tavern's goal and  mission is to give as many youth as possible the opportunity to engage  in outdoor sports and recreation--no matter their financial or physical  abilities--providing lifelong experiences that promote personal growth  and responsibility. Operated by a volunteer workforce, Sky Tavern is a  shining example of what is possible through strong community  engagement. From the instructors down to the lift operators, nearly  everyone helping Sky Tavern achieve its mission is taking time out of  their personal lives to do so. At its core, Sky Tavern runs on the  spirit of giving back, while also striving to fulfill founder Marce  Herz's goal of helping any child learn to ski and have fun doing it.   There are many examples of how Sky Tavern has helped people grow  through their love of the outdoors. Sky Tavern Ski Program alumni  include Olympians such as three-time medalist David Wise, Lane Spina,  and Tamara McKinney. Sky Tavern's promise to give opportunities to  anyone, regardless of their physical or financial ability is the  cornerstone that they operate on. The specially trained volunteer staff  in their adaptive program are dedicated to helping children with  disabilities learn how to ski and enjoy the outdoors. That dedication  has yielded results; several Paralympians, including Gold-medalist  Ricci Kilgore can trace their roots back to Sky Tavern.   Congratulations to Sky Tavern on its 75th anniversary. I look forward  to seeing their continued impact on the lives of young people in  Nevada.                            ____________________
