 Mr. President, the Republican leader referred to the  American Rescue Plan, which did not receive a single Republican vote in  support. He referred to it as runaway Federal spending.   What did we buy with the American Rescue Plan?   We bought vaccines, and we bought an administration and management of  delivering those vaccines to the American people in the midst of a  pandemic that was claiming American lives every day.   Runaway Federal spending--how much stronger would this Nation be if  we were still in the depths of this pandemic?   We are emerging from it, thank God. But it wasn't for lack of effort  on our part on this side of the aisle.   Yes, we spent the money. We administered the shots, and people across  America are now protected from hospitalizations and death because of  it. No apologies here to my colleague from Kentucky. It was money well  spent, not just for that--and that was the number one public health  purpose--but, secondly, to keep businesses afloat so they can reopen  their doors as the pandemic ebbed.   That investment in the capital of America, in the businesses of  America, paid off for business owners who otherwise would have lost  their life savings and family investments and for their workers who  finally returned to work.   I think it helped the small businesses, and I think it helped the  families. The child tax credit, which cut in half child poverty in  America--that child tax credit, according to the Senator from Kentucky,  was runaway Federal spending. Tell that to the family who lives  paycheck to paycheck and tries to provide the basics in life for their  children. No apologies here for the American Rescue Plan.  [[Page S1196]]    And when you ask the American people, ``What about this inflation,''  it is a problem. Of course, it is. We see it as they do. And we see it  all across the world. Inflation isn't confined to the United States. It  is reflected in a world that is emerging from COVID-19, where  economies--local economies--were strangled and choked and restricted.  Now, they are expanding. People are expanding their needs and spending  on that side of it. If the supply doesn't keep up with it, then  inflation results. We have a battle ahead of us and many plans here to  try to address it with a number of items to reduce the cost of living  for families.    I announce that the Senator from New Jersey (Mr.  Menendez) and the Senator from New Hampshire (Mrs. Shaheen) are  necessarily absent.
