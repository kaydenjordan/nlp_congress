 Mr. Chair, I rise in support of a bipartisan amendment I  have offered along with my colleagues from Texas, Chairman Thornberry  of the Armed Services Committee and Mr. Conaway, a fellow CPA.   It is essential the Democrats and Republicans work together to  control government costs to root out waste, fraud, and abuse, and that  we specifically focus these efforts on the Department of Defense.   Chairman Thornberry has promoted a reform agenda of which I am very  supportive. During the Armed Services Committee markup of the bill, I  proposed changes to the chairman's reform package. My amendment sought  to make the use of private sector auditors more efficient and effective  by eliminating bureaucratic mandates and an unnecessarily bureaucratic  committee.   The chairman supported my goals, and I suggested that I work with my  fellow CPA, Mr. Conaway. In a bipartisan spirit, we agreed to this  amendment, which will, one, help eliminate the incurred cost audit  backlog; two, help reallocate resources to prioritize higher risk  audits with potential savings for government; three, help ensure  private sector auditing capacity exists; and, most importantly, four,  root out waste, fraud, and abuse in Defense contracting.   I never thought I would come to Washington to work on Department of  Defense audits, but Chairman Thornberry's willingness to engage my  expertise and the bipartisan manner of the amendment will hopefully  result in significant reforms and aid in my ongoing efforts to help  save taxpayers' dollars by making government more effective and  efficient.
