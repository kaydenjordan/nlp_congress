 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  [[Page H4281]]    Mr. Speaker, this important measure by Congresswoman Norma Torres  affirms this body's support for all efforts to combat corruption in  Central America. The people of this region have been living in  societies that, because of corruption, and that corruption has become  endemic, has led to gang violence, to criminality, to high levels of  impunity. And these conditions directly affect the ability of these  governments to bring peace and prosperity to all of its citizens, and  that, in turn, fuels the flows of those who leave illegally, migrants,  to the Northern Hemisphere--well, to the United States.   So the citizens of Northern Triangle countries, those in this region,  want to live in safety in their own countries, and we can help by  supporting efforts by the International Commission Against Impunity in  Guatemala and its counterpart in Honduras, and those others in the  region that are fighting for these efforts that enable an independent  judiciary and a judiciary that combats corruption.   Norma Torres' work on Central America has helped to build capacity in  these countries to begin providing security for its citizens, and I  urge my colleagues to support this measure.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the  gentleman from California (Mr. Royce) that the House suspend the rules  and agree to the resolution, H. Res. 145, as amended.   The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the  rules were suspended and the resolution, as amended, was agreed to.   A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 1677) to halt the wholesale slaughter of the Syrian people,  encourage a negotiated political settlement, and hold Syrian human  rights abusers accountable for their crimes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1677         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

Sunset.       SEC. 2. SENSE OF CONGRESS.         It is the sense of Congress that--        (1) Bashar al-Assad's murderous actions against the people       of Syria have directly contributed to the deaths of more than       480,000 civilians, led to the destruction of more than 50       percent of Syria's critical infrastructure, and forced the       displacement of more than 14,000,000 people, precipitating       one of the worst humanitarian crises in more than 60 years;        (2) international actions to protect vulnerable populations       from attack by uniformed and irregular forces associated with       the Assad regime, including Hezbollah, on land and by air,       including through the use of barrel bombs, chemical weapons,       mass starvation, industrial-scale torture and execution of       political dissidents, sniper attacks against pregnant women,       and the deliberate targeting of medical facilities, schools,       residential areas, and community gathering places, including       markets, have been insufficient to date;        (3) Assad's use of chemical weapons, including chlorine,       against the Syrian people violates the Chemical Weapons       Convention, to which Syria is a party;        (4) Assad's abhorrent use of chemical weapons, most       recently on April 4, 2017, in an attack on the town of Khan       Shakhyn in which more than 90 people died, including women       and children, and more than 600 hundred people were injured,       is condemned in the strongest terms;        (5) violent attacks resulting in death, injury,       imprisonment or threat of prosecution against humanitarian       aid workers and diplomatic personnel, as well as attacks on       humanitarian supplies, facilities, transports, and assets,       and acts to impede the access and secure movement of all       humanitarian personnel are in violation of international       humanitarian law and impede the lifesaving work of       humanitarian organizations and diplomatic institutions; and        (6) Assad's continued claim of leadership and war crimes in       Syria have served as a rallying point for the extremist       ideology of the Islamic State, Jabhat al-Nusra, and other       terrorist organizations.       SEC. 3. STATEMENT OF POLICY.         It is the policy of the United States that all diplomatic       and coercive economic means should be utilized to compel the       government of Bashar al-Assad to immediately halt the       wholesale slaughter of the Syrian people and to support an       immediate transition to a democratic government in Syria that       respects the rule of law, human rights, and peaceful co-      existence with its neighbors.

Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from  California (Mr. Royce) and the gentleman from New York (Mr. Engel) each  will control 20 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to  include any extraneous material in the Record.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from California?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to  include any extraneous material in the Record.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from California?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to start by commending the gentleman from  New York (Mr. Engel), the ranking member, for his leadership in  authoring this critical legislation. Mr. Engel has long been the voice  on Syria, and I must mention that the outline that he has given in  terms of the initial problems when we saw those citizens on the streets  of Damascus, walking, saying, ``Peaceful, peaceful,'' and then, as we  saw on CNN, the automatic weapons open up and saw the Assad regime mow  those civilians down--he was the first to begin to ring the alarm. I  wish this body, and previous administrations as well, had done more to  heed his calls.   For 6 years, we have watched the Syrian regime launch wave after wave  of unrelenting destruction on the people of Syria. Airstrikes, chemical  weapons attacks, forced starvation, industrial-scale torture, the  deliberate targeting of hospitals, schools, marketplaces, and this done  with precision bombs and with crude barrel bombs, and, as a  consequence, Syrians suffering every day.   Now, just last month, we saw footage of entire families killed,  suffocated by sarin gas, a chemical weapon that Assad supposedly gave  up under a deal brokered by Russia and the previous administration. The  number of dead is estimated now to be close to 500,000, and another 14  million have been driven from their homes.   And while ISIS plays a role in the violence in Syria, it is Bashar  al-Assad and his backers--among them, Russia, Iran, and Hezbollah--who  are the main drivers of this death and destruction. ISIS has no  airplanes. It is Russian and Syrian fighter planes and helicopters that  drop those bombs on those hospitals and schools.   It is Hezbollah and Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps fighters who  attack cities, who burn crops, who prevent food and water and medical  supplies from reaching vulnerable civilians.   It is Assad's secret police and intelligence groups who kidnap and  torture and murder civilians from every ethnic group and political  party, Sunni, Shia, Christians, Alawite; none are safe.   One of the worst facilities is just 20 miles from Damascus, Sednaya,  a prison, a place so terrible that it is called a human slaughterhouse.  Thousands and thousands of people have been tortured and hung and shot  and left to starve to death within the prison. And the numbers are so  high that, in 2013, Assad began constructing a crematorium to dispose  of the bodies.   Over the past 4 years, our committee heard agonizing testimony from  Syrians caught up in this horror, including the brave Syrian defector  known to the world as Caesar and for whom this bill is named. Caesar  testified about the shocking scale of torture being carried out within  the prisons of Syria.   We saw his photographs and the tens of thousands of photographs he  took with those bodies numbered numerically. I don't know what it is  about totalitarian regimes that leads them to want to number their dead  and catalog it, but, because of his bravery, we have those photographs.   We have also heard from doctors who treat victims of chemical  attacks, volunteers who dig through rubble with their bare hands to  rescue those trapped within, and we have heard  [[Page H4287]]  from the survivors of torture in Assad's prisons.   As Syria drags on and on, vital U.S. national security interests are  at stake. Assad's brutality is both a magnet for terrorist recruitment  and a destabilizing force driving tens of millions of refugees out of  that country. We have 14 million Syrians, as I said, who are displaced  right now, many of them still in the country, and millions outside of  the country, yet we have taken no steps to apply the economic tools  that are available to us with respect to Assad and his backers.   Mr. Speaker, this legislation is designed to increase the cost to  Assad and to those outside backers by targeting the sectors of the  economy that allow Assad to murder with impunity. Under the bill,  foreign companies and banks will have to choose between doing business  with the regime or with the United States. It would also sanction  anyone who flies weapons or sends fighters into Syria to support the  Assad regime.   This bill is also about creating economic leverage to push the  parties to negotiate, creating the conditions for a negotiated peace.  It is about finding a way forward to be determined by the Syrian people  that does not allow Assad to exterminate his own community; it does not  allow him to do it with impunity; does not guarantee ISIS a safe space  from which to operate; and does not drive another 10 million people  from their homes.   For there to be peace in Syria, the parties must come together, and  so long as Assad and his backers can slaughter the people of Syria with  no consequences, there is no hope for peace.   As we speak, Russia and Iran have proclaimed themselves the  guarantors of peace and have promised to create de-escalation zones  where military operations can be curtailed and civilians can seek  safety. But these zones would be policed by the Syrian Army, supported  by Russian military police, by Hezbollah fighters, and IRGC, Iranian  Revolutionary Guard Corps commanders, backed by those Shia militias-- the very same people who have murdered thousands of Syrian civilians  with impunity throughout this conflict and who are actively engaged in  fomenting sectarian-based violence throughout the region. With this  scenario, peace does not have a chance.   Mr. Speaker, this bill is long overdue. And last year, Eliot Engel  and I brought this up, and we passed it unanimously, yet the other body  did not take it up before we adjourned.   I urge all Members to support this legislation as we seek to ease the  suffering of the Syrian people.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

I agree that your declining to pursue a sequential referral       in this case does not diminish or alter the jurisdiction of       the Committee on Ways and Means, or prejudice its       jurisdictional prerogatives on this bill or similar       legislation in the future. I would support your effort to       seek appointment of an appropriate number of conferees from       your committee to any House-Senate conference on this       legislation.        I will seek to place our letters on this bill into the       Congressional Record during floor consideration of the bill.       I appreciate your cooperation regarding this legislation and       look forward to continuing to work with the Committee on Ways       and Means as this measure moves through the legislative       process.            Sincerely,                                                   Edward R. Royce,                                                          Chairman.
