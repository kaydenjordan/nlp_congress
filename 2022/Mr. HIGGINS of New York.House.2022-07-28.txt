 Madam Speaker, Taiwan, a country of less  than 24 million people in East Asia, manufactures 92 percent of the  world's advanced computer chips. You can't buy technological supremacy,  but you can build it.   Today, the House will vote to approve the CHIPS Act, which will make  a $280 billion investment in the design and actual making of advanced  computer chips right here in America; $50 billion for research and  development and for the construction of chip manufacturing facilities  in America.   The bill also includes $10 billion to establish 20 regional hubs,  regional centers of innovation. Buffalo, New York, is well-positioned  to be one of those.   I urge this House to approve the CHIPS Act, and the Commerce  Department to select Buffalo as one of the regional hubs.                            ____________________
