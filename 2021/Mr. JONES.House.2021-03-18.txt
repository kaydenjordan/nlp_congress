 Madam Speaker, I swear, sometimes I stand in this Chamber  and feel like I am in the Twilight Zone, listening to a number of my  Republican colleagues espouse white supremacist ideology to denigrate  our wonderful Dreamers.   I am over here standing with a clear understanding that this bill  does not go far enough.   I want to share the story of a constituent of mine, Mr. Paul  Pierrilus, of our Spring Valley, New York, community, who was deported  to Haiti, a country where he had never even been, in apparent defiance  of the President's 100-day executive order.   We need a bill that goes further. I am going to vote for this, but we  need a bill that goes further, that forgives people who make mistakes.  [[Page H1522]]    Mr. Pierrilus, in his case, made a mistake in his early 20s. We need  a bill that allows him to return home, and I am going to be fighting  for that moving forward.
