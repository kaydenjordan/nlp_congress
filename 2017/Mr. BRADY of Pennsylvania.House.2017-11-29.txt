 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this resolution.   We would not be here today if it were not for the courage of my  friend and colleague, the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Speier). All  of us should be grateful for her leadership on this issue.   This resolution is the start, but it is just a start. We have to  reform the Congressional Accountability Act, we have to modernize to  fully fund the Office of Compliance, and there is much more to do.   I appreciate the effort of my chairman, Mr. Harper, and the  seriousness with which he has taken this issue and his commitment to  bipartisan progress. The status quo cannot and will not be tolerated.  Passing this resolution begins with the first step here.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from California (Ms.  Pelosi), who is our Democratic leader.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Raskin).

Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Brady  and the chair. I want to thank especially Congresswoman Speier and  Congresswoman Comstock for their good work on this issue.   Almost 40 years ago, I worked here in the United States Congress as a  member of the staff. I was 23 years old and I was sexually assaulted by  a distinguished guest of the United States Congress. Neither I nor  anyone in my office had received any type of sexual harassment  training. I had no place to turn; I had no one to tell; and I could do  nothing about it.   But today is a historic day. This is a watershed moment. Times have  changed and people do make changes. This is one that we are all  standing together--Republicans, Democrats, men, women, across the  board--to say ``enough is enough.''   I support this resolution as an important first step so that every  Member of Congress and every member of the staff on Capitol Hill  understand that we are drawing the line. We have had enough. We need to  address sexual harassment and assault in the workplaces, on college  campuses, in our military, and communities. The Halls of Congress can  be no exception.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Frankel).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Frankel).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to  gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. Carolyn B. Maloney).   (Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York asked and was given permission  to revise and extend her remarks.)                                time  1515    Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I thank Ranking  Member Brady for his leadership; Chairman Harper for moving so swiftly  on this issue; and my colleague, Jackie Speier, who has selflessly  worked on this issue for many years, along with Barbara Comstock.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this bill.   Too often, harassment is treated just like it is part of the job; and  if anyone complained, they were fired, punished, or paid off to be  silent. This is an important cultural change where harassment, which is  illegal, is treated seriously as a crime that needs to stop; and to  train staff, Members, and officers on how to know what is right and  what is wrong so that there is no misunderstanding.   This is a first step. I strongly support Congresswoman Speier's bill  that has a comprehensive approach, which bans the use of taxpayer money  to silence victims and to settle this.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, in closing, make no mistake about it, this is bullying:  sexual bullying harassment.   I have a wife, a daughter, a granddaughter, and a great- granddaughter. I have a responsibility to protect them. In the people's  House, we have mothers, wives, daughters, granddaughters, great- granddaughters, and we have a responsibility to protect them.   Men have a responsibility to stand up and confront this behavior when  we see it. We have a responsibility to demand better of other men. We  have a responsibility to confront these bullies.   Men who use their power to harass and abuse others are disgraceful,  and we cannot tolerate their behavior. We need to stop having a system  that enables it.   Mr. Speaker, I personally witnessed an incident back in my perch,  where I stay back in the corner there, of a Congresswoman that was  leaning back talking to me, and a Congressman walked by and groped her  from behind. I reached over and, lucky for him, I just couldn't grab  him. I wanted to chase him down the aisle, but the Congresswoman, as  classy as she is, said: ``No, don't do that. You may get in a little  trouble. We will take care of him.'' And he got taken care of pretty  well.   I wonder if women would be disrespected or sexually bullied if their  husbands or their fathers were standing next to them when somebody  tried to sexually harass them or grope them. That is why I say men who  do that are bullies and cowards. Just treat women with the respect and  dignity that you would your own mother.   Mr. Speaker, I ask for a unanimous vote on this resolution, and I  yield back the balance of my time.  [[Page H9498]]
