 Mr. President, for a long time, people opposed to  climate action said that tackling climate change would be too costly,  would harm economic growth, would be bad for American businesses, and  would kill jobs. It turns out these were phony arguments peddled by  fossil fuel interests. It turns out they are flat wrong. It turns out  that actually the true economic hazard is not climate action but  climate inaction.   We have recently seen an explosion of warnings from economic  regulators, central banks, insurers, investment firms, and risk  analysts that we face economic peril if we fail to address climate  change. These are not green groups; these are neutral business and  economic experts--the people whose job it is to protect us from risks  to financial stability and the people who make a business calculation  about what we stand to lose from unabated climate change.   Their warnings are many, and their warnings are serious. One example:  Just last month, Moody's warned that climate change will increasingly  disrupt and damage critical infrastructure and property and will hurt  worker health and productivity across the globe. Moody's, the credit  rating giant, estimated--hang on--$69 trillion. We talk about millions  around here pretty readily. We talk about billions when we are talking  about really big money. Moody's estimated $69 trillion of economic  damage globally by 2100, even if we limit global warming to only 2  degrees Celsius. The Presiding Officer and I are probably not going to  pay a lot of that. The pages will. We are not currently on track for  only 2 degrees Celsius; we are currently on track for around 3 degrees  of warming, which Moody's said would put us at further risk of hitting  tipping points beyond which lurk far larger, more lasting, and more  ominous dangers.   Here is another example: In May, the European Central Bank warned  that climate change presents significant economic risks to the economy,  to asset values, and to financial stability.   The longer we wait, the longer we fiddle around in this Chamber not  doing anything, the more it will cost to protect ourselves in the  future. That old saying about a stitch in time saving nine applies here  as well.   The ECB said that these risks could cause what they called ``systemic  issues,'' especially where markets do not price climate-related risks  correctly. ``Systemic issues'' is a bland term. It is central banker- speak. What it means is something pretty serious. Systemic issues means  this is so bad that it could take down the entire economy. The European  Central Bank is not alone. The Bank of England has been warning of  systemic risk from climate change or from not doing anything about  climate change for some time now. I think there are now over 30  sovereign banks that have made or adopted such warnings.   Just last week, Senator Schatz asked Federal Chairman Powell whether  severe weather is increasing due to climate change. Powell did not  equivocate. He said simply: ``I believe it is, yes.'' That is the  leader of the most influential bank in the world accepting without  hesitation a major threat to our financial system, echoed also by a  Federal Reserve report out of California. Climate change, they point  out, is a major threat to our financial system, to everything from  coastal real estate values, which Freddie Mac predicts will crash, to  stock market share prices, about which there are numerous adverse  predictions if this goes unchecked.   America's biggest financial institutions see what is coming. In the  House Financial Services Committee hearing in April, CEOs from six of  America's biggest banks agreed that climate change is a serious risk to  the financial system, and they said they are trying to take action to  address that risk.   There is an unfortunate sidebar, however. Big American banks that  claim to support climate action include four of our biggest banks:  JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, Citigroup, and Bank of America. These  banks all supported the Paris Agreement. In 2017, the CEOs of JPMorgan  Chase, Citigroup, and Bank of America even signed a letter urging  President Trump not to withdraw from the Paris Agreement.    These banks are all trying to reduce their own emissions, and all  have commitments to get to 100 percent renewable electricity--all good  steps. But the biggest direct impact these banks have on climate is not  through the promises they make but through the investments they make.  On that score, these four banks are steering us to climate calamity.   A group of environmental organizations released a report in March  adding up fossil fuel financing by 33 large, private sector banks from  around the world. These four American banks--JPMorgan Chase, Wells  Fargo, Citigroup, and Bank of America, which all support the Paris  Agreement and are all reducing their own carbon emissions--they are the  four largest funders of fossil fuel projects. Combined, they invested  over $580 billion in new fossil fuel projects over the past 3 years.  JPMorgan was the worst, with $196 billion of fossil fuel funding in 3  years. JPMorgan was also the top U.S. funder of tar sands, Arctic oil  and gas, and coal mining--the most emissions-intensive fuels.   The big American banks accounted for over a third of the surveyed  global fossil fuel financing since the Paris Agreement was signed in  2015. Worse, their investment in fossil fuel projects actually  increased after the Paris Agreement. Wells Fargo nearly doubled its  fossil fuel financing from 2016 to 2018. Obviously, these investments  in new fossil fuel projects do not align with the banks' stated support  of the Paris Agreement. The math doesn't work. The Paris Agreement aims  to limit warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius and to try to limit  warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius.   A study just published by Nature shows that the world's existing  fossil fuel infrastructure will emit enough carbon pollution to blow us  past 1.5 degrees of warming. The authors wrote that little or no  additional CO2-emitting infrastructure can be commissioned.  Little or no additional CO2-emitting infrastructure can be  commissioned if we are to meet the Paris Agreement climate goals.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the article titled ``How Much  Global Warming Is Fossil Fuel Infrastructure Locking In?'' from Inside  Climate News be printed in the Record at the end of my remarks.   That is the math. If the banks are true to their stated support of  the Paris Agreement, they should not finance any new fossil fuel  projects--unless, of course, they also finance capturing all the carbon  emissions, and they are not doing that.   It is true that these banks have announced goals to increase their  financing of clean and sustainable projects, but they are only goals,  and combined, even their goals only amount to around $100 billion per  year, which is about half of what they have actually invested in fossil  fuel projects each year since Paris.   Citi even released a report finding that maintaining our current  fossil fuel-heavy economy would cost more than moving to clean, low- carbon economy--cost more to stay in the fossil fuel economy than to  move to a clean energy economy--and they said that is not including  factoring in the economic damage from climate change, which Citi  reckons could total $72 trillion--$72 trillion under business as usual.  Citi projects that transitioning away from the projects they are  investing in to a low-carbon economy will save money on its own and it  will help avoid tens of trillions of dollars in further economic  damages. Yet they aren't investing consistent with their principles.   According to the International Monetary Fund, fossil fuels are  subsidized to the tune of $650 billion per year in the United States.  So there is no question that this massive subsidy--probably the biggest  subsidy in the history of the planet--makes investing in fossil fuels  profitable. But the contradiction remains. These banks all say they  support the Paris Agreement. They all recognize that it is economically  vital to  [[Page S4917]]  reach the goals of the Paris Agreement. Yet their investments would  ensure that the Paris Agreement fails.   It would help banks change their ways if companies had to disclose  their climate risks better. I just joined Senator Warren in a bill we  have done to require publicly traded companies to reveal their exposure  to climate-related risks.   But we have a proposal--Senator Schatz, Senator Heinrich, and I--to  help resolve the very root of the banks' contradiction: that Congress  put a price on carbon emissions and an end to fossil fuel subsidies.  Indeed, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon recommended this in the House  Financial Services Committee hearing in April. When asked whether his  bank will phase out fossil fuel funding and align its investments with  the goals of the Paris Agreement, he said: ``If you want to fix this  problem, you are going to have to do something like a carbon tax.''   So, bankers, help us do that. If these bankers think climate is a  serious problem--and they say they do--and that putting a price on  carbon pollution is the solution, which virtually every economist  agrees with--hello, you need to come here and fight to make it  happen. Banks have political influence. Lord knows, they never stop  throwing their influence around here when it comes to financial  regulations or tax giveaways. Where are they in Congress on climate? It  is a long pause waiting for them to show up. So, guys, talk is cheap.  Come on. Put a little effort into this. Pretend it is a financial  regulation.    The carbon fee bill of Senators Schatz, Heinrich, and Gillibrand  would help these banks align their investments with their stated goals.  Our bill meets the key standards of being effective on carbon  emissions, driving far more reductions than the Clean Power Plan,  revenue neutral in the economy, and border adjustable for trade. It  meets all three. Plus, it will help avoid the dreadful economic  warnings now so frequently heard from very responsible sources about  doing nothing--warnings of coastal property values collapsing, warning  of a carbon asset bubble crash, even warnings of big storms breaking  the bank of the insurance system.   To Citi's credit, it is a member of the newly formed CEO climate  dialogue group which will, I hope, become a strong advocate for a  Federal price on carbon pollution. That is the place where essentially  every economist--huge numbers of Nobel Prize winning economists, many  Republicans, former economic advisers to Presidents, former Treasury  Secretaries, former EPA Administrators, former Members of Congress-- have all come down.   It is pretty clear what the solution is: It is a price on carbon that  is revenue neutral and border adjustable and will reduce emissions  enough to keep us under 1.5 degrees. That is not hard to figure out. It  is getting there that is hard because, so far, the net pressure of  corporate America in Congress remains hostile to climate action,  whether from indifference by companies themselves or, worse, from the  hostile presence of corporate trade associations like the U.S. Chamber  of Commerce and the National Association of Manufacturers, two leading  business lobby groups recently outed as the two worst climate  obstructors in Congress.   The last I checked, a clean and green economy involved a lot of  commerce. And building a new clean grid and new clean technologies,  whether wind or solar or batteries or storage or distributed  generation, was a lot of manufacturing.   We still await the explanation from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and  the National Association of Manufacturers why they are 100 percent  aligned with the denial and obstruction of the fossil fuel industry and  0 percent aligned with their membership who, in many cases, are leaning  in to climate action.   There is a separate flotilla of front groups doing the dirty work of  the fossil fuel industry. The fossil fuel industry doesn't want to show  up and identify itself as the fossil fuel industry; then the game is  too obvious. So they put up all these front groups with ridiculous  names about Heartlands and Heritages and famous figures, and they are  front groups for fossil fuel. All those groups add to the corporate  pressure against climate action from the Chamber and from NAM.   So for banks like these, who claim to take climate change very  seriously, it would really make a difference if they would take an  interest in climate change, not just on their websites, not just in  their talking points, but in their investments in the market and  steered away from fossil fuel and into clean energy and in their  influence here in Congress.   We have to crack this nut here in Congress. There is no pathway to  avoiding climate calamity that does not require Congress to act.  Congress must act if we are going to get ahead of this problem. It is  not optional. You can't shrug as a business leader who cares about  climate and say: No, we are just going to do our thing; we don't need  to worry about what happens in Congress.   There is no pathway to avoiding the climate crisis without action in  Congress. The fossil fuel industry knows that. That is why they are  here, red in tooth and claw. The sensible, honorable parts of the  business community that want to do something about climate change need  to show up and push back because, otherwise, the hydraulics are against  us.   At this point, the science is clear. The economics are clear. The  warnings are serious--systemic risks--and they are many. Neither our  planet nor our economy can afford massive investments in new fossil  fuel projects, not by them, not by anyone. Time is short. We can no  longer afford corporate America to be AWOL on climate in Congress.   It is time for these banks and the rest of corporate America who want  to see progress and avoid what all those warnings are telling us to  wake up and to show up.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                  [From Inside Climate News, July 1, 2019]     How Much Global Warming Is Fossil Fuel Infrastructure Locking In?                             (By Phil McKenna)         All the power plants, vehicles and other fossil fuel-      burning infrastructure operating today will lock the world       into 1.5 degrees Celsius of global warming, exceeding the       Paris climate agreement goals, unless the biggest polluters       are shut down early or are retrofitted to capture their       carbon emissions, a new study shows.        And that's just the infrastructure already built. When the       researchers factored in the future emissions of coal- and       gas-fired power plants that are currently planned or under       construction, they found the total lifetime emissions would       shoot past l.5  deg.C (2.7  deg.F) warming and put the world       on pace to burn about two-thirds of the remaining carbon       budget for staying under 2  deg.C (3.6  deg.F) warming       compared to pre-industrial times.        The findings imply profound changes for the planet and many       of its inhabitants in this century. As global temperatures       rise, heat waves continue to intensify, extreme precipitation       increases, and an additional 10 million people face greater       risks from sea level rise in just the half degree between 1.5        deg.C and 2  deg.C, among other threats, the       Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) wrote last       fall.        We have already built enough to take us over 1.5,'' said       Ken Caldeira, an atmospheric scientist at the Carnegie       Institution for Science and a co-author of the study. ``For       these 1.5 scenarios you would either need to retire CO2       emitting infrastructure early or have carbon dioxide removal       strategies which are generally thought to be expensive.''        Nine years ago, Caldeira co-authored a similar study that       found the planet had already locked in about 496 gigatonnes       of carbon dioxide with existing infrastructure, emissions       that would result in about 1.3  deg.C of warming above pre-      industrial levels.        Since then, China and India have been on power plant       construction sprees. The average age of their coal-fired       power plants are 11 and 12 years, respectively, compared to       nearly 40 years in the United States, according to the new       study. The historical average lifespan of a power plant, and       the age used for calculations in the study, is about 40       years.        ``What we see now is a lot more carbon-emitting       infrastructure than we saw a decade ago,'' Caldeira said.       ``The trajectory is not going to where we would like it to go       to.''                  Future Emissions Likely to Be Even Higher         The new study found that existing energy infrastructure       would emit about 658 gigatons of carbon dioxide over the rest       of its expected lifetime, and that the future fossil fuel       power plants that are currently planned would boost that to       about 846 gigatons. The IPCC has determined that to have a 50       percent chance of keeping surface air temperature warming       under 1.5  deg.C, the world would need to limit emissions       from all human activities to about 580 gigatons of carbon       dioxide.        The future emissions are likely even higher than the study       estimates. It does not take  [[Page S4918]]       into account future emissions from other sectors including       shipping, aviation and heavy industry that will be hard to       wean off of fossil fuels. Nor does it account for emissions       related to fossil fuels extraction and pipelines or non-      energy emissions such as from agriculture.        Emissions from yet-to-be-built ships, planes, factories and       other fossil fuel-powered infrastructure will likely outweigh       emissions saved from the early retirement of existing fossil       fuel power plants, said Gunnar Luderer, head of the Energy       Systems Group at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact       Research in Germany, who reviewed the study.        For the new study, the researchers used detailed datasets       of fossil fuel-burning energy infrastructure operating in       2018 or planned. They found some progress, including       ``substantial'' cancellations of proposed fossil fuel power       plants in the past two years, which cut the expected       emissions from future power plants by as much as half from       studies conducted just a few years earlier.        In the U.S., utilities have been announcing plans to shut       down coal-fired power plants and add more renewable energy as       the costs of solar and wind power generation fall, but other       types of fossil fuel infrastructure have been expanding--      particularly natural gas drilling and pipelines to carry oil       and gas, both for domestic use and for export to other       countries. On June 20, for example, Energy Transfer LP       announced it planned nearly double the capacity the Dakota       Access oil pipeline, a project that was highly contested over       both climate and environmental concerns when it was approved       in 2017.                         No Time for Debate or Delay         Other studies have used different methods to estimate       emissions growth.        One study, published in Nature Communications in January,       determined there was a 64 percent chance that existing energy       infrastructure wouldn't commit the planet to passing l.5       deg.C warming, provided construction of additional fossil       fuel energy infrastructure stopped immediately and other       measures were taken to dramatically reduce emissions from all       other sectors of the economy.        Such measures would have to happen in the immediate future,       said Joeri Rogelj, a lecturer at the Grantham Institute at       Imperial College London and a co-author of the January study.        ``Both studies are really clear,'' Rogelj said. ``If we       wait another 5 to 10 years with being serious about emissions       reductions and addressing climate change then indeed we will       have no discussion anymore whether we can still make it to       1.5. It will be very clear and obvious that we will run past       it.''    I suggest the absence of a quorum.
