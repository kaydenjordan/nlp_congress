 Madam Speaker, I stand before you and this body today  to recognize an incredible American, an incredible New Yorker, and an  incredible law enforcement professional, Louis Matarazzo.   Lou Matarazzo committed his life to serving the people of New York,  where he spent 35 years as a member of the greatest police department  in the world, the New York City Police Department.   During his time in the NYPD, Lou experienced the ups and downs of  life on patrol as an NYPD cop, dealing with a crime crisis spanning  decades. Throughout this tumultuous time, Lou remained a steadfast  community protector, an advocate for his fellow brothers and sisters in  blue.   For 31 years, Lou served in various capacities in the New York City  Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, eventually being elected president  in 1995. Throughout his tenure, Lou Matarazzo worked tirelessly to  advocate for members of law enforcement, not just in New York, but  across this country, and strengthened police community relationships in  the Big Apple and beyond.   Due to his efforts, the lives of New York's protectors were enhanced,  community relations were improved, and the NYPD transformed into an  all-around more effective policing agency.   But Matarazzo didn't stop there. After retiring from the NYPD and  giving up his leadership in the PBA, he worked throughout the country  to support law enforcement professionals, including on Long Island, and  served as a special adviser to my former union, the New York City  Detectives' Endowment Association.   Sadly, on February 12 of this year, Lou Matarazzo passed away,  leaving behind a loving family and a community in mourning. The  Rockville Centre and Fourth Congressional District resident left a  lasting positive influence on New York, the United States, and the law  enforcement profession throughout this country.   His professionalism, commitment to duty and excellence in policing  served as an example to me during my time in the NYPD and helped me  rise through the ranks to become a detective.   I will personally miss Lou's leadership, the example he set, and his  guiding hand in New York. This good and faithful servant completed his  mission and remained our motto, ``Fidelis Ad Mortem,'' faithful until  death.   To the Matarazzo family, please know we will never forget the legend  that Lou was.                            ____________________
