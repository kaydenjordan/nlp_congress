 Madam Speaker, I rise to recognize the 106th anniversary  of the Armenian genocide.   Saturday, April 24, is Armenian Genocide Remembrance Day. On the  anniversary of the Armenian genocide, we mourn the innocent lives lost  and renew our call to recognize these events for what they were: a  genocide.   The Armenian people were removed from their homes and fell victim to  a mass murder campaign between 1915 and 1916. It is estimated that over  1 million Armenians were killed in this tragedy.   So many years later, people still do not call these events a  genocide. If we do not teach an accurate history, then we are doomed to  repeat it. It is our responsibility to recognize these tragedies and to  mourn them.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, today I rise to commemorate the 46th  anniversary of Black April.   April 30, 1975, marked the fall of Saigon and the end of the Vietnam  war. Many Vietnamese Americans who were alive during the war remember  this as the day that signified the loss of a country they once called  home.   The people left everything they knew to flee communism. Hundreds of  thousands of Vietnamese people have resettled in the United States and  built vibrant communities here. California's 48th District is the proud  home of Little Saigon, which is home to more Vietnamese Americans than  anywhere else in the United States.   On Black April, I will join the Vietnamese Americans in our community  and around the country in honoring those who served in Vietnam, and  those who lost their lives attempting to flee Communist rule.                            ____________________
