 Mr. Speaker, I first of all want to thank the  gentlewoman from Nevada (Ms. Titus) for the great leadership that she  has provided in the committee and in the House also.   I also want to thank my friend from Pennsylvania (Mr. Barletta) for  his leadership and for the great service that he has provided the  country here in the U.S. Congress.   This particular bill means a lot to my district. I also want to  thank, before I forget, the members of the Transportation and  Infrastructure Committee for unanimous support of this particular bill.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 2734, a bill which would  designate the Federal courthouse located in my district at 1300  Victoria Street in Laredo, Texas, as the George P. Kazen Building and  United States Courthouse.                                time  1745    Judge Kazen was born in Laredo, Texas, on February 29--a leap year-- in 1940. He received his law degree with honors from the University of  Texas School of Law in 1961. Shortly after graduation, he served a term  as a brief attorney for the Texas Supreme Court and entered the United  States Air Force as a JAG officer, where he was awarded the Air Force  Commendation Medal also.   Judge Kazen would return back to the city of Laredo in 1965, where he  practiced law until he was appointed by President Jimmy Carter to  become a United States district judge in 1979 for the Southern District  of Texas.   During his many years of service in the courtroom, he was known as an  honest, humble, and dedicated individual.   He was also among the most respected judges in the State and in the  country, and consistently ruled with class and fairness, all while  still making time to serve numerous civic organizations throughout  south Texas.   Judge Kazen recently retired after almost 40 years of service on the  bench.   I am pleased to have this opportunity to honor him and say that this  is an outstanding individual and a very noble individual. Dedicating  this Federal building and courthouse would serve as a reminder to all  of us of this great man of character who served his community and his  country for so many years.   Also, I want to convey my legislative intent for this bill that the  central jury assembly room on the first floor of this courthouse be  known as the Marcel C. Notzon II Jury Room.   Judge Notzon was born on August 24, 1935, in Laredo. His love for the  law and justice spanned a legal career over 39 years, with almost a  quarter century on the bench as the United States magistrate judge for  the Southern District of Texas. Judge Kazen, the man whom this building  will be named after, would call Judge Notzon the ``heart of the  courthouse.''   Judge Notzon, who just recently passed away, will be most remembered  as a portrait of a beloved and compassionate public servant and for a  full life he served in accordance with the rule of law.   In particular, I want to thank Senator John Cornyn and Senator Cruz  for helping to bring this bill to the floor in the Senate and  successfully passing the Senate, and all my Texas colleagues, all 36  Members from Texas in the House, for also supporting this piece of  legislation that would honor George P. Kazen throughout this earned  gesture.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues in the House to show their support  for this bill to name the Federal courthouse located at 1300 Victoria  Street in Laredo, Texas, as the George P. Kazen Federal Building and  United States Courthouse.   I want to thank Ms. Titus and Mr. Barletta for their work and their  support, and their staff also, and the committee.
