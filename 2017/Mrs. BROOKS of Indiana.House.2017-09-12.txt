 Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the  gentleman from Tennessee's amendment.   As a democracy founded on the belief in the rule of law, I am a proud  co-chair of the House Access to Civil Legal Services Caucus with my  colleague from Massachusetts (Mr. Kennedy).   I believe we have an obligation to ensure that all Americans have  access to legal representation in order to uphold the values upon which  our Nation was founded: equality and justice under our laws. This  amendment will ensure that Legal Services Corporation can continue  supporting those values by providing legal support to the millions of  Americans who would otherwise go without it whenever they might face  serious legal challenges.
