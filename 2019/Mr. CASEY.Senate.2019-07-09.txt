 Madam President, I rise this evening to talk about  judicial nominations and, in my view, the state of play, where we are.  I want to highlight some of the very real impacts these nominations  have on Americans across the board.   We have had a number of opportunities this year to come together and  have agreement on some judicial nominations, but, frankly, this year-- the last several years--this issue has been the subject of conflict and  sometimes rancor and division on the Senate floor and in the committee,  the committee of jurisdiction, the Judiciary Committee.   I have raised concerns about the willingness of Senate Republicans to  dismantle longstanding Senate rules but also Senate norms, all in a  rush to pack the bench with nominees who are often both ideological and  also, in some cases--not in all but in some cases--both too ideological  and often unqualified.   Early this afternoon, the Senate voted to confirm Daniel Aaron Bress  to a Ninth Circuit seat in California. I will talk about his nomination  just by way of example, not by way of argument before a confirmation  vote because that has passed.   I think his nomination and confirmation are another example of the  decline of the Senate's once-proud traditions relating to judicial  nominations.   He was opposed by both of his home State Senators. Both Senator  Feinstein and Senator Harris did not return a blue slip for Daniel  Aaron Bress.   The blue slip, as many people know, is literally a single piece of  paper where Senators sign their name and then check off whether they  support or oppose, as a way to have consensus between Senators from  their home State, and it has always been accorded respect and deference  in this Chamber, but that has all changed now.   In this case, you had a California nomination--I will get to that  part of it in a moment--where, as I said, both Senators did not return  blue slips. In this case, in particular, I think it is particularly  offensive because Senator Feinstein is the ranking member of the  committee.   For those who don't pay attention to all this terminology, ``ranking  member'' is the top person in one party who is not the chairman or  chairwoman, as the case may be.   So as the top Democrat, the ranking member of the Senate Judiciary  Committee, her opposition to Judge Bress should be an important factor  in his nomination and confirmation.   Prior to this administration, the Judiciary Committee had never held  a hearing for a nominee from the ranking member's home State without  his or her support. Again, that has all changed just recently.   Prior rules and norms have not stopped Republicans in the Senate from  pushing extreme and sometimes corporate nominees through this process,  especially at the circuit court level.   In a recent press release, Senator Feinstein and Senator Harris  explained that they opposed Judge Bress in part because he had so few  connections to California. He lived in California for only 1 year since  graduating from high school, he has not voted in California in an  election for over a decade, and the California bar lists him as a  Washington, DC, attorney.   I mention that because that should be relevant. When a home State  Senator--in this case, two home State Senators, one of whom is the top  Democrat on the Judiciary Committee--I think in that case there should  be deference paid to that kind of concern that is raised. After all,  they both represent their State.   As I mentioned earlier, the blue slip process is predicated on the  idea that home State Senators are more familiar than anyone else with  their State's legal community. I think that goes without saying. They  serve an important role in nominating individuals to serve and  represent the State.   Judge Bress is an example of why the blue slip process is so  important. He is not part of the California legal community. Despite  objections of the Senators, he will now sit on the Ninth Circuit Court  of Appeals and decide cases for a State with over 39 million residents  at last count.   Without blue slips, what would prevent a California judge from being  nominated to a court in another State? What would happen if you had  someone from a different State, who had very little ties to a State, be  nominated and confirmed, for example, to serve in a State like  Pennsylvania? It doesn't make a lot of sense to most people. It is a  norm that should not be violated.   His nomination illustrates how the blue slip process has been  eviscerated, especially for the circuit courts, which is something that  I had some firsthand experience with. I did not return a blue slip on  one nominee who was confirmed, and in the second case, there was a  hearing scheduled over my objections by way of not returning a blue  slip.   That experience that I had as a Senator whose blue slip and the  deference that should be paid as part of that blue slip process--that  circumstance in my case is at variance with my experience for district  court judges.   Senator Toomey and I--my colleague from Pennsylvania--have worked  together to jointly recommend experienced, consensus nominees for the  Federal district courts in Pennsylvania. We have three districts--the  Eastern District, the Middle District, and the Western District.   Unfortunately, this bipartisan district court process has become the  exception, not the rule. It used to pertain here in the Senate, where  every State had some kind of process by which nominees were presented  for confirmation by their home State Senators, and the White House--the  administration--in every case would pay deference to that.   That is exceedingly rare today. I am thankful we have maintained it  so far in Pennsylvania with regard to the work Senator Toomey and I do  together and our staffs do together to reach consensus. It doesn't  always work, by the way, but usually no one hears about the ones who  don't work out because we keep that to ourselves and move on to the  next person and see if we can't reach consensus. I appreciate that. I  think we are either at 19 or 20 judges confirmed since 2011, working  together, and I hope we can maintain that so that at least--at least-- the blue slip process can be respected for district court nominees.   I think people who elect us in our home States expect that. They  expect us to work together and to try to reach consensus where we can.  Sometimes it is not possible, but they do expect us to do that. If  there is an expectation of consensus and bipartisan cooperation  [[Page S4741]]  that adheres to or is expected of Senators, then there ought to be  institutional support for that here in the Senate and by the  administration. As I mentioned, that is not the case today, at least as  it relates to the appeals court, the circuit courts around the country.   This has relevance, of course, not just to process and norms and  traditions; that is in and of itself important. It is of even greater  significance when you consider the issues these courts will deal with.   Just today, for example, there was oral argument before the Fifth  Circuit Court of Appeals in the Texas v. United States case--a  monumental case that has the potential to cause millions of Americans  to lose coverage. We know that because we know that since the  Affordable Care Act was passed, more than 20 million people have gained  coverage, the larger share of that being people who gained coverage  through the expansion of Medicaid.   If that case were to be successful--a case brought by Republican  attorneys general from around the country and then later opposed by  Democratic attorneys general--if that case is successful, as it was at  the district court level, 20 million people stand to lose their  coverage, and a much larger number--depending on which number is on the  record currently, but at least 150 million-plus Americans have  protections today because of the Affordable Care Act, like the  protection if you have a preexisting condition protection.   Under the old system, the old rules, the old law, you could be denied  treatment or coverage because you have a preexisting condition. That  was happening routinely. That is no longer the law today. The law today  is that if you have a preexisting condition, you can still get  coverage. As I said, that would be at risk for something north of 150  million Americans. Some of the data tells us the numbers are equally  substantial when it comes to different parts of the law and those who  are adversely or potentially adversely affected.   If you had to step back and summarize where we have been in the last  more than--just about 2\1/2\ years now since the Trump administration  came into office, working with House Republicans and Senate  Republicans, you have had a campaign--really a constant campaign of  what I would argue is about three things, and maybe not only three but  at least three: ripping away coverage; decimating the Medicaid Program  or at least attempting to over and over again; and thirdly, sabotage-- sabotage mostly by the administration itself but also supported by  Republicans here in the Congress. That sabotage has been,  unfortunately, successful.    As of January, for example, the Gallup organization released data  that said the number of Americans--I am reading from the first line of  a news story from the publication Vox. The headline is ``Under Trump,  the number of uninsured Americans has gone up by 7 million.'' The sub- headline is ``Even in a strong economy, Americans are losing their  health coverage.'' This is an article written by Sarah Kliff--someone  who spends a lot of time writing about and analyzing healthcare as an  issue. It is dated January 23, 2019. I will read just the first two  sentences: ``The number of Americans without health insurance has  increased by 7 million since President Donald Trump took office, new  Gallup data released Wednesday shows.'' Again, this is a January 2019  story. It goes on from there to say: ``The country's uninsured rate has  steadily ticked upward since 2016, rising from a low of 10.9 percent in  late 2016 to 13.7 percent--a four-year high.''   So at the end of 2016, at the beginning of the Trump administration,  the uninsured rate was 10.9. At the end or the latter part of 2018,  going into 2019, it stood at 13.7. So Gallup tells us that 7 million  more people do not have healthcare who had it when the President  started his administration.   A number of organizations have catalogued recent analyses of the  potential threats that could impact communities if this Texas v. United  States case were successful. I will mention again for the record that  the litigants--the ones who were bringing the case, these Republican  attorneys general--prevailed at the district court level. Now it is on  appeal at the circuit court, and, in my judgment, it is probably more  likely than not that they will prevail at that level too. Then, of  course, the only option would be the Supreme Court, and I don't have a  lot of confidence that this Supreme Court would rule against that case,  which would result in chaos. That is a terrible understatement for what  would happen when 20 million people potentially lose their coverage and  tens and tens of millions more lose the protections they enjoy now,  especially those against the denial of treatment or coverage because  that individual has a preexisting condition.   Here are the numbers, just to remind folks. Everyone has heard the  number nationally. One hundred thirty-three million Americans, roughly,  have a preexisting condition. In my home State of Pennsylvania, that  number is a little more than 5.3 million people. Those numbers are  terribly high, but I think the one really making an impression on me  and I hope on others--especially those in Pennsylvania--is the number  of children in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania who have a preexisting  condition. Six hundred forty-two thousand seven hundred Pennsylvania  children have a preexisting condition--642,700. No action by the U.S.  Congress, by the administration, or by a court should ever result in  any child being denied coverage or treatment because of a preexisting  condition--any child but let alone numbers that are so high and so  offensive to even consider that number of children or any portion of  that number could be denied coverage.   The only number I will emphasize tonight is 642,700 Pennsylvania  children with a preexisting condition. I won't go through all the  numbers because I know we are here late tonight, but another number  that jumps out at me--and this number comes from a document published  by Protect Our Care telling us in a publication today that when you  consider the doughnut hole coverage, meaning that the Affordable Care  Act began to fill the coverage gap when older Americans were paying for  prescription drugs and often paying exorbitant prices for prescription  drugs--the Affordable Care Act began to chip away at that number, so  much and in such a substantial fashion that the average senior, since  the Affordable Care Act was passed--and this is the period of time  between 2010 and 2016--that seniors gained $2,272 on average, almost  $2,300 per senior to help them with their prescription drug costs by  helping to fill that so-called doughnut hole, which is a very benign  way to talk about a terrible coverage gap that burdens a lot of older  Americans. In Pennsylvania, that number is lower, but it was still more  than $1,100 per person.   All of that will be at risk if this case is successful. Just like the  protections for preexisting conditions are at risk, the support that  has been available up until the recent past for prescription drug  coverage for seniors--that support potentially could go away  completely. So seniors will again potentially be footing the bill if  this lawsuit is successful.   Two more, just for the record. Access to treatment would be in  jeopardy for some 800,000 people with opioid use disorder issues. We  know there are a huge number of Americans who have a substance use  disorder issue, often an addiction. A subcategory of that--probably the  biggest subcategory--are those with an opioid addiction. That has hurt  families of all kinds--rich and poor, north and south, no matter where  you live--east, west, rural, urban, suburban. It knows no bounds.   A lot of that support has come from the support for quality treatment  that folks need to lift themselves out of the grip of an addiction. A  lot of that support comes from Medicaid expansion. Whether it is the  repeal bills that were promoted on the Senate floor over and over again  or whether it is the lawsuit that could have as devastating of an  impact on healthcare as any repeal bill would, no matter where you  turn, in terms of Republican healthcare bills and this lawsuit, you can  see the adverse impact on Medicaid expansion.   Virtually every one of them not only wants to cut Medicaid expansion,  in most of the Republican bills, they want to eliminate it over time-- completely eliminate Medicaid expansion. Somehow it was wrong. I have  to ask why.  [[Page S4742]]  Why was it wrong that millions of people got their healthcare through  an expansion of Medicaid? Why would anyone ever doubt that someone next  to you who doesn't have coverage, first and foremost, and might have an  opioid addiction problem is getting coverage, and because they have  insurance coverage, they can get treatment for that terrible scourge  our country is going to be dealing with for decades--why is that the  wrong thing to do? How would taking that coverage away from someone  with an opioid problem advance the interests of the American people?  The answer is, it wouldn't. The answer is, it would set back the  efforts to deal with a whole host of folks out there who are getting  treatment today solely, completely, because of Medicaid expansion.   The last thing I will mention is our rural areas. I represent a State  that has 67 counties, and 48 of them are rural. A lot of the rural  hospitals in those communities are already teetering on the edge of  collapse and have been for years--not just the last several years but  for many years.   One of the fastest ways to ensure that more rural hospitals would  close and collapse is to cut Medicaid or to take away Medicaid  expansion. That has an adverse impact, the likes of which we can't even  begin to calculate because folks in rural Pennsylvania will lose  coverage if you decimate Medicaid or you take away Medicaid expansion,  but that doesn't end there.   A lot of folks in those communities are getting treatment for an  addiction issue or something related. They will be adversely impacted;  their families will; their communities will, but it doesn't stop there  in a rural area.   In a lot of these rural areas in my home State--and it is true all  across the country--the biggest employer, or at least the second or  third biggest employer, is often a hospital. In my State, there are  probably 25 counties where the top employer in those 48 rural  counties--about half of them, roughly--the No. 1 and No. 2 employer is  a hospital. So cutting Medicaid or eliminating Medicaid expansion or  sabotaging the health insurance markets or taking away the coverage of  the Affordable Care Act has healthcare consequences, has opioid  addiction treatment consequences, and of course has a job consequence  as well. If you cut Medicaid in a lot of rural areas, you are going to  lose a lot of jobs. It is as simple as that, as devastating as it is.   So we have a long way to go to make progress on healthcare. I hope--I  hope--my Republican friends will come together with us and work on  lowering the cost of healthcare and lowering the cost of prescription  drugs, but they don't seem to be that interested in that. Some are,  intermittently, once in a while, but they don't seem to be interested  because there is an obsession in the Senate, on the Republican side,  with decimating the Medicaid Program, ending Medicaid expansion, and  completely wiping out all the gains of the Affordable Care Act.   That would be bad enough, but it is doubly worse or it is doubly  insulting, I should say, when there is no plan for replacement. So what  if a court of law, what if a Federal court in the Fifth Circuit, in the  next couple of months, says the moving party here, the party that wants  to declare the Affordable Care Act unconstitutional--declares the  moving party is the prevailing party, that they win? Let's say it  doesn't go to the Supreme Court, but even if it does, let's say it  loses there. What happens then to those 20 million people who got  coverage? What happens to the 150 million-plus who have coverage today,  protections today, who did not have it before the Affordable Care Act?  They were paying their premiums for years, if not decades. They had  coverage for years, if not decades. Their children were maybe covered  in their employer-sponsored plan, but in many cases--maybe not in every  case--they didn't have much protection from preexisting conditions.  They didn't have protections against lifetime limits or caps on the  treatment you can get in a year or over a lifetime.   We had the bizarre and insulting and degrading experience, where  women were discriminated against by the insurance companies because  they were women. Being a woman was actually, in a sense, a preexisting  condition. That made no sense. Are we going to go back to those days  because a group of attorneys general wanted to change the law, and they  couldn't prevail on the Senate floor, or they couldn't prevail over  time in the House, or by way of what the administration would do, so  they went into court, and they are going to wipe out coverage for tens  and tens of millions of Americans? Is that a good thing for America? I  don't think so. I think that sends everything in the wrong direction.   Unfortunately, that is not just theory. Some of it is already  happening. As I said before, Gallup tells us that 7 million fewer  people have healthcare today, or at least as of January, than did two  Januarys before that. So we have a long way to go to make progress on  healthcare, but we are not going to make much progress around here if  we have a continual fight. I hope some will agree to set aside the  fight about repeal and lawsuits taking away coverage. Let's work  together to lower costs, and let's work together to lower the costs of  prescription drugs, in particular, because I have to answer to a lot of  families.   One of them is Matt Stefanelli, a young man we just spoke to today  talking about his children. Matt's son has type 1 diabetes. We are from  the same home county. He is worried not only about his own healthcare,  but he is worried about his son's healthcare. We have an answer, and  the answer is to respond to families like Matt's.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
