 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize an  outstanding group of young citizens from Bucks County, Pennsylvania,  who are actively living out their faith and making our community a  better place.   Earlier this year, members of the Newtown Quaker Meeting helped raise  $1,665 for the Mercer Street Friends' Community Schools through a  lasagna dinner held at the Newtown Friends Meetinghouse. The youth  collected voluntary donations, served the meal, and cleaned up after  dinner.   This exemplary act of community service is the norm, not the  exception, for young members of Newtown Quaker Meeting.   Previously held lasagna dinners have raised funds for Penndel Food  Pantry, Heifer International, Haiti Relief, and Save Darfur, among  other organizations. By serving simple meals twice a year, they have  now raised over $28,000 for charity over a 10-year period.   Mr. Speaker, I applaud the work of these children, their parents, and  congregants of the Newtown Quaker Meeting. I would like to particularly  thank members of the Children's Religious Education Committee of  Newtown Meeting, including Sarah Buxton, Eileen Grant, and Kelly Lake  for all of their work.                         In Memory of Malcolm Crooks     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and  memory of a resident of Bucks County, Pennsylvania, who passed away  last month at the age of 96.   Malcolm Crooks, a lifelong resident of Solebury Township, was a noted  environmental and conservation leader. He was the founding member of  the Honey Hollow and Aquetong Watershed Associations and was a member  of the first Solebury Township Planning Commission. He also served on  numerous boards that promoted environmental protection, including those  of the Bucks County Audubon Society and the Bucks County Planning  Commission.   A man of devout faith, Malcolm was a member of Solebury Friends  Meeting, and in the 1960s, he moved to Algeria and led a team of  Quakers to assist local residents. Throughout his life, Malcolm and his  wife, Elaine, continued to travel the globe and immerse themselves in  world cultures.   Mr. Speaker, Malcolm made our community a better place. Generations  will continue to experience the beauty of our home because of his  selfless work.   I send my prayers and condolences to Malcolm's wife and his  children--Sylvia, Malcolm, and Catherine--along with his entire family.                          In Memory of Pete Rossetti     Mr. Speaker, it is with a heavy heart that I rise  today to honor the life and memory of an American patriot from Bucks  County, Pennsylvania, who passed away on June 5 at the age of 96. Pete  Rossetti, a resident of Southampton, lived a life in service to our  country and our community.   Born in Philadelphia, Pete served honorably in the United States Navy  during World War II. He earned the American Theater, European Theater  Combat Medal and was also a Purple Heart recipient. In January, Pete  was awarded the French Legion of Honor Medal, the highest French  military distinction, for his service. Pete served in several campaigns  during the war, including the invasion of Sicily, Salerno, Angelo, and  Normandy.   A graduate of Temple University, Pete earned a degree in business  administration from Temple University, and he later worked as an  employee benefit consultant.   Mr. Speaker, I send my deepest condolences to Pete's children--Donna,  Sandra, Carla, Joseph, and Mary Ellen--along with the entire Rossetti  family. May they take comfort that he is now reunited with Annette and  enjoying his eternal reward.                            ____________________
