 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the groundbreaking  contributions of the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope and Submillimeter  Array, located on the 13,803-foot summit of Mauna Kea on my home island  in Hawaii, and to celebrate their contributions to a truly  international effort producing the first-ever image of a black hole.   Part of the Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration, the JCMT and SMA  joined six other telescopes around the globe to form an Earth-sized  telescope of unprecedented power and resolution able to photograph the  supermassive black hole in the M87 galaxy. Hawaii's key contribution  was to place world-class telescopes in the middle of the Pacific Ocean.   Astronomers partnered with renowned Hawaiian language and cultural  practitioner Dr. Larry Kimura to suggest the Hawaiian name ``Powehi,''  meaning embellished dark source of unending creation.   These Hawaii observatories pioneered the study of black holes, and  thanks to powerful new capabilities, perfect conditions atop Mauna Kea,  and dedicated personnel, we can all look forward to more of JCMT and  SMA's cutting-edge discoveries in the future, in addition to the  continued growth and reputation of Hawaii as a world leader in  exploring our heavens.                            ____________________
