 Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the  Balanced Budget Amendment.   This Monday, we heard that federal deficits are going to be almost $2  trillion more over the next decade than previously projected. While  there is more than one reason for our exploding deficit, the GOP's tax  reform bill increased our deficit by almost 20 percent.   Last fall, I and many of my colleagues voiced our fears that the so- called party of fiscal conservatism was going to try to pay for their  tax bill by gutting Medicare and Social Security.   I agree with the amendment's authors that Congress urgently needs to  address our debt. If Congress advanced a carefully structured balanced  budget amendment, with waivers to allow fast action to stabilize the  markets in the event of a financial crisis like the one we faced just a  few short years ago, and with waivers to allow us to fulfill the  promises that we have already made to our country's senior citizens, I  would support it.   But this amendment does not do that. It endangers our long-term  prosperity in order to pay short-term lip service to fiscal  responsibility.   I do not support potentially pulling the rug out from under Americans  counting on their Medicare and Social Security benefits, who have been  relying on the promises our government made to them for their whole  lives. I do not support action that increases the likelihood that our  country will be plunged once again into recession, endangering markets  and economies worldwide. And I do not agree that the cost of larger tax  breaks for multinational companies or of other fiscal decisions made by  Congress should be borne by our country's elderly and sick.   I ask my colleagues to vote to protect our constituents from an  economic crisis that could be far worse than the one we suffered in  2008, and to join me in voting against this amendment.
