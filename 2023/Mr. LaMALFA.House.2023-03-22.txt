 Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak about an extremely  important topic that is very current and very disturbing in our Nation,  in our Nation's schools, and the relationship of parents and their  kids.   Mr. Speaker, during the COVID lockdowns, schools were closed, and  much of the learning was conducted online, except for those courageous  schools that did manage to stay open and teach their kids the normal  way.   During this time, parents gained a valuable opportunity to see  firsthand what their children were being taught in public schools, and  in some cases, what is in their libraries.   What they found was very shocking to them. We heard a conversation a  bit earlier about, Oh, this is banning books.   If you see the content that is in some of the books, some of the so- called educational materials, it is really nothing short of pornography  that is being allowed to be in there.   Mr. Speaker, when did it become okay for kids to be subject to that  kind of material or the performances that are being brought to their  libraries under the guise of openness where it wouldn't be really any  different than what is going on in a strip club?   You would get in big trouble should you take your kid to one of  those. How is that allowed to be normalized these days?   Rather than teaching children the skills that they need and the  knowledge to become successful adults, these activists, whether it is  teachers, counselors, superintendents, they are filling their heads  with this woke far-left propaganda and pushing radical gender ideology  on children as young as elementary age.   In response to the backlash, teachers and public school  administrators have attempted to keep this indoctrination and these  agendas secret from their parents. Unbelievable.   This included helping encourage students to keep secrets from their  parents, hiding their lesson plans and curriculums, trying to ban  recording in the classroom, obfuscating what materials are being shown  to students, and shutting down parents who spoke out at public school  meetings when they heard about this, even so far as having the U.S.  Department of Justice refer to them as terrorists.   They asserted time and again that parents did not have the right to  be involved in their children's education. They claimed that once  children walked through the schoolhouse door, those children belonged  to the State.   What is that? Where are the echoes of that coming from?   In 2021, parents across the country revolted at school board meetings  and  [[Page H1306]]  gathered to make their concerns heard in free assembly, a First  Amendment protection.   In Loudoun County, Virginia, a father of a young girl who had been  assaulted by a biological male was arrested for speaking out against  the school board's decision to hide the perpetrator's history of  assault against young girls. That decision put his innocent daughter  and countless other students at risk.   In my own district in Northern California, a school district was  caught secretly changing a young girl's name and pronouns and even  encouraging that something was wrong with her body--she was in the  wrong body--filling her head with falsehoods. The counselor who  encouraged this activity allegedly manipulated the young girl to keep  her transitioning secret from her own mother.   In both cases, parents rightfully pushed back against these assiduous  attempts of public schools to force woke gender ideology on their  children.   Unfortunately, parents across the country have been met with State  force when they have tried to assert their rightful place as the  supreme authority in their children's lives.   The Department of Justice infamously circulated a memo calling  parents who exercise these rights as ``domestic terrorists.''   As Americans gradually become aware of the rotten corruption that  permeates so much of our public school system, it became clear that  Congressional Republicans needed to take action to support parents  across the Nation and enshrine protections against government  retaliation.   Last Congress, I introduced two bills: one that prohibits doctors  from performing gender reassignment surgeries on minors and another  allowed victims of these life-altering procedures to sue those who  pushed these surgeries on them as minors.   These permanent, life-altering surgeries are being forced onto  vulnerable children by radical activists. Mutilating a child's body is  not medicine. It is not science. It is not affirming, nor is it care.    As we have seen in the recent exposure of the inside workings of a  Missouri clinic, children manipulated into undertaking these surgeries  are not informed about the life-altering damage being done to their  bodies. They are being rushed through the process, and in the worst  cases are outright lied to by the people who are somehow going to make  their lives better or more in order, and that they know better who  should be taking care of them instead of their parents when this harm  is being caused.   Doing this to a child is immoral, and it should be punished with the  full force of the law. Children whose lives are permanently altered due  to these surgeries should be allowed to sue for damages and put parents  back at their rightful place, their God-given right to oversee their  children's education, their well-being, their health, and their bodies.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, this week is National Ag Week. It is a time  where America honors and gives thanks to her farmers, ranchers, and ag  workers. Without their hard work, dedication, and ingenuity, our Nation  would not enjoy the rich bounty of food they grow.  [[Page H1308]]    However, there are daunting issues that face our agricultural sector:  Fuel, water supply--especially in my home State of California; although  right now, we are very grateful for the massive rain--market  conditions, and the trade commitments being enforced, such as the  deficit we have with China.   Agriculture is essential to the economic well-being of my district,  northern California, and the West.   California farmers rely on an abundance of water and low fuel prices  to grow the crops we eat.   The last several years have seen fields go fallow because  California's broken water management system has not been able to  deliver the water that was needed.   Indeed, if we don't have the water supply, these crops that America  receives so much of from California would not be grown, they would need  to be imported or not have them at all.   It is in America's best interest to pursue permitting reform and  unleash our domestic energy potential.   We celebrate National Ag Week in order to keep Americans working,  fed, and our farmers in the fields.                            ____________________
