 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Yeadon Police  Department, which recently started the first police-community garden in  the country as part of an ongoing program to develop positive  relationships between police and community members.   The garden gives officers and residents an opportunity to meet in a  cooperative environment, to open lines of communication and foster  understanding.   Officers and residents work together in the garden throughout the  growing season, and the food grown there is shared with those who work  the soil, as well as area food banks. They hope to start six or seven  more gardens through the community.   The mayor of Yeadon, Rohan Hepkins, says that his community has seen  a decrease in crime during the pandemic. He credits police outreach  efforts, including the department's reliance on community-oriented  policing and outreach to the school district and younger folks so that  they look at the police not as enemies but as allies.   I commend Police Chief Anthony ``Chachi'' Paparo and Mayor Hepkins  for their efforts to improve community policing and to ensure that  everyone in the community feels safe.                            ____________________
