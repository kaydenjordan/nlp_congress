 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Mayor  Raymond Bagshaw, who passed away March 10.   Mayor Bagshaw's service to our community and to helping small  businesses was unwavering. As the mayor of the city of Edgewood, he  brought what was called boundless ingenuity to his city where he  started numerous projects, including transforming a vacant, desolate  lot into a beautiful park. Today, the park, which bears his name, hosts  numerous events and family-filled activities.   A true public servant, Mayor Bagshaw was never afraid to roll up his  sleeves and work in the trenches. During natural disasters, it was  natural for him to pitch in to clean up debris or direct traffic around  downed power lines.   Mr. Speaker, I join Mayor Bagshaw's family, the city council, and  citizens of Edgewood in celebrating his life and legacy and thanking  him for a job well done.                            ____________________
