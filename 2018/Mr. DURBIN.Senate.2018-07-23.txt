 I announce that the Senator from Ohio (Mr. Brown), is  necessarily absent.    Mr. President, last July, heavy rain in Illinois caused  severe flooding that led the Governor to declare disaster areas in  Lake, McHenry, Kane, and Cook Counties. Thousands of buildings,  including homes, businesses, and schools, were damaged by floodwaters.  Thankfully, there were no fatalities as a result of this historic  flooding.   Lake County was one of the areas most impacted by the flooding. When  I visited two towns in this area--Libertyville and Gurnee--I saw street  after street of flood damage to homes and businesses. It was  heartbreaking.   I spoke with residents who were concerned about being able to recover  from the flood and resulting damages and who voiced the need to find  long-term solutions that will mitigate the impact of future flood  events.   One year later, I am still awed by the dedication of the local first  responders and county officials. State and local employees and  volunteers came out to help at every level, from county emergency  management agencies to the American Red Cross. Representatives from the  Illinois Emergency Management Agency worked closely with local  officials to make sure communities had the resources needed to protect  critical infrastructure and clean up when the water began to recede.   People from all around the region pitched in to help their neighbors  and even strangers protect property and get back on their feet.   It has been challenging for Illinois to receive Federal aid after a  disaster occurs. I led the Illinois delegation in supporting the  Governor's request for a Federal disaster declaration for the four  impacted counties, but unfortunately, the State did not receive aid  after the flooding last July.   Currently, FEMA considers State population when reviewing States'  requests for Federal assistance following a disaster. This puts highly  populous States like Illinois at a disadvantage, relying on the premise  that they can absorb more recovery costs after a disaster. Despite  that, my colleagues in Congress and I will always stand ready to do  whatever we can to provide Federal assistance to assist Illinois  communities.   I introduced a bill to fix FEMA's disaster declaration formula--the  Fairness in Federal Disaster Declarations Acts--and I will continue to  push this bill to try and help States, both small and large, in times  of need. Families in Illinois deserve a fair and transparent disaster  declaration process that allows them to access Federal resources when  they are needed most.   I want to thank everyone who was engaged in the response and  mitigation efforts, and all those who were part of the recovery efforts  since last July. Illinoisans always come together and rebuild, as we  have done, and we are stronger for it.                            ____________________
