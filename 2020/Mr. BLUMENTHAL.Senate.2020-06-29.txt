 I am honored to follow the Senator from Nevada who  knows so well the importance of public service and public servants.   One of the reasons why we are here is because many of those public  servants doing such great service for our communities will be laid off  or furloughed to the detriment of their communities and their States.  As the Senator knows in Nevada, and I know in Connecticut, what is  necessary for them to continue their work is, in fact, the Heroes Act.   We have been talking a lot about the frontline workers, the heroes,  like first responders, police, firefighters, the doctors and nurses,  the grocery checkers, the delivery people far and wide, high and low.  They have been doing great work. Many of them are going to be directly  affected if we fail to pass the Heroes Act. Many of them and their work  will be for naught if we fail to support the Heroes Act and enable  State and local government to continue to employ them and support them.   I have been traveling across the State of Connecticut over these last  2\1/2\ months. What I have found is unparalleled hardship and  heartbreak.   Yesterday, I visited a small business, a restaurant in Norwalk called  No Leftovers, offering Caribbean food. It has been in business for 3  years. Its owner has received no Paycheck Protection Program funding,  and it is hanging by a thread. That story is repeated again and again  and again.   One of the reasons he is so fearful about the future is that zoning  in Norwalk has been delayed because people are not at work. What  happens to Norwalk and its Zoning and Land Use Department if there is  no money to pay for it? That story writ large is about the future of  America and the American dream that No Leftovers and small businesses  like his exemplify, and it is a Black-owned business. The tragedy of  the Black-owned businesses going under is one of the unwritten stories  of this pandemic. Forty-one percent have failed during this pandemic-- often through no fault of those business owners--because they face this  economic crisis, and they face the loss of service if State and local  governments, in effect, have to cut their workforces and their services  to those businesses. This is not only Black-owned but businesses owned  across the board by all Americans and employing Americans.   Small businesses, as we know, no matter who owns them, are the major  job creators today in the United States. There are linkages here, as I  have been hearing. I go around the State talking to those business  owners--not only the big contractors, the defense providers, like  Sikorsky and Pratt & Whitney, but their supply chain. Those small- and  medium-sized businesses will be disastrously affected by a failure to  keep faith, move forward, and pass the Heroes Act.   Those frontline workers deserve the Heroes Fund--hazardous duty pay  up to $25,000, retroactive to the beginning of this national emergency.  Again, recognizing public service, not only rewarding it but also  retaining and recruiting more of them.   State and local governments depend on those frontline workers whom we  talk so glowingly about. Now is our chance to put the money where our  mouth is, and we have not only a moral obligation, we have an economic  duty and a patriotic duty as we go into July 4.   Finally, let me just say--and I said it last week--that the U.S.  Senate is about to leave town for 2 weeks, wanting America to believe  that we have done our job. The fact is, we will have failed to have  done our job unless we will have acted on the Heroes Act. Failing to  act on the Heroes Act is an abrogation of our duty. We cannot go back  and talk about the spirit of the Fourth of July and about the  resilience and resoluteness of the Founders if we cannot be  sufficiently determined to do our job here.   That aid to State and local governments is not a matter of  convenience or luxury; it is a necessity for us to finance the public  health departments that conduct testing and contact tracing as well as  those economic development departments and land use departments,  health, firefighting, policing, teaching. These are the core functions  of our government, and there will be layoffs--massive layoffs--across  the country if we fail to do our job.   I have been reading a book called ``The Great Influenza'' by John  Barry. One of the lessons of that pandemic is that the failure to tell  the truth is itself a failure that can lead to disaster. It can spawn  fear and even terror. It can lead to complacency and inaction.   The failure to tell the truth is all too common these days with  regard to this pandemic. The numbers tell, with much greater accuracy,  the story of this pandemic than what we have been hearing from the  White House. Yet now we have an obligation to make sure the truth is  told, and that means facing the obligation to act. The way we can act  is on the Heroes Act. The way we can tell the truth is to squarely lay  before the American people what the challenges are and what the costs  will be if we fail to act.   The other great lesson of that book is of the failure by local health  departments and by local leaders to command the resources and devote  them to fighting the pandemic itself. This contributed to it. We need  to learn the lessons of history. They are sometimes so simple and  powerful that we look the other way.   Before we leave town, let us look squarely at the Heroes Act and do  the right thing--pass it and make sure that America moves forward to  conquer this public health emergency and economic crisis that has been  made all the more severe by the unfinished business of this country in  dealing with racism and discrimination. We have that opportunity. The  July 4 holiday should not be a time off; it ought to be a time on for  us to do the right thing, and it is on us.   I yield the floor                            ____________________
