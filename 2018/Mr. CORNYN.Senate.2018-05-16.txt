The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator  from Arizona (Mr. McCain).    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  resume legislative session for a period of morning business, with  Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, today our Democratic colleagues insisted  on an aimless vote on the issue of net neutrality. This is what has  been called by the Wall Street Journal a vague name which essentially  is cover for regulation of the internet like a utility under the  previous regime, which is the Obama-era regime.   Following the FCC issuance last December of the Restoring Internet  Freedom Order, our Democratic colleagues vowed to make net neutrality a  campaign issue.   To me, one of the most maddening things about the title ``net  neutrality'' is that this is the opposite of neutrality. This is all  about more regulation of the internet.   Oh, by the way, I noticed that the internet seemed to be working just  fine while this Restoring Internet Freedom Order by the FCC was in  effect.   How did they do this? By painting the FCC's decision as proof  somehow--and I am not really sure how, other than maybe gullible press  and people willing to just accept their argument at face value--that  some of us are against net neutrality. That is just not the case.   I believe the free market has done more to help the internet grow and  succeed as an engine of commerce and something that allows us to  communicate with our friends and family, share pictures and the like,  beyond our wildest dreams. I guess Thomas Friedman's book ``The World  is Flat'' talked about how one of the most important events in recent  history was the development of the world wide web in 1995. We have come  a long way since 1995, and the internet has succeeded beyond our  wildest dreams, which is the reason the last thing we should want is  the government to come in and inject itself with more controls.   We have always supported a free and open internet. Internet service  providers should not be able to block, slow, or otherwise unfairly  discriminate against any legal website or online service. In fact, it  was our Democratic colleagues who blocked Republicans from passing the  bill earlier today that would have prevented the internet service  providers from being able to do just that.   The issue up for debate this week, though, was how to classify these  providers for regulatory purposes, and here, there was a choice. Our  side of the aisle has long favored a light-touch approach that is  offered under title I of the Telecommunications Act. Our Democratic  friends favor a more onerous approach under title II. That is why they  favor repealing the FCC's recent order, returning to Depression-era  regulations implemented under the Obama administration.   Our Democratic colleagues have now gotten their wish, in a way. They  voted here in the Senate to repeal the current FCC order by using the  Congressional Review Act, which gives Congress the power to nullify  agency rules and requires only a simple majority to pass. But our  colleague, the senior Senator from South Dakota, is correct when he  refers to their stunt as ``political theater.'' It is merely a ``show  vote.''   First of all, even though our Democratic colleagues may have joined  together to win this vote on the Congressional Review Act in the  Senate, there is simply no indication that the House plans to take it  up or that the President would sign it if they did.   Second, contrary to supporters' claims, the resolution will not  ``restore'' net neutrality. In fact, it would accomplish the opposite.  This resolution would remove rightful oversight of noncompetitive  behavior and consumer protection from the Federal Trade Commission and,  instead, subject ISPs to oversight by the FCC, including regulations  regarding consumer data privacy, approval or disapproval of new  innovation, and dictating the terms and conditions of service. That  would create a major imbalance in our internet ecosystem between  content and platform regulation, as edge providers like Google and  Facebook would not be subject to the same standards as broadband  providers.    Finally, the resolution would increase the digital divide across  America, and that is no small matter. As Brent Wilkes, the former CEO  of LULAC, wrote recently in the Houston Chronicle, ``the CRA would . .  . reinstate Depression-era Title II rules that have not created the  open internet's engine of opportunity with a level playing field that  proponents envisioned.''   He went on to say: ``Placing the internet back under Title II rules  would . . . curb the critical infrastructure investment necessary for  connecting more Americans to high-speed broadband, including nearly 4  million Texans--about 15 percent of the state's population--who live in  rural communities that are difficult and costlier to connect.''   As I said when I began, I believe in an open and free internet, but  the vote we just held does not make the internet more open or more  free--just the opposite. Let's be blunt about it. This vote was simply  a waste of time.   The light-touch regulatory treatment of internet service providers  under the December 2017 FCC order was a return to the Clinton-era  environment that allowed the internet to innovate and thrive. Imposing  additional, stifling government regulations does not benefit consumers  in the long run and, instead, allows FCC bureaucrats to pick winners  and losers. That is why I opposed our Democratic colleagues' resolution  today.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on a separate note, for the last few days,  we have been celebrating National Police Week, when we honor the men  and women who help keep our communities safe. They have chosen a  difficult and often dangerous life, dedicated to enforcing the law,  defending our civil liberties, and protecting our cities and  neighborhoods.   Sometimes law enforcement officers intentionally put themselves in  harm's way for our benefit, and sometimes they even sacrifice their  lives for their fellow citizens. The police in my State are no  exception. In fact, according to one FBI report, Texas had more law  enforcement officers die in the line of duty in 2017 than any other  State.  [[Page S2711]]    Because it is National Police Week, I would like to mention two  important pieces of legislation that are high priorities for law  enforcement groups, and I am happy to be the chief sponsor of both.   The first is called the Justice Served Act. Its companion legislation  passed just yesterday in the House. I am grateful to my colleague  Representative  John Carter for helping to make sure that happened.   The bill would provide grants for State and local governments to  prosecute cold cases. These are older crimes that have languished but  are reignited through DNA evidence, including evidence obtained from  backlogged rape kits. By making sure that newly tested evidence is used  to investigate and prosecute unsolved crimes, the Justice Served Act  would ensure that vital criminals are brought to justice instead of  remaining free and on our streets. This will give crime victims and  their families closure and relief and deliver justice.   Once new DNA evidence is used and the wrongdoers are prosecuted, the  crime victims will know that their attackers no longer remain at large.  The evidence can also help exonerate those who have been wrongfully  accused or even convicted.   Especially this week, I am proud to have the support of the Major  County Sheriffs of America, the Fraternal Order of Police, the National  Association of Police Organizations, the Major Cities Chiefs, and other  law enforcement organizations. I am also grateful to have the support  of various organizations that support sexual assault victims, as well  as prosecutors' groups.   Finally, I would just like to say that I appreciate my cosponsor, the  senior Senator from Minnesota, who has helped this bill continue to  move through the legislative process.   Another bill I would like to mention as long as I can--seasonal  allergies are getting to me, like so many of us--is the Project Safe  Neighborhoods Authorization Act of 2018. We hope to have it hotlined  this week because, like the Justice Served Act, it is a high priority  for law enforcement groups across the country.   Project Safe Neighborhoods is a nationwide partnership among State,  Federal, local law enforcement, and prosecutors that use data-driven,  evidence-based, and trauma-informed practices to reduce violent crime.   When I was the attorney general of Texas, then-Governor George W.  Bush and I administered a program known as Texas Exile, in which we  targeted felons who were carrying firearms as part of their carrying  out some crime. We targeted those violent offenders by concentrating  resources on the most important cases. This program involved multiple  law enforcement agencies and allowed them to collaborate on a ``Smart  on Crime'' approach, focusing efforts on high-level offenders who were  responsible for tearing communities and families apart.   Multiple jurisdictions in Texas participated in Project Exile, which,  again, was focused on the most violent offenders and the ones who were  carrying firearms, which they could not legally possess or use. The  result was a staggering reduction in crime rates and homicides. Project  Exile later became the basis for the Department of Justice's nationwide  Project Safe Neighborhoods Program, which has been ongoing for more  than a decade. I am happy that soon we will reauthorize it.   Under Project Safe Neighborhoods, Federal, State, and local law  enforcement cooperate and focus their enforcement efforts on organized  criminal networks and repeat offenders who are driving crime rates in a  particular area. One of those regions is Northern Virginia, where a  regional task force composed of 13 local, State, and Federal law  enforcement agencies has made tremendous strides in eradicating gang  violence perpetrated by groups like MS-13. My colleague Barbara  Comstock's district is in that region, and she has been the bill's  biggest champion in the House.   Since its inception in 2001, Project Safe Neighborhoods has been  deployed by both Democratic and Republican administrations to reduce  violent crime. According to a Michigan State University study funded by  the Department of Justice in 2013, Project Safe Neighborhoods was  associated with a 13.1-percent decrease in violent crimes in cities  with high rates of program participation, including double-digit  reductions in total firearms, crimes, and homicides in every city  examined by the study.   Our bill will reauthorize the program through fiscal year 2021 in  amounts consistent with current appropriations levels. Additionally, it  will require participating entities to prioritize the investigation and  prosecution of individuals with leadership roles in criminal  organizations, and it will strengthen innovation and prevention  initiatives on the local level.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                  S. 2866         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.
