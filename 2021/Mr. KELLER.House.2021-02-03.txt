 Madam Speaker, since the Supreme Court wrongly decided  Roe v. Wade 48 years ago, we have lost 62 million lives to abortion.  Any loss of life to abortion is not only heartbreakingly preventable,  it is completely unacceptable in our modern society.   This pin, I always wear on my collar. These two little feet represent  the exact size and shape of a baby's feet 10 weeks after conception.  Every day, as I put this pin on my collar, I reflect on the millions of  lives cut short and the innovations, ideas, and improvements lost to  our world. If anything else was extinguishing life on the same scale as  abortion, every American would be up in arms fighting to right that  wrong.   Why is the sanctity of life any different?   As Members of Congress, if we are not willing to fight for life, then  what are we willing to fight for?   The Lord has blessed me with two children and now three  grandchildren. Every individual can attest to the indescribable feeling  of joy meeting a newborn for the first time and holding that child. Our  Creator has a plan for every single one of us, and I will work  tirelessly to ensure every life has the chance to realize its full  potential.
