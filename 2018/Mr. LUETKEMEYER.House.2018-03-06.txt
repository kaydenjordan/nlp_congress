 Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Hensarling for all his  great work and leadership on our Financial Services Committee and also  thank the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Loudermilk) for crafting a  commonsense, bipartisan bill that requires the Federal financial  regulators and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to conduct a  comprehensive review of all the regulations promulgated with the intent  of identifying those that are outdated or duplicative.   Across the Nation, financial companies continue to suffer as a result  of the burdensome regulations. What my friends on the other side of the  aisle don't always recognize is the impact that has on the ability of  those companies to serve their customers.   Take cybersecurity as an example. Financial firms of all sizes are  forced to adhere to an overlapping regulatory regime that is focused on  fighting yesterday's war.   I spoke with a major bank just last week that has cybersecurity  examinations from the Federal Reserve, the Comptroller of the Currency,  the FDIC, the Treasury Department, and multiple State banking agencies;  and that doesn't include the foreign entities that regulate the  international businesses of this bank. Each agency has a slightly  different exam process and requires slightly different information.    This type of regime doesn't protect companies from cybersecurity  threats. The lack of coordination means this institution spends more  time reacting to the regulators than it does protecting its customers.   Or look at the antiquated regime surrounding examination and  enforcement of the Bank Secrecy Act and anti-money laundering laws.  What was originally intended to be a reasonable process that fostered  collaboration between financial institutions and law enforcement to  root out bad actors and  [[Page H1388]]  illicit financing has become so onerous that banks are choosing to drop  customers or close entire books of businesses just to avoid compliance  burdens. Processes like these do very little to help consumers or the  integrity of the financial system.   Every time I speak to a bank or credit union in Missouri, I ask what  one rule or regulation they find to be the most burdensome or they  would like to see changed. The answer is always the same: It isn't just  one. It is the weight of all the rules combined that is restricting  credit and the availability of financial services in our communities.   We have to make a change, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Loudermilk's legislation  would institute a more thoughtful approach to regulations that will not  only offer regulatory relief, but also foster a more responsible and  stable financial marketplace.   As the gentleman from Georgia has said in the past, this bill isn't  just about regulatory relief; it is about good government. This should  not be a partisan exercise. I hope every Member of this body stands for  responsible government and joins me in supporting H.R. 4607 today.    Madam Speaker, I withdraw my reservation of a point  of order.    Madam Speaker, I claim the time in opposition.    Madam Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to  discuss this matter today.   It is kind of interesting that we have before us an amendment that  basically is something that deals with a financial services bill,  something that deals with a financial services issue, yet we had the  EPA and a whole bunch of other agencies brought into the discussion  here, which has nothing to do with what we are trying to talk about  here today.   The amendment talks about the President or his immediate family  members. How is it possible that, unless those family members have the  authority to make the request, they even should be considered?   This is sort of pulling things out of the air here that make no sense  to me. This is a very simple bill that we have where all we are looking  at trying to do is take the EGRPRA law that says that, every 10 years,  all the rules and regulations are reviewed.   All we are doing is putting two agencies back into this group of  agencies that are under review, one that was not even in existence at  the time of the bill's passage back in the nineties, the CFPB; and the  other one that needs to be included is the National Credit Union. All  we are doing is taking that 10-year review down to 7.   Why is this controversial? We are taking an agency that was not even  included in this originally and putting it under the purview of this  bill so that there can be a review of the rules and regulations.   Is there lack of transparency on the other side?   Do we no longer want to be concerned about what is going on?   Do we no longer want to know that the rules and regulations are  appropriately adjudicated here by these agencies?   I think that is the wrong way to go. I think that we need to have  more transparency. Reducing from 10 years down to 7 gives us an  opportunity to have a more constant review of these things to make sure  that the bureaucratic folks in the executive branch of the government  don't run away with what should be, in my view, the authority of the  Congress.                                time  1330    Madam Speaker, I think that the motion to recommit is way out of line  here, and I don't think we need to waste any more time on it.   Madam Speaker, I ask folks to decline the amendment, and I yield back  the balance of my time.
