 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 116,  the ``Investing in Main Street Act of 2019.''   H.R. 116 amends the Small Business Investment Act of 1958 to increase  the amount that certain banks and savings associations may invest in  small business investment companies, subject to the approval of the  appropriate Federal banking agency.   Texas has, for a historical fourth time, been ranked by CNBC as the  number one spot for ``America's Top States for Business.''   WalletHub also recognized Texas as a small business friendly state by  ranking Texas as the best state to start a business overall and giving  Texas first place in the business environment category which looks at  average growth in number of small businesses, growth of business  revenues, five-year business survival rate, and job growth, amongst  other categories.   Houston alone has almost 120,000 small business.   This makes Houston ninth nationwide and second statewide for total  number of small businesses.   These small businesses enjoy calling home the 13th friendliest city  in the nation for small business owners.   Over 99 percent of the businesses in Houston are considered small.  [[Page H524]]    4.0 GPA is one of the many Houston small business success stories.   Founded by Henry Keculah, Jr. in 2016, 4.0 GPA's mission is to  provide all students, regardless of their socioeconomic background,  with the opportunity to attend an institution of higher education.   Henry, Jr. was one of five 2018 Upstart Award Finalist.   Upstart awards recognize African-American entrepreneurs who run  successful companies and also give back to their communities.   H.R. 116 is common sense legislation that supports small business  like 4.0 GPA, and even the Chamber of Commerce has written in support  of it.   I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 116.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today to voice my support for  H.R. 430, the``TANF Extension Act of 2019,'' which extends the  Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program and related programs.   The bill authorizes activities outlined in part A of title IV and  section 1108(b) of the Social Security Act to continue through June 30,  2019, in the manner authorized for fiscal year 2018.   This extension is necessary so society's most vulnerable do not fall  through the cracks.   The Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program provides  critical funding to states' anti-poverty efforts.   It helps ensure that families in poverty with children can meet their  children's basic needs.   The TANF program, which is time limited, assists families with  children when the parents or other responsible relatives cannot provide  for the family's basic needs.   The Federal government provides grants to States to run the TANF  program.   These State TANF programs are designed to accomplish four goals:   To provide assistance to needy families so that children may be cared  for in their own homes or in the homes of relatives;   To end the dependency of needy parents on government benefits by  promoting job preparation, work, and marriage;   To prevent and reduce the incidence of out-of-wedlock pregnancies and  establish annual numerical goals for preventing and reducing the  incidence of these pregnancies; and   To encourage the formation and maintenance of two-parent families.   States have broad flexibility to carry out their programs.   The States, not the Federal government, decide on the design of the  program, the type and amount of assistance payments, the range of other  services to be provided, and the rules for determining who is eligible  for benefits.   These social safety net programs provide necessary government  assistance to help Americans families maintain a basic standard of  living, and are a safety net for the poorest of the poor.   Millions of Americans, despite working two jobs, depend on these  programs just to keep food on the table and a roof over their heads for  their families.   In addition, the vast majority of full-time workers live paycheck to  paycheck.   In fact, 70 percent of Americans rely on at least one means tested  federal program throughout their lives.   America, one of the richest countries in the world, should be able to  help families caught in, to use the celebrated LBJ biographer Robert  Caro's famous phrase, the ``tentacles of circumstance.''   However, we have an Administration that is sensitive to the plight of  every day Americans.   This Administration seeks to implement an agenda that reveals a  patently racist and inaccurate portrayal of poor people as lazy  ``Welfare Queens'' who would rather depend on the government than pull  themselves up by their bootstraps, but nothing could be further from  the reality that millions of Americans face.   Mr. Speaker, the President should know that it is unreasonable and it  is cruel to expect the poorest people to pull themselves up by their  bootstraps when they do not have boots.   Our nation's social safety net programs already fail to help all of  the families in need:   Only 1 in 4 poor families with children receive TANF;   The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) only provides  $1.40/per meal; and   Housing assistance reaches just 1 in 5 eligible families.   That is because the federal government has failed to raise the  minimum wage in almost a decade, so even if you work a full-time  minimum wage job, you are still living in poverty.   Members of the Congressional Black Caucus are here to tell the  American people, do not be fooled.   Donald Trump says this is about a ``poverty trap,'' but the real trap  is not raising the minimum wage.   Employers should be highly motivated to pay their employees a fair  amount so that every American can enjoy the opportunity to live with  dignity, with proper nutrition and proper health care.   A salary that is not commensurate with the current cost of living  prevents people from enjoying life with dignity, and that is NOT what  the American dream is about.   The President opposes increasing the minimum wage and eliminating  labor protections for middle and lower income workers in the African  American community.   Mr. Speaker, raising the minimum wage to just $12 per hour would save  $53 billion in SNAP benefits alone.   Wage gaps are larger today than they were in 1979.   For example, African American men's average hourly wages were 22.2  percent lower than those of white men in 1979 and declined to 31  percent lower by 2015.   Young African American women have been hardest hit since 2000.   Average wealth for white families is seven times higher than average  wealth for African American families.   Worse still, median white wealth (wealth for the family in the exact  middle of the overall distribution) is twelve times higher than median  African American wealth.   Wage gaps are growing primarily because of discrimination and racial  differences in skills and worker characteristics.   Declining unionization has also had a role in the growing black-white  wage gap, particularly for men newly joining the workforce.   African Americans have been disproportionately affected by the  growing gap between pay and productivity.   Not only are the President's policies divisive along racial and  cultural lines, they also serve to further increase economic inequality  due to their clear design in favor of the wealthiest among us at the  expense of everyone else.   Trump's billionaire tax heist robs the U.S. Treasury of $1.5 trillion  in resources that could be invested in economic growth in underserved  communities.   The President has proposed doubling down on the war on drugs, which  drains the African American labor pool.   The President has taken every opportunity to harm health care for  African-Americans from sabotaging the American Care Act to ending  Medicaid as we know it.   Trump also wants you to believe that he wants a bipartisan  infrastructure plan.   Do not be fooled.   Trump's review of ``welfare programs'' is an immoral attempt to gut  the programs that provide a basic standard of living for Americans  struggling to make ends meet, all to pay for  [[Page H534]]  massive tax cuts to himself and the richest 1 percent.   Instead, he should raise wages and invest in job training programs to  prepare Americans for the work of the future.   Mr. Speaker, our nation still has a long way to go before we achieve  economic equality for all its citizens.   The President and Congressional Republicans should work with  Democrats to put more money in the pockets of hardworking Americans.   At the end of the day, our constituents should be able to support  their children with one full-time job.   Ultimately, we need to give families the tools they need to rise out  of poverty, not undercut programs that keep them afloat.    Madam Speaker, as I entered Bush Intercontinental  Airport today, terminal B was shut down, shut down because, of course,  we do not have enough TSA officers, as the terminals were shut down in  Miami.   I understand the circumstances and the difficulties of these working  people in this crisis of no paycheck and no opportunity to pay their  bills.   At the same time, a headline in our local newspaper, ``Coast Guard  families left `in a fog,' ''--families who have little babies with  medical conditions, who cannot pay their bills. The reason, of course,  is the Coast Guard comes under Homeland Security.   And a President who has the audacity to say they can adjust, let them  adjust, where is the heart? Where is the recognition that we are  jeopardizing our skies with air traffic controllers who are overworked  and working overtime with no pay, TSA officers? I came home on Friday  and gathered with those.   What about a Federal employee couple who has indicated that they have  no ability to pay their bills and are taking money from their son's  scholarship fund?   Mr. President, open the government.   Finally, let me say to Mr. King, it is shameful, your words, and I  would offer that I join all of my colleagues in seeking censure.                            ____________________
