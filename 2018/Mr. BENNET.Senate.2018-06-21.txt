 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be  recognized for 2 minutes and that my colleague from Colorado, Senator  Gardner, also have 2 minutes.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to call up  amendment No. 2983.    Mr. President, each year, 230,000 men and women leave  military service. Many enter the civilian workforce. I know everyone in  this Chamber believes we can do a better job connecting our veterans  and transitioning servicemembers with rewarding and high-paying jobs.   I also know people in this Chamber agree that these men and women are  ideal employees for American businesses. They are highly trained, many  in advanced technologies. They are experienced leaders. They are driven  and mission-oriented. As someone who used to work in the private  sector, these are all qualities I have looked for in employees.   As a Colorado Senator, I know our State has one of the highest  percentages of veterans in the country, and we have military bases with  transitioning servicemembers. Many veterans from all over the country  choose to live in Colorado and make it their home.   We also have top science and engineering programs in emerging energy  industries hungry for a highly skilled workforce. There is a natural  opportunity to connect these groups and strengthen the bridge between  our men and women in uniform and rewarding, high-paying jobs. That is  what this amendment seeks to achieve.   It directs our government to identify opportunities with the military  to partner with colleges, universities, and the private sector to train  our veterans and transition servicemembers for jobs in the growing  energy, cyber security, and artificial intelligence sectors.   I thank my colleagues for supporting the amendment and especially  Senators Gardner and Duckworth for joining me as cosponsors.   I yield the floor.
