 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to condemn the bullying and  threatening of American businesses being conducted by the United States  Department of Commerce.   This was brought to my attention by a small business owner just this  week.   In the Census Bureau's Annual Business Survey, businessowners are now  asked if they invest in a list of so-called ``green'' initiatives to  fight climate change.   If your local baker, dry cleaner, or peanut farmer hasn't been able  to invest in geothermal energy or a renewable purchase power agreement  or extra battery storage, they are asked these threatening questions:   Are you afraid of lost sales?   Do you foresee getting a bad reputation?   Do you think it might be harder to raise capital or secure lines of  credit?   Do you think you might be fined by the government?   Do you think your business will suffer if we implement a carbon tax?   The bottom line from the radical leftists in charge of our executive  branch: That's a nice business you have there, it would be a shame if  something happened to it.    Surveys with leading questions are often called push polls. This is  more like a shove poll. This is the Federal Government threatening  American businesses to engage in government-pushed policy, or else.   Here is a warning of my own. If you work at the Department of  Commerce and you are responsible for this disgusting language, you will  be hearing from Congress very soon. Be prepared to explain yourselves.  The time for bureaucratic overreach must come to an end.  [[Page H4038]]    The Federal Government exists to serve and protect Americans and  their livelihoods, not to pick winners or losers, not to destroy  industries, and not to impose climate change ideology on hundreds of  thousands of businesses that bring prosperity to American families  every day.   Semper Fidelis.
