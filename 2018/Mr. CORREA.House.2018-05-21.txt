 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of my bipartisan  legislation, H.R. 4334, the Improving Oversight of Women Veterans' Care  Act.   Women are the fastest growing cohort of veterans. There are currently  2 million women veterans in the United States and Puerto Rico, almost  10 percent of the overall veteran population.   According to some projections, women veterans are expected to grow to  represent 15 percent of all veterans by 2030. Therefore, it is  important that we ensure that women veterans receive quality care in a  safe and dignified environment, as well as in a timely manner, in and  outside the Department of Veterans Affairs.   Specifically, this bill will require an annual report on veteran  access to gender-specific care under community care contracts and  quarterly reports on environment of care standards for women veterans.   In conclusion, I would like to thank my colleague and friend, Ranking  Member Walz, and Health Subcommittee Ranking Member Brownley for the  support of this legislation. I thank Chairman Roe as well.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 4334.
