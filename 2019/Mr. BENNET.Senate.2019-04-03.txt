 Madam President, later today, the majority leader will  use the so-called nuclear option to once again break the Senate rules.  This is going to be the latest episode in a series of decisions that  have been made around here--mostly by the majority leader but not only  by the majority leader--to degrade the Senate's responsibility to  advise and consent.   What has happened here is a travesty. We have destroyed--this  generation of American politicians has decided that somehow we have  prerogatives that the people who came before us didn't exercise.   I think part of the problem we have is that people are so sick and  tired of the dysfunction around this place, they are not even paying  attention to what is happening here even though, in theory, it is  happening in their name.   Two days ago--on the first of April, fittingly--the majority leader  wrote an op-ed laying out his case. He wrote:         Since January 2017, for the first time in memory, a       minority has exploited procedure to systematically obstruct a       President from staffing up his administration.    Let's read that again.         Since January 2017, for the first time in memory, a       minority has exploited procedure to systematically obstruct a       President from staffing up his administration.    Senator McConnell went on to write:         Crucial jobs are still being held empty out of political       spite.    He seems to have completely forgotten the Obama administration when  he was the leader of the minority, when he was systematically denying  President Obama the right not only to put people in his Cabinet and in  his administration but to put judges on the bench as well.   Before President Obama arrived in Washington, the filibuster had been  used 68 times on this floor--68 times since that rule was created  sometime right before 1920. In the first 5 years of the Obama  administration, the Republicans filibustered his nominees or used the  filibuster in some other way 79 times. It had been used 68 times from  when the rule was created to when President Obama became President, and  then over the first 5 years of his administration, they used it 79  times. And they can't remember a time when a minority systematically  denied a President the ability to put judges on the court or to staff  their administration.   When President Obama was President, they filibustered the Secretary  of Defense nominee for the first time in the history of America, and he  was a former Senator and a Republican. His name was Chuck Hagel. They  filibustered him. Secretary of Defense seems like a pretty crucial  appointment.   In President Obama's last 2 years, the Republican Senate confirmed  only 22 judges. That is a smaller number than at any time since the  Truman administration. Twenty-two judges was all he got.   President Obama left 100 vacancies to President Trump to fill--a  record number. There were more vacancies at the end of his term than  there were at the beginning.   It has been a concerted strategy of Senator McConnell's for a  decade--for more than that--and he has succeeded.   He led the most famous blockade that has ever happened in the Senate,  and that was the blockade he led of Merrick Garland.   When Justice Scalia died 342 days before the end of President Obama's  term, Senator McConnell responded to that by saying: ``This vacancy  should not be filled until we have a new President.'' He called  President Obama a lameduck President. There were 342 days left in his  term. He had an entire year left in his term.   Until that point, the Senate had never refused to consider an elected  President's nominee because the vacancy arose in an election year,  which they claimed over and over again wasn't the case. Since the  Nation's founding, the Senate has confirmed 17 Supreme Court nominees  in election years; it has rejected 2.   The majority leader would later say:         One of my proudest moments was when I looked Barack Obama       in the eye and said, ``Mr. President, you will not fill this       Supreme Court vacancy.''    He did it because he knew he could get away with it, and he thought  he would roll the dice. It was shameful. And it wasn't true that it was  consistent with our history; it was completely inconsistent with our  history.   Whether you support Donald Trump or you don't support Donald Trump, I  think you can thank the majority leader for electing Donald Trump  because by keeping that vacancy on the Court, he made that the issue in  the election, and he galvanized the Republicans around a candidate who  otherwise wouldn't have been very appealing to many of them. People say  that he stole a Supreme Court seat. It is bigger than that--he won the  Presidency for Donald Trump. And we know what has happened since that  time.   But it amazes me that in the name of things not moving quickly  enough, he can come out here and claim that the most significant thing  he has ever done is what he did to Merrick Garland and then the record  he has set putting judges on the circuit courts and the district courts  since Donald Trump was elected President. Nobody has ever had this many  judges put on the court as fast as the majority leader has put them on  the court. Now, for district court judges, he wants to do it in 2 hours  of time. He is just going to crank the machine until it is not  available to him anymore, and it has been clear that has been his  objective from the beginning.   But it is not just that the judges are conservative judges; it is  that they are not as good as they used to be.   You know, until the group of people in this room--including me, by  the way--in 2013, out of desperation, I came to this floor and voted to  change the  [[Page S2215]]  rules so that President Obama could actually get some nominees  confirmed, some judges confirmed, and some administrative appointments  confirmed. I have said on this floor before that that is the worst vote  I have taken as a Senator, and I apologize for that vote. I share some  of the responsibility for where we find ourselves today.   The majority leader said at that time: ``You're going to come to  regret this decision.'' And I will say this about him: He was right. I  do. Not for me and not for the Senate but for the American people who  are having their judiciary infected by the mindless partisanship of  this place, which is hopefully temporary partisanship. But those are  lifetime appointments that we are confirming that we can't take 30  hours to confirm anymore, and now we are going to do them in 2 hours  just to make sure we populate the court with conservative judges whose  views are consistent with the majority leader's and the President of  the United States.   But, as I said, it is not just about their point of view, their  judiciary philosophy, it is also their quality, because if you have to  earn 60 votes for a lifetime appointment or--when I was in law school  and you were a qualified judge who was nominated by a President for the  Supreme Court, you would then command 90 votes or 95 votes, and that  gave the American people confidence that the judiciary was insulated  from politics, that it was insulated from partisanship. Now, because of  what the majority leader has done to the Supreme Court, we are going to  put people on that Court with lifetime appointments by the barest  partisan majorities. It is impossible for me to see how that is going  to build confidence in the judiciary.   So when he says he has just put it back to the way it was before  anybody around here started to filibuster circuit court judges, that is  not true because before that, you would get 90 votes for somebody who  was qualified for the Supreme Court, and today, you get whatever you  get from the partisan majority that happens to be in power.   By the way, I have absolutely no idea what is going to happen when we  have a President of one party and a majority of another party and there  is a vacancy on the Supreme Court, or two or three. If we don't change  our behavior around here, those vacancies are just going to remain  until we have a President and a Senate of the same party, however long  that takes. But if you only need to get 51 votes, I guess you don't  have to be that qualified.   The Senate confirmed a nominee recently to the Sixth Circuit who  wrote blog posts peddling conspiracy theories about Barack Obama and  compared abortion to slavery. He was confirmed 51 to 47. He would never  have survived the vet before.   The Senate confirmed a nominee to the Fifth Circuit who dismissed  concerns about glass ceilings for women, sexual harassment, and the  gender pay gap as a Trojan horse for government intervention. He was  confirmed 50 to 47. This man would never have gotten to this floor  before we changed the rules, and he now has a lifetime appointment.   The Senate confirmed a nominee for the Eighth Circuit, even though  the American Bar Association rated him unanimously as ``not  qualified''--a unanimous rating of ``not qualified,'' and he is now a  circuit court judge with a lifetime appointment. It has never happened  in our history. The ABA questioned whether he ``would be able to detach  himself from his deeply held social agenda and political loyalty.'' He  was confirmed 50 to 48. They said he was unqualified unanimously  because they thought his ideology would blind him, and now he has a  lifetime appointment.   The Senate confirmed a second judge the ABA deemed unqualified for a  district court in Oklahoma. According to the ABA, this nominee  frequently missed work, and when he did show up, it was often in the  middle of the day. He was confirmed by 52 votes.   Last December, the Senate confirmed a third judge the ABA found  unqualified with 50 votes. He barely made it, but Vice President Pence  made a trip from the White House to break the tie.   The partisan temper that is destroying this place needs to come to an  end, and we need to make sure, between now and whenever that happens,  that we don't take down the rest of government with us.   The Founders didn't design the court to be an extension of our  partisan foolishness. The independent judiciary is responsible for  enforcing the rule of law, which is at the heart of our democratic  Republic. It is what separates us from so many other countries around  the world that have failing economies because no one subscribes to the  rule of law or that are filled with corrupt institutions, where rules  are bent, broken, or ignored, with no thought about what is going to be  left for tomorrow but just the looting of the economy for the benefit  of people today.   The Constitution makes it clear that the Senate has a  responsibility--we have a constitutional responsibility--to advise and  consent on judicial nominations. There is no one else assigned that  responsibility. The House of Representatives has nothing to do with it.   Through this decade-long--it is more than that--20-year-long series  of preemptive retributions, where one party says: If we don't do it to  them, they are going to do it to us, we are now at the point where we  are destroying the judiciary, and I think we should pull back from the  brink. I don't think the majority leader should invoke the nuclear  option today, should break another rule around here. No one else in  America runs their operation by breaking the rules.   Just in this session alone, we have seen not only this, not only this  violation of our norms and our customs, of the rule of law, of our  responsibility to advise and consent, we have seen the same people  support the President's extraconstitutional destruction of the rule of  law when he claimed an emergency to fund his wall or to fund $5 billion  for his wall, which, by the way, he said had already been largely  built.   Just like the majority leader today is saying, we have a record  number of judges who have been confirmed since President Trump has been  put in office, but we are not moving quickly enough so I have to change  the rules by using the nuclear option.   I need to declare an emergency to build the wall, even though it is  almost complete because of my excellent administration.   It is all gibberish, and it is all meant just to get a result for  partisan reasons.   I think when the history is written about this period of our  political system, this is all going to look like a tragic farce--all of  it. People are going to know, when they write an op-ed piece on April  Fools' and say one thing, and they have spent the last 20 years doing  something else, that is not going to be lost to the pages of history.  People are going to know how the system worked when we arrived here,  when the people who were in this Chamber arrived, including myself, and  maybe in some tiny, little footnote there will be something that says:  Well, at least Bennet was out here admitting the mistake he made to  contribute to this disaster.   For the life of me, I don't know why we aren't correcting course. We  are free people. Everybody in this Chamber, I think, should have an  incentive to try to be remembered well and to be remembered as a good  steward of this place and of the work we did here. I doubt very much,  when our careers are at an end, what people are going to say is, the  good news is, they broke the rules.   I know what the result is going to be today. I know my friend from  Oklahoma has actually worked hard to see if he could get a bipartisan  result here, and today that has been impossible, but what I really hope  is that we can change what we are doing in the Senate so we can protect  and preserve the independence of our judiciary and that maybe we will  even move beyond the bipartisanship that is bringing the Senate to its  knees today.   With that, I yield the floor.    I thank Senator Gardner. I agree with his assessment and  those of Chairman Murkowski, Senator McSally, and Senator Cortez Masto,  about the urgency and path forward for DCP implementation. I would like  to reiterate that this bill does not exempt or waive any environmental  laws. In drafting the DCPs, both the upper and lower basin carefully  considered the environment and the existing environmental analyses and  compliance documents. Additional NEPA compliance would be needed if  Federal actions are outside the scope of effects analyzed in the  existing compliance and decision documents.   I ask Senator Sinema, if this is also her understanding?
