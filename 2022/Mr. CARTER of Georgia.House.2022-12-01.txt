 Madam Speaker, I rise today to congratulate  LeAndrea Mikell, the executive director for government and community  engagement at Savannah State University for making the annual Georgia  Trend 40 under 40 list.   LeAndrea grew up in Hardeeville, South Carolina, right on the other  side of the river from Savannah. Though she didn't grow up in Savannah  proper, LeAndrea lives and breathes our city.   She began her professional life in the city as a student at Savannah  State University, where she interned for the Savannah Area Chamber of  Commerce, then went on to work for the Savannah Morning News, then to  the World Trade Center in Savannah, then back to her alma mater.   Today, LeAndrea works with students, residents, and elected officials  to provide better opportunities for young people across the region to  prepare them for the success they deserve.   It is citizens like LeAndrea who make Savannah the tight-knit  community it is. We are so lucky to have such talented people like her  working to secure a better and brighter future for the students in our  city.   I thank Georgia Trend for including her in its 40 under 40 list, and  to thank LeAndrea for the important work that she does for her  university and for our city.                            ____________________
