 Mr. Speaker, like so many others, I have been deeply  disturbed by the news out of the New York and Virginia State  Legislatures, where infanticide is being legalized.   Today I rise in strong support of H.R. 962, the Born-Alive Abortion  Survivors Protection Act.   Mr. Speaker, a child born alive after a failed abortion is a living  being just like any other baby born prematurely. Ending any life at 24  weeks or as a newborn is murder.   The law just adopted in New York legalizes abortion up to 40 weeks,  essentially up to the moment of birth, and this is atrocious.   We are facing a moral crisis, and I fear for my children's future  with today's officials supporting and signing bills into law like that  of New York's.  [[Page H2007]]    I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to denounce the  radical support for infanticide and join me in reaffirming and  protecting the inalienable right to life.   Let's do the right thing. Let's bring the Born-Alive Abortion  Survivors Protection Act up for a vote in this House and pass this bill  to preserve the sanctity of life.                            ____________________
