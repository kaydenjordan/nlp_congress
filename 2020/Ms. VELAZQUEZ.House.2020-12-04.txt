 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this legislation  because it will restore justice to our most marginalized communities,  and it will boost our economy.   I thank Speaker Pelosi, Chairman Nadler, and my fellow chairs, for  bringing this legislation to the floor today. The MORE Act takes  meaningful action to address systemic injustices by removing cannabis  from its current classification as a schedule I drug and incentivizing  States to expunge low-level possession records.   As chair of the Small Business Committee, I am proud to have  championed measures included in the bill that will expand capital  access and Federal small business development resources to the cannabis  sector.   We cannot forget that while communities of color have  disproportionately suffered from the so-called war on drugs, they have  also been locked out of traditional capital markets. That is why the  MORE Act is the best legislation to advance progress on this issue, and  I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes''.                                time  1015
