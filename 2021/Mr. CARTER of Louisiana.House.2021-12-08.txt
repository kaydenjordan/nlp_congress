 Mr. Speaker, NASA's Michoud Assembly  Facility in New Orleans, Louisiana, is known as America's rocket  factory.   For over 55 years, Michoud has manufactured large vehicles and  components for NASA, from the Apollo program to the space shuttle to  the Space Launch System, or the SLS.   Michoud is the main manufacturing and assembly site for SLS, which  will take us to the furthest reaches of our solar system.   This site employs approximately 3,500 people but supports more than  6,000 jobs nationwide. This includes government civil service workers,  contractors, and staff of other government agencies, as well as  commercial firms, including firms from Louisiana that create a  significant number of jobs and economic opportunities.   The National Center for Advanced Manufacturing, a partnership between  NASA, the State of Louisiana, Louisiana State University in Baton  Rouge, and the University of New Orleans, also calls Michoud home. The  total economic output of Michoud is over $830 million.   All this to say, Michoud is an indispensable part of the New Orleans'  economy, New Orleans' community, and our Nation's space program.   Sites like Michoud would benefit greatly from the passage of H.R.  5746, which reauthorizes the enhanced use leases needed to keep up  production.  [[Page H7472]]    I am proud to be an original cosponsor of this bill and ask that all  Members support this bill. I urge a ``yea'' vote for this incredibly  important piece of legislation to maintain and to continue the work  that we have done at Michoud with NASA for our country.                                time  1045
