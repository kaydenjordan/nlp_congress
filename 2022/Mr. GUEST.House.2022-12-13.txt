 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the life of  Mississippi State University head football coach, Mike Leach, a man who  left a substantial mark on the game of football and served as an  inspiration for players and fans alike.   Coach Leach was, in a word, unconventional. The air raid offense,  which he brought to college football, changed the game of football  forever; but the sports world will not soon forget Coach Leach's unique  personality that entertained everyone who had the opportunity to listen  to his good-humored interview style and memorable one-liners.   I am thankful that Coach Leach chose Mississippi State University as  his new home in 2020. The last three seasons with him at the helm have  produced some of the most memorable football seasons in my lifetime.   Without a doubt, Coach Leach will be missed, and his impact on the  game of football and Mississippi State University will prove to be  timeless. We will continue to look back fondly on the memories that  Coach Leach, the pirate, graciously left us with.                            ____________________
