 Madam Speaker, in the aftermath of September 11, 2001, we  saw heroism and selflessness, especially the first responders who  rushed toward danger, rescued survivors, and then spent months cleaning  up the wreckage.   Their selflessness was on display again last month when first  responders encouraged us, Congress, to reauthorize the 9/11 Victim  Compensation Fund.   This Congress and I were particularly touched by Detective Luis  Alvarez, who traveled to Washington during the final days of his life.  He said: ``I'm doing okay, but there are others out there who aren't  doing okay.'' Detective Alvarez embodied the selflessness of so many.   On June 29, Detective Alvarez passed away, but he will be remembered  and counted among those who gave their life for us.   Before he died, he said: ``The government has to act like first  responders, you know, put politics aside and let's get this bill  done.''   Detective Alvarez is right, and today we vote to permanently  reauthorize VCF. First responders and their families must never again  face uncertainty about whether their country will be there for them.
