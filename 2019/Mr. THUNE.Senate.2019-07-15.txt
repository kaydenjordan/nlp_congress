 The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator  from Kansas (Mr. Moran), the Senator from Kentucky (Mr. Paul), and the  Senator from Nebraska (Mr. Sasse).   Further, if present and voting, the Senator from Kansas (Mr. Moran)  would have voted ``yea.''    Mr. President, today I recognize Adam Miller, an  intern in my Rapid City, SD, office, for all of the hard work he has  done for me, my staff, and the State of South Dakota over the past  several weeks.   Adam is a graduate of Canton High School in Canton, SD. Currently, he  is attending Black Hills State University in Spearfish, SD, where he is  double majoring in political science and history. He is a hard worker  who has been dedicated to getting the most out of his internship  experience.   I extend my sincere thanks and appreciation to Adam for all of the  fine work he has done and wish him continued success in the years to  come.                            ____________________
