 Madam Speaker, you would have to be living in a hole  somewhere to not have noticed that across the Nation, the desecration  happening to our national monuments, statues, memorials, and even the  vandalization of some of our large cities has been running rampant.   It is time for that to end. In many cases, these acts of vandalism  are targeted towards longtime institutions of those that tirelessly  fought for our freedoms. This desecration must end. And there must be  severe penalties for doing these felonious acts.   We have seen George Washington statues, the Father of our country,  who valued freedom above all else, knocked down. Ulysses S. Grant, the  Commanding General of the Union Army, who helped stop the slavery  effort of the South, who signed the Civil Rights Act of 1875 and the  ratification of the 15th Amendment, was toppled in San Francisco.  Abraham Lincoln, who freed so many from slavery. Even down the street  from here, they are having to guard the Mary McLeod Bethune statues  down there at Lincoln Park, along with Mr. Lincoln. And she was a key  element of FDR's original Federal Council of Negro Affairs, otherwise  known as the ``Black Cabinet.''   There is not even any logic or sense to the vandalism and chaos that  is going on here when they are tearing down statues on all sides of the  issue. It needs to be stopped, and there needs to be harsh penalties  for those doing this.  [[Page H2582]]                                ____________________     Madam Speaker, I appreciate my colleague from Arizona  (Mr. Biggs) for leading this tonight and for what he has been standing  up for.   I just have to say that I am really grieved by the strife we have in  this country, especially trying to exit out of this Wuhan virus  situation and the horrific things we saw happening in Minneapolis. That  was the moment when we saw George Floyd being abused and ultimately  killed by that.   There was unity among 99.9 percent of the population of the people in  this country saying that is wrong. We had a moment to learn from that,  to build upon that.   Indeed, it seemed to be a short moment. Peaceful protests immediately  followed. We agree with those. And then that has been co-opted by these  forces coming out of the ground that have been looking for an  opportunity to divide us, divide our Nation, whether it is antifa or  other groups that are forming and now seeking political power with  this. It is now beyond racism. It is something completely different.   The violence that we are seeing, the mayhem, the destruction, the  vandalism has nothing to do with the good conversation we should have  been having in that spirit of unity that I think most Americans felt in  that window of time right after the George Floyd killing.   How are we going to come out of this? How are we going to have a good  conversation about how we can improve things with law enforcement but  not impugn law enforcement for what they are doing? They are out there  every day trying to find the balance between how to defend the public,  how to defend their own life when they knock on a door or walk up to a  car--they don't know what is going on inside there--and also being a  good ambassador for somebody who they just need to talk to.   How are we going to find this balance again amidst all of this  mayhem, amidst all of this violence? Well, certainly, the signal needs  to be sent that we are not going to tolerate the violence, the mayhem,  the destruction, the vandalism. Severe penalties need to be coming down  upon those who we already have on camera or other ways to identify in  anything going forward.   I just came from Lincoln Park about 10 blocks east of here, and they  have to put fencing and have guards out there for the statue of Abraham  Lincoln, who is shown there putting a hand up for a slave depicted in  that statue, an emancipated slave. He is still wearing the chains. He  is looking up at Mr. Lincoln, who is lifting him and going to take him  to a better place.   Yet, that is being misinterpreted in 2020 as something that is  hateful. That same statue was paid for by emancipated slaves back then  who were inspired by what Mr. Lincoln had done.   They even have a fence around Mary McLeod Bethune right next-door  because they are afraid that might get vandalized because there is  indiscriminate vandalism happening to any statue, to any memorial, to  any monument just because it is a mayhem out there.   That doesn't even make sense. It is not even logical that you would  tear down the ones, General Grant or whoever, who were actually in the  fight to end slavery. We are not going to have a very good conversation  about racism when frauds like this go on.   Even something so simple or silly as a garage at a raceway here a  while back where somebody said it was a noose in the garage, and the  media ran with it immediately without taking at least 12 hours to check  out and find out that it was a pull handle for shutting a garage door.  In no way does it meet the specifications for a noose. Unfortunately,  the driver doubled down on that and continued in interviews saying  definitely a noose.   That doesn't do anything to bring the harmony we should be having,  especially when that driver was shown an incredible amount of harmony  by his colleagues there when first that incident was reported.   Where are we going with all of this? I grieve for our country, the  one that had imperfect roots but always has strived to build upon  itself to do better, to improve.   Slavery came in with the country, but the Founders knew it wasn't  right. There were compromises made to at least form this country to be  something better than the monarchy that England had, compromises but  still building until finally in the 1860s when Mr. Lincoln came and  said enough. You had more than half the country that was already ready  to do that.   We don't get a lot of talk about that because you think the whole  country was racist. Most of the country was not. It was eradicated.  Then we had the 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments to grant rights to  those who originally did not have them. The Civil Rights Act of the  1960s continued on that path, the Voting Rights Act.    Yet, all we hear around here is, Republicans are against all that,  when you find out that, actually, Republicans were leading in greater  numbers on all of those things all the way back at that time. Now,  Democrats are trying to co-opt that and turn it into something else  completely. Indeed, the first 20 Members of Congress who were Black  were also Republican because they saw who was really trying to lead  them toward freedom.   What we have going on right now is not going to keep this great  country in a place that is free. We have lost a lot of freedom already  by the virus, first--something we have to handle--but also the freedom  to actually assemble downtown in a large city or to go visit a statue  or do anything.   Our freedoms are being eroded. Our freedoms are being eroded by  roving bands of people who--mayors in large cities, Democrat mayors,  and some Democrat Governors that govern States aren't doing anything  about it.   What are we supposed to do? Stand and watch what is going on here?  No, we are not going to watch this anymore. We are not going to put up  with it. Severe penalties need to be had for these people inflicting  this mayhem upon their own Nation, upon their own neighbors, upon  neighborhoods. It needs to be harsh.   Then, once we can get the violence stopped, maybe we can get back to  the table and have a real conversation about how we are going to  improve the situations with race.   It grieves me that young Black males feel like they are going to be  victimized by the term ``driving while Black.'' That is an awful  feeling for them and for us, I think, to see that happen.   Our great colleague over on the other side, Senator Tim Scott, when  he brought forth a bill he has been working on very hard for a long  time, looking for bipartisan efforts, his JUSTICE Act, and then someone  tells him it is a token effort.   What the heck does that mean? That really struck him deeply, that  people would say that about that and not even give him the opportunity  to have that bill developed further in the Senate. What a shameful  moment that was.   Yet, now we have legislation here that is trying to eviscerate the  ability of cops to operate how they need to, to have a little bit of  immunity because a cop doesn't know what he is walking into or what she  is walking into. They need a little latitude, not the latitude we saw  in Minneapolis, but one to simply operate.   Doctors need latitude in order to work on patients and not be sued to  death. Yet, we have this legislation that is going to be, basically,  sue a cop. That is not going to help anything.   What is that going to do for morale for keeping cops on the force,  for recruiting new ones? Do we want this mayhem we keep seeing  happening right here in D.C., Minneapolis, L.A., any other large city,  and we don't have some kind of law enforcement there?   Social workers do have their place in certain situations, and they  can be  [[Page H2585]]  helpful. But we don't take money away. We don't defund the cops who are  already shorthanded in rural areas like mine, sheriffs, police, in  order to try and change the whole game.   We have a lot of listening to do to each other on both sides. Not  everybody with light-colored skin is a racist, and I think a lot of  people around this country are really feeling, after the unity we had,  after the George Floyd ugly incident in Minneapolis, this is a time to  get together and listen to each other.   If this is allowed to continue to happen, it is going to make it  awful hard for people to listen to each other because they are feeling  under fire themselves for something they never did, never stood for.  Instead, they have always stood for the greatness of that flag right up  there. In God we trust.   I appreciate the time.
