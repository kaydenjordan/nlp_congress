 Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman  from Texas for yielding, and we are thrilled that he is on the Budget  Committee.   The rule puts in motion a process to spend trillions of dollars on a  progressive wish list, all under the appearance of pandemic relief. And  for what?   We know all five of the last COVID-related pieces of legislation were  done on a bipartisan basis. In the last few days, we have seen a  framework from 10 Republican Senators laid out to get to a solution.   The fact that we are moving forward with this process just goes to  show that yesterday's White House meeting was just a photo-op for the  President.   Sadly, the Democrat majority seems to want to go a partisan route in  both the House and Senate because they know there is not a bipartisan  consensus in this country for the socialist policies they want to  include, giveaways to their base, the far left and the coastal elite.   Just look at what is being discussed by Democrats on how they plan to  use the budgeting process known as reconciliation, a mechanism  traditionally used to control spending and address the debt. They now  talk openly about granting mass amnesty; growing the control government  has over your healthcare; adding new burdens, rules, and costs on the  very small businesses that they have shut down; and bailing out their  political allies whose policies destroyed local economies.    All of this they want to somehow hide from the American people with  the label of essential items for pandemic relief.   And the rule we are debating right now rewards this process. It is  the first step in allowing Washington Democrats to jam this radical  agenda through Congress at lightning speed.   I ask the Chair, where was the rush to help American families when  the Speaker was holding up support for direct aid to working-class  families all spring, all summer, and all fall, eventually dropping her  price tag and objections only after the first Tuesday in November? The  first Tuesday in November happens to be election day.   I have always kept one motto in my heart as I approach this job: Put  people before politics. Unfortunately, what we are seeing from the  Democrats is the exact opposite; it is all politics.   In more than 30 years, a budget has not originated in the House that  has not first gone through the committee process. This is truly a  first. The Budget Committee has yet to even meet, to organize, to set  our rules, and to ratify an agenda of oversight of the new  administration.   So why are we standing here right now? Why are we moving ahead like  this when the President, in his inaugural address, called for unity and  spoke about the power of our example? The answer is simple: So that  Democrat leaders can spend more on a bunch of programs, ideas, and  systems, which they have dreamed about throwing taxpayer money at since  they took control of this Chamber 2 years ago.   Mr. Speaker, I will close with this. The Democrats talk about  unification, the need to unify as a Congress and work together, the  need to unify as a country and learn to respect one another again for  the good of America. But when their actions don't match their words,  the value of every word they say from that point forward becomes  meaningless.   The actions of the Democrat majority, to start a process which will  only end in more divisive partisanship, is the exact opposite of what  our country is asking for right now.                                time  1745
