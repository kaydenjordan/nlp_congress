 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and concur in  the Senate amendment to the bill (H.R. 3462) to require an annual  report on the cybersecurity of the Small Business Administration, and  for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the Senate amendment is as follows:   Senate amendment:         Strike out all after the enacting clause and insert:       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``SBA Cyber Awareness Act''.       SEC. 2. CYBERSECURITY AWARENESS REPORTING.         (a) In General.--Section 10 of the Small Business Act (15       U.S.C. 639) is amended by inserting after subsection (a) the       following:        ``(b) Cybersecurity Reports.--        ``(1) Annual report.--Not later than 180 days after the       date of enactment of this subsection, and every year       thereafter, the Administrator shall submit a report to the       appropriate congressional committees that includes--        ``(A) a strategy to increase the cybersecurity of       information technology infrastructure of the Administration;        ``(B) a supply chain risk management strategy and an       implementation plan to address the risks of foreign       manufactured information technology equipment utilized by the       Administration, including specific risk mitigation activities       for components originating from entities with principal       places of business located in the People's Republic of China;       and        ``(C) an account of--        ``(i) any incident that occurred at the Administration       during the 2-year period preceding the date on which the       first report is submitted, and, for subsequent reports, the       1-year period preceding the date of submission; and        ``(ii) any action taken by the Administrator to respond to       or remediate any such incident.        ``(2) FISMA reports.--Each report required under paragraph       (1) may be submitted as part of the report required under       section 3554 of title 44, United States Code.        ``(3) Rule of construction.--Nothing in this subsection       shall be construed to affect the reporting requirements of       the Administrator under chapter 35 of title 44, United States       Code, in particular the requirement to notify the Federal       information security incident center under section       3554(b)(7)(C)(ii) of such title, any guidance  [[Page H8737]]       issued by the Office of Management and Budget, or any other       provision of law or Federal policy.        ``(4) Definitions.--In this subsection:        ``(A) Appropriate congressional committees.--The term       `appropriate congressional committees' means--        ``(i) the Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship       of the Senate;        ``(ii) the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental       Affairs of the Senate;        ``(iii) the Committee on Small Business of the House of       Representatives; and        ``(iv) the Committee on Oversight and Reform of the House       of Representatives.        ``(B) Incident.--The term `incident' has the meaning given       the term in section 3552 of title 44, United States Code.        ``(C) Information technology.--The term `information       technology' has the meaning given the term in section 3502 of       title 44, United States Code.''.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the measure under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I thank all the members of the Small Business Committee  for their hard work this Congress on behalf of our Nation's 32 million  small business owners.   These bills will help small firms in a number of areas: strengthen  cybersecurity and broadband access, improve exporting, and enhance  recovery assistance from natural disasters.   They are the product of the bipartisan and bicameral work of the  House and Senate Small Business Committees. I hope that we can come  together today and approve these bills.   First, we will consider H.R. 3462, the SBA Cyber Awareness Act, as  amended and passed by the Senate. For more than 20 years, the SBA's IG  has listed IT security as one of the most serious management and  performance challenges for SBA. These vulnerabilities were exposed  during the rollout of the SBA COVID-19 relief programs.   The unprecedented demand for programs like PPP and the COVID EIDL  overwhelmed the SBA's legacy system, leading to back-end crashes, slow  portal operations, and a breach that exposed applicants' personal  information. SBA failed to make any public announcement about the data  breach, and it took weeks for the agency to send paper notifications to  affected individuals.   H.R. 3462 would require the SBA to assess its cybersecurity  procedures and submit a cybersecurity report to Congress within 180  days of passage and annually thereafter.   SBA possesses sensitive information belonging to countless American  small business owners. We must ensure this data is protected from bad  actors in cyberspace.   The Senate-passed version we are voting on today reinforces reporting  requirements established by the Federal Information Security Management  Act of 2002.   I support the changes and thank the Senate for improving this  legislation. I thank Mr. Crow of Colorado and Mrs. Kim of California  for introducing and championing this bill. Their relentless efforts on  this issue is why we are here today.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 3462, as amended by  the Senate, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Colorado (Mr. Crow).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.  [[Page H8738]]    Mr. Speaker, the average cost of a data breach in the United States  is over $9 million. For small businesses operating on razor-thin  margins, an event like this can be catastrophic.   Small businesses must be confident that SBA systems are fully  operational and capable of protecting their sensitive data. H.R. 3462  will go a long way toward rebuilding trust in the agency's IT  infrastructure.   I thank my colleagues, Mr. Crow of Colorado and Mrs. Kim of  California, for their leadership on this issue.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to concur with the Senate amendment  to the bill, H.R. 3462, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 8844) to reauthorize the State Trade Expansion Program of  the Small Business Administration, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 8844         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

(b) Survey.--Section 22(l) of the Small Business Act (15       U.S.C. 649(l)) is amended--        (1) by redesignating paragraphs (7) through (9) as       paragraphs (8) through (10), respectively; and        (2) by inserting after paragraph (6) the following new       paragraph:        ``(7) Survey.--The Associate Administrator shall conduct an       annual survey of each State that received a grant under this       subsection during the preceding year to solicit feedback on       the program and develop best practices for grantees.''.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the measure under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 8844, the STEP  Improvement Act of 2022.   This bill reauthorizes the SBA's State Trade Expansion Program, or  STEP, as we call it. This program is a proven and effective program  that gives small businesses the tools they need to enter and thrive in  the global marketplace.   Since its inception in 2010, STEP has helped firms access new markets  and support $832 million in export sales in fiscal year 2021 alone.   The program offers grants to all 50 States, U.S. territories, and  D.C. This financial assistance aids export-related activities such as  developing e-commerce capabilities, participating in export trade shows  and foreign trade missions, creating international marketing materials  and website globalization.   Our committee held two hearings on STEP this Congress where we heard  that demand for the program continues to increase across the country,  and improvements could be made to streamline the program.   To that end, the STEP Improvement Act of 2022 authorizes $30 million  per year through fiscal year 2026, and mandates a standardized  application process, increases grant spending flexibility, improves  communication between the SBA and States, and enhances reporting  requirements.   The legislation allows businesses less than 1 year old to participate  in the program, which would allow STEP to provide services to the most  innovative small businesses that are exporting faster than ever before.   The legislation has the strong support of the State International  Development Organizations. I thank the bill's sponsors, Mr. Evans, Mrs.  Kim of California, Ms. Newman, and Mr. Flood for their continued  bipartisan work to improve STEP.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 8844, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to  the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Evans), the author of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, small businesses are truly the bedrock of the American  economy, and exporting is one sure way for them to expand their profits  at home and their presence overseas.   H.R. 8844 will go a long way in ensuring small employers and  entrepreneurs  [[Page H8740]]  at any stage in their business journey can grow and open the doors to  the global marketplace.   By reauthorizing STEP, this legislation ensures that States and their  small businesses will face fewer hurdles to participation and greater  opportunities.   Once again, I commend my colleagues, Representatives Evans, Kim, and  Flood for their hard work on this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes,'' and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (S. 1687) to amend section 21 of the Small Business Act to require  cyber certification for small business development center counselors,  and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  S. 1687         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Small Business Cyber       Training Act of 2022''.       SEC. 2. DUTIES OF SMALL BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT CENTER                     COUNSELORS.         (a) Cyber Training.--Section 21 of the Small Business Act       (15 U.S.C. 648) is amended by adding at the end the       following:        ``(o) Cyber Strategy Training for Small Business       Development Centers.--        ``(1) Definitions.--In this subsection--        ``(A) the term `cyber strategy' means resources and tactics       to assist in planning for cybersecurity and defending against       cyber risks and attacks; and        ``(B) the term `lead small business development center'       means a small business development center that receives       reimbursement from the Administrator under paragraph (5).        ``(2) Certification program.--The Administrator shall       establish a cyber counseling certification program, or       designate 1 or more substantially similar governmental or       private cybersecurity certification programs, to certify the       employees of lead small business development centers in       providing cyber planning assistance to small business       concerns.        ``(3) Number of certified employees.--The Administrator       shall ensure that the number of employees of each lead small       business development center who are certified in providing       cyber planning assistance is not less than the lesser of--        ``(A) 5; or        ``(B) 10 percent of the total number of employees of the       lead small business development center.        ``(4) Cyber strategy.--In carrying out paragraph (2), the       Administrator, to the extent practicable, shall consider any       cyber strategy methods included in the Small Business       Development Center Cyber Strategy developed under section       1841(a)(3)(B) of the National Defense Authorization Act for       Fiscal Year 2017 (Public Law 114-328; 130 Stat. 2662).        ``(5) Reimbursement for certification.--        ``(A) In general.--Subject to the availability of       appropriations, the Administrator may reimburse each lead       small business development center for costs relating to the       certification of 1 or more employees of the lead small       business center in providing cyber planning assistance under       a program established or designated under paragraph (2).        ``(B) Limitation.--The total amount reimbursed by the       Administrator under subparagraph (A) may not exceed $350,000       in any fiscal year.''.        (b) Implementation.--Not later than 180 days after the date       of enactment of this Act, the Administrator of the Small       Business Administration shall implement paragraphs (2), (3),       and (4) of section 21(o) of the Small Business Act, as added       by subsection (a).     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the measure under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the bill before us today, S. 1687,  the Small Business Cyber Training Act of 2022.   The House passed its companion bill, H.R. 4515, the Small Business  Development Center Cyber Training Act on November 2, 2021.   S. 1687, would establish a cyber counseling certification program for  lead SBDC staff to provide specific, free-of-charge cyber training for  small businesses.   As more businesses utilize the internet for social media advertising,  payment systems, and global markets, more of them become vulnerable to  cyberattacks. The cyber disruptions can destroy IT systems and derail  operations, sometimes forcing the business to shut down.   Cyberattack damage is not just limited to the IT systems; it can also  erode customers' trust and tarnish a business' reputation.   With that said, a recent SBA survey found that 88 percent of small  business owners felt their business was vulnerable to a cyberattack,  but reported that they couldn't afford professional IT solutions, have  limited time to devote to cybersecurity, or just do not know where to  begin.   Given the greater risk cyberattacks pose to small businesses and  their limited capacity to protect against them, we must find ways to  help entrepreneurs strengthen their cybersecurity posture. The SBA and  SBDCs are ready, willing, and able to fill these gaps.   Under this legislation, lead SBDCs would be required to provide cyber  training and resources and facilitate cybersecurity investments that  are typically too expensive for small businesses.   S. 1687 makes minor technical changes to the House passed bill and  were agreed upon by all stakeholders. I thank our House leaders, Mr.  Garbarino, Mr. Evans, Ms. Houlahan, and Mr. Chabot, who have been true  advocates on this issue. I applaud their commitment to helping small  business owners protect their livelihood from destructive cyberattacks.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, as amended,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   The use of digital tools dramatically increased during the pandemic,  even here in Congress; and the massive shift to remote work has  resulted in a significant rise in cybersecurity threats and attacks.   Guarding against cyberattacks often comes with significant costs and  a substantial investment of time and resources. Unfortunately, small  businesses operating on thin margins have fewer resources to dedicate  to cybersecurity.   S. 1687 ensures that the Nation's 62 lead SBDCs are fully equipped to  assist small businesses with their cybersecurity needs at no cost. The  bill would eliminate the primary obstacle of investment costs and make  cybersecurity mitigation easier to adopt.   This bill is a commonsense solution to complex problems. I urge my  colleagues to support S. 1687, the Small Business Cyber Training Act of  2022, as amended.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (S. 1617) to modify the requirements for the Administrator of the  Small Business Administration relating to declaring a disaster in a  rural area, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  S. 1617         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the measure under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 1617, the Disaster Assistance  for Rural Communities Act. This bill will close a loophole in the Small  Business Administration's disaster lending program, which  disproportionately impacts homeowners and businesses located in remote  rural areas.   Although people assume SBA only provides assistance to small  businesses after a declared disaster, the opposite is true. In fact,  according to CRS, approximately 80 percent of SBA disaster loans were  awarded to individuals and households rather than businesses.   SBA's disaster lending program has been an important tool that helps  not only businessowners, but also homeowners and renters rebuild after  disasters and emergencies.   Under the current law, when the President declares a disaster under  the Stafford Act, but does not authorize individual assistance, the SBA  must declare a disaster for an individual to apply for a loan.   Yet, for SBA to declare a disaster, a minimum amount of physical  damage must be sustained by a certain number of homes and businesses in  a county or smaller political subdivision. This policy hurts remote  rural areas because SBA cannot declare a disaster if a minimum number  of homes or businesses aren't damaged or destroyed.   This outdated policy is hurting some of our most vulnerable citizens.  We must close this loophole, especially as major disasters become more  prevalent and destructive due to climate change.   In 2021, the United States experienced 20 separate billion-dollar  weather and climate disasters, which caused $145 billion in damage.   This bill addresses this issue by allowing SBA to declare a disaster  in any rural area in which a major disaster has been declared by the  President but individual assistance hasn't been authorized under the  Stafford Act. It is critical that SBA disaster lending programs be  available to all individuals, no matter where they reside or where they  operate their business.   I thank Senators Risch, Shaheen, Hassan, Kennedy, and Braun for their  leadership on this important measure. I also thank Mr. Golden, who  introduced a companion bill on the House side.  [[Page H8742]]    Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to vote ``yes,'' and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   This legislation to update SBA's policy to provide assistance to  homeowners and businesses in remote rural areas is long overdue.  Individuals affected by natural disasters need SBA assistance now more  than ever, particularly with the threat of major disasters due to  climate change.   A business' location shouldn't determine their eligibility for aid in  the wake of a natural disaster. Simply put, it is not fair for SBA  loans to be available for individuals impacted by a tornado or flood in  an urban area, but not a remote rural area just because the number of  properties damaged by the disaster didn't meet an arbitrary threshold.   The SBA's disaster lending program has been an essential tool helping  people get back on their feet after a disaster and the program should  be available to help as many people as possible.   I thank Ranking Member Luetkemeyer for working with me to get this  bill passed today.   In the 117th Congress, Representative Luetkemeyer joined the  committee as the ranking member, and while we may not have always seen  eye to eye, we were able to set aside our differences to bring more  than 20 bipartisan bills to the floor, including legislation to extend  the statute of limitations for fraud cases involving PPP and COVID  EIDL.   The spirit of bipartisanship has always been central to the day-to- day operations of the committee. I look forward to continuing this  tradition. American small businesses deserve nothing less.   I once again thank the members of the committee and their staff who  have worked tirelessly through this Congress to aid small business  owners and entrepreneurs throughout the country. I am incredibly proud  of all the work our committee has done to support small businesses when  they needed it the most.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on S. 1617, and I  yield back the balance of my time.
