 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  acknowledge the outstanding performance of Pennsylvania's critical  access hospitals.   Before I was elected to serve in the House of Representatives, I  spent nearly 30 years in the healthcare field. I am most proud to see  Pennsylvania recognized in the top 10 States by the Health Resources  and Services Administration for quality performance.   With the help of funding from the Federal Office of Rural Health  Policy, Pennsylvania's critical access hospitals are able to invest in  quality improvement projects and new technical assistance resources to  better care for their patients.   Pennsylvania is home to 15 critical access hospitals that provide  service to the most rural areas in our State. Since 1991, the  Pennsylvania Office of Rural Health has dedicated its efforts to ensure  that these hospitals constantly improve the quality of care they  provide to their patients.   Rural hospitals are critically important to our communities. They may  be limited in resources, but they are committed to providing the best  care possible to patients.   I am proud of our Pennsylvania critical access hospitals, and I  congratulate them on this national recognition.                            ____________________     Mr. Chairman, I rise to offer amendment  No. 49.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         At the end of division H (before the short title), insert       the following:        Sec. __.  None of the funds made available by this Act may       be used to establish or collect tolls on Interstate Route 80       in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 500, the gentleman  from Pennsylvania (Mr. Thompson) and a Member opposed each will control  5 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania.    Mr. Chairman, I rise to offer amendment  No. 49 to the underlying bill, H.R. 3354, Make America Secure and  Prosperous Appropriations Act.   Mr. Chairman, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, over a 5-year period,  has failed three attempts to place tolls on Interstate 80.  Pennsylvania's failed plan has cost millions of dollars, led actually  to the indictments of several political insiders, and abetted in  diminishing the average citizen's faith in their public institutions.   Unfortunately, Pennsylvania still has authorizing language for tolls  of Interstate 80 in State law. Any move by Pennsylvania to dust off the  plans to toll one of its interstates must be met with scrutiny and open  public debate, and this amendment will ensure that that happens.   The amendment I have offered with Mr. Kelly will simply limit funds  from this bill for the purpose of placing tolls on Interstate 80 in  Pennsylvania during the fiscal year 2018.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.   Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in  opposition.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.   Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr. Chairman, I can't imagine why we  would want to micromanage Pennsylvania's transportation system. I  wouldn't want the body micromanaging North Carolina's.   We had a decision about tolling in my district a few years ago.  Tolling wasn't anybody's first choice or second choice or third choice.  But if tolling had not been instituted on a part of the loop road  around Raleigh, North Carolina, if tolling had not been instituted, we  would have waited 20 years for the road to be constructed. So we took a  deep breath and we undertook a toll project, and that is why the road  is built and serving commuters today.   Now, that decision could have gone either way, but we would have had  no business in this body coming in and dictating that decision in North  Carolina or any other State. I don't know why we should start tonight.   Federal law is very flexible about the use of Federal aid funds for  new toll facilities and even existing toll-free roads. States will make  different decisions about this.   I would say our infrastructure needs are pressing enough to require  an all-of-the-above approach, and if tolls are appropriate and are  accepted, then that is perhaps what we should do. But that is a  decision for State and local officials and their constituents in  considering these matters. We have no business in adopting an amendment  of that sort, and I very much hope we will not.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I am not sure. I  appreciate the gentleman's opinion, but I don't see where Congress does  not have input into a Federal highway, and that is what Interstate 80  is. It is approximately 311 miles. It is more than well-maintained. The  cost of it, with significant gas taxes levied today, pays for not just  the maintenance, but the construction and the improvements that are  necessary.  [[Page H7055]]    Again, we are talking Federal gas tax, again, a nexus to this body  that the gentleman doesn't seem to realize. What this amendment does is  just call on and require an open debate with scrutiny, and so I, quite  frankly, continue to just ask the support for this amendment.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time   Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr. Chairman, I would like the clarify  that I am not the least bit interested in getting into the merits of  this project. It is none of my business, none of our business, so that  is not the point. I haven't said a word about the merits of the  project. I know nothing about it.   What I do know is that this is a decision that the State of  Pennsylvania is perfectly capable of making for itself. I am not  interested in the folks that might be on the losing side of a decision  to come to this body to carry their water. We have no business doing  that.   This is simply an inappropriate exercise of appropriations power, and  I urge the amendment's rejection.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I made my arguments  clear, and I yield back the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Thompson).   The amendment was agreed to.   The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 50  printed in part B of House Report 115-295.                 Amendment No. 51 Offered by Mr. King of Iowa    The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 51  printed in part B of House Report 115-295.
