 Madam Speaker, I am grateful for the  addition of the Civil Affairs and Psychological Operations Advanced  Individual Training courses at Fort Jackson, South Carolina, which is  one of the most military friendly communities in America.   Civil affairs and psychological operation soldiers bring unique skill  sets. The relocation of Fort Jackson, where over half of all soldiers  attend basic training, effectively organizes courses in the Army  Training and Doctrine Command environment.   Through job growth at Fort Jackson, the local economy of Columbia  will benefit with nearly $5 million in initial establishment, and $3.5  annually.   Congratulations to Commanding General Milford Beagle, Jr., of Fort  Jackson on this expansion. I appreciate his extraordinary leadership.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget  September the 11th, defeating terrorists overseas, in the global war on  terrorism with the courageous leadership of President Donald Trump.   Our sympathy goes out to the family of Nawres Hamid, an Iraqi  American Muslim from California who was murdered by the Soleimani- financed terrorists on December 27.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, this week, universally  respected Senator Joe Lieberman, a Democrat, provided an extraordinary  op-ed in The Wall Street Journal: ``President Trump's order to take out  Qasem Soleimani was morally, constitutionally, and strategically  correct. . . . No American can dispute that Soleimani created,  supported, and directed a network of terrorist organizations that  spread havoc in the Middle East.'' In Syria, ``more than 500,000  Syrians have died.''   ``During the Iraq war, Soleimani oversaw three camps in Iran.'' These  trained fighters have killed more than 600 American soldiers.   The claim that President Trump ``had no authority to order this  attack without congressional approval is constitutionally untenable and  practically senseless. . . . Democrats should leave partisan politics  at `the water's edge' and . . . stand together against Iran and  dangerous leaders like Qasem Soleimani.''   Senator Joe Lieberman tells the truth. We must resist: ``Death to  America,'' ``Death to Israel.''   I extend our sympathies to the family of Nawres Hamid, an Iraqi  American Muslim from California, who was murdered by Soleimani-financed  terrorists 13 days ago.
