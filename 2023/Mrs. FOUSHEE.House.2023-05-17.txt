 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to formally recognize and  commend North Carolina Central University's football team by  introducing a resolution congratulating them for winning the  Historically Black Colleges And Universities National Football  Championship in the 2022 Celebration Bowl.   NCCU is located in my district in Durham, North Carolina, and is  known for its distinguished academic and athletic excellence. It is a  prime example of the importance and great value of our Nation's HBCUs.   Under the steadfast leadership of Chancellor Dr. Johnson Akinleye in  the classroom and Head Coach Trei Oliver on the field, NCCU brought  home the Black College Football National Title for the fourth time in  the university's history with Eagle Pride and Eagle Promise.   I am deeply honored to represent NCCU, and I extend my sincere  congratulations to the entire team, the coaches, athletic staff, the  students, and the faculty for this well-deserved victory. Go Eagles.                            ____________________
