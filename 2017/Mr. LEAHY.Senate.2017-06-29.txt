 Mr. President, the Smithsonian Institution in Washington,  DC has as its newest treasure, the National Museum of African American  History and Culture. It is the work of many and would not be there  without its founding director, Dr. Lonnie G. Bunch III.   I know as a member of the Smithsonian board of regents that Dr. Bunch  is the single most important person bringing about this magnificent  museum and one which will speak to the history of African Americans in  this country more than anything else.   We all know that history has seen an enormous amount of pain caused  by violence and deaths resulting from racism in America. When you come  into that moving museum, as I have many times, the last thing you would  expect is someone who would leave the ultimate symbol of racism, a  noose, hanging in it. I know the dismay felt by people of all races  when it was found, but probably what has helped the healing the most is  the op-ed of June 23, 2017, in the New York Times, written by my  friend, Lonnie Bunch.   I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the op-ed, so  that all can see it and so that it will be part of the history of the  U.S. Senate.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                  [From the New York Times, June 23, 2017]           A Noose at the Smithsonian Brings History Back to Life                          (By Lonnie G. Bunch III)         The person who recently left a noose at the National Museum       of African American History and Culture clearly intended to       intimidate, by deploying one of the most feared symbols in       American racial history. Instead, the vandal unintentionally       offered a contemporary reminder of one theme of the black       experience in America: We continue to believe in the       potential of a country that has not always believed in us,       and we do this against incredible odds.        The noose--the second of three left on the National Mall in       recent weeks--was found late in May in an exhibition that       chronicles America's evolution from the era of Jim Crow       through the civil rights movement. Visitors discovered it on       the floor in front of a display of artifacts from the Ku Klux       Klan, as well as objects belonging to African-American       soldiers who fought during World War I. Though these soldiers       fought for democracy abroad, they found little when they       returned home.        That display, like the museum as a whole, powerfully       juxtaposes two visions of America: one shaped by racism,       violence and terror, and one shaped by a belief in an America       where freedom and fairness reign. I see the nooses as       evidence that those visions continue to battle in 2017 and       that the struggle for the soul of America continues to this       very day.        The people responsible knew that their acts would not be       taken lightly. A noose is a symbol of the racial violence and       terror that African-Americans have confronted throughout       American history and of the intensity of resistance we've       faced to any measure of racial equality. During slavery, one       of the main purposes of lynching was to deter the enslaved       from escaping to freedom. But lynching did not end with       slavery; it was also a response to the end of slavery. It       continued from the 1880s until after the end of World War I,       with more than 100 people lynched each year. So prevalent was       this atrocity that between 1920 and 1938, the N.A.A.C.P.       displayed a banner at its national headquarters that read       simply, ``A man was lynched yesterday.''        Lynching was not just a phenomenon of the American South or       the Ku Klux Klan. And in many places, as black people fought       for inclusion in American life, lynchings became brutal       spectacles, drawing thousands of onlookers who posed for       photographs with the lifeless bodies. This collective memory       explains why the noose has become a symbol of white supremacy       and racial intimidation.        So, what does it mean to have found three nooses on       Smithsonian grounds in 2017? A  [[Page S3848]]       noose inside a Missouri high school? A noose on the campus of       Duke University? Another at American University?        As a historian, who also happens to be old enough to       remember ``Whites Only'' signs on motels and restaurants that       trumpeted the power of laws enforcing segregation, I posit       that it means we must lay to rest any notion that racism is       not still the great divide.        As someone who has experienced the humiliating sting of       racial epithets and the pain of a policeman's blow--simply       because I was black and in a neighborhood not my own--I would       argue that it answers a naive and dangerous question that I       hear too often: Why can't African-Americans get over past       discrimination?        The answer is that discrimination is not confined to the       past. Nor is the African-American commitment to American       ideals in the face of discrimination and hate.        The exhibitions inside the museum combine to form a       narrative of a people who refused to be broken by hatred and       who have always found ways to prod America to be truer to the       ideals of its founders.        In the process of curating these experiences, I have       acquired, examined and interpreted objects that stir feelings       of intense pain. Anger and sadness are always parts of this       work, but I never let them dominate it. Instead, I use them       to help me connect with the people who have suffered and       continue to suffer immeasurable pain and injustice, while       clinging to their humanity and their vision of a better       country.        I see the nooses in the same way. They are living history.       Viewed through this lens, they are no less a part of the       story the museum tells than the Klan robes, the slave       shackles small enough to fit a child, the stretch of rope       used to lynch a Maryland man in 1931 or the coffin used to       bury the brutally murdered Emmett Till.        If you want to know how African-Americans continue to       persevere and fight for a better America in the face of this       type of hatred, you need only visit the museum, where the       noose has been removed but the rest of the remarkable story       of our commitment to overcome remains. Anyone who experiences       the National Museum of African American History and Culture       should leave with that realization, as well as the       understanding that this story is continuing. The cowardly act       of leaving a symbol of hate in the midst of a tribute to our       survival conveyed that message as well as any exhibit ever       could.                            ____________________     Mr. President, last night in the Kennedy Caucus Room, the  U.S. Capitol Historical Society honored the Senate Appropriations  Committee with a celebration of its 150th anniversary. Past and present  committee members and staff gathered to reflect on the history of the  committee, and Senate Historian Betty Koed gave a wonderful keynote  address.   Established on March 6, 1867, the committee's powers are rooted in  article 1, section 9, of our Constitution which states, ``No Money  shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations  made by Law.'' The Founders recognized the power of the purse as one of  the most important tools Congress has to ensure our system of checks  and balances and to conduct oversight of the executive and judicial  branch--but it is much more than that. The Appropriations Committee is  where we translate the priorities of a nation into the realities of the  people.   Our country is not a business, where we allocate resources only  according to the bottom line. We do not invest in order to make a  profit or a one-for-one dollar in return. We invest in those areas  where it is uniquely right for government to take the lead. We invest  in the areas that make a difference in the everyday lives of Americans  and that help build the foundations of our country and our economy-- infrastructure, national security, our environment, education, science  and research, healthcare.   I want to thank the U.S. Capitol Historical Society for organizing  this anniversary celebration, and I ask unanimous consent that the text  of the remarks given by Senate Historian Betty Koed be printed in the  Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                  Appropriations Committee 150th Anniversary                          Wednesday, June 28, 2017                      Betty K. Koed, Senate Historian         On March 6, 2017, the Senate reached an important milestone       in the history of its committees. The Committee on       Appropriations turned 150 years old.        For its first quarter-century, the Senate operated without       permanent legislative committees. Instead, it relied on       temporary ``select'' committees to manage proposals and write       bills. In 1816, having created nearly a hundred of these ad       hoc committees, the Senate decided on something more       permanent.        In December of 1816, it created eleven standing committees,       including Judiciary, Foreign Relations, Commerce, and       Finance. However, it did not create a Committee on       Appropriations.        Over the next five decades, the Finance Committee handled       most appropriations, but that overworked committee struggled       with the haphazard funding requests of executive agencies.        Wishing to appear frugal, agency directors often       understated their funding needs to the House of       Representatives and then, in the hectic final days of a       session, quietly turned to the Senate for emergency funds.        The threat of suspended operations usually convinced       Congress to replenish the coffers. If agencies ran a surplus,       directors simply spent those funds as they pleased.        By the 1860s senators realized that they needed to gain       better control over appropriations. The Civil War had vastly       expanded federal spending. In fact, in 1865, expenditures       passed the billion-dollar mark for the first time in our       national history.        The lack of centralized control over appropriations also       played to the president's advantage, and the executive often       spent millions without first securing formal congressional       appropriations.        In other words, by the end of the Civil War, no less than       the power of the purse was at stake.        On March 6, 1867, two years after similar action taken by       the House, Senator Henry Anthony of Rhode Island proposed a       new committee to consider spending bills.        The Senate agreed--by unanimous consent--and passed       subsequent legislation to better regulate how such funds were       used.        Before long, this new committee became a Senate powerhouse.       Led by strong chairmen like Iowa's William B. Allison, the       Appropriations Committee reached new heights of influence       during the Senate's Gilded Age.        Not surprisingly, senators who did not serve on the       committee began to complain. Did this upstart committee have       too much power? Chairmen of the legislative committees, as       well as the heads of executive agencies, said yes, and looked       for ways to wrest back some of that power.        In the 1890s, senators curtailed the jurisdiction of the       Appropriations Committee, giving control over spending in       certain areas, such as agriculture, military affairs, and       pensions, back to legislative committees.        Committee chairs were delighted, but with no centralized       control over the budgetary process, the committees ran amok.       Spending increased with little or no accountability.        And so, in 1921, again prompted by war-related costs that       had pushed annual spending to more than $25 billion a year,       Congress passed the Budget and Accounting Act.        Signed by President Warren G. Harding, the 1921 law       required an annual budget from the president, created the       General Accounting Office (now GAO), the Bureau of the Budget       (now the OMB), and led to the establishment of permanent       subcommittees for Appropriations.        But passage of that bill was just the beginning. In       implementing the new law, Chairman Francis E. Warren of       Wyoming shaped the future of the committee.        In 1922 Warren introduced a successful resolution to again       centralize the appropriations process. He also included in       his resolution a revision to Rule 16, requiring that all       general appropriation bills, and amendments to such bills, be       referred to the Committee on Appropriations.        This, in essence, established the broad jurisdiction that       the committee enjoys today.        Since that time, the Appropriations Committee has continued       to evolve as its duties and workload were amended by       subsequent legislation.        Of course, the biggest change came in 1974 with the Budget       Act, which created the House and Senate Budget Committees       along with the Congressional Budget Office. But, again, the       Appropriations Committee remained intact.        In the 1980s and 90s, other elements were added--Gramm-      Rudman, budget summits, PAYGO, CRs--but you know that history       better than I do. You've been living it.        Today--150 years after its creation--the Senate Committee       on Appropriations, ably led by Chairman Cochran and Vice       Chairman Leahy, continues to be a powerful and influential       voice in national policymaking.        Of course, that doesn't mean that the appropriations       process has always been easy. In fact, at times, it has been       downright testy.        For example, on a hot day in August of 1950, as the Senate       continued working past its targeted adjournment date, tempers       inside the committee room got to be nearly as hot as the       scorching summer sun.        ``The Senate is beginning to show signs of overwork,''       observed newspaper columnist Jack Anderson. ``Sessions are       growing longer,'' he wrote, ``and tempers shorter.''        Among the confrontations that caught Anderson's eye was a       battle between two of the Hill's best known curmudgeons,       Tennessee senator Kenneth McKellar and Missouri       Representative Clarence Cannon.        They were the chairmen of the Senate and House       Appropriations Committees and for years they had argued       bitterly over federal spending. That battle reached a climax       in 1950.        ``A gavel-bashing, name-calling clash between 81-year-old .       . . McKellar, and 71-year-  [[Page S3849]]       old . . . Cannon, was broken up . . . just short of physical       violence,'' noted the Washington Post on August 19, 1950.        While meeting in conference, Senator McKellar had sharply       commented on Cannon's personality, using language peppered       with words such as blind, stupid, and pigheaded.        Infuriated, Cannon sprang from his chair, rushed towards       McKellar, and shouted, ``I've taken all I'm going to       [take].'' Startled but defiant, McKellar snatched the gavel       and tried to rap it on Cannon's head.        ``In the nick of time,'' the Post reported, a staff member       ``grabbed Cannon'' and ``two senators seized the gavel from       McKellar.''        Peace was restored . . . for the moment.        A decade later, another chairman of the Appropriations       Committee--Senator Carl Hayden of Arizona--fought so bitterly       with old Clarence Cannon that the two houses of Congress had       to establish neutral ground.        Like McKellar, Hayden was an old hand at appropriations.       With 50 years of congressional service behind him, his       skillful management of spending bills had earned him the       label, ``the third senator from every state.''        But Hayden's notable length of service had not prepared him       for Clarence Cannon. In the House since 1923, Cannon knew his       way around bicameral disputes.        This was a battle of the titans on Capitol Hill.        ``Government agencies are frantically going broke,'' wrote       a reporter in June of 1962, just because two members of       Congress ``keep yelling at each other.''        For months, Cannon and Hayden had delayed action on       legislation while they argued over seemingly petty issues.        The press dubbed it the ``Battle of the Octogenarians,''       but underlying this crisis was a dispute as old as Congress       itself.        Was the Senate truly the ``upper house''?        Fueling the argument was a long-simmering House resentment       of the Senate's general air of superiority, an attitude which       had resulted in some rather high-handed practices.        For example, for nearly two centuries, all conference       committees had been chaired by senators, and such meetings       had always been held on the Senate side of the Capitol.        In 1962, the House decided to challenge this old custom of       senatorial privilege. Leading the charge was Appropriations       Chairman Clarence Cannon.        Defending the Senate's prerogatives--Carl Hayden.        Cannon informed Hayden that he refused to make the trek to       the Senate side of the Hill for conference meetings. From now       on, he insisted, senators had to walk to the House side--at       least half of the time! Furthermore, he demanded that he be       allowed to chair half of the conferences.        Hayden countered. In that case, he insisted, the Senate       would initiate half of all appropriations bills.        The resulting stalemate lasted for months. Meeting after       meeting produced no agreement. The appropriations process       remained stalled well past the end of the fiscal year, while       government agencies scrambled for funds.        Finally, Carl Hayden called for a truce. He suggested a       special meeting to be held on neutral ground and turned to       Senate Majority Leader Mike Mansfield for a solution.        Needless to say, Mansfield was anxious to end the battle.       He searched for a proper meeting space. Finally, he opened       EF-100, a small room located off the crypt, in the exact       center of the Capitol.        ``I even agreed to have it surveyed,'' Mansfield explained,       ``so that the conference table would not be so much as an       eighth of an inch more on one side than the other.''        Presented with this option, Chairman Cannon agreed to meet       in conference, but stood firm in his demands to co-chair       meetings.        To end the crisis, and probably urged on by Mansfield, Carl       Hayden relented. The Senate sacrificed a few of its cherished       privileges, and government operations returned to normal.        Pundits dismissed the battle as a tempest in a teapot, but       more astute observers recognized that this high-profile       battle was another chapter in an on-going struggle over the       shared constitutional powers of the Senate and the House.        Finally, this evening I would like to highlight an       important but mostly forgotten milestone in this committee's       history.        Since 1867, about 300 senators have served on the       committee. Of those 300, a mere dozen have been women. The       first woman to serve was, of course, Margaret Chase Smith of       Maine, who joined the committee in 1953.        As you all know, in 2012, Senator Barbara Mikulski--the       second woman to serve on the committee--became the first       woman to chair it.        Those are both major milestones in Senate history.        Here's one more.        Way back in 1911, a woman served as chief clerk to the       Senate Appropriations Committee.        Her name was Leona Wells. She joined the Senate's clerical       staff in 1901 and remained on the payroll for 25 years. I       believe her to be the first woman to hold a top committee       position in the Senate.        Born in Illinois in 1877, Wells moved to Wyoming when she       turned 21, because this young suffragist could cast a vote in       Wyoming. There she met Senator Francis E. Warren, whose       patronage brought her to Washington.        As chair of the Military Affairs Committee, Senator Warren       appointed Wells to the committee's clerical staff When he       became chairman of Appropriations in 1911, he brought Wells       with him, giving her the position of chief clerk--although it       appears that the Senate never officially gave her that title.        At the time, Leona Wells was unusual--a well-paid       professional woman on Capitol Hill. In fact, she was so       unusual that she attracted media attention.        Leona Wells ``is probably the most envied woman in       government service,'' reported the Boston Globe in an article       titled ``Uncle Sam's Highest Salaried Woman.''        Not only did she earn a good salary, the Globe noted, but       she is ``the first woman employee of the Senate to be placed       in charge of the affairs of a big committee.''        Wells scouted new territory for female staff, but one area       remained off limits--the Senate Chamber. When Chairman Warren       was on the floor doing committee business, Wells had to wait       outside.        Male committee clerks freely entered the chamber, but the       Senate was not yet ready to admit a female staffer. Instead,       as the Globe reported, Wells waited ``just outside the swing       doors of the chamber . . . and kept the door an inch or two       ajar that she might hear everything that went on inside.''        Leona Wells is largely forgotten now, but her service on       the Appropriations Committee opened a door so other women       could follow. Her story is also part of this committee's       history.        This has been an all-too-brief summary of the history of       this important committee, but I hope it will serve as a       reminder.        Just like Francis Warren or Carl Hayden or even Leona       Wells, all of you--chairs, vice chairs, members, and staff--      are part of the history of the Committee on Appropriations.                            ____________________
