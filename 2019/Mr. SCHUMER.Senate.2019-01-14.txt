 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, as the government shutdown enters its  fourth unfortunate week, its effects are widespread and worsening. As  of Friday, 800,000 public servants were without pay. Tomorrow, roughly  41,000 Active-Duty Coast Guard members won't get their paychecks. By  the end of the week, our Federal courts will start running out of  operating funds. Farmers and small businesses remain unable to access  loans and assistance. Some working families are unable to access home  loans. Food safety inspections are curtailed. Airport terminals are  closing amidst widespread staffing shortages at TSA. The Trump shutdown  is even affecting the opioid crisis. The DEA is in charge of approving  a critical daily medication used by doctors in the recovery and  treatment of opioid addiction. As long as the DEA is shut down, that is  not happening.   It is all the more shameful because the Trump shutdown is a  completely manufactured crisis--manufactured by Donald Trump. The only  reason the government is shut down right now is that President Trump  reversed positions the day before the government funding ran out,  bewildering Senate Democrats and Republicans who were assured he would  sign a stop-gap bill to fund the government.   Leader McConnell is trying to blame the current Speaker of the House.  He is way out to lunch on that one. We are here because the President  reversed himself, and the last Speaker of the House failed to use his  responsibility to put the Senate-passed bill on the floor. This House  has voted to reopen the government. It is the Senate that hasn't done  it because Leader McConnell won't bring the bill to the floor.   President Trump has stubbornly refused to negotiate or soften his  position from the get-go. Democratic leaders and staff have been over  to the White House over and over again to urge the President to open  the government while we negotiate over border security. We are all for  border security. There are different ways to do it. Everyone wants it.  But why shut down the government while we are negotiating that? Every  time we have asked that of the President, he has been intransigent and  uncompromising. He refuses to back down from his position that the  price to reopen the government is $5.7 billion of taxpayer money for a  wall he promised Mexico would pay for.   I want to remind all my Republican colleagues and the American people  that Democrats only want to reopen the government. We offered a  proposal that would separate the government shutdown from our  disagreements over border security.   The House has passed six bills to reopen the government, each of  which was drafted and approved by Senate Republicans. Let me emphasize  that point. The Democratic proposal to reopen the government is to pass  the Republicans' government funding bills. Democrats are not demanding  any added policy changes, no Democratic agenda items, no nothing. These  bills are noncontroversial. Leader McConnell has voted for each of  them.   According to a Quinnipiac poll that just came out, the American  people support our plan by an overwhelming majority--63 percent to 30  percent. A healthy minority of Republicans are for the plan. Thirty- nine percent are for the idea, while only 52 percent are opposed. So  even Republicans are moving to the position: Open the government, and  then debate border security.   President Trump started this shutdown. He is the person continuing  it. It is irresponsible of him to do it. Make no mistake--Democrats are  happy to negotiate about the best way to secure our border, but we need  to open the government first.   The fact that President Trump refuses to consider our proposal means  that he is holding the government and the American people hostage as a  political tactic. To President Trump, innocent, hard-working Americans  are no more than bargaining chips. He will bluster, mislead, and storm  out of meetings until he gets what he wants. That is not how our system  of government works. We don't--we can't--govern by temper tantrum. No  President has done it. If we do not reject government by extortion now,  what is to prevent the same thing from happening  [[Page S168]]  over and over again under this President? What will he do when the debt  ceiling needs to be renewed?   Before the Christmas holiday, we had a solution in sight. We believed  the President would support a true compromise to end the shutdown. At  the last minute, he reversed himself and said no. And now he is  continuing the shutdown.   It is clear that the President doesn't want to end the shutdown--at  least not yet. He has flatly refused our proposal to reopen the  government while we negotiate on border security. He has contradicted  his own deputies--the Vice President, the Chief of Staff--after they  made offers to Democrats. Just this morning, he refused to consider one  of his closest allies, Senator Graham's proposal to open the government  temporarily while we negotiate border security.   How many more reasonable offers can the President reject? How much  more suffering must the President cause before Leader McConnell  realizes it is time to move ahead without him? It seems clear to nearly  everybody but Leader McConnell that Congress needs to move forward  without the President. At every juncture, the President has been the  obstacle to progress. We need intervention.   It is time for Congress to fulfill our constitutional duty to govern,  even without the President. It is time for Leader McConnell to realize  he has the power to break this impasse and pass the House legislation  to reopen the government--legislation his party already supports and  legislation Leader McConnell has voted for and bragged about. The  President is unwilling to move the ball forward, so Congress must. I  urge my friend Leader McConnell to allow a vote on the House-passed  legislation to reopen the government. It seems to be the only way out  right now.                               Russia Sanctions    Madam President, on another matter--Russia sanctions--before the end  of last year, the Trump administration moved to relax sanctions on  three companies owned and controlled by sanctioned Russian oligarch  Oleg Deripaska.   As a reminder, an overwhelming, bipartisan majority of the last  Congress supported additional sanctions on Russia as a response to  President Putin's malign activities, particularly in Ukraine. Oleg  Deripaska and a number of companies he controlled were placed under  U.S. sanctions because Mr. Deripaska was effectively acting as an agent  of Putin's interests abroad, leveraging the wealth he had accrued  through control of these companies.   In my view, the Trump administration's plan to provide sanctions  relief to these companies is deeply flawed and wrong.   First, it fails to sufficiently limit Mr. Deripaska's control and  influence of these companies. Even though this plan brings Deripaska's  ownership interest in these companies down from 70 percent to 45  percent, the terms allow for other Russian shareholders with family and  business ties to Deripaska to maintain shareholder interests. His ex- wife and father-in-law will still own a combined 7 percent in the  company, and a sanctioned Russian bank is acquiring more shares. Even  with the 45 percent, he would probably control it--many American  companies are controlled with far less--but with these additional  people owning shares, there is no doubt that Deripaska continues to  control the company.   Second, it must not be forgotten that Mr. Deripaska is wrapped up in  Special Counsel Mueller's investigation and has deep ties to former  Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort. There should not be sanctions  relief for President Putin's trusted agent before the conclusion of  Special Counsel Mueller's investigation. Just days ago, it was revealed  that former campaign chairman Paul Manafort provided Trump campaign  polling data to a close associate of Mr. Deripaska's. We don't know  what Special Counsel Mueller knows. And the timing--at a time when  these things are coming forward, to undue the sanctions on Rusal is  very suspect.   Lastly, removing sanctions on these companies will benefit President  Putin's government and economy since the export of metals, such as  aluminum, is a key revenue generator for a country that needs revenues.  At a time when Russia has failed to curtail its hostile action against  our Nation and our allies--this is not the moment to give up a source  of leverage over the Russian Government.   Tomorrow, the Senate will take up a motion to disapprove the Treasury  Department's proposal. I strongly believe the Senate should vote to  disapprove. And in a short time, I will be sending a letter to every  single one of my Senate colleagues--Democratic, Republican,  Independent--to urge them to block this misguided effort by the Trump  administration and keep those much needed sanctions in place.   I yield the floor.    I announce that the Senator from Illinois (Mr. Durbin)  and the Senator from Illinois (Ms. Duckworth) are necessarily absent.
