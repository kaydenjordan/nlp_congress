 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 4607, the so-called  Comprehensive Regulatory Review Act. So instead of advancing  legislation that improves our financial regulatory framework, the  Republican majority is pushing yet another bill that is a giveaway to  Wall Street and predatory lenders.   Let's be clear. This bill is intended to dismantle rules considered  inconvenient by the financial services industry. If this bill were  enacted, financial services regulators would be forced to spend more  time and resources on backward-looking reviews and deregulating the  financial services industry rather than strengthening protections for  consumers and the economy.   Allow me to explain. The Economic Growth and Regulatory Paperwork  Reduction Act, or EGRPRA, currently requires the Federal Reserve, the  FDIC, and the OCC to conduct a review of the regulations that they have  issued in order to identify outdated or otherwise unnecessary  regulatory requirements imposed on insured depository institutions.    The banking regulators conduct this review every 10 years, but until  now, this review has been a relatively balanced, careful assessment  that the banking regulators have done twice in the last two decades,  and the regulators have taken this process seriously.   The last review took about 3 years to complete. It involved field  hearings and public engagement. The final review included many balanced  and thoughtful recommendations to improve rules. Many of these would  provide relief for community banks and credit unions but in a way that  also maintains safeguards for consumers and protects the interests of  the public and the broader economy.   Unfortunately, H.R. 4607, this bill, would make three major mistakes  in changing the current review process. First, this bill actually  requires regulators to change regulations so that they are less costly  and burdensome for ``covered persons.''   Well, who are these covered persons? Are they the millions of  consumers who were harmed by Wells Fargo's scheme to open fraudulent  accounts without their knowledge? Were they? No.   Are they the many consumers who learned just a few days ago that  Citigroup violated the law by charging them too much interest on their  credit cards? No, no.   Are these covered persons in this bill the Latino or African-American  families who were discriminated against by JPMorgan Chase, Bank of  America, and so many other banks steering them into more costly  mortgages when they qualified for more affordable loans? No, not at  all.   Are they--the ones who are being protected--are they seniors or  servicemembers who fall prey to payday lenders that trap them in a  cycle of debt? No.   Are they college graduates who are harassed by debt collectors for  their student loan debt? No.   Under this bill, Mr. Speaker, covered persons are defined as ``any  person that engages in offering or providing a consumer financial  product or service; and any affiliate of''--such--``person . . . if  such affiliate acts as a service provider to such person.'' You know  what that means? You know who these so-called covered persons in this  bill are who they are talking about? That means Wells Fargo, JPMorgan  Chase, Citigroup, Bank of America, payday lenders, mortgage brokers,  debt collectors, and thousands of other financial companies.   All of these companies would get easier rules that limit their costs  and burdens without appropriately considering the impact they are going  to have on their customers. And this bill does nothing, absolutely  nothing, to strengthen protections for consumers where there might be  deficiencies or gaps in our regulatory framework.   Second, unlike the other banking regulators, which are tasked with  ensuring the safety and soundness of the financial services sector, the  Consumer Bureau's unique mission is the protection of consumers and of  ensuring that the consumer marketplace operates in a fair, transparent,  and competitive manner.   Although it may make sense for the banking agencies to periodically  review their prudential rules, with a focus on their regulated  entities, the Consumer Bureau should be making sure that its rules are  appropriately protecting consumers and the interests of the public, not  the big financial corporations.   In addition, the Consumer Bureau is already subject to unique  accountability and oversight measures that the other financial  regulators are not. These special checks and balances include the  requirement that the Consumer Bureau have small business review panels  as a part of its rulemaking process and the ability of the Financial  Stability Oversight Council, that is, FSOC, to repeal any of its final  rules. And the Consumer Bureau is already required to review all of the  significant rules within 5 years of the time they go into effect, but  in a balanced--balanced--manner.   The third problem with H.R. 4607 is that it would make it harder for  the regulators to do their jobs. The bill would require a comprehensive  review of all banking and consumer protection regulations once every 7  years instead of every decade. If regulators take these reviews as  seriously as their previous reviews, as I believe they would, then that  would mean they would be tied up spending nearly half of each 7-year  cycle doing regulatory reviews instead of supervising their regulated  entities and enforcing the law.   This bill would impose an unbalanced review process on regulators  that favors industries' wishes--favors industries' wishes over  consumers and the economy. The methodology in this bill promotes  deregulation. That is what this is all about. This is a bill about  deregulation instead of creating a robust process to identify gaps or  deficiencies in oversight that harm consumers, undermine the safety and  soundness of our financial system, or jeopardize the country's  financial stability.   So I cannot support a bill that forces the Consumer Bureau to weaken  rules for Wall Street and payday lenders. I am talking about the  Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. I urge my colleagues to oppose  H.R. 4607.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1245     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I knew that my friends on the opposite side of the aisle  would basically refer to small banks.   This is what is normally done when we see deregulatory efforts being  made. They talk about how they are trying to help small and community  banks, and they fail to talk about the major financial institutions  that I have talked about in my presentation that are the beneficiaries,  also, of this deregulatory effort that is being put forth.   When I take a look at the existing law now and the Economic Growth  and Regulatory Paperwork Reduction Act, I see that their mission is to  conduct a review of their regulations to identify outdated or otherwise  unnecessary regulatory requirements imposed on insured depository  institutions.   This deregulatory bill that we have before us goes a lot further. As  I said, it is about deregulation, and it is about reducing cost and  liability risk. This does not benefit our consumers at all.   Again, what we would do in the passage of this bill is simply open up  opportunities for the big banks and financial institutions to get rid  of the kind of oversight, the kind of laws that we have worked so hard  for because it is inconvenient for them or it interferes with their  bottom line in some way.   So I do not want our Members to be tricked or fooled to think, number  one, this is simply about further getting rid of paperwork or that this  is about supporting the small banks. This is about new ways by which to  deregulate so that the big banks that are now found to be defrauding,  found to be discriminating, found to be doing things like Wells Fargo  has done, this is about deregulation that will further enhance their  ability to do the kinds of things that we claim to be so opposed to and  that harm our consumers.   The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau that they are now including  by way of H.R. 4607 should be looked at very carefully.   First of all, my friends on the opposite side of the aisle hate the  Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. They want to get rid of it. They  have tried, time and time again, to undermine it in so many ways. The  President has sent Mr. Mulvaney over there, who is supposed to be over  at the Office of Management and Budget, to basically destroy it.   Mr. Speaker, we cannot allow the Members of Congress to be tricked or  fooled that somehow this is helpful that they are bringing in the  Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. What they want to do is tie the  hands of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and basically change  their mission from protection for consumers to deregulation for the  biggest banks in America.   Why do we have the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau? That is the  centerpiece of the Dodd-Frank reform legislation that we worked so hard  on.   Are we forgetting about what happened in 2008?   Are with forgetting about the recession that was caused by the big  banks who had been involved with all of these exotic products and ways  by which they were enticing would-be homeowners to try and get  mortgages?   We can't forget about all of that. We have to know that not only did  we have a recession, we were headed for a depression. Dodd-Frank reform  has gone a long way toward eliminating some of the bad practices that  were in place that got us into that situation in the first place.  [[Page H1386]]    Now, little by little, my friends on the opposite side of the aisle  keep trying to creep in with new ways that they can support these big  banks and financial institutions and deregulate and let them get in the  position again where they are tricking our consumers, where they are  coming up with these exotic products that caused our consumers to  eventually get into foreclosure, and that would allow the big banks  again, like Wells Fargo, to come up with all of these tricks that they  use in order to enhance their bottom line. I think we are smarter than  this, and I don't think that we are going to go for this legislation  that is just another way to open the doors to deregulate.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance  of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance  of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve  the balance of my time.    I continue to reserve the balance of  my time, Mr. Speaker.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the  balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, before I proceed with my closing, I would just like to  make a few comments about some of the information that was shared with  us by Members on the opposite side of the aisle. I want to remind them  that these poor little banks that you are talking about, which include  all of the big banks in America, made record profits in 2016--more than  $170 billion--and they are going to make billions more from that tax  bill, that tax scam giveaway to Wall Street. Lending is up 75 percent  since 2010.   So when my friends on the opposite side of the aisle continue to talk  about how the banks are suffering, I don't know who they are talking  about. As a matter of fact, the real bipartisanship of this committee  is about community banks, and Democrats have led and will continue to  lead on every way and everything that we can do for community banks.                                time  1315    Mr. Speaker, I notice that when my friends on the opposite side of  the aisle come in with deregulation, they frame it in such a way that  you would think that it is all about community banks, when, in fact,  they always attach anything they do for community banks to the biggest  banks in America.   So, Mr. Speaker, H.R. 4607 demonstrates just how much my colleagues  on the other side of the aisle value the interests of Wall Street over  families and consumers on Main Street.   This bill would direct the banking, credit union, and consumer  protection regulators to loosen their rules to benefit bad actors on  Wall Street. The bill doesn't even allow regulators to consider how to  improve safeguards to better protect consumers.   It is absurd that we are here today discussing yet another bill that  leads to massive deregulation and seeks to tip the scales in favor of  the financial industry. The interests of the public are what we should  be focused on.   This bill is yet another piece of the harmful and reckless Republican  agenda. Only a few months ago, Republicans jammed their tax scam  legislation through this Chamber. They added $1.8 trillion to the  Federal debt in order to line the pockets of Wall Street and other  megacorporations with billions in tax cuts, leaving families on Main  Street and generations of their children just to pick up the tab.  Democrats rejected that terrible piece of legislation and should now  reject H.R. 4607 as well.   Americans for Financial Reform, a coalition of more than 200 consumer  civil rights, investor, retiree, community, labor, faith-based, and  business groups said that H.R. 4607, ``contains no consideration of the  public benefits that are the justification for creating the regulations  in the first place, and which regulators should be seeking to preserve.  Any mandate to tailor regulations must include consideration of public  benefits, rather than being a one-sided directive to reduce business  costs.'' I agree.   For Members who are concerned with maintaining strong protections, I  would highlight that Trump's OMB Director, Mick Mulvaney, has been  illegally installed as Acting Director of the Consumer Financial  Protection Bureau and is working every day to dial back the important  work of the Consumer Bureau from within.   Congress should not be giving Mr. Mulvaney, or anyone the President  eventually appoints and is confirmed to serve as the next Director of  the Consumer Bureau, a green light to gut consumer protections and  reduce the Consumer Bureau's ability to hold bad actors accountable.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose H.R. 4607, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the  yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
