 Madam President:   Right now, we are on the precipice of a constitutional crisis. We are  about to step into the abyss. I want to talk for a few minutes why we  are on that precipice and why we are looking into the abyss.         Let me first ask a fundamental question: What is the crisis       that calls for the undoing of two centuries of tradition? . .       . Are . . . Senators merely doing their jobs as legislators,       responding to a generalized public calling for the abolition       of the filibuster? Clearly not. It is not the American people       at large who are demanding detonation of the nuclear option.        [T]he nuclear option is being pushed largely by the       radioactive rhetoric of a small band of radicals who hold in       their hands the political fortunes of the President.        Constitutional scholars will tell us that the reason we       have these rules in the Senate--unlimited debate, two-thirds       to change the rules, the idea that 60 have to close off       debate--is embodied in the spirit and rule of the       Constitution. . . . That is what the Constitution is all       about, and we all know it.        It is the Senate where the Founding Fathers established a       repository of checks and balances. It is not like the House       of Representatives where the majority leader or the Speaker       can snap his fingers and get what he wants. . . . On       important issues, the Founding Fathers wanted--and they were       correct in my judgment--that the slimmest majority should not       always govern. . . . The Senate is not a majoritarian body.        The bottom line is very simple: The ideologues in the       Senate want to turn what the Founding Fathers called the       cooling saucer of democracy into the rubber stamp of       dictatorship. . . . They want to make this country into a       banana republic where if you don't get your way, you change       the rules! Are we going to let them? It'll be a doomsday for       democracy if we do.        I, for one, hope and pray that it will not come to this.       But I assure my colleagues, at least speaking for this       Senator . . . I will do everything I can to prevent the       nuclear option from being invoked not for the sake of myself       or my party but for the sake of this great Republic and its       traditions.    Those are powerful words, but they are not mine. Every word of my  speech today was originally spoken by our esteemed colleague, the  senior Senator from New York, Chuck Schumer. Senator Schumer spoke so  eloquently in defense of the Senate's rules, customs, and traditions  when the fortunes of his party looked a little different. My, how times  have changed. Now it is Senator Schumer's fingers that are hovering  over the nuclear button, ready to destroy the Senate for partisan  advantage.   Think about it. The narrowest majority in Senate history wants to  break the Senate rules to control how voters in every State elect  Senators. Could there be a better argument to preserving the Senate's  rules, customs, and traditions?   So, before it is too late, let us reflect on the wise and eloquent  words of Senator Schumer's, words that are as true today as they were  when he spoke them, even if Senator Schumer is singing a different tune  today.   I yield the floor.
