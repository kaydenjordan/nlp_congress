 Madam President, section 36(b) of the Arms Export Control  Act requires that Congress receive prior notification of certain  proposed arms sales as defined by that statute. Upon such notification,  the Congress has 30 calendar days during which the sale may be  reviewed. The provision stipulates that, in the Senate, the  notification of proposed sales shall be sent to the chairman of the  Senate Foreign Relations Committee.   In keeping with the committee's intention to see that relevant  information is available to the full Senate, I ask unanimous consent to  have printed in the Record the notifications which have been received.  If the cover letter references a classified annex, then such annex is  available to all Senators in the office of the Foreign Relations  Committee, room SD-423.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                    Defense Security                                              Cooperation Agency,                                                      Arlington, VA.

(viii) Date Report Delivered to Congress: July 29, 2019.        *As defined in Section 47(6) of the Arms Export Control       Act.                             POLICY JUSTIFICATION   Canada--Multifunctional Information Distribution System (MIDS)--Joint                      Tactical Radio System (JTRS)(5)         The Government of Canada has requested to buy one hundred       fifty-two (152) MIDS JTRS (5) with Remote Power Supply. Also       included are spare cables and MIDS batteries; Link-16 mobile       racks; diagnostic support tools; technical documentation;       training and engineering technical support; and other related       elements of logistics and program support. The total       estimated program cost is $44 million.        This proposed sale will support the foreign policy and       national security objectives of the United States by helping       to improve the military capability of Canada, a NATO ally       that is an important force for ensuring political stability       and economic progress and a contributor to military,       peacekeeping and humanitarian operations around the world.        Canada intends to upgrade its current inventory of CF-18       Aircraft, CC-130J, and the Royal Canadian Air Force's Ground       Stations with the purchase of these MIDS JTRS (5) terminals       to be fully interoperable with U.S. and allied forces to       support and compliment joint operations in a net-enabled       environment; have modernized electronic protection and       secure, jam-resistant wave forms; and be capable of improved       Link-16 message exchange and information fidelity including       support to advanced weapon employment. Canada will have no       difficulty absorbing this equipment into its armed forces.        The proposed sale of this equipment and support will not       alter the basic military balance in the region.        The principal contractors for MIDS JTRS are Viasat,       Incorporated, headquartered in Carlsbad, CA and Data Link       Solutions, headquartered in Cedar Rapids, IA. The Government       of Canada is expected to negotiate an offset agreement with       the principal contractor(s), in accordance with Canada's       Industrial and Technological Benefits (ITB) Policy, before       signing the Letter of Offer and Acceptance (LOA), but details       are not known at this time.        Implementation of this proposed sale will not require the       assignment of additional U.S.  [[Page S5188]]       Government or contractor representatives to Canada. However,       it is anticipated that engineering and technical support       services provided by the U.S. Government may be required on       an interim basis for training and technical assistance.        There will be no adverse impact on U.S. defense readiness       as a result of this proposed sale.                            Transmittal No. 19-35       Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of Offer Pursuant to           Section 36(b)(1) of the Arms Export Control Act                             Annex Item No. vii         (vii) Sensitivity of Technology:        1. The Multifunctional Information Distribution System       (MIDS) Joint Tactical Radio (JTRS) is a software defined       radio. The MIDS JTRS Programmable Secure Information Security       Architecture Module (PSISAM) is Critical Program Information       (CPI). The PSISAM is embedded in a MIDS JTRS Shop Replaceable       Unit (SRU) and contains the information security hardware and       cryptographic keys necessary to operate the terminal. MIDS       JTRS contains embedded COMSEC and is capable of processing up       to TOP SECRET information. Each MIDS JTRS contains an       embedded SRU that is UNCLASSIFIED Controlled Cryptographic       Information (CCI). Un-keyed terminals and de-energized       terminals are UNCLASSIFIED CCI. When a terminal is operating       on the host platform it is classified up to the level of data       being transmitted.        2. If a technologically advanced adversary were to obtain       knowledge of the specific hardware and software elements, the       information could be used to develop countermeasures or       equivalent systems, which might reduce weapon system       effectiveness or be used in the development of a system with       similar or advanced capabilities.        3. A determination has been made that Canada can provide       substantially the same degree of protection for the       technology being released as the U.S. Government. This sale       supports the U.S. foreign policy and national security       objectives as outlined in the Policy Justification.        4. All defense articles and services listed in this       transmittal have been authorized for release and export to       Canada.                            ____________________     Madam President, section 36(b) of the Arms Export Control  Act requires that Congress receive prior notification of certain  proposed arms sales as defined by that statute.

(ii) Total Estimated Value:        Major Defense Equipment * $0 million.        Other $554 million.        Total $554 million.        (iii) Description and Quantity or Quantities of Articles or       Services under Consideration for Purchase: Foreign Military       Sales (FMS) case EG-P-GKB, implemented in September 2018, was       below congressional notification threshold at $45 million ($0       in MDE) and provided for material and labor services in       support of Oliver Hazard Perry Class Frigates (FFG-7), Fast       Missile Craft (FMC), Mine Hunter Coastal (MHC) ships, Coastal       Mine Hunter (CMH) ships, and 25 Meter and 28 Meter Fast       Patrol Craft (FPC). Egypt has requested the case be amended       to continue providing the same support on the basic case.       This amendment will push the current case above the non-MDE       or services congressional notification threshold and thus       requires notification of the entire case.        Major Defense Equipment (MDE): None.        Non-MDE: Provides for material and labor services in       support of Oliver Hazard Perry Class Frigates (FFG-7 class       ships), Fast Missile Craft (FMC), Mine Hunter Coastal (MHC)       ships, Coastal Mine Hunter (CMH) ships, and 25 Meter and 28       Meter Fast Patrol Craft (FPC).

Policy Justification                 Egypt--Follow on Technical Support (FOTS)         The Government of Egypt has requested a possible sale of       Follow on Technical Support (FOTS) that provides for material       and labor services in support of Oliver Hazard Perry Class       Frigates (FFG-7) class ships), Fast Missile Craft (FMC), Mine       Hunter Coastal (MHC) ships, Coastal Mine Hunter (CMH) ships,       and 25 Meter and 28 Meter Fast Patrol Craft (FPC). The       estimated cost is $554 million.        This proposed sale will support the foreign policy and       national security of the United States by helping to provide       a strategic partner with critical support for multiple type       ships responsible for Egypt's maritime security. The proposed       sale is essential to maintain Egypt's national security,       regional stability, and the free flow of worldwide commerce       via the Suez Canal.        Egypt intends to use this technical maintenance and service       support to ensure the Egyptian Navy is operationally capable       of providing coastal defense and security. The proposed sale       will increase the Egyptian Navy's material and operational       readiness. Egypt will have no difficulties absorbing this       support into its armed forces.        The proposed sale will not alter the basic military balance       in the region.        The prime contractor for Engineering Services Support will       be VSE Corporation and U.S. Government activities will       provide FOTS for Egypt. There are no known offset agreements       proposed in connection with this potential sale.        Implementation of this proposed sale will require periodic       trips to Egypt involving U.S. Government and contractor       representatives for technical reviews, support, and oversight       for approximately five years.        There will be no adverse impact on U.S. defense readiness       as a result of this proposal sale.                            ____________________     Madam President, section 36(b) of the Arms Export Control  Act requires that Congress receive prior notification of certain  proposed arms sales as defined by that statute.

The Republic of       Korea is one of the major political and economic powers in       East Asia and the Western Pacific and a key partner of the       United States in ensuring peace and stability in that region.       It is vital to U.S. national interests to assist the Republic       of Korea in developing and maintaining a strong and ready       self-defense capability.        This proposed sale will enable the Republic of Korea to       sustain and operate its fleet of RQ-4 Block 30 remotely       piloted aircraft and will significantly advance U.S.       interests in standardization with the Republic of Korea's       Armed Forces. The potential sale will further strengthen the       interoperability between the United States and the Republic       of Korea and ensures the Alliance has a robust intelligence,       surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) capability on the       Korean peninsula. The ROK will have no difficulty absorbing       this equipment into its armed forces.        The proposed sale of this equipment and support will not       alter the basic military balance in the region.        The principal contractor will be Northrop Grumman       Corporation located in Palmdale, CA. There are no known       offset agreements proposed in conjunction with this potential       sale. Any offset agreement will be defined in negotiations       between the Purchaser and the prime contractor.        Implementation of the proposed sale will not require the       assignment of any additional U.S. Government or contractor       representatives to the ROK.        There will be no adverse impact on U.S. defense readiness       as a result of this proposed sale.        All defense articles and services in this transmittal have       been approved for release and export to the Republic of       Korea.                            ____________________     Madam President, section 36(b) of the Arms Export Control  Act requires that Congress receive prior notification of certain  proposed arms sales as defined by that statute.

POLICY JUSTIFICATION                Thailand--Stryker Infantry Carrier Vehicles         The Government of Thailand has requested to buy sixty (60)       Stryker Infantry Carrier Vehicles (ICV); and sixty (60) M2       Flex .50 cal machine guns. Also included are spare parts,       Basic Issue Items (BII), Components of End Items (COEI),       Additional Authorized List (AAL) (specific items for       operations and maintenance), Special Tools and Test Equipment       (STTE), technical manuals, OCONUS Deprocessing Service, M6       smoke grenade launchers (4 per vehicle) and associated       spares, AN/VAS-5 Driver's Vision Enhancer (DVE), AN/VIC-3       vehicle intercommunications system, contractor provided       training and Field Service Representatives (FSR), and other       related elements of logistics and program support. The total       estimated program cost is $175 million.        This proposed sale will support the foreign policy and       national security objectives of the United States by helping       to improve security of a Major Non-NATO ally in INDO-PACOM       which is an important force for political stability and       economic progress in the region.        The Stryker vehicles will increase Thailand's capability to       defend its sovereign territory against traditional and non-      traditional threats by filling the capability void between       light infantry soldiers and heavy mechanized units. Thailand       will have no difficulty absorbing this equipment into its       armed forces.        The proposed sale of this equipment and support will not       alter the basic military balance in the region.        The principal contractor for the Stryker vehicle is General       Dynamics Land Systems, Sterling Heights, MI. There are no       known offset agreements proposed in connection with this       potential sale.        Implementation of this proposed sale will not require the       assignment of any permanent additional U.S. Government or       Contractor representatives to Thailand.        There will be no adverse impact on U.S. defense readiness       as a result of this proposed sale.                            Transmittal No. 19-33       Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of Offer Pursuant to           Section 36(b)(1) of the Arms Export Control Act        Annex Item No. vii        (vii) Sensitivity of Technology:        1. The M1126 Stryker is an infantry carrier vehicle       transporting nine soldiers, their mission equipment and a       crew of two consisting of a driver and vehicle commander. It       is equipped with armor protection, M2 machine guns and M6       Smoke Grenade Launchers for self-protection. The Stryker is       an eight-wheeled vehicle powered by a 350hp diesel engine. It       incorporates a central tire inflation system, run-flat tires,       and a vehicle height management system. The Stryker is       capable of supporting a communications suite, a Global       Positioning System (GPS), and a high  [[Page S5191]]       frequency and near-term digital radio systems. The Stryker is       deployable by C-130 aircraft and combat capable upon arrival.       The Stryker is capable of self-deployment by highway and       self-recovery. It has a low noise level that reduces crew       fatigue and enhances survivability. It moves about the       battlefield quickly and is optimized for close, complex, or       urban terrain. The Stryker program leverages nondevelopmental       items with common subsystems and components to quickly       acquire and field these systems. Stryker is UNCLASSIFIED.        2. The AN/VAS-5 Driver's Vision Enhancer (DVE) is a compact       thermal camera providing armored vehicle drivers with day or       night time visual awareness in clear or reduced vision (fog,       smoke, dust) situation. The system provides the driver a 180       degree viewing angle using a high resolution infrared sensor       and image stabilization to reduce the effect of shock and       vibration. The viewer and monitor are ruggedized for       operation in tactical environments. The system is       UNCLASSIFIED but considered SENSITIVE technology.        3. If a technologically advanced adversary were to obtain       knowledge of the specific hardware and software elements, the       information could be used to develop countermeasures that       might reduce weapon system effectiveness or be used in the       development of a system with similar or advanced       capabilities.        4. A determination has been made that Thailand can provide       substantially the same degree of protection for the       technology being released as the U.S. Government. This sale       supports the U.S. foreign policy and national security       objectives as outlined in the Policy Justification.        5. All defense articles and services listed in this       transmittal have been authorized for release and export to       Thailand.                            ____________________     Madam President, Idaho's entrepreneurs are  passionate individuals who consistently innovate and provide high- quality products and services. As a member and former chairman of the  Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, it is my  distinct privilege to recognize Empire Airlines as the Idaho Small  Business of the Month for August 2019. Located in Hayden, Empire  Airlines is an international air carrier and heavy maintenance repair  station with decades of experience and a history of success.   In 1977, Nick Chenoweth and Vic Walters founded Clearwater Flying  Service, which later became Empire Airlines. Neither Chenoweth nor  Walters were pilots, nor had they any experience running an airline. A  third partner, Mel Spelde, joined the company just 2 months later as  flight instructor and manager. Early jobs for the business included  fire patrol, air ambulance, charters, flight instruction, transporting  backcountry hunters and anglers, and cloud seeding in Libya. The  business quickly adopted a ``go anywhere, do anything'' attitude, which  is reflected in its motto, ``We Can Do That.'' As the business grew,  they eventually changed the name to Empire Airlines. Now run by  president and CEO, Tim Komberec, Empire Airlines focuses on cargo,  maintenance, and airline startups.   Over the years, Empire steadily grew but never lost the try-anything,  go-anywhere spirit embodied in its motto. Empire now has an aerospace  division to provide state-of-the-art maintenance for aircraft, as well  as an unmanned division, which provides drone services to help clients  solve problems and reach goals. Empire Airlines also provides  consulting services to help others jump-start their airline operation.   Empire Airlines strives to be a valued member of the community,  supporting various charities and causes, including drug-free high  school graduation parties in the area and numerous other events. What  might be most impressive is the way Empire celebrates the many  employees who have reached 25 years with the company by giving them a  place in the timeline of the company's history posted publicly on its  website.   Empire Airlines' success is a prime example of Idaho's  entrepreneurial spirit: Dare to dream, look at things differently,  never give up, and when opportunity calls, answer with ``We can do  that.'' The State of Idaho is proud to be home to innovative, hard- working entrepreneurs like Nick, Vic, Mel, and all of those at Empire  Airlines. The entire Empire family shows how one big idea and a  dedication to hard work can lead to small business success. I would  like to congratulate Tim Komberec and all of the employees at Empire  Airlines on being named the ``Idaho Small Business of the Month'' for  August 2019. I look forward to watching your continued growth and  success.                            ____________________
