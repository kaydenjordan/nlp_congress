 First, for the information of all of our colleagues,  later this morning I will introduce a continuing resolution that will  ensure continuous funding to the Federal Government. The measure will  provide the resources necessary to continue normal operations through  February 8.   Let's review why this step was necessary.   Even in the face of a great need to secure the border and following  good-faith efforts by the President's team, our Democratic colleagues  rejected an extremely reasonable offer yesterday. It would have cleared  the remaining appropriation bills, which had received bipartisan  support in committee, and provided an additional $1 billion to tackle a  variety of urgent border security priorities.   I am sorry that my Democratic colleagues couldn't put their  partisanship aside and show the same good faith and flexibility that  the President has shown in order to provide the resources our Nation  needs to secure the integrity of our borders as well as the safety of  American families, but this seems to be the reality of our political  moment. It seems like political spite, for the President may be winning  out over sensible policy--even sensible policies that are more modest  than border security allocations that many Democrats themselves have  supported in the very recent past.   Faced with this intransigence--with Democrats' failure to take our  borders seriously--Republicans will continue to fulfill our duty to  govern. That is why we will soon take up a simple measure that will  continue government funding into February, so that we can continue this  vital debate after the new Congress has convened, because--make no  mistake--there will be important unfinished business in front of us,  and we owe it to the American people to finally tackle it.   Just last week, U.S. Customs and Border Commissioner Kevin McAleenan  told our colleagues on the Judiciary Committee that the United States  faces a border security and humanitarian crisis--a border security and  humanitarian crisis.   These are some of the facts. In the past year alone, we saw a 30- percent increase in apprehensions by CBP, including nearly 6,700  apprehensions of individuals with criminal histories and a 50-percent  increase in apprehensions of known gang members. We have seen a 75- percent spike in methamphetamine seizures since fiscal 2015. So it is  quite obvious that shoring up our borders is an urgent need for our  national security--no question about it.   Secure borders are what the American people expect and they deserve.  That is why it continues to be a major focus of President Trump and his  administration. Already the President's approach to border security is  yielding undeniable results. In each of four CBP sectors where physical  borders have been improved or expanded--El Paso, Yuma, Tucson, and San  Diego--illegal traffic has dropped by at least 90 percent.   While you wouldn't know it from listening to the far-left special  interests, this administration's focus on border security actually  follows similar commonsense efforts that used to be a bipartisan  consensus.   It used to be a bipartisan consensus. In 2006, for example, the  Secure Fence Act, which is designed to strengthen physical security  measures at the border, received the support of no fewer than 26 of our  Democratic colleagues, including the current Democratic leader, along  with Senators Feinstein, Carper, Nelson, Stabenow, Wyden, and Obama.   In 2010, President Obama signed a bill to increase the CBP's physical  presence down at the border. It passed the Senate by unanimous consent,  by the way.   So let's not pretend there is some bright-line principle that  separates the billions of dollars that our Democratic colleagues were  willing and eager to spend on border security in the recent  [[Page S7824]]  past and the resources now requested by the President and his team.  There is no big difference in principle. There has just been a shift in  the political winds on the far left. This is knee-jerk, partisan  opposition to the administration's reasonable and flexible requests.  This is making political obstruction a higher goal than the integrity  of our Nation's borders. Frankly, it is just political spite, and the  American people know it when they see it.   So the Senate will continue our work on the remaining bills--the  products of much bipartisan hard work and collaboration, and, in the  meantime, we will turn to a clean continuing resolution later today so  we can make sure we don't end this year the way we began it--with  another government shutdown because of the Democrats' allergy to  sensible immigration policies. That is what they did at the beginning  of the year.   We need the government to remain open for the American people. We  need to wrap up our work for this year, and I hope that my Democratic  friends return next year ready to join the President, this Senate  majority, and the American people in our desire to secure our border.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on a completely different matter, from  time to time, each of us has indulged in jokes and finger-pointing that  sustain the friendly rivalry between the House and the Senate--the  Founders' metaphorical teacup and saucer. Make no mistake. I am  thankful every day that so many former Representatives see the light  and come over to join us in the Upper Chamber, but for the past 3  years, there is no one outside of the Senate with whom I have partnered  more closely than the Speaker of the House, Paul Ryan.   As history will remember, the speakership was far from the  destination that the contented Ways and Means chairman had in mind when  our friend John Boehner announced his retirement in 2015, but to the  great fortune of the entire Republican Party, Paul had demonstrated  over his years in the House the very qualities his conference needed  most.   Everyone knew he had uncompromising integrity, seemingly  inexhaustible energy, the trust and admiration of his fellow Members,  and he had an aspirational message about what we stood for as  Republicans. He has reminded our party, as clearly and forcefully as  any leader of his generation, about all that our party can and should  aspire to be--``not pale pastels,'' in Ronald Reagan's timeless words,  ``but bold colors.'' His colleagues knew he had all of these qualities,  and we knew it here in the Senate.   While I was far from the most crucial member of the pressure  campaign--a draft effort that even roped in the Cardinal Archbishop of  New York--I will admit that I picked up the phone too. I called Paul  and told him exactly what he didn't want to hear--that he was the right  man at the right moment. Conveniently, I was about to get on a plane to  Iraq at the time. So Paul didn't have much of an opportunity to push  back.   Over the past 3 years, I have had more opportunities than most to see  the right man in action. We have met weekly to coordinate the efforts  of our majorities and present a united front on behalf of the American  people. At times the cohesion between our teams made it feel like we  shared one large staff. So I have seen firsthand how much of what we  have been able to accomplish this Congress has been due in huge part to  Paul's serious approach and to his principles and his pragmatism alike.   He helped lead the way on last year's comprehensive reform of our Tax  Code, turning his decades-long personal mission into a brighter future  for millions of American workers and job creators.   He navigated tense funding negotiations with a deep understanding of  his Members' concerns and stood firm in support of America's military,  helping to deliver the largest year-on-year increase in defense funding  in 15 years.   He stayed true to his heart, putting Catholic social teaching into  practice and fighting for policies of all shapes and sizes to lift up  the most vulnerable among us, from the working poor to the victims of  human trafficking.   His tenure as Speaker has proved a perfect capstone to a remarkable  career in Congress. Every step of the way, Paul has shattered myths and  stereotypes about what conservative leaders are like.   Through his long list of accomplishments and his personal witness  alike, he has demonstrated that faith in American free enterprise and  individual liberty are not quaint, outdated ideas but essential and  timeless principles.   He has helped prove that right-of-center values are not only the  basis for protest movements, as some cynics had liked to suggest, they  are also the foundation for governing majorities.   He has shown that our party's ideals and principles do not clash  whatsoever with the moral priority we should place on those at the  margins of society but rather that those ideas are often the best means  to honor that commitment.   Talk about a product of the Jack Kemp coaching tree. It is safe to  say the Speaker's cherished mentor would be mighty proud. Paul's time  at the center stage of our Nation's politics has inspired countless  Americans, including a new generation of leaders, but speaking  personally, more than any one of the accomplishments that I have been  proud to work with Paul to help to secure, I think I will most remember  how he has done that job; how energetically and happily the Speaker has  poured himself into each task at hand. No matter if some said it  couldn't be done, no matter that he hadn't sought the job in the first  place, the happy warrior has been undeterred.   For all this says about Paul Ryan the Speaker, it says even more  about Paul Ryan the man. He has a big heart and a razor-sharp mind. It  doesn't take long to notice either one, and he knows how to lead with  both.   He is a man of profound faith and abiding patriotism, and even after  20 years of Washington, he remains a staunch optimist. Paul is quick to  insist that America's brightest days are yet to come and even quicker  to back up the sentiment with action.   Working with Speaker Ryan has been among the great joys of my career  in the Senate. The Nation is so much better for his leadership, and I  am better for his friendship. I am so grateful to Paul for everything.  I wish him, Janna, and their lovely family great happiness in whatever  adventures lie ahead.                            ____________________     Mr. President, now I am down to my very last end-of- year tribute to a Member of this body. I offer this one with the very  greatest reluctance.   This one isn't occasioned by any retirement. Fortunately, for all of  us, Senator John Cornyn isn't going anywhere. He will be right here  with us when the 116th Congress convenes in January, but he will no  longer be serving as Republican whip. His tenure in this key leadership  role is almost complete. So I could not let the week pass without  sharing for the official Record--and with all of our colleagues--a  small slice of the tremendous gratitude and respect and admiration I  feel for the senior Senator from Texas.   John and I were already well acquainted when he took over the whip  role 6 years ago in relief of Jon Kyl, but still, I wasn't sure exactly  what our relationship would look like. You never quite know in advance.  Everybody is different, but just a few weeks into our partnership as  leader and whip, John presented me with a birthday gift that told me at  least three things about him.   He framed and autographed a picture of ourselves--just an ordinary,  not particularly glamorous shot of the two of us, plus John Barrasso,  probably talking with the press there in the Ohio Clock corridor.   A somewhat unusual gift, I thought. Lesson No. 1: This guy has a  sense of humor and good cheer. In this photo, I am kind of standing  front and center. Six-foot-one John is standing right behind me, a  little out of focus and halfway in the shadow. So there is lesson No.  2: Humility.   Then there was his handwritten message: ``Happy birthday, Mitch--I've  got your back.'' That was lesson No. 3. It spoke for itself and how  fortunate I  [[Page S7825]]  have been to be reminded every single day since that John Cornyn meant  exactly what he said.   John has proven to be a stunningly effective whip for the Republican  conference these past years. He has also been more than a solid friend  and a wiser, more loyal counselor than I had any right to expect.   The whip is a powerful position. The conference trusts you to help  lead them. Your peers trust you with your candor and their concerns. As  each piece of legislation progresses, different groups of your  colleagues are trusting you to help secure accomplishments that are  huge priorities for them and their own constituents.   So it is easy to imagine ways this critical role could go off the  rails. You could wear out your welcome with some of your colleagues.  You could become too focused on notching today's win at the expense of  tomorrow's relationships and good feelings. You could let personal  disagreements threaten the unity of your leadership team and your  conference, but as those who know him well can attest, these aren't  worries that keep John up at night. That is because he is the  quintessential team player, not focused on personal gain, dedicated to  the causes that matter to Texas and his Members, and willing to roll up  his sleeves and do the hefty lifting himself to advance those goals.    You know, they say everything is bigger in Texas, and sure enough,  ``Big John'' has been known to ride across the screen in campaign spots  from time to time, but somewhere along the way, John's ego didn't get  the message. John doesn't twist arms or get angry. He doesn't playact  at being the bad cop. Instead, he listens. He learns. He pours his time  and energy into learning all about his colleagues, their concerns,  their State's priorities.   People outside the Senate might think someone in John's position  would need to act like a bully. The term ``whip'' certainly sends that  message, but John knows that scare tactics don't do many favors in the  long run. The winning strategy on Team Cornyn has been less like the  Mafia and more like savvy and heartfelt customer service, and they sure  have a lot to show for it. The more I have been reflecting on why John  has had so much success, I have kept coming back to the fact that this  man was a judge--a Texas Supreme Court justice, to be exact. In a  courtroom, the judge has the power, but their job isn't to wheedle or  persuade. It is to listen fairly to all parties, all theories, and all  ideas. Give everyone a hearing, take it all in, and then chart the best  course possible.   How lucky we have all been to have somebody like that whipping votes  for the last 6 years.   It is a privilege to see John at work. It has been an honor to work  in the trenches with him day after day these past 6 years. To be more  accurate, it has been a pleasure to stand shoulder to shoulder with him  here in the well.   We have had our fair share of quality time. At the end of any  Congress, you would expect the majority leader and whip might have a  small handful of close shaves and dramatic moments to reflect on, but  John has helped steer the ship with the slimmest possible majorities.  Week after week, 51 to 49, then 50 to 49, in many cases.   We have seen this play out in the confirmation of a historic number  of well-qualified nominees to the Federal judiciary and in the passage  of major legislation of delicate moving parts, from comprehensive tax  reform to a landmark opioids package.   The truth is, even a comprehensive catalog of all the big floor votes  would only capture a fraction of John's excellent work. More key  nominees and important pieces of legislation have traveled quietly  through the Senate because John has been there, diligent and patient  and respectful, working through challenges and addressing concerns,  literally, around the clock.   As if this wasn't enough to fill John's plate, let's remember, while  serving as whip, he has also been a vital member of the Intelligence  Committee, Judiciary Committee, and the Finance Committee, and he has  been an outstanding senior Senator for Texas all at the same time.   In fact, in each of the past two Congresses, no Senator has been the  lead sponsor of more bills that have become law than John Cornyn. He  led on Fix NICS. He led the fight against human trafficking--all in a  couple of years' work.   Of course, he doesn't do it alone. John has assembled a whip staff  that are as much a testament to his eye for talent as they are a  tremendous asset for the entire conference. At the helm of the  operation as chief of staff in his whip office, Monica Popp.   In so many ways, John and Monica seem to be cut from the same cloth.  Like her boss, Monica has a sixth sense when it comes to reading a room  and getting people what they need. She relishes the chance to tackle  tough problems. As far as she is concerned, a troublesome situation is  really just an opportunity. Just like John, Monica is an attentive  listener. This has made her an encyclopedic authority on what makes  each Member of the conference tick. When Monica makes a recommendation,  you know it is based on the best possible information, and on so many  occasions, I have relied directly on her sharp counsel out here on the  floor.   I am not sure I have ever worked with someone who had such a warm  heart and ice in her veins at the very same time. She operates with  calm and confidence precisely because she has built so many genuine and  solid friendships that she knows just where things stand.   Outside observers get Congress wrong when they say, ``It's all about  the math.'' It is really all about the relationships. Ironically  enough, this former math teacher turned all-star Hill staffer is just  about the ultimate living proof of that.   We may not be losing Senator Cornyn this month, but I am sorry to say  we are saying goodbye to Monica. I will miss her, and I know the entire  conference will miss her.   It is all about relationships with John too. Even as he was  constantly tasked with walking a tightrope through a pressure cooker,  he has also managed to be one of the kindest, most down-to-earth human  beings around. In no place is this more evident than the way he treats  the unelected members of this Senate family. He gets to know everyone.  He wants to earn your trust. He wants to know how you are doing.   After all, before he was the Senate's majority whip or a justice on  the Texas Supreme Court or the State's attorney general, he was a  husband and father. I know his wife, Sandy, and their family are hoping  the end of John's service as whip will bring at least a nominal  relaxing of his schedule. I doubt that, by the way.   Ordinarily, I might guess that John might be able to spend more time  on his hobbies, but somehow--as his prolific Twitter and Instagram  pages regularly notify the whole world--he has kept right at them all  along.   For all the different hats John wears in the Senate, he has managed  to hang on to his chef's cap too--marching through the ``Rasika''  cookbook and whipping up feasts for the family. The dove hunts  certainly haven't gone anywhere either.   So, really, whatever his title happens to say, what I am looking  forward to from John is more of the same--more invaluable guidance,  more exemplary legislating. I know the press corps is certainly hoping  for more of his informative one-liners.   Like I said, I am so happy we aren't saying goodbye to John today.  What I am saying--with complete personal sincerity, and also for the  entire conference--is thank you. Thank you for your friendship,  partnership, and thank you for making all of us look better than any of  us deserve. Thank you for helping the Senate deliver for the country.  Thank you for always having all of our backs.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I understand that the Senate has  received a message from the House to accompany H.R. 695.    I ask that the Chair lay before the Senate the message  to accompany H.R. 695.   The Presiding Officer laid before the Senate the following message  from the House of Representatives:         Resolved, That the House agree to the amendment of the       Senate to the title of the bill (H.R. 695) entitled ``An Act       to amend the National Child Protection Act of 1993 to       establish a national criminal history background check system       and criminal history review program for certain individuals       who, related to their employment, have access to children,       the elderly, or individuals with disabilities, and for other       purposes.'' and be it further        Resolved, That the House agree to the amendment of the       Senate to the text of the aforementioned bill, with an       amendment to Senate amendment.    Pending:   McConnell motion to concur in the amendment of the House to the  amendment of the Senate to the bill.   McConnell motion to refer the message of the House on the bill to the  Committee on the Appropriations, with instructions, McConnell Amendment  No. 1922, to change the enactment date.   McConnell Amendment No. 1923 (to (the instructions) Amendment No.  1922), of a perfecting nature.   McConnell Amendment No. 1924 (to Amendment No. 1923), of a perfecting  nature.                 Motion to Concur with an Amendment No. 4163     Mr. President, I move to concur in the House amendment  to the Senate amendment to H.R. 695, with a further amendment.    I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the  amendment be dispensed with.    I ask for the yeas and nays on the motion to concur  with amendment.    Mr. President, I have a second-degree amendment at the  desk.    I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the  amendment be dispensed with.    Mr. President, I move to refer the House message on  H.R. 695 to the Committee on Appropriations with instructions to report  back forthwith.    I ask for the yeas and nays on my motion.    I have an amendment to the instructions.    I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the  amendment be dispensed with.    I ask for the yeas and nays on my amendment.    Mr. President, I have a second-degree amendment at the  desk.    I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the  amendment be dispensed with.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following  the remarks of the senior Senator from Texas, all postcloture time be  considered expired and the Senate vote on the Maguire nomination; that  if confirmed, the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon  the table; and that the President be immediately notified of the  Senate's action with no intervening action or debate.    Mr. President, just for the information of our  colleagues, I expect the Maguire nomination to go by voice vote.    I object.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs be discharged  from further consideration of H.R. 4174 and the Senate proceed to its  immediate consideration.    I ask unanimous consent that the Johnson-Murray  substitute amendment at the desk be considered and agreed to; that the  bill, as amended, be considered read a third time and passed; and that  the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table.  [[Page S7871]]     Mr. President, earlier today, I finished my yearend  tributes to several of my fellow Senators, but, unfortunately, there is  still one more goodbye to a very special member of my own team. It is  no exaggeration at all to say that for the past 4 years, Hazen Marshall  has stood squarely in the center of every consequential decision and  piece of legislation that Congress has taken up. Just wrap your mind  around the job: the policy director in the Senate Majority Leader's  office.    Every day that Hazen has driven here to the Capitol and parked his  big pickup truck among all the hybrids and hatchbacks, he has come  ready to work--as a visionary strategist, a lead negotiator, a graceful  manager, a constant resource to key players on both sides of the  aisle--basically, something like an air traffic controller for the U.S.  Senate.   Now, with a job like that, it is no wonder that when my chief of  staff and I set out to lure Hazen back to the Capitol to join our team  in 2014, it didn't start out as an easy sell. For one thing, he had  already served 18 years of hard time here.   Hazen started out as an intern for his home State Senator, Don  Nickles. Now, the way I hear it all these years later, he may or may  not have missed the official deadline for submitting his internship  application, but this agriculture and economics whiz from Oklahoma  State was exactly what the office needed, with a farm bill coming up.  So they brought him on.   By the time he departed the Senate with Don for greener pastures, he  had shot up through the ranks and become staff director on the Senate  Budget Committee. Everybody knew Hazen, and they knew that he knew  everything. Everyone loved working with him. He had become a part of  this institution in his own right.   We knew he would need some good luck to persuade him to write a  sequel to all of that, but our fortunes turned around when Hazen  volunteered to come down to Kentucky in the last days of my 2014  campaign.   With the atmosphere of public service and the camaraderie and old  friendships already in place with so many of his would-be colleagues,  well, I think  [[Page S7879]]  the old bug hit Hazen again right then and right there. I am sure it  didn't hurt when we actually won the majority that year, too.   So this policy mastermind and peerless budget expert came on board.  Keep in mind that this is the guy who has only worked for two bosses in  his whole life--Don Nickles and his own father. I got to be lucky No.  3.   Just a couple of things have happened since then: the early wins,  like the 2015 highway bill, paving the way for reconciliation with a  quick turnaround on the 2017 budget, getting tax reform off the white  board and on to the President's desk, walking the narrow bipartisan  balance beam of this past winter's funding agreement, and scoring a win  for defense funding.   During each of these battles and many others, Hazen was right there  at the center of the action. But I can't think of a single time when he  himself sought to be the center of attention. As far as Hazen was  concerned, his accomplishments were not Hazen Marshall's. They were the  accomplishments of the leader's office, the conference, and the Senate.  His victories were all team victories.   You couldn't succeed at a job like Hazen has without having  thoroughly mastered the machinery of Congress, but you wouldn't be as  happy doing it or make nearly so many friends along the way, unless you  were in it for the right reasons.   This is a town where many folks will try to parlay any proximity to  power into black-tie invitations and jump at any chance to self- promote--not Hazen. It probably doesn't hurt that he would probably  rather be in the seats at Nat's Park, anyway, at his kids'  performances, or on the river than at most high-society functions. But  even more than that, selfishness is simply not in the man's character.   He is just rock solid, completely confident, and utterly reliable.   When I or any other Member or any staffer brought a question or  problem to Hazen, we knew we would get a straight answer and we would  get it fast, and it was guaranteed to be right. In every meeting, on  every hard day, there was Hazen at the end of the table reassuring me  and everyone else with a smile and his trademark encouraging words:  ``It's all good. It's all good.''   He is one of the seniormost staffers in the Senate, still totally  humble, still trying to buck everyone up and squeeze some smiles out of  the work. And, frankly, with Hazen at the negotiating table, it almost  always was ``all good.''   Of course, we will miss more than just Hazen's professional  excellence. His humble, hard-working spirit isn't the only way he  remains less of a beltway operator and more of that farm boy from  Hennessey, OK. He may be one of the most savvy and well-connected guys  in this city, but you had better believe that while colleagues would  compare notes about the different trips they had taken over recess,  Hazen would grin ear-to-ear while describing the latest Indy car race  he had taken in.   To be fair, this is also a man of high culture. His affinity for  music and theater includes the artistic pursuits of his children,  Madeline and Max, and practically everything else under the sun as  well.   So I don't suspect Hazen will have a hard time filling his days when  the Senate reconvenes without him in January. Maybe he will dive even  deeper into his CrossFit habit and convert to ``two-a-days.''   Certainly, his devotion to the Washington Nationals will ensure that  he still faces many frustrating, stressful situations come springtime,  but unlike many legislative challenges, he will be able to shoulder  that burden with a cold beer in his hand.   I can't wait to see you in the stands, buddy, but I will miss you  here.   Thanks so much for your service to me, to your colleagues, and, most  of all, to your country.    Mr. President, I move to instruct the Sergeant at Arms  to request the presence of all absent Senators, and I ask for the yeas  and nays.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  pending motion to refer be withdrawn, amendment No. 4164 be withdrawn,  and the Senate vote on the motion to concur with further amendment with  no intervening action or debate.    For the information of all Senators, there are no more  rollcall votes tonight. We will still be in session tomorrow. We have  to see what the House does with what we just sent them.
