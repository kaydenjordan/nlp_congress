 Mr. President, Friday marked the first anniversary of the  so-called American Rescue Plan, which is the Democrats' partisan $1.9  trillion spending spree. Fittingly, the anniversary arrived just 1 day  after the release of February's inflation numbers which marked the  worst inflation since January of 1982.   Why do I say ``fittingly''?   Well, because the anniversary of the American Rescue Plan is  basically the anniversary of our inflation crisis. While it is true  that supply chain issues and the reopening of economies after COVID  shutdowns created certain inflationary pressures, a big part of the  reason for our current inflation crisis is Democrats' decision to pass  the American Rescue Plan last March.   The definition of inflation is too many dollars chasing too few goods  and services, and that is exactly the situation Democrats helped create  with their so-called American Rescue Plan. Democrats came into office  mere weeks after Congress had passed a fifth--fifth--bipartisan COVID  relief bill totaling almost $1 trillion and meeting, essentially, all  current pressing COVID needs. Our economy was well on its way to a  healthy recovery, and the majority of States had the money they needed  to deal with the pandemic. In short, it was abundantly clear that we  were not in immediate need of trillions more in government spending.   But that didn't stop Democrats. Now that they were in charge, they  were eager to take advantage of the COVID crisis to begin implementing  their Big Government vision. So in the name of COVID relief, they  pushed through a massive partisan $1.9 trillion spending piece of  legislation filled with unnecessary spending and handouts to Democratic  interest groups. Less than 9 percent of that $1.9 trillion spending  bill was earmarked for actually combating COVID. The rest went to  priorities like a $350 billion slush fund for States, a bailout for  union pensions, rental assistance far in excess of anything that was  needed, and the list goes on.   Despite being billed as essential COVID relief, a substantial portion  of the money appropriated will not be spent until 2022 or later; and  despite the pressing need for workers to fill the millions of available  job openings, Democrats created incentives for Americans to stay on  unemployment instead of returning to work by extending enhanced  unemployment benefits until September of 2021, long after they were  likely to be needed. So the end result of all this was entirely  predictable.   Democrats flooded the economy with unnecessary government money, and  the economy overheated as a result. And you don't have to take my word  for it. Here is what Steve Rattner, who served in the Obama  administration, had to say in November:   The original sin was the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan, passed  in March. The bill--almost completely unfunded--sought to counter the  effects of the COVID pandemic by focusing on demand-side stimulus  rather than on investment. That has contributed materially to today's  inflation levels.    Let me repeat that. This, according to Steve Rattner, who worked in  the Obama administration, about inflation--talked about the legislation  passed last year by the Democrats. He said that this ``has contributed  materially to today's inflation levels.''   Or, as another former Obama administration member put it:         The United States has had much more inflation than almost       any other advanced economy in the world.    That was Jason Furman, an economist at Harvard University and former  Obama administration economic adviser.   He went on to say:         The difference comes because the United States stimulus is       in a category of its own.    That, again, from another former Obama administration economist,  Jason Furman.   Inflation started to rise almost as soon as the ink was dry on the  American Rescue Plan, and it just keeps rising. February's 7.9 percent  inflation marks the worst inflation since January of 1982--January of  1982--40 years ago.   And Americans are struggling. Just going to the grocery store is  taking up a larger and larger portion of the American paycheck. Ground  beef is up 13 percent; eggs are up 11 percent; citrus fruits are up 16  percent; chicken is up 13 percent; milk, up 11 percent; bacon and  related products are up 18 percent; and on and on and on.   In fact, one American quoted in the New York Times noted that bacon  is now as expensive as filet mignon used to be. Ordinary goods are  starting to feel like luxury objects as more and more families struggle  to afford basic grocery items.   A Washington Post columnist noted that a number of the price  increases recorded for February were the highest annual increases ever  recorded for those items, including an 8.4-percent increase in the  price of baby food and an 11-percent increase in the cost of lunch  meat.   In a speech to House Democrats last week, the President suggested  that he was ``sick of'' people saying that Democrats' reckless spending  had helped cause our inflation crisis. This is what the President said  last week--President Biden:         [T]he American people think the reason for inflation is the       government is spending more money. Simply not true.    Well, there are a lot of economists who would disagree with him,  including the two Democratic economists I have already quoted. And  President Biden himself actually admitted in November that his stimulus  checks helped increase the demand fueling inflation. I am sorry that  President Biden is sick of having people point this out.   But you know who else is sick and tired of things? The American  people. They are sick and tired of facing massive price increases  everywhere they look. They are sick of increasingly having to live  paycheck to paycheck as they wonder just how much further their grocery  prices are going to go up. They are sick of wondering if they will be  able to pay all of next month's bills.   And whether President Biden likes it or not, his so-called American  Rescue Plan is responsible for a substantial part of the economic  distress that Americans are now experiencing. And while President Biden  may be sick of it, we need to keep talking about this because the  President is still--still--trying to double down on the spending  strategy that helped create this inflation crisis in the first place.  Just 2 weeks ago in the State of the Union Address, the President  discussed inflation and outlined his hopes for massive new amounts of  government spending, spending that would unquestionably take an already  bad inflation situation and make it even worse.   It is nice that the President and congressional Democrats are now  talking about our inflation crisis, but it would be even nicer if they  would realize that it was their spending that helped trigger this  crisis in the first place; otherwise, we will continue to see Democrats  push for ever bigger increases in government spending with  correspondingly devastating price increases for American families.   The American Rescue Plan was a bad deal for Americans. Let's hope  that Democrats do not have the chance to double down on this  legislation and make our current inflation crisis even worse.   I yield the floor.   Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.
