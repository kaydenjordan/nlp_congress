 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor many Americans who are  forgotten: those who have gone through difficult times that are now on  a path of recovery.   Substance abuse disorders are running rampant throughout our  communities all over America. They have crossed borders of race,  ethnicity, gender, and politics. This crisis knows no bounds, and we  are here to bring awareness to the fact that there is a  [[Page H7870]]  way forward for each of these individuals.   I have hosted substance abuse awareness roundtables all across my  district regularly and have heard from folks who have family, friends,  or are themselves dealing with substance abuse. Many of these people  you would have no idea they or people they knew were struggling.   But they were, Mr. Speaker. And this is why I rise with my  colleagues, both Democrat and Republican alike, and wear the color  purple today, to show that through love, care, faith, family, and  community, we can help those walking through a very, very lonely  valley.   We can uplift those who need it the most. We are all here to help our  brothers and sisters in Christ.                            ____________________
