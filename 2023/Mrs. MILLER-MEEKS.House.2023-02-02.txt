 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 60th  anniversary of the Isabel Bloom shop in Davenport, Iowa, and what would  be the 115th birthday of sculptor Isabel Bloom.   The original Isabel Bloom was a Davenport native who attended the Art  Institute of Chicago and the Vogue School of Fashion. She and her  husband married in 1938 before settling in Davenport with their three  children in the early 1940s.   In 1963, Isabel and her husband opened a small studio in Davenport's  East Village. Bloom received multiple awards for her ceramics but  perfected garden art to sell in her store. Because it was sturdy and  weather resistant, her preferred base was concrete.   Though ownership has since changed, and the Isabel Bloom shop has  continued to grow, the current owners, Donna Young, Cathy Nevins, and  Bill Barrett, have stayed true to Bloom's original vision: to create  art that brings comfort and joy to their community. As an owner of a  few Isabel Bloom pieces myself, I can say their vision rings true.   Congratulations to the Isabel Bloom shop. I wish them many more years  of creativity, friendship, and success.                            ____________________
