 Mr. President, I have come to the floor to talk about  one of the favorite things I get to do all week, and that is to talk  about some Alaskans who are making a difference. We call this our  ``Alaskan of the Week.''   It means that I get to speak about my State, usually an individual,  maybe a couple of people, but every now and then I like to mix things  up and keep people on high alert because the people I am going to talk  about in Alaska are the ultimate people--Americans--on high alert. As  opposed to recognizing one or two, I am going to recognize a bunch of  Alaskans, an impressive group, who work day and night, not only to keep  Alaska safe but to keep America safe. They will be doing it this  weekend, the Fourth of July--24/7, 7 days a week, 365 days a year,  always on high alert.   As we are heading into the Fourth of July weekend, Russia is once  again in the news, and we have been debating the National Defense  Authorization Act on the Senate floor, a very critical bill that I am  fully supportive of, which funds our military and pay raises for our  troops. I thought it would be very appropriate to highlight the  hundreds of men and women in my State who stand watch and patrol the  northern skies of Alaska and America to protect our Nation. They are  unsung heroes. You don't hear a lot about them in the news, but we  certainly appreciate them. I think all Senators and all Americans do,  which is why I want to talk about them today.   They are our brave servicemembers who fly and maintain our F-22  Raptors--this amazing stealth fighter; our E-3 Sentrys, which are also  known as AWACS, which are like the quarterback in the sky of aircraft;  our Alaska Guard KC-135 Stratotankers; our brave members of the Alaska  Rescue Coordination Center, who operate HH-60 Pave Hawk helicopters and  H-130 Hercules aircraft, should we need a search and rescue mission;  and our Active-Duty members and guardsmen, who maintain, monitor, and  track threats from other countries for our country, particularly  threats coming from Russia. These brave men and women--hundreds of  them--are keeping guard day and night over the northern skies of  America.    When the Russians fly their Bear bombers and fighter jets into or  near American air space, these intrepid Americans are on duty to ensure  that our F-22s are there to intercept and greet the Russian pilots and  aircraft who threaten to move into our air defense identification zone,  or ADIZ, as we call it. They are there waiting and intercepting Russian  bombers. These airmen keep us all safe. As I mentioned, they are all  worthy of the great title Alaskans of the Week.   Before I get into exactly what these men and women do to guard our  Nation--and they do it round the clock; they are doing it right now, by  the way, and will be doing it the Fourth of July, by the way--I would  like to talk a little about Russia and Alaska and our close geography.  I want to give a little geography lesson. There are actual places in  Alaska where you really can see Russia from your house.   Russia and Alaska are divided by the Bering Strait, which is about 55  miles at its narrowest point. In the middle of the Bering Strait sit  two islands, Big Diomede, which is actually Russian territory, and  Little Diomede, which is part of Alaska, part of America. They are less  than 2\1/2\ miles apart from each other, nearly touching. In the words  of a New York Times reporter, it is the place where ``the two great  continental powers reach across the map and all but touch, like the  outstretched figures in Michelangelo's `The Creation of Adam.''' It is  a little dramatic, but you get the point--Little Diomede and Big  Diomede.   On a clear day, you can see Russia from St. Lawrence Island, which is  also Alaskan, and even from our mainland, in Wales, AK. During the Cold  War, the Alaska-Siberia frontier was called not the Iron Curtain but  the ``Ice Curtain,'' which we needed to stay closed.   Much preparation was put into keeping Russia from invading or  infiltrating the United States from its northern flank--from the  Arctic, from Alaska. In the early Cold War years, our government  recruited and trained fishermen, bush pilots, trappers, and many, many  in our patriotic Native Alaskan communities throughout the State to  stand guard for America during the Cold War. And so many Alaskans did  this for decades. It was their patriotic duty guarding the northern  flank of our great Nation.   There were the great Eskimo scouts of the Alaska National Guard, who  knew the land better than anyone else could. They were so patriotic  with their love of this Nation.   It is still unclear how many Russians were able to get to our lands,  but stories do abound in Alaska about strangers speaking Russian  showing up in communities unannounced--five men emerging from the water  in wet suits over olive-drab uniforms, the color of the uniform of  Soviet Special Forces. Go to any one of our Native Alaska communities,  and today, you will still hear such stories.   Something that is very clear and very well known is that between 1961  and 1991, the U.S. military intercepted thousands of long-range Soviet  bombers and reconnaissance aircraft when they were moving into American  airspace. We used our aircraft back then, the F-102s, F-106s, and  later, F-4s, F-15s. Then, like now, our aircraft were superior to the  Russians and that was certainly one of the reasons we won the Cold War.   This is still going on today. This is still a threat. The Russians  continue to flex their military muscle, from Ukraine to Siberia, and  they have added new Blackjack bombers to the mix and their SU-35  fighters. They still come close to American airspace via flights near  Alaska. That is where our F-22 pilots and those who support them come  in.   Just in the last 6 months, our Alaskan F-22s, shown here, have  intercepted 10 Russian Bear bombers. We are starting to see Cold War  levels of intrusions into American airspace and, of course, our  patriotic men and women--young men and women, by the way--flying these  great aircraft, going after these big Bear bombers. There were 10  missions already, and it is just July 2. What are they up to?   Air Force Gen. Terrence O'Shaughnessy, who commands NORAD and these  forces, ultimately, and U.S. Northern Command, linked the uptick in  Russian military flights off Alaska's coast to the ongoing coronavirus  pandemic and Russia's testing of our military readiness. They are  testing us, but we are ready for them.   In essence, that is what we have been doing all week--debating and  getting ready to vote on final passage of the  [[Page S4200]]  National Defense Authorization Act, which is all about our military's  readiness. Again, in Alaska--24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a  year--our brave men and women are guarding the northern flank of  America.   This is how Lt. Col. Dave Deptula, commander of the 525th Fighter  Squadron--this F-22 squadron, the ``Bulldogs''--described it:         The Russians will fly their bombers and fighters across the       Bering Strait and they will test our ADIZ [Air Defense       Identification Zone] airspace--they will try to see if they       can come into our airspace. And if they were going to go into       it, we would be there every time to say, respectfully,       ``Hello. We're here and we're flying with live munitions.''    He said the goal is to make sure the Russians know that they are  there to protect our Nation and try to deescalate.   By the way, Colonel Deptula is my former Air Force fellow and a great  Air Force leader, just like his dad.   As an aside, pilots in the military have what are called ``call  signs,'' which are essentially their pilot nicknames. As a marine, I  know many pilots by their call signs. Lieutenant Colonel Deptula's call  sign is ``Ghost.'' Maybe that is because he is an F-22 stealth fighter  pilot, able to sneak up on Bear bombers like this without being seen  and even heard. But I have also heard that maybe it is because when it  is time to pay the tab at a bar, he doesn't seem to be around. Just  kidding there, Colonel Deptula, Ghost. I can't think of a better call  sign for an F-22 stealth fighter pilot in Alaska, and we are very, very  proud of Ghost in the Sullivan Senate office.    Here is how it works. Here is what these brave young men and women in  the U.S. Air Force do to protect our Nation. We have 15 long-range  radar sites across the great State of Alaska, which are constantly  feeding information to the 176th Air Defense Squadron, which analyze  that information.   By the way, I have the honor and pleasure next week of hosting the  Secretary of the Air Force in Alaska. She will be able to see our great  military members, and we will go out and actually see some of these  radar sites.   When our military note troublesome activity, they send out a bone- rattling alarm--what is called the KLAXON--to the Combat Alert Cell.  This is a group of pilots and maintainers who are always ready. They  are like firemen. They literally have a pole where they scramble down  to get to their aircraft--what they call a ``hot cocked'' and armed F- 22 at the ready.   As these pilots literally race to their jets, so, too, does the  aircrew of the AWACs--the long-range eyes and ears for the F-22. They  launch very quickly. This is taking place at JBER in Anchorage.  Simultaneously, at Eielson Air Force Base, about 350 miles north of  Anchorage, the 168th Air Refueling Squadron, a unit of the Alaska Air  National Guard, launch the KC-135 tankers to meet the F-22s as they are  going to intercept the Russians and to top off the 600-gallon F-22 fuel  tanks when they are in the air and then refuel them on the way back.  This is all part of one big mission. That is what they are doing.   All told, there are hundreds of Alaskans in the air and on the ground  involved in operations like this every single time it happens.   As I mentioned, it is happening a lot--twice a month in the last half  year.   Patriotic young men and women are always prepared to defend our  country in the sky--24 hours a day, 7 days a week.   One thing I want to do for this ``Alaskan of the Week'' is remind  Americans when they are celebrating the Fourth of July--which is a  great thing to do--to remember that these dedicated warriors will be on  guard protecting our Nation. When everybody is barbecuing, celebrating  America, think about what they are doing.   If you have seen any video of the F-22s flying, it is impressive, but  we also have to remember there are real pilots in those planes. Look  how close they are in this mission. It can be very dangerous.   Think of this to get a sense of how this all works. It is the middle  of the night and the klaxon goes off. It is winter in Alaska. It is  dark and 20 below zero. A pilot hustles to her airplane--yes, ``her.''  We have F-22 female pilots. One is call sign Contra. We were discussing  recently in my office about what a great job she does. She gets in the  aircraft and flies nearly 600 miles sometimes--certainly, faster than  the speed of sound--to reach the rough Bering Sea to intercept a  Russian Bear bomber like this in the middle of the night. She probably  had to refuel on the way there.   Sometimes Russian pilots can get aggressive. According to Ghost, we  do not respond aggressively in turn. We are respectful. We are tough.  We are professional. The Russians know it, and the Russians know that  they are up against the best Air Force in the world--armed and ready.  So the Russians usually behave.   But this can be a stressful mission. As I mentioned, it has happened  10 times already in the last 6 months. It is so critical for our  Nation. So many young Alaskans are involved in this. Our men and women  in the military represent the very best of this country--brave, strong,  committed, devoted to our country, devoted to democracy, devoted to the  Republic.   That is why we have been working on this all week. When we come back  from our Fourth of July work period, we will continue to work on and  pass the National Defense Authorization Act for them.   On this Fourth of July holiday, as I mentioned, I hope we can take  the time to thank them and to remember those who have served before.  Know that when you are spending time with friends and family this  holiday, dozens of airmen in Alaska are on alert and ready to go do  this mission in a moment's notice.   We have to remember also that the freedoms we are celebrating this  weekend have been secured at a price. There is no Independence Day  without the U.S. military and our courageous veterans, past and  present.   Yet it is not just about protecting our Nation. Think about this:  American servicemembers have done more to liberate men and women across  the globe from tyranny and oppression--literally, hundreds of millions  of people--than probably more than any other force in human history.  That includes those who are currently serving. Think about that when  you are celebrating the Fourth of July. Can any other country say that?  Think about the other big countries in the world--China, Russia,  Germany. Have they been forces to have liberated hundreds of millions  of people? The fact is, they are the kinds of countries that have tried  to dominate hundreds of millions. As my friend from Arkansas just  mentioned, China is doing it again, as we speak, in Hong Kong.   So, yes, our Nation has challenges right now--no doubt about it. Yet  I think the vast majority of us recognizes the obvious fact that we are  the greatest country in the world and have stood for liberating not  just Americans but hundreds of millions around the world. My view is  that we are the greatest country in the history of the world. One  reason is due to those who stand guard to protect us and our freedoms  and our liberty.   So a big thank-you to those who fly and maintain our F-22 Raptors-- our AWACS--our Alaska National Guard KC-135s; our HH-60s; our HC-130s;  and all of the Active-Duty members and guardsmen who on the Fourth of  July, which we are going to celebrate in a couple of days, will be  ready to go do this mission at a moment's notice and be ready to  protect us.   I will be up on the Yukon River, in Alaska, with my wife and  daughters, as we always are, to celebrate not only America's birthday  but my wife's, and we will be toasting the brave young men and women  who are doing this for our country. I encourage the rest of my fellow  Americans to do the same.   To the Raptor pilots and maintainers and everybody who supports them,  thanks for what you are doing. Most importantly, congratulations on  being our Alaskans of the Week.   I yield the floor.    I thank my good friend from Tennessee for those kind  comments
