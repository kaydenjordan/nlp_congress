 Mr. Speaker, I yield as much time as he may  consume to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Yoho).    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may  consume to the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. Hill).    Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for  [[Page H8119]]  time, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, first of all, I want to thank so many people for working  so hard on this piece of legislation: my good friend,  Jim McGovern,  the principal cosponsor and just a great friend, on fighting tyranny in  China. He chairs the China Commission. I am the ranking member.  Previously, I have chaired it, and so we have gone back and forth in  working that leadership. I want to thank him especially for that.   Mr. Speaker, I also want to thank, of course, Chairman Engel and  Ranking Member McCaul, Chairman Sherman and Ranking Member Yoho for  their strong support for this bipartisan legislation.   Mr. Speaker, there are a number of staffers who I will speak about in  a moment. No. I will do it now: Scott Flipse for his great work on this  bill, it is landmark work going back to 5 years ago; Jon Stivers; Reva  Price from the Speaker's office, who has been tenacious on this  legislation; Jennifer Hendrixson-White; Bryan Burack; Janice Kaguyutan;  Theresa Lou; Darrow Godeski Merton; Doug Anderson; Piero Tozzi; Sabrina  Tsai. Just so many very good people who have all pulled together in a  bipartisan way to make sure that this legislation comes to the floor  and becomes law.   Mr. Speaker, since the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre 30 years ago, I  have had the privilege of working with colleagues on both sides of the  aisle, including Speaker Pelosi, on human rights, the rule of law and  democracy for the People's Republic of China.   Mr. Speaker, I also want to thank Kevin McCarthy, the minority leader  here in the House, the Republican leader, who has put me on as his  selection on the China Commission and for his strong support for this  legislation as well.   We have always believed, Mr. Speaker, that every person in China  deserves better than the brutality so many endure every single day and  the systematic violations of their universally-recognized human rights.   Tragically, under President Xi Jinping, human rights abuses  throughout China have significantly worsened, including the pervasive  use of torture, religious persecution, and human trafficking.   Solemn promises made by Beijing are rarely kept, and far too many  leaders of the free world are far too eager to blindly accept fiction  over fact.   Broken promises are the rule, not the exception under Xi Jinping, and  the people of Hong Kong are suffering because of it.   During the 2014 Umbrella Movement, the world saw the courageous  people of Hong Kong demanding that Beijing not renege on promises made  to ensure universal suffrage, basic rights, and authentic elections in  2017.   Despite President Xi Jinping's brutal crackdown on protesters then  and now, triggered this time by an outrageous proposed policy to  facilitate extradition, the resolve, the courage, the tenacity, and  clarity of purpose of the people of Hong Kong shines through the  darkness like the Sun.   Two days ago, Reuters reported that President Xi Jinping told leaders  in Nepal, ``Anyone attempting to split China in any part of the country  will end in crushed bodies and shattered bones.''   President Xi's government excels in crushing bodies, shattering  bones, torturing dissidents, and filling concentration camps, massive  crimes against humanity, for which there has been little or no  accountability or sanctioning.   But today, Mr. Speaker, we are simply urging the Chinese President  and the Hong Kong Chief Executive--and we have that obligation under  our own laws--to faithfully honor the government's promises.   Honor the promises made in the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration  that facilitated the conveyance of Hong Kong from the United Kingdom to  China beginning on July 1, 1997, that autonomy, human rights, including  press, assembly, association, and religion, would be exactly the same  as before the handover for at least 50 years.   Honor the promises made in the ``Basic Law'' of Hong Kong adopted by  China's National People's Congress in 1990, before the giveback of Hong  Kong, that autonomy and rights would be protected.   Even before the latest round of protests, Mr. Speaker, the U.S. State  Department has noted that rights and liberties in Hong Kong have  diminished. They are not living up to their solemn promises made in  order for the Hong Kong conveyance to occur.   You know, the great young leader, Joshua Wong, reminded us that a  fourth of the population of Hong Kong, about 2 million people, turned  out for one of the peaceful protests. Mr. Speaker, where has that ever  happened?   Five years ago, Mr. Speaker, in 2014, joined by Mrs. Pelosi, I  introduced the bipartisan Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act. We  did it again in 2015, in 2017, and again this year, again, with my good  friend from Massachusetts.   Our new bill, the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, is a  blueprint for meaningful action. Specifically, the act directs the  Secretary of State to certify to Congress annually whether Hong Kong  continues to deserve special treatment under U.S. law different from  mainland China in such matters as trade, customs, sanctions  enforcement, law enforcement cooperation, and protection of human  rights and the rule of law.   It encourages the State Department not to deny visas based on an  applicant's arrest or detention for participating in nonviolent  activities in Hong Kong.   It requires an annual report from the Commerce Department on whether  the Hong Kong Government adequately enforces U.S. export controls and  sanctions laws, including on those goods and services transshipped to  North Korea, Iran, or other countries relating to the proliferation of  weapons of mass destruction, violations of human rights, narcotics  trafficking, and more.                                time  1600    It requires an assessment of whether U.S. origin items, including  software, technology, and services, have been transferred from Hong  Kong to China in violation of U.S. law and have been used by China for  mass surveillance, predictive policing, or for the social credit  system.   Now, some people might ask: What is this social credit system? Mr.  Speaker, it is a ubiquitous, totalitarian ``brave new world'' system  scheduled for implementation by 2020 that will use public records,  online activities, and other tools of surveillance to aggregate data on  every single, solitary Chinese citizen and business and use that data  to monitor, shape, and rate financial, social, religious, or political  behaviors.   It requires the Secretary of State to submit a strategy to Congress  to protect U.S. citizens and businesses in Hong Kong from the erosion  of autonomy and the rule of law because of actions taken by the Chinese  Communist governments.   It requires the President to identify and sanction persons in Hong  Kong or in mainland China responsible for the erosion of Hong Kong's  autonomy and serious abuses of human rights.  [[Page H8124]]    It tracks the Magnitsky Act, which Mr. McGovern and I worked so hard  to enact into law, so that we deny visas and also deny the ability to  do business here to the people who are responsible for these egregious  abuses.   And it requires a waiver provision that helps ensure that our actions  protect the great people of Hong Kong and enhance the autonomy rather  than inadvertently harming it. So it gives real flexibility to the  President and to the State Department to make the right call.   Finally, Mr. Speaker, I have heard it said that the business of Hong  Kong is business. It is that. But it is also clear to me, now, that the  business of Hong Kong is freedom and democracy.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, first of all, let me say, I appreciate and respect the  eloquent remarks of the Speaker just a few moments ago. We are united  on Hong Kong. I think that is very clear, and we have been working  together, along with a number of other Members, including some former  Members, like Frank Wolf from Virginia, who are united in believing  that freedom, and democracy, and respect for human rights is  everybody's business, and everybody is entitled to it. These are God- given rights. So, again, I want to thank the Speaker for her wonderful  remarks.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4270, the PROTECT Hong  Kong Act, sponsored by Chairman  Jim McGovern, and I am very proud to  be a cosponsor on it. The PROTECT Hong Kong Act mandates export  restrictions on defense articles and munitions to the Hong Kong police.  [[Page H8127]]    As the largest protest movement Hong Kong has ever seen continues  into its fifth month, major concerns have arisen about the Hong Kong  police's independence and professionalism. The people of Hong Kong are  rightfully furious about well-documented cases of excessive force,  brutal tactics, and the tolerance of violence against protesters and  journalists by the government.   The Hong Kong police's actions are now a cause in and of themselves  of protest. There has been widespread police misuse of crowd control  equipment and less lethal weaponry, including incidents that have  seriously injured journalists. Police have used teargas, rubber  bullets, water cannons, sponge grenades, pepper spray, and batons  against demonstrators, some of which, indeed, are American-made  equipment. In recent weeks two protesters have been shot with live  rounds.   Meanwhile, while we discuss a move to ban the sale of such offensive  equipment, the Hong Kong Government, via executive fiat, has  simultaneously moved to ban the use by demonstrators of defensive  equipment used to protect themselves against police attacks; namely,  gas masks and face masks.   The PROTECT Hong Kong Act will prohibit the issuing of licenses for  the export of munitions and crowd control equipment to the Hong Kong  police. The Secretary of State, in consultation with the Secretary of  Commerce and other relevant Federal agencies, will also be required to  issue a report on what has been sold to the Hong Kong police over the  past several years.   These prohibitions will remain in effect until these incidents are  independently examined and the Hong Kong police have demonstrated truly  professional conduct.   In sum, the U.S. should not be complicit in any way, shape, or form  in violence being used to squash the legitimate demands guaranteed to  the Hong Kong people by international treaty. That is unacceptable, and  it is contrary to U.S. interests, and it is contrary to U.S. law.   I strongly support unanimous support for this measure, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for  time, so I yield back the balance of my time.
