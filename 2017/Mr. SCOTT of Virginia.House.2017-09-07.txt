 Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentlewoman for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the number of amendments that were made in  order by the Rules Committee, but I am appalled that the majority chose  not to include one of my amendments, No. 63, to division F of H.R.  3354, which would strike a prohibition against using Federal funds for  the purpose of transportation needed to desegregate public schools.  This language has found its way into every appropriations act since at  least 1974.   The language in sections 301 and 302 of division F of the bill really  represent a relic of an ugly history when States and school districts  across the Nation resisted meaningful integration of public education  for decades after the Supreme Court's ruling in Brown v. Board of  Education. That resistance has worked.   According to the GAO last year, our schools are more segregated by  race and class today than they were in 1968. The persistence of these  riders, if unchallenged, is morally reprehensible and has no place in  2017. I stand with the Congressional Black Caucus in calling for a  total removal of this offensive language in any fiscal 2018  appropriations act.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the  amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the  amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.    Mr. Chair, this amendment would prohibit the  EPA from spending any funds to ensure that States fulfill their  obligations under the Clean Water Act to help clean up the Chesapeake  Bay. If passed into law, this amendment would endanger the progress we  have made in restoring the Chesapeake Bay watershed and would put in  jeopardy not only the Chesapeake Bay itself, but also critical economic  contributions that the bay provides.   Since the Chesapeake Bay agreement was signed in 1983, the most  recent agreement signed in 2014, bay States and the Federal Government  have invested significant resources in cleanup and restoration efforts.  Cooperation is critical in these efforts, and only under the  cooperative agreement agreed upon in the Chesapeake Clean Water  Blueprint are we seeing a lot of progress being made. But the  Chesapeake Bay cleanup efforts are part of backstops that make sure  that each State does what it has actually promised to do. With these  safeguards in place, States have to certify that their investments are  not made in vain and that other States will also make good on their  investments.   This amendment would undermine this historic collaboration, endanger  historic progress we have made, and give States a loophole to avoid  meeting their responsibilities under the Clean Water Act.   I believe that, instead of offering amendments that undermine  Chesapeake Bay restorations, we should be investing even more resources  to ensure that they are successful.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to reject the amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to reject  the amendment.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.   The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further  proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Virginia  will be postponed.                   Amendment No. 51 Offered by Mr. Sanford    The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 51  printed in House Report 115-297.
