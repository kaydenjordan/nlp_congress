 Mr. Speaker, I rise to celebrate the 30th  anniversary of Cancer Link, an amazing volunteer organization dedicated  to finding a cure for breast cancer and assisting those in south  Florida whose lives have been impacted by this disease.   Cancer Link was founded in 1987 by a small group of 10 Miami women  who wanted to spread awareness about breast cancer after suffering the  devastating loss of a friend. In the years since, this wonderful  organization has grown into an impactful volunteer group that has  supported essential breast cancer research at the Sylvester Cancer  Center in Miami, Florida.   The volunteers at Cancer Link have also helped provide essential  community healthcare programs that ensure that healthcare for breast  cancer treatment is accessible to every woman in our community.   Congratulations again to all who have been a part of Cancer Link  throughout the years, and thank you for 30 years of service to our  community.                            ____________________
