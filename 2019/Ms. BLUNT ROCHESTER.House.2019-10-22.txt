 Madam Speaker, I am proud to report that last  week the Energy and Commerce Committee advanced H.R. 3, the Lower Drug  Costs Now Act.   We also passed out of committee H.R. 4671, the Helping Seniors Afford  Healthcare Act, which I introduced with my colleagues Representatives    Andy Kim and Dwight Evans.   Currently, Medicare beneficiaries receive financial assistance for  their premiums and out-of-pocket costs through the Medicare Savings  Programs, or MSPs.   Medicare takes great strides to protect low-income beneficiaries  through these programs, but there are millions of Americans who fall  through the cracks. My bill expands access to the MSPs so more Medicare  beneficiaries will be protected from soaring healthcare costs.   I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join me in  supporting the passage of H.R. 3 and H.R. 4671.                            ____________________
