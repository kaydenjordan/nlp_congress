 Madam Speaker, since I came to Congress 3 years ago, I  have made it a top priority to work toward improving our Nation's  infrastructure. I have repeatedly advocated and testified for repairing  and expanding our roadways and bridges across the Sixth District,  including Interstate 81, the economic backbone of the Sixth  Congressional District.   But the Senate agreement up this week allocates just $110 billion for  roads and bridges, less than 15 percent of the total bill's funding.   Further, House Democrats are tying its passage to the $4.3 trillion  tax-and-spend boondoggle they call human infrastructure.   The bill includes $7.5 billion to create a Civilian Climate Corps to  promote the Green New Deal, $80 billion for the IRS to double the  number of agents that will target American families and businesses, and  provides a zero percent increase for Homeland Security as the Biden  border crisis continues to worsen.   Additionally, the bill provides $42.3 billion in tax credits for the  wealthy, while at the same time raising $2.1 trillion in higher taxes  on the middle-class families and job creators.   With inflation on the rise and unprecedented levels of government  spending driving up our national debt, we cannot afford this loaded  legislative package.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose both of these bills when  they come before the House.                            ____________________
