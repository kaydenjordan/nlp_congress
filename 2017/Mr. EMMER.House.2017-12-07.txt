 Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished chair of the  Appropriations Committee. I appreciate the time.   Mr. Speaker, in my home State of Minnesota, the Children's Health  Insurance Program, better known as CHIP, provides coverage for  thousands of low-income, pregnant women as well as new mothers and  their children.   When funds for my State's CHIP program ran out, these Minnesotans  were left wondering the fate of their healthcare. That is why we teamed  up with Representative Ryan Costello, Chairman Walden, and Subcommittee  Chair Burgess to introduce the CHIP Stability Act to bring certainty  and support to Minnesotans and millions of families across the country.  I am so grateful that our responsible, short-term funding solution is  incorporated into this continuing resolution today.   But let me be clear: This is not enough. When the House passed the  Championing Healthy Kids Act, a fully paid-for and long-term CHIP  reauthorization solution, we put politics aside and America's most  vulnerable first. It is my hope that the Senate will do the same very  soon.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage all of my colleagues to support this  continuing resolution so CHIP recipients are able to receive the  coverage they need.
