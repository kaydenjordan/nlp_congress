 Mr. Speaker, today, I stand with my colleagues to oppose  the motion to obstruct and to repeal facilitating abortions funded by  the Department of Defense and, in effect, taxpayers.   Following the Supreme Court's landmark Dobbs decision, the Biden  administration sought ways to bypass the ruling. They have encouraged  Federal agencies to not only expand abortion access but also to burden  American taxpayers with the cost.   Last October, the Secretary of Defense released a memo titled:  ``Ensuring Access to Reproductive Health Care.'' Let's get something  straight, Mr. Speaker. There is nothing reproductive about abortion.  Abortion ends a life. It does not reproduce.   This memo paves the way for taxpayer money to facilitate abortion for  servicemembers and their dependents. It even allows for the  reimbursement of  [[Page H4425]]  travel expenses for those seeking abortions in another State. Taxpayer  funds for the DOD are meant for national defense, not to further a pro- abortion agenda.   Let me be clear, Mr. Speaker. We believe in life-affirming care for  the mother and the baby that God is growing inside of her, but we also  believe that the government in no way, no shape, and no form should be  paying to facilitate ending that life.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to back this amendment and defeat  the motion to obstruct. Let's save some lives.
