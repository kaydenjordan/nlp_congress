 Madam Speaker, I thank so much Representative Bergman  for yielding. It is a great pleasure to be a neighbor to the wonderful  Upper Peninsula of Michigan.   Veterans Day has been celebrated under different names since World  War I, but the premise remains the same: We pause to honor the men and  women who have selflessly served our Nation and have kept us free.   We honor their love of country, their patriotism, and their  willingness to sacrifice for our greater good. Our country has faced  many challenges in the last 100-plus years. From Belleau Woods to  Normandy to the global war on terror, every time, our warriors have  answered the Nation's calls.   This year, as we close the chapter on Afghanistan, we are again  reminded of the sacrifices they have made, the kindness in their  hearts, and their dedication to the mission.   This Veterans Day, reflect on the gift they have given us, respect  their service, and thank them for their sacrifice. Because of them, we  live in the greatest Nation on Earth.   On behalf of my constituents, thank you, and may God bless all of  you.
