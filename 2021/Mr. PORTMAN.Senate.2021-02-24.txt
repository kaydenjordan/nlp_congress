 Mr. President, I am here on the floor today to talk  about the need for all of us to redouble our efforts to combat drug  addiction. One of the top priorities I have had in my time in public  service has been to combat this crisis, which has devastated so many  families, destroyed so many communities, and impacted us in so many  negative ways.   Unfortunately, under the cover of the coronavirus pandemic, there is  an epidemic that is growing, and that is the drug addiction epidemic.  It is heartbreaking because we actually had several years of progress.  We were making progress, finally, in turning the tide, and now, it is  coming back with a vengeance to the point that overdoses and overdose  deaths, hospitalizations, and all the other negative consequences of  drug addiction is being raised up again in the context of the  coronavirus.   Here, in the Congress, we have taken a leadership role on addressing  this issue. Over the last several years, Congress has appropriated  billions of dollars--and not that money solves everything, but the  money has been pretty well spent on programs that are actually tested,  evidence-based programs on prevention, on treatment, and longer term  recovery.   Once called the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act, which I  authored with my colleague, Sheldon Whitehouse, on the other side of  the aisle, there is other legislation, too, called the 21st Century  Cures Act. All of this has provided help that goes down to the local  level, the community level, to be able to create a network, to be able  to push back against the addiction crisis.   In 2017, Ohio's overdose opioid death rate was almost three times the  national average. Ohio was one of the worst States in the country in  terms of our opioid addiction. In terms of opioid deaths, we were top  three in the country. It is not something you want to be at the top of.  Nearly a dozen Ohioans were dying from these dangerous drugs every  single day. This is in 2017. It surpassed car crashes as our country's  No. 1 killer among young people and, for Ohio, the No. 1 overall.   But that next year, in 2018, much of what we were doing here in  Congress, the work again on the CARA Act, the Cures Act, and other  things that were being done at the State level and local level that  were being supported by our Federal legislation, they were starting to  work. So, in 2018, Ohio led the country again, but this time it wasn't  in overdose deaths. It was in the reduction of overdose deaths. We  actually had a 22-percent reduction from 2017 to 2018.   By the way, the same thing happened nationally. We had a reduction in  overdose deaths nationally in 2018 for the first time since 1990. Think  about that. From 1990 until 2018, every single year, we had more people  dying from overdoses in this country, driven in large part by opioids,  and, more recently, by the most deadly of opioids, synthetic opioids  like fentanyl and Carfentanil.   Unfortunately, again, under the cover of this coronavirus pandemic,  drug addiction has flourished, and that positive progress has been  reversed. It is heartbreaking. While we need to remain committed to  solving the healthcare challenges of COVID-19, there is increasing  evidence that the stresses of this unprecedented time are driving a  spike in drug abuse and subsequent overdoses, this making 2020 the  worst year in the history of our country in terms of overdose deaths  and other measurements of drug addiction.    Why? Well, I have asked a lot of people that. Common sense would tell  you people are lonelier. Many people are distraught. Maybe they have  lost their job. Maybe they have had someone in their family die of  COVID-19. People are feeling anxious. People are unable to access  recovery programs in person, so they can't go sit down with their  recovery coach, which they might have been able to do but for COVID-19  and the isolation that is required. Many of those in recovery from  addiction are stalled in their progress, or they are suffering from  relapses.   There is a story that ran last week about a record number of overdose  deaths in my home State of Ohio. It was on FOX 8 in Cleveland. One of  the people they interviewed was a Cleveland woman who had lost her son  to an overdose. It was pretty powerful. She talked about how important  it is for people fighting addiction to have that network of support. It  was hard to find during COVID-19. She said: ``An addict needs to talk  to someone, they need constant reassuring from their support group.''   She is right. There are a lot of troubling statistics out there that  should be a cause for concern and a call to action for all of us. The  Centers for Disease Control reported that more than 81,000 people died  of drug overdoses in the 12 months ending in May 20 of 2020, the  highest 12-month total in our Nation's history. So, again, it looks  like 2020 is going to be the worst year ever.   The American Medical Association reports that more than 40 States  have reported an increase in opioid-related deaths during the COVID-19  pandemic. A recent study in the JAMA Psychiatry journal found that a  45-percent increase was the overdose death increase in emergency rooms  from April to October of 2020 compared to that same time in 2019.   It would be worse, in my view, without the Federal response to the  coronavirus pandemic, including some measures to ensure those suffering  from addiction can continue to get the care they need through  telehealth. We have cut redtape. We have provided some regulatory  relief to expand telehealth and telehealth options specifically for  opioid treatment, like eliminating requirements for in-person visits  before prescribing lifesaving drugs like buprenorphine.   Without these expanded services, I believe the overdose spike would  be even worse. Although there is no substitute for face-to-face  interaction to help along an individual's journey to recovery,  telehealth has kept patients in touch with their doctors at least and  allowed physicians to prescribe medication-assisted treatment remotely.   In talking to those who are recovery coaches or those doctors back  home who specialize in addiction, they tell me they believe that the  telehealth option has been extremely important, so even though it has  gotten worse, it would have gotten even worse if people had not had at  least the ability to access their recovery program through a remote  means.   Interestingly, these telehealth options for addiction treatments were  put in place temporarily, but they have proven to be such a viable  option for addiction treatment that now people are talking about making  them permanent. I agree with that. I don't think it makes sense to get  away from them as this pandemic goes away, which is why yesterday,  along with my colleague, Sheldon Whitehouse, I entered this legislation  called the Telehealth Response for E-Prescribing Addiction Services  Treatment Act. The reason that is such a long name is we wanted to make  the acronym TREATS, which it is. The TREATS Act makes permanent a  number of temporary waivers for telehealth services and bolsters  telehealth options for addiction treatment services.   Let's turn to a couple of things specifically. First, it allows for a  patient to be prescribed lower-scheduled drugs like Suboxone through a  telehealth visit on their first visit, as opposed to having to go in  person for that first visit.   Current law requires an in-person visit when you need an initial  prescription for controlled substances, but this has been a real  deterrent for patients in crisis and in urgent need of treatments from  Schedule III or Schedule  [[Page S871]]  IV drugs like Suboxone or certain drugs for reoccurring mental health  conditions, so our bill is important in that regard.   It also limits abusive practices by limiting telehealth visits to  those who have both audio and video capabilities to be able to interact  with the treatment providers to reduce fraud and abuse when it is your  first visit. It would also keep the existing requirements for in-person  visits when prescribing Schedule II drugs like opioids or stimulants  that are more prone to being abused during these telehealth visits. So  we have provisions in there to avoid abuse, but it is important to  continue this telehealth option when other options just aren't there.   Second, our bill would allow for Medicare to bill for audio-only or  telephone telehealth services for mental health and substance abuse  treatment if it is not the patient's first visit. Due to distance or  access to broadband, in-person visits or even video appointments aren't  always possible for our seniors. We still need to focus on safety and  robust treatment options, but in order to balance the needs of  patients, we propose to allow our Nation's seniors under Medicare to  use phones for subsequent mental health or behavioral health visits  when they don't have access to the internet and where face-to-face  interaction just isn't as necessary.   I believe this TREATS legislation will make a difference in the  addiction treatment space and will help us prevent more untimely  overdoses, but it is also important that we ensure that law enforcement  officials can continue to go after the supply of lethal drugs coming  into our communities, lethal drugs that are fueling these overdoses.   The most important thing, in my view, is reducing the demand dealing  with prevention, treatment, and recovery, but by stopping some of the  flow of these drugs, among other things, you are reducing the supply,  which raises the cost of these drugs on the street. And, unfortunately,  some of these drugs are unbelievably inexpensive, given how incredibly  powerful and deadly they can be.   Data from the Center for Disease Control shows that the biggest  driver of these surge in overdose deaths has been the class of drugs  called synthetic opioids. We talked about that a moment ago. They are  far deadlier than the traditional opioids like heroin but still cause  far too many overdoses.   The most well known of these drugs, fentanyl, is about 50 times  deadlier than heroin, and it is often less expensive. It is illegally  manufactured primarily in China, and then it is smuggled across our  southern border or through the U.S. mail. A pound of fentanyl is lethal  enough to kill half a million people. Think about that. One pound is  enough to kill half a million people.   We have made some progress keeping it out of the mail system. The  STOP Act is now in effect. We are working with the Postal Service and  also working with Customs and Border Protection to properly implement  that legislation, which I authored on a bipartisan basis here several  years ago, and it is finally being implemented to keep our mail system  from delivering poison into our communities.   But the traffickers have changed patterns, and a lot of it is now  going to Mexico and then coming over land across our southern border.   Across the country, law enforcement have had their hands full trying  to stop the flow of synthetic opioids. Ohio State Patrol troopers  seized a total of 129 pounds of fentanyl last year, enough to kill more  than 60 million people. We have 11.8 million people in Ohio, but our  troopers, just in Ohio, seized enough fentanyl to kill 60 million  people.   In one Ohio county, Cuyahoga County, there were more than 1,700  seizures of fentanyl by law enforcement in 2020. One DEA initiative to  fight drug trafficking that started just last August of 2020 has  resulted in the seizure of nearly 440 pounds of fentanyl.   Fentanyl itself is a schedule II drug, which means that law  enforcement is able to take appropriate actions to crack down on it,  and that is good. But there is a hidden challenge with fentanyl, and  that is that manufacturers can alter its chemical makeup in a lab to  make what is known as a fentanyl analog or a copycat. It is all  synthetic. So if some evil chemist somewhere can adjust the formula and  make it an analog, it is not subject to the schedule II charges that  law enforcement can bring. Because the chemical makeup is different in  fentanyl, it is not automatically illegal at all, in fact. What is  worse, these copycats can often be deadlier than fentanyl--take, for  instance, carfentanil, which is 100 times as deadly as fentanyl and  about 10,000 times more deadly than morphine. Just handling  carfentanil, if you were to spill some on yourself, can kill you.   In 2018, the Drug Enforcement Agency, DEA, made the right call by  temporarily making these fentanyl-related substances illegal to  possess, transport, or manufacture. Thanks to that designation, our law  enforcement officials have been better able to protect our communities  by seizing and destroying these fentanyl-related substances.   Unfortunately, the temporary extension by DEA ends in only a few  months. After May 6, 2021, these incredibly dangerous substances will  no longer be subject to strict regulation by law enforcement. It will  be easier for drug manufacturers in China and elsewhere to flood the  United States with carfentanil and other synthetic opioids. We can't  allow that to happen.   Of course, we can't allow that to happen, which is why yesterday I  introduced the bipartisan Federal Initiative to Guarantee Health by  Targeting Fentanyl, or FIGHT Fentanyl Act, along with my colleague  Senator Joe Manchin from West Virginia, another State that has been  devastated by the opioid epidemic. Our bill simply codifies the  existing DEA precedent to permanently schedule fentanyl-related  substances, allowing our law enforcement officials to continue to crack  down on synthetic opioid in all of its forms. Let's provide some  certainty, some predictability here, and make this permanent.   Just as importantly, it is going to send a signal to both the  American people and the manufacturers and smugglers that produce  synthetic opioids that we have not forgotten about this threat, and we  are going to do everything in our power to keep these deadly drugs out  of our communities.   The FIGHT Fentanyl Act and the TREATS Act are a couple of things that  we could do right now on a bipartisan basis, and we should. I urge my  colleagues to support them.   But we have a lot more work to do in the months ahead. The  authorization for the Comprehensive Addiction Recovery Act, the CARA  bill we talked about earlier, expires in fiscal year 2023. And Senator  Whitehouse and I will soon introduce a CARA 2.0 Act to build on the  successes of CARA with an unprecedented investment in expanding access  to proven treatment and recovery programs--again, programs that are  shown to work by evidence for treatment and recovery than longer term  recovery.   CARA 2.0 includes dozens of provisions to address addiction from all  fronts--research and education, treatment and recovery, criminal  justice reform, dealing with prescription drugs--making it the most  comprehensive legislation in our country's history. When added with the  existing CARA programs that are reauthorized through 2023, we would be  investing well over $1 billion to address this longstanding epidemic,  again, at a time when under the pandemic the epidemic is growing.   We need to be sure that as we continue to invest in the coronavirus  vaccine development and distribution, we are also focusing on this  epidemic. As we come out of this coronavirus pandemic--and I believe we  are starting to see some signs of that--let's be sure we are not  leaving in its wake more and more deaths and more and more addiction  with regard to the drug addiction crisis.   We need to all recognize the urgency of working to reverse this surge  and nationwide overdoses and overdose deaths. As we emerge from this  coronavirus pandemic, let's act now to ensure we have the tools in  place to also turn the tide on this disease and get those affected the  help they need.   I yield my time.
