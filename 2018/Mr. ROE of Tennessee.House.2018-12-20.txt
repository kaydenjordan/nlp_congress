Mr. Speaker, I encourage all Members to support  this legislation for an American hero, First Lieutenant Douglas  Fournet. It is a privilege to recommend this legislation, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (S. 3777) to require the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to  establish a tiger team dedicated to addressing the difficulties  encountered by the Department of Veterans Affairs in carrying out  section 3313 of title 38, United States Code, after the enactment of  sections 107 and 501 of the Harry W. Colmery Veterans Educational  Assistance Act of 2017.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  S. 3777         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Forever GI Bill Housing       Payment Fulfillment Act of 2018''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND SENSE OF CONGRESS.         (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:        (1) On August 16, 2017, the Harry W. Colmery Veterans       Educational Assistance Act of 2017 (Public Law 115-48) (known       by some as the ``Forever GI Bill'') was enacted into law.        (2) Such Act makes certain improvements to the Post-9/11       Educational Assistance program for veterans, including       improvements relating to how the Secretary of Veterans       Affairs calculates the amount of payments for monthly housing       stipends under that program.        (3) Section 107 of such Act (Public Law 115-48; 33 U.S.C.       3313 note) requires the Secretary to calculate the amount of       payments for monthly housing stipends based on the location       of the campus of the institution of higher learning where the       individual attends classes, a change from the previous       direction to make such calculation based on the location of       the institution of higher learning.        (4) Section 501 of such Act (Public Law 115-48; 37 U.S.C.       403 note) repeals the inapplicability of a modification of       the basic allowance for housing for members of the uniformed       services to benefits administered by the Department of       Veterans Affairs.        (5) The amendments made by section 107 and 501 of such Act       became effective on August 1, 2018, and January 1, 2018,       respectively.  [[Page H10429]]         (6) Representatives of the Department of Veterans Affairs       have stated that the Department will not be able to determine       proper payment amounts based on the amendment made by section       107 of such Act until December 1, 2019.        (7) Representatives of the Department have also stated that       outdated information technology systems have stymied efforts       to update necessary information that enable proper housing       payments as required by the provisions of law amended by       sections 107 and 501 of such Act.        (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--        (1) as soon as possible, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs       should end the making of improper payment amounts for monthly       stipends under section 3313 of title 38, United States Code;        (2) by January 1, 2020, the Secretary should make whole the       individuals entitled to payments of monthly stipends under       section 3313 of title 38, United States Code, who have been       underpaid as a result of the difficulties encountered by the       Department of Veterans Affairs in carrying out such section       after the enactment of sections 107 and 501 of the Harry W.       Colmery Veterans Educational Assistance Act of 2017 (Public       Law 115-48); and        (3) no individuals entitled to payments of monthly stipend       under section 3313 of title 38, United States Code, who have       been overpaid as a result of the difficulties encountered by       the Department in carrying out such section after the       enactment of sections 107 and 501 of such Act should have       overpayments recuperated by the Department.       SEC. 3. TIGER TEAM FOR HOUSING STIPENDS.         (a) Establishment.--Not later than one day after the date       of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Veterans       Affairs shall establish a tiger team (in this section       referred to as the ``Tiger Team'') dedicated to addressing       the difficulties encountered by the Department of Veterans       Affairs in carrying out section 3313 of title 38, United       States Code, after the enactment of sections 107 and 501 of       the Harry W. Colmery Veterans Educational Assistance Act of       2017 (Public Law 115-48; 38 U.S.C. 3313 note and 37 U.S.C.       403 note).        (b) Composition.--Not later than 15 days after the date of       the enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall submit to       Congress the names and titles of the employees of the       Department who compose the Tiger Team established under       subsection (a), including the name and title of the senior-      level employee of the Department who serves as the lead       accountable official of the Tiger Team.        (c) Duties.--        (1) Submission to congress.--Not later than 90 days after       the date of the enactment of this Act, the Tiger Team shall       submit to Congress the following:        (A) A plan describing the following:        (i) How the Secretary will obtain the information necessary       to determine the correct payment amounts for monthly stipends       under section 3313 of title 38, United States Code, made       after the enactment of sections 107 and 501 of the Harry W.

(iii) How the Secretary will identify all of the       individuals who received payments of monthly stipends under       section 3313 of such title that were not in compliance with       such section, after the enactment of sections 107 and 501 of       such Act (Public Law 115-48; 38 U.S.C. 3313 note and 37       U.S.C. 403 note).        (iv) How the Secretary will notify the individuals       described in clause (iii).

(B) A complete timeline for the implementation of the plan       described in subparagraph (A).

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and insert extraneous material during consideration of S. 3777.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of S. 3777, Forever GI Bill  Housing Payment Fulfillment Act of 2018.   Mr. Speaker, the Forever GI Bill is one of several landmark bills  that this Congress has enacted to help our Nation's veterans; however,  the implementation of this law has been bumpy, to say the least, and  there have been veterans who have been underpaid due to the Department  of Veterans Affairs' inability to modify their ancient IT systems to  properly implement the law.   While I am encouraged by Secretary Wilkie's decision to reset  implementation of the IT modifications, we owe it to our veterans to  conduct proper oversight of this process. That is why I am proud to  support this legislation introduced by my good friends Senator Boozman  of Arkansas and Mr.  Andy Barr of Kentucky on the House side.   This bill would require the VA to create a ``tiger team'' that would  produce a plan to ensure all GI bill users who were underpaid as a  result of the IT systems not being in place are made whole. The bill  would also require periodic updates on the VA's progress on providing  these underpayments to veterans.   Mr. Speaker, this bill will ensure the VA does the right thing and  pays student veterans what they are owed under the law. I encourage my  colleagues to support S. 3777, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I encourage all Members to support  S. 3777, and I yield back the balance of my time.
