 Mr. Chair, I thank my friend, Congressman  Rick Larsen, for yielding.   Mr. Chair, yesterday, I had a chance to talk about this legislation  and talk about the fact that there has been an input process that has  gone on for well over a year. This legislation is in excess of 840  pages and has achieved numerous bipartisan wins on things that are  advancing aviation safety and the aviation industry in the United  States.   There are a number of people behind the scenes who have put  tremendous hours of blood, sweat, and tears into this bill. I will take  a minute to thank the following folks: Hunter Presti, Laney Copeland,  Julie Devine, Chris Senn, Andrew Giacini, Will Moore, Jack Ruddy, Corey  Cooke, Abby Wenk, Leslie Parker, Brian Bell, Alex Menardy, Liz Forro,  Adam Weiss, Kathy Dedrick, and Stanton Johnson, as well as our own  deputy chief of staff, Maggie Ayrea, for all the work that they did to  put this legislation together.                                time  0945    I remind this body, Mr. Chairman, that this bill passed out of the  House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee on a unanimous vote.  I will be the first to admit that, certainly, there are some  imperfections--and my friend from Pennsylvania believes he has  identified one--but this legislation is really just a tremendous step  forward for the aviation industry in the United States.   I, again, thank Mr. Larsen. Sam Graves did an amazing job, as well as  Congressman Cohen for their partnership on this bill.
