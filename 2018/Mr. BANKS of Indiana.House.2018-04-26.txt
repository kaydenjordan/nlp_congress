 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of our  Nation's veterans.   Over the last 16 months, this Congress and President have made  tremendous progress for the men and women who have served our country  in uniform. Congress passed and the President signed into law the  largest expansion of GI benefits since World War II: appeals reform,  the Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act, and several other  important bills.   As a member of the House Veterans' Affairs Committee, I have been  proud to author legislation and contribute to these initiatives on  behalf of Hoosier veterans. But there is still so much more to do for  our veterans and to address many of the longstanding issues within the  VA, which is why it is absolutely vital that our next VA Secretary has  the experience and commitment needed to build upon the progress that we  have already made.   Our veterans have made tremendous sacrifices to keep our Nation free  and secure, and they deserve the highest quality of people serving at  the VA. Today, I urge the Trump administration to nominate a VA  Secretary committed to making important reforms and serving our  Nation's heroes who have served us so well.                            ____________________     Mr. Chairman, I want to thank Chairman Shuster  and my colleagues for their work on this underlying legislation.   My amendment is simple. It would designate the hangar at Smith  Airfield in Ft. Wayne, in my district, as the National Airmail Museum.  Currently, there is no such museum with this particular designation. I  want to also make clear that my amendment prohibits any Federal funding  to support this important initiative for the community. It is a zero- cost amendment.   The significance of hangar number 2, which is the only example of  Clark W. Smith's patented carousel design, makes it a fine fit for this  designation. In 1911, the United States Postal Service began airmail  delivery, and in 1930,  [[Page H3657]]  commercial airmail service came to Smith Airfield.   Mr. Chairman, this recognition would be a great addition to my  community and a vital tool to educate the American people on the  significant role airmail played in the evolution of aviation.  Furthermore, such recognition would propel the ongoing initiative to  preserve and share the history of airmail.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment and the  en bloc amendment and support the preservation of airmail history.
