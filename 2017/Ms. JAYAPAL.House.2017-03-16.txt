 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on the subject of my Special Order.    Mr. Speaker, this evening I rise to speak on behalf of  the Congressional Progressive Caucus, and I believe some of my  colleagues will be joining me, to talk about the budget that has just  been released by this President.   I would like to say, Mr. Speaker, that while it is being called a  skinny budget, we call it the billionaire's budget. It is the same  misguided, rambling, unfocused, bloated giveaway to rich and corporate  interests that has been offered for years.   My belief is that a budget is a statement of our values. This budget  ensures that the rich get richer at the cost of working people, the  environment, and the future of our country.    Funding has been axed for nearly 20 agencies, from the Corporation  for Public Broadcasting to the National Endowment for the Arts and the  National Endowment for the Humanities. In addition to elimination of  these important agencies, the billionaire's budget guts funding for  several other important agencies.   You can see here by this chart from The Washington Post exactly what  is happening: the Environmental Protection Agency chopped by 31  percent; the State Department cut by 29 percent; Agriculture cut by 21  percent, the Labor Department by 21 percent.  [[Page H2140]]    And the cuts go on through every single agency of critical importance  to the American people: Department of Health and Human Services,  Commerce, Education, Housing and Urban Development at a time when we  have a tremendous housing crisis in this country.   Transportation, from a President who said that he was going to invest  in our infrastructure, yet here you see that the Transportation budget  has a 13 percent cut.   Mr. Speaker, the reality is that the cost of security for the Trump  Tower is $183 million a year. The budget for the National Endowment for  the Arts is $148 million a year.   There are some other cuts that we could do if we were that concerned,  but let's talk about housing. Housing access and affordability is  squarely on the chopping block in this billionaire's budget.   With a $4.3 billion cut, HUD will lose its Community Development  Block Grant program. Now, some people don't know exactly what the  Community Development Block Grant program does; and, in fact, it  sounded like Director Mulvaney didn't know that either when he was  asked about a critical program that is funded through this Community  Development Block Grant program, and that is funding for Meals on  Wheels.   There are communities across this country that fund their Meals on  Wheels program, which is funding for meals for the elderly who cannot  get to somewhere where they can get a meal, and so we take them a meal.  That is Meals on Wheels, an incredibly bipartisan, beloved program.  Unfortunately, that would go away because the CDBG program would be  cut; and, therefore, the Meals on Wheels program would be cut.   These programs are an integral part of building up our communities,  both through affordable housing as well as through some of these  critical programs that go as wraparound services to affordable housing.   The city of Seattle, which I represent, is currently in a state of  emergency due to its housing crisis. Right now, there are around 3,000  people experiencing homelessness in the city and nearly 10,000 in the  surrounding areas--veterans, families, LGBTQ youth.   This is unacceptable. Access to stable housing is absolutely critical  to making sure that members of our community are safe and able to  access the services they need to get back on track and live full lives.   Let's talk about Health and Human Services. The Department of Health  and Human Services is facing an 18 percent cut to its funding, which  could have devastating--and I am talking about life and death-- consequences here, absolutely devastating impacts.   It would decrease the funding for the National Institutes of Health,  for cancer and medical research, critical programs that help us to  figure out how we save lives in this country and actually are part of  the innovation that the United States offers. Gutting this funding  would put us at a grave disadvantage, and it would put people's lives  at risk.   Transportation, another critical area that this President promised  that he was going to invest in. He was going to make sure we were  bringing forward jobs, that we were investing in our infrastructure,  our crumbling roads and bridges, making sure that we are investing in  critical transit and transportation projects. But in this budget, the  Transportation budget is facing a 13 percent cut. That is nearly half a  billion dollars from the TIGER grant program, which has allowed our  country to carry out critical infrastructure improvement projects not  just in one kind of a city, not just in urban areas, but urban and  rural areas alike.   The billionaire's budget would also cut funding to all new fully  funded grant agreements, including some really important projects in  cities across the country.   In Seattle, our critical streetcar project would be cut; and light  rail expansion, which we have been working on for years, the State has  invested in a bipartisan way--when I was in the State senate, we  actually passed a $15 billion transportation infrastructure package  because we knew that we had to deal with the transportation  infrastructure needs of business, of our communities across the State  and the influx of people into our State.                                time  1845    We agreed in a bipartisan way that this was something we needed to  do. Part of that agreement included being able to fund the next phase  of light-rail across our region.   Our Sound Transit CEO, Peter Rogoff, calls this budget a ``body  blow.'' I couldn't agree with him more. We are looking at potentially a  $7.7 billion cut to Sound Transit.   These are major transportation projects for our cities. They would  create jobs, which is what this President said that he wanted to do, is  create jobs. But by gutting these funds and gutting investment in  transportation infrastructure, we will be stopping the very projects  that are going to create those jobs and help our cities and rural areas  make the necessary upgrades that they need to thrive.   Mr. Speaker, one of the worst areas that is hit in this budget is the  environment. This billionaire's budget is an all-out assault on our  environment and efforts to fund research and curb climate change.   President Trump has found ways to wreak havoc on our efforts to  protect our planet by, in this budget, cutting climate research and  protection funds to multiple departments. This isn't just the  Environmental Protection Agency, but we are talking also about NASA  space exploration and many other areas that ensure that we preserve  this planet for the next generation.   I have got a 20-year-old, Mr. Speaker, and when I was running for  Congress, he said to me: Mom, you have got to work on climate change.  It is one of the most important issues facing my generation. You are  the stewards of our lands. If you don't take care of this planet, then  we won't have anything left and my children won't have anything left.   This is my 20-year-old son telling me this. Mr. Speaker, I promised  him I would do everything I can for his generation and future  generations to protect our planet.   Unfortunately, one of the biggest cuts in this budget is to the  Environmental Protection Agency. This is a 32 percent cut to the  Environmental Protection Agency. This decimates all of our work on  climate change, all of the research that we need to do so we know how  to protect our climate, all of the work on environmental justice  programs, which is really essential when you think about who is taking  the burden of climate change. It is our low-income communities,  communities of color, and other vulnerable and marginalized  communities.   I have always believed that we should rename the EPA. Environmental  Protection Agency makes it sound like it is something off in the  distance, like it is about something out there. But, in fact, what the  Environmental Protection Agency does is monitor our water so that we  have clean water to drink and use. It monitors our air so that we have  clean air to breathe and we don't have asthma and other respiratory  diseases that come with air that is so polluted that we can't even  survive in it. It ensures that we are protecting human health.   We could rename the EPA the Agency for Clean Water, Clean Air, and  Human Health, and I think that that would cover a lot of what the EPA  does.   The EPA's cut is going to result in 3,200 lost jobs. That is 20  percent of the department. Research programs would be discontinued both  domestically and around the world, and programs like the Clean Power  Plan and numerous restoration projects, including a critical  restoration project in the Puget Sound, the Puget Sound Restoration,  would lose 93 percent of its funding. This is true of the Great Lakes  region. There are places in Republican and Democratic districts across  this country that are going to suffer and see environmental protection  being rapidly undone.   President Trump has made it painfully clear that he and his  administration are enemies not only of the environment, but of the  science that tells us that yes, we must address climate change because  it is real and it is manmade. Yet, we are fighting efforts to  consistently undermine the research and the science that shows us  exactly  [[Page H2141]]  where we are as a country and what we must do in order to protect our  environment.   Let me talk about education for a second. With the appointment of  Betsy DeVos to the Department of Education, President Trump has  signaled that his administration has every intention of doing whatever  they can to privatize our education system. The billionaire's budget  takes the first steps in that process.   It increases charter school funding by $168 million and it adds $250  million to create a new, private school choice program. It cuts $3.7  billion in grants that go toward after-school programs, aid programs,  and important teacher training.   This budget would decimate Head Start. Head Start is a program that  has been shown to be successful. When you invest early in kids'  education and you make sure that you give them that early support, it  definitely has an impact in diminishing and breaking that school-to- prison pipeline.   These are investments that save us money in the long run. Not only  are they the most humane thing to do and the right thing to do, but  they are actually cost-effective programs that stop us from having to  spend millions of dollars down the line when people can't get a great  public education.   We should be investing in our public education program and making  sure that we are helping kids to go all the way from early learning to  higher education. That is the foundation of a great country, when we  are educating and investing in our students to have that kind of a  great education.   Mr. Speaker, I see that my colleague from the Progressive Caucus is  here. I yield to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Raskin), the  wonderful Representative from that State, because I know he has got  somewhere to go right after this. I invite him to come up here, and I  thank him for his leadership on all issues constitutional and  otherwise.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Raskin for his  consistent brilliance and leadership. I so appreciate it. It has been a  tremendous honor to serve with him here.   I want to talk about another area that we haven't covered yet, which  is the State and development programs budget. This is essentially our  efforts around diplomacy and development around the world. This would  be incredibly hard hit. The prime target is the United Nations. Climate  change initiatives at the United Nations would lose all of their  funding. The government would cut back its regular contribution to the  U.N. and pay no more than 25 percent of the cost of U.N. peacekeeping  operations. The budget would hit all of the multilateral development  banks, like the World Bank, which would be trimmed by $650 million over  3 years, and cultural programs like the East-West Center in Honolulu.   Today a number of Republican colleagues talked about how misguided  this cut was, and it made me very hopeful, to be honest.  Representatives Hal Rogers and Ted Yoho both agree that this cut is  absolutely misguided.   Several retired three- and four-star generals wrote a letter to  Congress expressing their deep concern over these serious budget cuts  that are being made to the State Department because they know that  diplomacy goes hand in hand with any kind of defense that has to be put  out there. You have got to have the two together. Here is what they  said: ``The State Department, USAID, Millennium Challenge Corporation,  Peace Corps and other development agencies are critical to preventing  conflict and reducing the need to put our men and women in uniform in  harm's way.''   In 2013, General Mattis himself said that if more funding for  development wasn't provided, he would have to buy more bullets.  Development programs are inextricably linked with our national  security, and this President should not be cutting these funds if he  wants to bolster national security. If he wants to bolster national  security, then we should be investing more of our dollars into  diplomacy and development as two of the other legs of a three-legged  stool. Unfortunately, he is going in the opposite direction.   Our aid and development efforts have to be well-rounded and holistic.  I know this because I have worked in international development before  all over the world. I have worked along the borders of Laos and  Cambodia, in Thailand. I have worked across south Asia. I have worked  in Latin America. I know and I understand that our relationships and  our ability to build  [[Page H2143]]  strong multilateral coalitions and to invest in the stability of  countries as war is happening there is absolutely essential to  preserving peace.   The generals wrote: ``We know from our service in uniform that many  of the crises our nation faces do not have military solutions alone-- from confronting violent extremist groups like ISIS in the Middle East  and north Africa to preventing pandemics like Ebola. . . .''   This 29 percent cut is absolutely unacceptable and will not keep us  safe.   The billionaire's budget doesn't just cut funding for these programs,  though. It also increases spending, and not for the benefit of our  communities. This administration is calling for $3 billion to detain  more immigrants, deport more people, and build a bigger border wall.  The staggering increase to detain an unprecedented 45,700 men and women  is unacceptable.   Mr. Speaker, 167 men and women have died in detention since October  2003. The organization that I used to work at put out a human rights  abuses report about the detention center controlled by the GEO  corporation, private detention center way back in 2005 or 2006. We  looked at all of the human rights abuses that were happening not only  in that detention center, but we did research on what was happening  around the country.   Among the 35 death reviews in this recent report that came out that  have been released through Freedom of Information Act requests,  substandard medical care contributed to at least 15 deaths. And even  when government investigations concluded that a facility violated  government detention standards, the government fails to hold these  private facilities accountable and make sure that changes are made to  address deficiencies that lead to the loss of human life.   Instead of spending $3 billion on immigration enforcement and  detention, here is what we could do with that money: We could create  45,000 new middle class jobs. We could build 184 new elementary  schools. We could hire about 55,000 new kindergarten and elementary  schoolteachers. We could provide close to 337,000 Head Start slots for  young kids. We could pay for nearly 311,000 people to attend a 4-year  college per year. We could help States protect and save up to 12,000  at-risk wildlife and plant species in the United States every year for  the next 2.3 years. By the way, we could also provide nearly 2.1  million households with solar energy. We could weatherize over 460,000  homes nationwide, saving the average household about $283 a year. And  we could provide 10 million lifesaving HIV/AIDS treatments.   Mr. Speaker, this budget is about profit over safety, privatization  over public good. It is about war over peace and diplomacy. And it is  about incarceration over rehabilitation. It is fundamentally about  billionaires and lobbyists over the American people.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
