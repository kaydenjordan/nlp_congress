 Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Deutch for yielding.   In recent years, the living conditions for the Cuban people have  deteriorated rapidly. Shortages of basic goods like food, medicine,  even hygienic products like diapers, have become the norm. Socialism  and communism have truly failed. The economy has collapsed and in order  to maintain power, leaders have only tightened their stranglehold on  the people.   The Cuban people have responded. This past summer we witnessed  history. Cubans from all walks of life peacefully took to the streets  demanding reform and freedom. They were met with violence. Since then,  demonstrators have been rounded up, and show trials, arbitrary  detentions, and crackdowns on thought and speech have followed.  Activists are still missing and have not been seen for months. Our  hearts are with the Cuban exile community, nearly 1.6 million in  Florida alone, including many second- and third-generation Floridians.   They call America home because they cannot call Cuba home due to the  violent, Communist dictatorship. This resolution is an important  statement by the people's House that we will not stand by while Cubans  suffer and die. And we will lead the international community in holding  the Communist regime accountable. Please vote ``yes.''
