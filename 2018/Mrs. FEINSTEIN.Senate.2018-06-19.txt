 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I rise in support of the  appropriations package currently under consideration, particularly the  section dealing with Energy and Water Development appropriations.   I know my good friend Senator Alexander, the chairman of our  Appropriations Energy and Water Subcommittee, spoke last evening. I  have served as chairman or ranking member of that committee for the  past 5 years--we have alternated--and it has been a real pleasure and a  great privilege for me to work with him.   I also want to thank Senator Shelby and Vice Chairman Leahy. Perhaps  people don't know this, but they have taken truly meaningful steps to  return us to regular order. It has been a long time coming, and I truly  hope it can be maintained. I have been on the Appropriations Committee  for more than two decades, and I have been saddened to watch as we have  descended into partisanship year after year and lessened our influence  as a committee.   Believe it or not, it has been 21 years since Congress passed all 12  appropriations bills by October 1. Since then, we have just staggered  through a series of continuing resolutions and omnibuses. So I thank my  colleagues on the Appropriations Committee for supporting this bill  during markup, where we saw a vote of 30 to 1. I hope we will be able  to maintain that spirit of bipartisanship on the floor, and I urge my  colleagues to refrain from offering poison pill amendments, which would  derail our progress.   I believe this is a fair bill. It contains tradeoffs and hard  choices. I certainly don't agree with everything in it--particularly  the nuclear weapons portion--but I support passage of the bill by the  Senate.   Overall, the bill provides $43.8 billion for the Army Corps of  Engineers, the Bureau of Reclamation, the Department of Energy, and  other agencies. This is an increase of $566 million over fiscal year  2018 levels.   I want to highlight the fact that we received an increase in our  nondefense allocation of $474 million above 2018. This is a very  generous allocation, and it has allowed us to do the following: to  increase funding for reclamation programs that prevent and mitigate the  effect of drought throughout 19 western States; to increase funding for  critical Army Corps infrastructure; and to increase funding for the  Office of Science, the largest single supporter of basic scientific  research in the United States.   We were also able to continue strong support for applied energy  programs, particularly those that fund the development of carbon-free  renewable technologies.   Even with a more modest defense allocation, we fund efforts to  address the environmental legacy of the Cold War in Tennessee, South  Carolina, New Mexico, Washington, and other States.   The bill also funds key priorities in nuclear nonproliferation,  including securing radiological materials in hospitals and industrial  facilities in this country and helping our international partners do  the same.   Before I turn to nuclear weapons, I wish to speak briefly about  nuclear waste. There are over 80,000 metric tons of spent fuel stored  at 77 reactor sites in 33 States. The vast majority of that is still  stored in wet pools. This is important because every one of us has  communities struggling to deal with their legacy nuclear waste. For the  sixth year in a row, this bill includes a provision that would create a  nuclear waste pilot program to allow for interim, consent-based storage  of commercial spent nuclear fuel. But I want to say to all my  colleagues in the Senate, we need your support to get this  [[Page S4019]]  done. We have a bipartisan path here in the Senate, but the House won't  budge. They won't support any nuclear waste proposal that isn't Yucca  Mountain. After all these years that have gone by, we can't let another  year go by with no movement on nuclear waste. We need the Senate to be  united, and we need your help to push the House to stop holding our  bipartisan pilot program hostage to their impossible demands on Yucca  Mountain.   Finally, I want to speak briefly about nuclear weapons.  Unfortunately, this bill includes the $65 million requested by the  Trump administration to begin to modify the existing W76 warhead for  the new low-yield weapon. If fully funded, this new nuclear capability  will be completed in just 2 years.   I strongly oppose funding for this new nuclear weapon. I firmly  believe we already have enough nuclear weapons, and the military  actually agrees. When testifying before Congress on March 20, 2018,  Gen. John Hyten, the commander of U.S. Strategic Command, said:         I have everything I need today to deter Russia from doing       anything against the United States of America. We're fully       ready against any threat that exists today, without a doubt.    That is the head of our nuclear forces saying he has everything he  needs. So why waste money on new nuclear weapons the military doesn't  need?   Not only do I share General Hyten's belief that we already have  enough nuclear weapons in general, but I also believe we definitely  don't need any low-yield nuclear weapons in particular.   The Trump administration has argued that it needs this new nuclear  weapon in order to have a proportionate response to a Russian first-use  of a low-yield weapon. That line of argument makes clear that the  administration is actually contemplating using nuclear weapons to fight  limited nuclear wars. Just think about it. There is no such thing as a  limited nuclear war. We are kidding ourselves if we think there is, and  the military agrees.   In February, Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis said:         I don't think there is any such thing as a ``tactical       nuclear weapon.'' Any nuclear weapon used any time is a       strategic game-changer.    I share Secretary Mattis's view. I don't believe there is any such  thing as a limited nuclear war. Once a nuclear weapon is used by any  country against any target, that is the end of us. Therefore, I do not  see any reason to develop low-yield weapons.   We have steadfastly funded the modernization of our nuclear stockpile  and its supporting infrastructure over the past 8 years. Altogether,  the Congressional Budget Office estimates that over the next 30 years,  we will spend $1.7 trillion to upgrade and maintain nearly all of our  nuclear forces. But the low-yield submarine launched ballistic missile  warhead is separate and apart from the scope of that effort. Funding it  simply does not make sense from either a budgetary or a strategic  perspective.   Despite my opposition to funding for this nuclear warhead, I do  recognize that, in other ways, this is a balanced bill. It builds on  the investments we were able to make in the fiscal year 2018  omnibus. It provides another $200 million for water projects in the  West, and it continues investments in clean technologies that will help  combat the effects of climate change. It is not perfect. It is not the  bill I would have written if I were chairman, but on balance, I support  this bill. I urge my colleagues to do so as well.    Once again, it is a great pleasure for me to work with my chairman.  We have worked together now for over 5 years on this committee and  produced a bill every year. Both of us have made compromises, and I am  very proud of the relationship. I thank the chairman.   I yield the floor.
