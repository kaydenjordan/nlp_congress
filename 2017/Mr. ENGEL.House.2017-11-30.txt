 Mr. Speaker, I, too, rise to mourn the loss of our great  colleague, Maurice Hinchey.   I knew Maurice for more than 30 years. We served together for many  years in the New York State Assembly, and then he came to Congress.   In the assembly in Albany and all of New York State, he was known as  one of the champions of the environment. He chaired that committee in  Albany. When he came to Washington, he also, as my colleagues have  said, championed green things and making sure the environment was safe  for all of us for generations to come.   The thing that I really remember about Maurice Hinchey is what a nice  person he was. He was soft-spoken but sharp, intelligent, and honest.  He was the kind of person who was in public service for all the right  reasons and really was a model Member of Congress for so many of us.  Whether you agreed with him or disagreed with him, he listened to you.  He was a tenacious fighter and a really smart individual who really,  really knew his subject.   The thing I remember about Maurice is what a nice guy he was, how  soft-spoken he was, and how caring he was. He didn't enter public life  to get the accolades. He entered it because he really believed  government should make a difference and could make a difference.   Let me say, Maurice, you did make a difference: You made a difference  to many in America; you made a difference to those of us in New York  State; you made a difference to your friends who served in the New York  State Assembly in Albany; and you made a difference in the United  States Congress here in Washington.   Rest in peace, Maurice. We will miss you, but we will never forget  you.                            ____________________
