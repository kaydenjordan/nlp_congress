 Mr. President, I want to recognize my dear  friends Ida and Irwin Haber for receiving the Jewish National Fund's  Northern Ohio Tree of Life Award. This award is given in recognition of  outstanding community involvement, professional leadership, and  dedication to the cause of American-Israeli friendship with the  devotion to peace and the security of human life. Ida and Irwin Haber  are of the utmost quality and character for this honor. It is fitting  that they receive this award jointly, as their personal and  professional lives have been a team effort for the past 44 years and  have been guided by their strong Jewish identity and heritage from the  start.   Ida and Irwin met at a United Synagogue Youth event in high school  and have been together ever since. It is their faith and commitment to  the Jewish people that helped bring them together, and they remain  active members of the Jewish community. Irwin serves as the Ohio  chapter Chairman and National Board member of the Friends of the Israel  Defense Forces, on the National Council of the American Israel Public  Affairs Committee, and is a member of the Endowment Fund Committee of  the Jewish Federation of Cleveland. Additionally, he and Ida serve in  leadership roles for the University Hospitals Ahuja Medical Center.   Business has been a family venture for the Habers as well. In 1993,  Irwin became the chairman and owner and Ida became vice president of  the PDI Group. Their leadership and vision for this manufacturer of  weapons platform support systems has built an internationally reputable  business that provides equipment to U.S. Air Force and Navy and 45 air  forces across the world. The PDI Group has been recognized by the U.S.  Small Business Association and the Department of Commerce for its  accomplishments and excellence.   Ida and Irwin Haber have led lives of faith and have served their  customers and their community admirably. Perhaps their greatest  achievement is their beautiful family. They have three adult children,  Nathan, Ryan, and Rena, who work for the family business; two  daughters-in-law, Yana and Shlomit; and three granddaughters, Arianna,  Ava, and Noa.   On a personal level, Jane and I are grateful for Ida and Irwin's  advice and friendship, for having us to their home for Shabbat dinner,  and for numerous other good memories.   On behalf of the U.S. Senate, I congratulate Ida and Irwin Haber for  being honored with the Jewish National Fund's Northern Ohio Tree of  Life Award.                            ____________________
