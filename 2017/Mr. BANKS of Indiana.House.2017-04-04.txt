 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for his  leadership on important issues like these.   Unfortunately, my home State of Indiana is no stranger to severe  weather. As we enter peak tornado season, my constituents are  vulnerable to tornado outbreaks which could lead to loss of life and  destruction. Protecting lives and property from severe weather needs to  be a top priority at NOAA. I am glad we are addressing this issue for  that reason today.   This legislation will greatly improve our ability to predict severe  weather, like the tornadoes that affect my district, through a focused  program to enhance forecasting. When mere seconds make the difference  between life and death, my constituents deserve the most accurate and  timely forecasts available, and I am confident that this legislation  will help give them that information.   I am also pleased that this bill gives NOAA the ability to  incorporate data and forecasting skill from private sector companies  like Harris Corporation in northeast Indiana, which employs about 450  engineers and technicians in my district. These talented professionals  build the world's most advanced weather satellite instruments.   Many government-operated systems are slow and costly, and the private  sector can be used to fill critical weather data needs. Directing NOAA  to integrate next-generation commercial solutions improves our ability  to protect lives and property.   The time to think outside of the government-only-weather-data box is  now. That is why I applaud the chairman of the Science, Space, and  Technology Committee, Mr. Smith, as well as my colleague from Oklahoma  (Mr. Lucas) for bringing this important legislation to the forefront. I  look forward to its passage into law.
