 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I thank the gentleman from Georgia, my friend, for yielding me the  customary 30 minutes for debate.   Mr. Speaker, I echo the sentiments of my friend from Georgia with  reference to the ongoing recovery period that we are experiencing in  region four, and I especially offer compliments to the Federal family  of agencies that have been on the ground working in all of our region.   Like my friend from Georgia, my home is without power, and we urge  patience. The authorities are working with the utility companies and  they really do have a lot of people on the ground, and it is expected  that they will be able to restore power and we will be able to take the  long-range view with reference to recovery.   Certainly, we want to thank the first responders. The local  authorities have been on their game at their best, as well as the  National Oceanic Weather Service that has supplied a lot of information  to all of us.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to debate the rule for H.R. 3697, the  Criminal Alien Gang Member Removal Act. Today's rule brings the number  of closed rules for the 115th Congress to 42. In other words, more than  50 percent of the legislation coming out of the Rules Committee has  been closed off from open and honest debate; closed off by my  Republican friends.   At the beginning of this Congress, we were told by my Republican  colleagues and the Speaker that they would run the government and, more  particularly, the people's House in an open and transparent manner.  They even championed regular order. Well, that spirit has clearly been  jettisoned in favor of an overtly partisan approach to governing that  is indeed unfortunate.   By way of example, the bill we are discussing today was introduced  last Thursday, brought to the Rules Committee last night, and is now  going to be put before the House for a vote without the committee of  jurisdiction holding one hearing on the bill or Members having the  opportunity to offer their amendments, which is too bad, because this  bill is really in desperate need of help.   During our debate last night, one of my Republican colleagues on the  Rules Committee posed three hypothetical situations and asked: If this  bill were to become law, what effect the bill would have in those  instances?   Not surprisingly, the answers we got were confusing, convoluted, and  contradictory. Now we find ourselves here today asking the entire  membership of the people's House to vote on something for which no one  can honestly say they know what the unintended consequences would be if  this bill were to become law.                                time  1230    Bad process makes bad bills, and the process we have witnessed with  this bill can't get much worse.   Mr. Speaker, challenged by their party's leader, Donald John Trump,  to fix DACA, House leadership, instead, brings this bill to the floor,  a bill that does nothing but peddle in the politics of fear, a bill  that purports to make communities safer, when all it does is serve red  meat to the Republican base and foment xenophobia.   Everyone in this House, everyone in this Nation, can agree that  confronting and defeating the perpetrators of gang violence is a good  and worthy goal. In fact, we already have laws on the books that do  just that. We already have task forces on gangs in virtually all of our  communities.   This bill, on the other hand, will not make our communities safer. It  will, however, undermine the rule of law in this country by betraying  our commitment to the Constitution's guarantee of due process. The bill  is also glaringly pretextual in its approach and overbroad in its  effect so that it can be seen as nothing other than yet another move to  implement Donald John Trump's promise to the Republican base to engage  in mass deportation of immigrant communities across our country.   Mr. Speaker, there is no doubt that our immigration system is in dire  need of attention. It is also clear that we should approach our work in  a manner that is fair to all Americans and compassionate toward those  who have fled unbelievable violence and are seeking a better life here  in the United States.   We should be proud that we remain--despite the anti-immigrant  rhetoric emanating from the White House--a beacon of hope for freedom- loving people around the world, and we should remain welcoming upon  their arrival.   This, however, is not the tack taken by many of my Republican  friends, and is certainly not the path taken by House leadership with  today's bill.   As evidence of their approach, we need only to look at the despair  the Republican Party has cast upon the 800,000 DREAMers who live in  this country. Instead of finally making permanent the status of  DREAMers in this country as full citizens, the first act the Republican  majority takes after Donald John Trump tweeted that he would end DACA,  then tweeted that he would revisit the issue in 6 months, the first  thing that they did was to present a bill that is so broadly drafted  that a group of five or more nuns could constitute a criminal gang in  the eyes of the law.   Indeed, the bill's harboring provisions under section 274 of the  Immigration and Nationality Act are, as Sister Simone Campbell said,  ``so sweeping that religious workers who provide shelter,  transportation, or support to undocumented immigrants could be found  liable of criminal activity. The Federal courts have found that  `harboring' includes offering a known undocumented individual a place  to stay.''   Sister Simone concluded with this salient point: ``This statute has  been used against religious workers in the past, and this bill tries to  make it a weapon for the future.''   Mr. Speaker, it was only a few short years ago that the Grand Old  Party, in the wake of their electoral loss to President Barack Obama in  2012, issued their autopsy of what went wrong. That report concluded  that Republicans must do a better job reaching out to Hispanic  Americans.  [[Page H7327]]    Yet, instead of heeding their own advice, President Donald John Trump  called Mexican Americans murderers and rapists on the very first day of  his campaign. From that dark point on, Hispanic Americans have had to  watch one of the two major political parties in their country descend  further and further into the abyss of xenophobia.   Democrats stand ready to have a serious conversation about  comprehensive immigration reform and border security, and I urge my  Republican friends to put the red meat aside for the moment and work  with us.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to  the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Lofgren), my good friend, the  distinguished ranking member of the Judiciary Committee Subcommittee on  Immigration and Border Security, a clear-eyed thinker on this subject,  and has been the same for a protracted period of time. Few in this body  can rival her abilities on this particular subject.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, if we defeat the previous question, I am going to offer  an amendment to the rule to bring up H.R. 3440, the DREAM Act. This  bipartisan, bicameral legislation would help thousands of young people  who are Americans in every way except on paper.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately  prior to the vote on the previous question.   The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Barton). Is there objection to the  request of the gentleman from Florida?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Sanchez) to discuss our proposal. My good friend is the  distinguished vice chair of the Democratic Caucus.    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman from California an  additional 30 seconds.    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman from California an  additional 30 seconds.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record statements in opposition to H.R.  3697 by the American Civil Liberties Union, the Asian Americans  Advancing Justice, the Service Employees International Union, and the  National Hispanic Leadership Agenda.                                 American Civil Liberties Union,                                 Washington, DC, September 12, 2017.      Re vote ``no'' on H.R. 3697, the ``Criminal Alien Gang Member           Removal Act''.         Dear Representative: On behalf of the American Civil       Liberties Union (ACLU) and our nearly two million members and       supporters, we urge members of the House to oppose H.R. 3697       which is expected to be brought up for a floor vote as early       as Thursday, September 14.        The American Civil Liberties Union recommends a NO vote on       this bill because it will promote widespread racial       profiling, violate First Amendment protections, expand       mandatory detention of immigrants, raise serious       constitutional questions on judicial review of government       designations of certain groups, and bar humanitarian relief       for individuals in violation of international treaties.        H.R. 3697 will promote widespread racial profiling, risking       violation of individuals' Fifth Amendment equal protection       rights.        H.R. 3697 will empower the immigration authorities to       conduct dragnet sweeps of Latino communities and other       communities of color. Media reports make clear that law       enforcement has recently relied on questionable and       unreliable evidence to assert that Latino individuals are       gang members, including wearing certain kinds of clothes or       doodling an area code from a Latin American country on a       school notebook. Officers have alleged gang membership       sometimes based on merely being seen with people who are       alleged gang members or living in neighborhoods known to       suffer gang activity. This bill gives DHS the latitude to       arrest, detain, and deport noncitizens including long-time       green card holders for the ``crime'' of living in an       immigrant neighborhood or showing pride in their countries of       origin.        Gang databases information-sharing arrangements between       local law enforcement and federal immigration authorities are       flawed, inaccurate, encourage biased policing, and have been       repeatedly shown to be unreliable. Gang databases have       extremely low thresholds for inclusion: simply living in a       neighborhood where there are gang members or talking to       people who are gang members often results in a young person       being placed in a gang database. An audit of California's       gang database CalGangs found that law enforcement could not       substantiate a significant proportion of their entries into       the gang database. Reliance on gang databases will only       further encourage racial profiling of young men of color       living in poor neighborhoods.        H.R. 3697 seeks to deport immigrants based on a mere       ``reason to believe'' that they have been involved in gang       activities. This overly broad designation could sweep up       individuals who have not engaged in criminal activity.       Indeed, in many cases, H.R. 3697 could make immigrants       deportable for activities protected by the First Amendment.        H.R. 3697 subjects an individual to deportation if the       Secretary of Homeland Security or Attorney General ``knows or       has reason to believe'' that an individual is a gang member.       A person is also subject to deportation, if, the individual       has ``participated in the activities'' of the ``gang''       knowing or having reason to know that their activities will       ``promote, further, aid or support'' the illegal activity.       This expansive language could sweep up people who have       committed no criminal activity whatsoever.        Even worse, H.R. 3697 risks making people deportable for       activities that are constitutionally protected under the       First Amendment.        ``Reason to believe'' is an exceedingly low standard of       proof that will subject people to deportation based on mere       probable cause of gang involvement. This is especially       troubling given the lack of strict rules of evidence in       immigration court, where individuals may be deemed gang       members based on hearsay.        H.R. 3697 includes no exception for offenses committed as a       juvenile. However, the Supreme Court has recognized the broad       legal consensus that juveniles should be held to different       standards of culpability.        H.R. 3697 also includes no exception for having       ``participated in the activities of a gang under duress,       which is a well-recognized defense against criminal conduct.       Many vulnerable individuals may have ``participated in the       activities'' of a gang under coercion, including for fear of       their lives or those of their family members. It raises       serious due process concerns to subject individuals to       removability based on such conduct.        H.R. 3697 grants the Department of Homeland Security       massive discretion to designate a group as a ``criminal       gang'', based on secret evidence, and without meaningful       judicial review, which raises serious constitutional       questions.        H.R. 3697 creates a vague and overbroad definition of a       ``criminal gang'' that sweeps in lawful and constitutionally       protected conduct.        H.R. 3697 grants the Secretary of Homeland extraordinarily       broad discretion to designate a group a ``criminal gang'',       based on ``classified'' or ex parte evidence that the       designated individuals may not access, even in a court       challenge. The Government's ability to rely on secret       evidence to make and defend the gang designation raises       serious due process concerns.        H.R. 3697 also bars individuals from ``rais[ing] any       question concerning the validity of [a gang designation]'' in       their own removal proceedings.        H.R. 3697 provides little to no opportunity to challenge       for those unjustly subject to a gang designation. A group       cannot petition for revocation for two years after the       designation, during which time alleged members cannot       challenge the validity of that designation in removal       proceedings--thereby punishing and deporting individuals over       facts they cannot challenge. Similarly, groups have 30 days       to file a legal challenge to the designation in court, but       that judicial review cannot prevent other pieces of the act       from moving forward, such as removal proceedings, until there       is a final order from the  [[Page H7330]]       court. Whether petitioning for revocation or challenging a       designation in court, this act has the effect of punishing       and removing individuals without providing sufficient options       for recourse or redress.        H.R. 3697 bars important forms of humanitarian relief for       individuals fleeing persecution and children facing       situations of abuse, which violates U.S. treaty obligations       and raises serious constitutional concerns.        At the same time, H.R. 3697 bars individuals accused of       gang involvement from asylum and withholding of removal, thus       stripping individuals fleeing persecution--including       potentially thousands of individuals fleeing gang violence in       Central America--from refuge in the United States. H.R. 3697       thus violates U.S. obligations under the Refugee Convention       and the international law prohibition of nonrefoulement, or       the return of individuals to situations where they will face       persecution or torture.        H.R. 3697 would also strip children accused of gang       involvement of eligibility for Special Immigrant Juvenile       Status (SIJS), which provides immigration relief to children       facing abuse and neglect. To deport these children would be       cruel and irrational when many of the children applying for       SIJS have come to the U.S. to flee gang violence in Central       America.        H.R. 3697 irrationally strips individuals of Temporary       Protected Status (TPS) which is an important humanitarian       protection for noncitizens.        H.R. 3697 expands the scope of mandatory detention, in       violation of the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause.        H.R. 3697 would require the mandatory detention of       immigrants accused of gang involvement, without the basic due       process of a bond hearing to determine if the person even       needs to be locked up in the first place.        H.R. 3697 would impose mandatory detention on individuals       who seek asylum at a port-of-entry--many of whom are fleeing       gang violence in Central America--by eliminating parole for       asylum seekers accused of gang ties.        The detention provisions raise serious due process       concerns. As the Supreme Court has held, ``[i]n our society,       liberty is the norm, and detention prior to trial or without       trial is the carefully limited exception.'' Although the       Supreme Court has upheld limited periods of mandatory       immigration detention where Congress found certain categories       of noncitizens to pose a heightened flight risk or risk to       public safety, H.R. 3697 sweeps far beyond what is       constitutionally permissible.        Separate from any relationship with gang affiliation, the       TPS-specific provisions of the legislation revise the statute       to allow the government to detain noncitizens with TPS       ``whenever appropriate under any provision of law.'' This       potentially raises the specter that noncitizens who have been       granted protection by our government could languish in       detention for prolonged periods of time, in violation of due       process.        The detention provisions are a massive waste of taxpayer       dollars. The immigration authorities already have full       authority to detain any individual pending a removal       proceeding. Individuals remain in detention unless they meet       their burden of proving, either to an immigration judge at a       bond hearing or to an ICE office make a parole determination,       that they pose no flight risk or danger to the community.        For the above reasons the ACLU urges a NO vote on H.R.       3697, the ``Criminal Alien Gang Removal Act.''            Regards,      Faiz Shakir,        Director, Washington Legislative Office.      Lorella Praeli,        Director of Immigration Policy and Campaigns.                                   ____                                                     Asian Americans                                               Advancing Justice.    Vote ``No'' on H.R. 3697 ``Criminal Alien Gang Members Removal Act''         Dear Member of Congress: Asian Americans Advancing       Justice--AAJC urges you to vote NO on H.R. 3697, the Criminal       Alien Gang Members Removal Act. H.R. 3697 is unnecessary and       would criminalize immigrants without any due process       protections. Department of Homeland Security personnel would       have broad authority to designate someone as a gang member       without adequate justification or due process.        Additionally, it is shameful that this bill is going to the       house floor but the DREAM Act is not. Congress should not       vote on any immigration legislation until the Dream Act is       signed into law. Less than a week ago, President Trump       crossed a moral line in terminating the DACA program and       leaving 800,000 immigrant youth vulnerable to deportation.       When DACA is fully terminated on March 5, 1,400 Dreamers a       day will lose their ability to work legally and stay in the       United States. Congress must act to protect immigrant youth       immediately--not to endorse legislation that promotes racial       profiling and further criminalizes immigrant youth.        H.R. 3697 creates an overly broad definition of a       ``criminal gang'' by allowing DHS to designate any individual       as a gang member. This bill raises a host of due process       concerns. It would allow ICE to target people who may or may       not appear to be in a gang and charge all those who seem in       any way connected to the individual members of the gang.        This bill includes new expansive powers to deport and block       individuals from entering the U.S. and requires mandatory       detention of anyone suspected of being in a gang. This bill       bars individuals from asylum, withholding of removal, TPS,       and SIJS. The mandatory bar would result in individuals who       only have a vague connection to a potential gang member being       barred from live-saving protection in the U.S.        Children arriving unaccompanied from Central America are       fleeing gang violence, not bringing it. Skyrocketing levels       of gender, family, and gang violence in these countries leave       youths with no choice but to flee or face gang recruitment,       sexual and gender-based atrocities, or murder. The United       Nations refugee agency has found that the majority of       children coming to the southern border merit protection under       international law.        Members of Congress cannot say they support Dreamers and at       the same time vote for measures like H.R. 3697 that       scapegoats immigrant kids as criminals. Please vote NO on       H.R. 3697.                                   ____                                                   Service Employees                                             International Union,                                 Washington, DC, September 13, 2017.        Dear Representative: On behalf of the two million members       of the Service Employees International Union (SEIU), I urge       you to oppose H.R. 3697, the Criminal Alien Gang Member       Removal Act.        The bill includes an overbroad definition of gangs and gang       membership that would extend to efforts by good samaritans to       help immigrants in need. It also fails to establish adequate       due process standards to allow groups that are falsely       identified as gangs to challenge the designation.       Furthermore, it would require mandatory detention and would       eliminate core immigration relief for persons that the       Department of Homeland Security or the Department of Justice       ``has reason to believe'' may be a gang member. Those       affected are likely to include many gang victims who often       are erroneously included in gang databases.        In addition to being far too broad, H.R. 3697 would do       little to reduce gang activity and could actually be       counterproductive. The bill focuses on driving immigrants       further underground, but that will make community policing       and proven gang prevention activities harder, and the bill       will have no impact on the majority of gang members who are       U.S. citizens.        We therefore strongly urge a no vote on H.R. 3697, and may       include this vote on our legislative scorecard.            Sincerely,                                                         John Gray,      Legislative Director.                                   ____                                                   National Hispanic                                               Leadership Agenda,                                 Washington, DC, September 12, 2017.      Re NHLA Opposition to H.R. 3697, Criminal Alien Gang Member           Removal Act.       House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative: We write on behalf of the National       Hispanic Leadership Agenda (NHLA), a coalition of 45 leading       national Latino nonpartisan civil rights and advocacy       organizations, to strongly urge you to vote against H.R.       3697, Criminal Alien Gang Member Removal Act. This bill       further entrenches a national narrative that immigrants and       Latinos are criminals. To vote on this bill on the heels of       the President's decision to rescind the Deferred Action for       Childhood Arrivals program sends a clear message to our       communities that we are unwelcome. NHLA recommends a ``no''       vote on H.R. 3697, and any similar legislation, including       amendments and cloture votes. NHLA will closely monitor any       votes on these matters for inclusion in future NHLA       scorecards evaluating Member support for the Latino       community.        The purpose of legislation like this is to categorize       immigrants and Latinos as dangerous criminals, by making       sweeping, false generalizations and assumptions about these       populations. Studies repeatedly have shown that immigrants       are less likely to be incarcerated than native-born       Americans, less likely to commit crimes, and less likely to       be repeat offenders. Meanwhile, the damage to immigrant and       Latino communities is clear. Latinos are already reporting       fewer crimes in major cities as a result of the toxic       political rhetoric against Latinos and immigrants under the       current administration. This proposal only serves to paint       immigrants and Latinos with a broad brush as gangsters and       lawbreakers.        H.R. 3697 creates a new definition under the Immigration       and Nationality Act for the term ``criminal gang,'' and would       severely penalize individuals determined by the Secretary of       the Department of Homeland Security or the Attorney General       to allegedly be a member of a criminal gang. This is       troubling legislation for a few reasons. The expansive       definition of what constitutes a ``criminal gang'' and       ``criminal gang activity'' in this bill will open the door to       racial profiling and lead to the criminalization of       individuals who have never supported criminal behavior. The       bill empowers government officials to arrest, detain, and       deport any non-citizens, even lawful permanent residents, who       have not been found guilty of any crime under the law,       raising serious due process concerns. H.R. 3697 sets an       alarmingly low evidentiary standard, whereby government       officials can deport non-citizens who they ``know or ha[ve]       reason to believe'' are gang-involved. Another due process       concern is that once a non-citizen receives a  [[Page H7331]]       gang-classification, they may be unable to apply for any       legitimate relief. For example, one would be disqualified       from applying for Temporary Protected Status or Special       Immigrant Juvenile Status, even in cases where the child was       forced to join a gang at gunpoint, as is often the case with       minors fleeing Central America.        For people fleeing gender-based violence, which is       occurring with much more frequency in Central America,       barriers to forms of relief or protection are particularly       acute as many are often forced to join gangs to save their       lives.        H.R. 3697 sends a dangerous message to the country in a       time when our elected officials must be standing against       nativist messages, not catering to them. This bill does       nothing but criminalize immigrants and bar those who have       credible asylum claims from the safe haven they need. To the       extent Congress seeks to address the issue of gangs in the       U.S. and abroad, it must do so after careful study and with       smart policy. H.R. 3697 is neither well studied nor smart.       Rather, it is a misguided effort to broaden the scope of       those who will be accused of gang membership and to prohibit       future relief from individuals based merely on association or       unreliable indicators of gang membership, or to those who       were forced into gang membership under duress. Those who have       never been convicted, those who are not gang members, and       even those who have been extorted in an effort to save a       loved one's life will be punished. In the process, immigrants       and Latinos will continue to suffer the brutal consequences       of policies that criminalize our communities and stereotype       our people as nothing more than gang members. It is clear       that this bill is intended to further demonize immigrants and       will not serve to make communities safer, especially       considering that law enforcement already has mechanisms in       place to track gang activity.        This Congress has not only shirked its responsibility to       effectively address the problems with our broken immigration       system, but it is consistently moving our country in the       wrong direction by fostering space for dangerous and       xenophobic rhetoric and policy. Nonetheless, this body can       truly make meaningful change in the immigration landscape by       supporting efforts to provide a path to citizenship for       undocumented immigrants like DREAMers who have contributed so       much to our country.        We urge you to vote no on H.R. 3697. Thank you for your       time and consideration.            Sincerely,      Thomas A. Saenz,        MALDEF, President and General Counsel, NHLA Immigration       Committee Co-Chair.      Jose Calderon,        Hispanic Federation, President, NHLA Immigration Committee       Co-Chair.     Mr. Speaker, my friend on the other side of the aisle  is a multitalented person. In addition to his curriculum vitae, he  carries with him the mantle of being a man of the cloth. I know he  knows Matthew 25:35. It is oft quoted, and we do well to remember it.  Among the things that are said in that verse are: ``For I was hungry  and you gave me food, I was thirsty and you gave me drink, I was a  stranger and you welcomed me.'' This sentiment must be our guiding  principle, our North Star, as we work to repair our broken immigration  system.   Today's bill is in total opposition to this sentiment as it works to  demonize, with one broad, careless, and probably unconstitutional  stroke, an entire group of people, the vast majority of whom simply  wish to find refuge from immense hardship in their country of origin.   My Republican friends should take yet another in a long line of  legislative mulligans on this bill and come to the table ready to work  in a sensible way to fix our immigration system. I would suggest they  could start by bringing the DREAM Act to the floor for an up-or-down  vote.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote on the rule and the underlying  bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 9 of rule XX, the Chair  will reduce to 5 minutes the minimum time for any electronic vote on  the question of adoption of the resolution.
