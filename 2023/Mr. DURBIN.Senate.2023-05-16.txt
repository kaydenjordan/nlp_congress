 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, it is graduation season in America--a time  when many of us in this Senate head back home, gather with students and  families to celebrate amazing accomplishments.   This past Saturday I had the honor of joining students at Loyola  University of Chicago Stritch School of Medicine for their commencement  ceremony. It was an inspiring and hopeful celebration.   These graduates--doctors--I met this last weekend are heroes in the  making. As future practitioners and medical researchers, they will  dedicate their lives to healing our communities and families. And we  couldn't be prouder of their accomplishments.   Let me also note two things. First, Loyola University Stritch School  of Medicine was the first school of medicine in the United States to  allow students with DACA status to apply for admission. They didn't set  any quotas. But they said to these young people who have received  recognition by our government that they can stay legally in the United  States. Though they were not born here, they have received recognition  by our government and been held back from many of their ambitions.   So when Loyola University of Chicago opened their doors for  applications from those DACA students, young people--remarkable young  people--from all over the United States applied. So far, 32 graduated  before last Saturday and another 6 this past Saturday. Think of that:  38 DACA students who finally got a chance to go to medical school  proved themselves worthy, did great, and now headed for their  residencies and beyond.   They will become an important part of America's future. And I am so  proud of Loyola University of Chicago for its leadership in doing that.  I encourage all other schools to offer the same opportunities for these  extraordinary DACA students to have a chance to continue to be part of  America.   The second person I want to mention is a hero that is of a special  nature. She was tragically missing from Loyola's campus this past  weekend. Her name is Areanah Preston.   On Sunday, Chicago Police Officer Preston was set to receive her  Master of Jurisprudence from Loyola's School of Law. But just days  before her graduation ceremony, she was shot and killed outside of her  home, right as she was returning home from a late shift on patrol.   Officer Preston was one of the best of Chicago. At only 24 years of  age, she had served with the Chicago Police Department for 3 years. And  during her time on the force, she worked to build trust between law  enforcement and the communities that she served.   Officer Preston was inspired to become a police officer after taking  a trip to Europe as part of her undergraduate criminology studies. Her  class visited former concentration camps in Germany and Poland, the  sites of some of the worst atrocities in human history.   The stories of the Holocaust compelled Areanah Preston to the change  she wanted to see in the world. She wanted to be part of it. In her  words:         When I got back [home], I wanted to be an officer. I felt       like I could be a person to fight for justice.    And during her time on the force, that is exactly what she did.   On Saturday--the day before Mother's Day--Officer Preston's mother  Dionne and her other family members walked on stage at Loyola  University's ceremony to accept her diploma.   I want to extend my deepest condolences to each and every one of  them. Officer Preston and her family should be together today,  celebrating her amazing accomplishments and her courageous service to  our city. Instead, they are mourning her loss. She is yet another  victim of America's epidemic of gun violence.   Officer Preston's loss is especially poignant this week as we mark  the beginning of Police Week. It is a time when law enforcement  officers across the country travel here to Washington to meet with  lawmakers and honor their peers who lost their lives in the line of  duty.   The murder of Officer Preston in Chicago--as well as hundreds of  other police officers who have died by gunfire in recent years--is a  sobering reminder that no American is immune to the scourge of gun  violence in this country.   It was just 1 year ago this weekend when a White supremacist marched  into a grocery store in Buffalo, NY, with an AR-15 assault-style rifle  and opened fire, killing 10 Black Americans.   The first victim in that shooting was a man named Aaron Salter. At  the time of the shooting, Mr. Salter--a former police officer--was  working as a security guard at the grocery store.   When the gunman showed up, Mr. Salter did not hesitate to leap into  action. He opened fire on the gunman. There was only so much he could  do. You see, Mr. Salter was armed with a handgun. The assailant had an  AR-15-style rifle and was wearing a tactical vest.   In this case, Mr. Salter was a good guy with a gun, but the bad guy  had a bigger gun. Mr. Salter was forced into a position that no police  officer, no security guard, should ever find themselves in--being  outgunned by a violent criminal. But this happens with alarming  frequency. And it is because lawmakers have failed to do enough to stop  guns from falling into the wrong hands.   If we truly want to honor the sacrifices of heroes like Mr. Salter  and officer Preston, we need to do more than offer our prayers and  condolences. We need to take action.   At this point, I want to salute you, Mr. President, because you and  your wife and family have worked so hard to make this issue an  important part of our agenda in America.   In the years since the mass shooting in Buffalo, we have seen more  than 650 mass shootings across America. A mass  [[Page S1659]]  shooting takes place when four people are either killed or wounded in  one incident. During that period, more than 40,000 of our fellow  citizens have died from gunfire, which is now the No. 1 killer of our  Nation's children. The No. 1 killer of children under the age of 18 in  America is gun violence. That is a fact.   Time and again, we hear lawmakers argue in Washington and other  places that guns really aren't the problem, often claiming the real  problem is mental illness. Well, here is the truth. Every nation on  Earth struggles with mental illness, but America is the only advanced  nation that sees more mass shootings than there are days in a year. I  want to deal with mental illness honestly, but to say that is the  problem alone is to ignore the obvious.   Last year, the Senate Judiciary Committee, which I chair, held a  hearing on the crisis of gun violence in America. One of the witnesses  we heard was former Phoenix Police Chief Jeri Williams.   During that hearing, Chief Williams told the committee that our  Nation's gun laws are failing members of law enforcement like her. Here  is what she said:         We are outgunned. We're outmanned. We're out-staffed.        We do need responsible gun legislation . . . there should       be a ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines in       order for us to properly serve and protect our communit[ies].    Chief Williams was right. Smart gun safety laws work. We even have  recent proof of it.   Last year, this Senate finally passed the bipartisan Safer  Communities Act--the most important gun safety law in nearly 30 years.  Thanks to that law, the Justice Department is able to perform enhanced  background checks on buyers under the age of 21.   According to the Department of Justice, these enhanced background  checks have already prevented more than 160 firearms from falling into  potentially dangerous hands.   But that is not enough. We need to do more. Without more robust  legislation--like reining in assault weapons--we are not going to make  the progress we need in protecting the lives of our families and  communities.   Friday afternoon, I had a visit in my Chicago office from four  people. One was a mom and three were pediatricians from the Highland  Park area north of Chicago. We remember Highland Park because of the  last Fourth of July parade where a shooter got on the roof of a  building and, in a matter of 60 seconds, fired off 83 rounds into an  innocent crowd. And 7 people died, over 50 were injured. One 8-year-old  boy was paralyzed for life.   They came to talk to me about the AR-15 assault weapon crisis that we  face in America. What they said to me I cannot repeat on the floor of  the Senate because they went into graphic, painful detail of what an  AR-15 weapon does to the human body and particularly what it does to  children. Those small bodies, those compact little bodies, hit by an  AR-15 round, are forever damaged, and some of them are in an impossible  situation when it comes to medical care.   They talked about the fact that--and we hear this so often--at the  scene of these mass shootings, particularly in schools, they collect  DNA evidence from the parents to identify what is left of the body of  the children after the assault weapons had been fired into the bodies.   That is just a horrible thing, unimaginable thing, when it comes to  imagining your own children or grandchildren and what might happen to  them.   This mother came as part of this group, which is known as March  Fourth, broke down in tears and told me that every single day now since  Highland Park a year ago, she worries about sending her kids to school:  Will this be the day that they don't come home?   No family, no parent, no grandparent should ever face that fear as we  do in America--uniquely in America--because of the bewildering  explanation of our Second Amendment.   Unfortunately, instead, moving forward on sensible gun safety laws,  some people in the other party would move backward. Right now, the  House MAGA majority is trying to erase a regulation that restricts  braces that turn pistols into short-barreled rifles.   That is the same kind of weapon carried by mass shooters in Dayton,  OH; Boulder, CO; and recently in Nashville, TN.   These weapons are a danger to law enforcement and ordinary citizens.  And now this Republican effort in the House wants to make it easier to  access these deadly weapons, not harder.   Does that make any sense at all?   Moreover, at this very moment, MAGA Republicans are threatening to  default on America's debt unless we pass Speaker McCarthy's bill to  wipe out 30,000 law enforcement jobs.   Talk about defending the police. The McCarthy approach in making deep  budget cuts not only affects the number of law enforcement who are on  the beat trying to protect us every single day but also makes a 25- percent cut in medical research in this country, something that is  essential for every family's future.   That is right. House Republicans are threatening to trigger an  economic crisis unless Democrats support their proposals to defund the  police and basically eviscerate medical research in this country. That  is coming from the same Republicans who spent years falsely claiming it  was the Democrats who wanted to defund the police. Now we have clear  evidence otherwise. Here they are supporting budget cuts that would  leave law enforcement behind and make communities less safe. This is no  way to honor the service and sacrifice of police officers across the  country who have journeyed to Washington.   If you are going to talk a big game about supporting law enforcement  during your political campaign, you have to back up your action when  you are elected. Threatening a disastrous debt default unless we make  massive budget cuts is no way to protect America.   Let's make sure officers have all the funding and resources they need  to keep America safe, and that includes sensible gun safety laws that  help keep weapons of war off American streets.
