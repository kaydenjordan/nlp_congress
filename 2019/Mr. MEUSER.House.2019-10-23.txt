 Mr. Speaker, an overlooked factor of these relentless  investigations and this impeachment inquiry is the way in which the  words of Ukrainian President Zelensky have been largely ignored.   Zelensky said, without condition, that he felt no pressure from  President Trump related to corruption investigations in Ukraine.  President Zelensky's words have been largely ignored because they do  not fit the narrative pushed by the Democratic leadership of this  House.   Just think, had President Zelensky wanted to severely damage our  President, he could have lied and stated he did feel pressure. Doesn't  that scenario give you chills? Had a foreign leader simply altered and  fabricated one publicly stated phrase, the entire Democratic Caucus of  this House would be calling for our President's head, repeating it over  and over.   That is the reality of this sickening and dangerous presumption of  guilt that some Members of this body are choosing to push.   Our President deserves nothing less than the due process and  presumption of innocence afforded to all Americans by our Constitution.  Anything less is an affront to the Republic our Founders created and to  all the electorate, Democratic and Republican.                            ____________________
