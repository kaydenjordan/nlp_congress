 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to decry a  tragedy that has pierced the heart of my community, a tragedy that  continues to cut deeper with each passing day because we still don't  know what happened. We still have no answers.   All we know is that one of our very best, one of our brightest, is  dead. Our hearts are broken, and we demand answers. Army specialist  Enrique Roman-Martinez was a Chino native who makes the whole Inland  Empire proud.  [[Page H3885]]                                     time  0915    He joined the Army before he was even old enough to vote. He begged  his mother to sign the release forms. That is how committed he was to  our country and to others.   He was stationed at Fort Bragg in North Carolina and went camping in  the Outer Banks over Memorial Day weekend with seven other soldiers. We  don't know what happened that night on May 22, but what we do know is  it cost Enrique his life, and the seven people who would seemingly have  a lot of explaining to do, remarkably, had nothing to say.   When a police officer walked up to their campsite the next day and  asked those seven soldiers to move their illegally parked vehicles, not  a single one thought it was important enough to mention that someone  who had been camping with them, their friend and their fellow soldier,  was missing from the night before. It took a full 17 hours before they  spoke out and reported Enrique gone. When they did so, they said they  were worried that Enrique was suicidal.   It is hard for me to imagine why anyone would hesitate to tell a  police officer that their fellow camper, their friend, and their fellow  soldier was missing if they thought he was suicidal.   A week later, Specialist Roman-Martinez's remains were found washed  ashore not far away. The question of whether or not he was suicidal was  settled by the simple fact that they only found a severed head--his  head. That is it.   He was just 21 years old. He had just started out in life. He had  dedicated his few short years as an adult to a cause much greater than  himself. He was only 3 months away from completing his duty and coming  home as a veteran. Someone like that deserves better than this. His  family deserves better for the son and brother that they have loved and  lost.   I would like to take a moment to talk about Enrique's family, his  mother, Maria, and sister, Griselda, because one of the most solemn and  sacred duties our military has is their commitment to leave no one  behind on the battlefield. It is their duty to inform the family when  something goes wrong.   Mr. Speaker, as the mother of an Air Force veteran, I can tell you  the fear of receiving a notice like that was with me every single day  my son served. It is an ongoing unease in the back of your mind that  never goes away. It is something I can still feel today.   Now, imagine if Enrique were your son. The only thing worse than a  conversation like that is if that conversation never happens--never.  That is what happened to Maria and Griselda. The Army was so slow to  inform the family that they learned through media reports their son had  been mutilated--through media reports.   The medical examiner ruled Enrique's death a homicide on that Monday,  and it took the Army until Friday to reach out to the family. The lack  of notice was bad enough, but the lack of answers is still far worse.  It is time to hear more from the seven individuals. Their silence isn't  acceptable. It is time to hear from the community in North Carolina. If  they know something, say something.   As a mother, I plead with them, if it were their son, if they are the  mother of one of those seven young soldiers, male or female, say  something. They need to talk to their son or daughter and demand that  they speak out.   Lawyering up is not enough. Lawyering up is not enough. They deserve  to bury their son and brother.                            ____________________
