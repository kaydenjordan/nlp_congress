 Mr. Speaker, tomorrow the House of  Representatives will vote on the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection  Act, and before that occurs, Mr. Speaker, I wanted to come to the floor  tonight and just remind all of us that the United States of America is,  indeed, a unique nation that is premised on the foundation that we are  all created equal and that each of us is endowed by our creator with  the unalienable right to live.   But 2 years ago, Mr. Speaker, numerous video recordings were released  that incontrovertibly documented corporate officers and employees of  Planned Parenthood casually discussing their rampant practice of  harvesting and selling the little body parts from many of the hundreds  of thousands of innocent babies they are guilty of killing in their  abortion clinics across this Nation every year.                                time  1930    Now, these videos irrefutably reveal officers of Planned Parenthood  haggling over the price of these little organs and body parts and  casually describing ways of killing these little babies, often using  much more painful methods, like partial-birth abortion, to make sure  that the saleable organs of these little babies remained undamaged.   One of these videos described an incident where one of Planned  Parenthood's employees calls one of the younger employees over to  witness something that was ``kind of cool;'' that one of those baby's  hearts was still beating. The older employee said: ``Okay. This is  really a good fetus, and it looks like we can procure a lot from it. We  are going to procure a brain.''   Then, using scissors, together the two employees, starting at the  baby's chin, cut upward through the center of this child's face and  then pulled out the baby's little brain and placed it in a container  where it could later be sold.   Mr. Speaker, I find it so crushingly sad that the only time this  little baby was ever held by anyone in his very short life was by those  who cut his face open to take his brain.   Have we forgotten that, not so long ago, authorities entered the  clinic of Dr. Kermit Gosnell, and there they found a torture chamber  for little babies that defies, within the constraints of the English  language, any description. The grand jury, at that time, reported:  ``Dr. Kermit Gosnell had a simple solution for unwanted babies. He  killed them. He didn't call it that. He called it ensuring fetal  demise. The way he ensured fetal demise was by sticking scissors in the  back of the baby's neck and cutting the spinal cord. He called it  snipping. Over the years, there were hundreds of snippings.''   Ashley Baldwin, one of Dr. Gosnell's employees, said she saw babies  breathing, and she described one as 2 feet long, that no longer had  eyes or a mouth, but were, in her words, making like, this ``screeching  noise.'' And she said it ``sounded like a little alien.''   For God's sake, Mr. Speaker, this can't be who we truly are. The fact  is that more than 18,000 late-term, pain-capable, unborn children were  torturously killed, without anesthesia, in America in just the last  year. Many of them cried and screamed as they died, but because it was  amniotic fluid going over the vocal cords, we couldn't hear them. It is  the worst human rights atrocity in the United States of America.  [[Page H7655]]    Now, I know that many of those on this floor and the American media  will hold to the standard line and try to cloak all of this in the name  of freedom of choice; but I would beg them, Mr. Speaker, to open their  hearts and ask themselves what is so liberating about brutally and  painfully dismembering living, helpless little human babies.   In spite of all the political noise, protecting these little,  helpless, pain-capable, unborn children and their mothers is not a  Republican issue, and it is not a Democrat issue. It is a basic test of  our basic humanity and who we are as a human family.   Mr. Speaker, the sands of time should blow over this Capitol dome  before we ever give Planned Parenthood one more dime of taxpayer money.  And in the name of humanity, Democrat Senators should not be allowed to  filibuster the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act in the Senate  because passing it would prevent the vast majority of these ongoing  evil acts of torture against helpless, little, pain-capable human  babies that these videos have now shown so clearly to the entire world.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Smith),  one of the greatest pro-life champions in the history of the United  States and a precious friend.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from  Missouri (Mrs. Hartzler).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Johnson.)   I am very grateful that you are here tonight, sir.    Mr. Speaker, I so sincerely thank the  gentleman.   I yield to the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. King), my precious friend.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from  Arizona (Mr. Biggs), my very good friend.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his  remarks.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from West Virginia (Mr.  Jenkins), and I thank him for coming to the floor tonight.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his  remarks.   It is now my honor to yield to the honorable gentlewoman from South  Dakota (Mrs. Noem).    Mr. Speaker, I sincerely thank the gentlewoman  for her remarks.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr.  Norman).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman very  sincerely for his remarks. I am glad he came this way here recently.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Babin).    Mr. Speaker, I thank my very good friend from  Texas very much for speaking on the floor tonight.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Banks).    Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Banks very  much for his remarks.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the distinguished gentleman from Pennsylvania  (Mr. Rothfus).    Mr. Speaker, in closing, I simply say that  sometimes I think we kind of get caught up in things and we grow used  to something that otherwise would horrify us.   Before the sun set this evening, we saw 3,000 unborn little Americans  die a tragic and lonely death. That is in the land of the free and the  home of the brave.   Mr. Speaker, each time that took place, not only did a nameless  little baby die a lonely and tragic death, but the mother was never the  same again. All the gifts that that child might have brought to this  world are now lost forever.   So, Mr. Speaker, I pray that somehow in this debate we would put  aside which people are right and ask: What is the right thing for  America?   The very creed of this country is the notion that all of us have the  Imago Dei, or the image of God, stamped on our souls. If that is true,  Mr. Speaker, then there is a far greater question here than we can ever  imagine.   Mr. Speaker, I think if we ask ourselves the truest and deepest  question, then perhaps we will begin to see the winds of change begin  to blow in this country. That is very simply without all of the  rationalization, without all of the gotchas and the what-ifs and the  avoiding of the subject, and if we just ask ourselves one basic  question: Does abortion kill a little baby?   If it does not, Mr. Speaker, then I sincerely am one that can get up  out of this Chamber and never speak of it again. But if abortion really  does kill a little human child, then those of us standing here in the  seat of freedom, the greatest Nation in the history of the world, also  stand here in the midst of the greatest human genocide in the history  of the human family.   Mr. Speaker, that is not what we are called to do in this world, as  the greatest Nation that ever had the chance to exist on this Earth.   Mr. Speaker, I hope that, as we debate the bill tomorrow, we can put  aside anything but the truth and just examine in our own hearts who we  really are. If we do that, I believe we will pass the Pain-Capable  Unborn Child Protection Act on October 3, 2017. By the grace of God, it  will go over to the Senate and they will find a way to bring this bill  to the floor and send it to President Trump, who I have every  conviction will sign the bill, and for which I am very grateful.   Mr. Speaker, God bless America, and I yield back the balance of my  time.
