 Mr. Speaker, while I will vote in favor of this  resolution and support the advancement of the Abraham Accords and  normalization of relations with Israel, I am disappointed that the  resolution does not mention the longstanding U.S. policy of supporting  a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, as past U.S.- Israel relationship anniversary resolutions have. I continue to  strongly support a sustainable two-state solution, with a democratic,  Jewish state of Israel and a demilitarized, democratic Palestinian  state living peacefully side-by-side. This resolution's omission of  this policy is concerning given the current far-right Israeli governing  coalition under Prime Minister Netanyahu, which has seriously  undermined the prospects for a two-state solution.   Further, as hundreds of thousands of Israelis have been protesting in  opposition of an anti-democratic judicial overhaul, it's important for  U.S. policymakers to recognize that a negotiated two-state solution  requires a robust democracy in Israel. America must insist that Israel  not only remains committed to the two-state solution but committed to  democracy in Israel.
