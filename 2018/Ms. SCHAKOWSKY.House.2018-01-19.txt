 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and  mourn the loss of a precious friend and mentor, Paul Booth.   Paul was a lifelong happy warrior for justice and a renowned  progressive champion. For decades, he was a top leader in his union,  AFSCME, fighting every day for working women and men.   From his youth as a student leader until the very day he died, he  fought for peace and equality and opportunity. Paul Booth made things  happen. He was a strategist and, above all, an organizer. With his life  partner, Heather Booth, Paul inspired and taught us to work smarter and  be better.   Paul Booth will be sorely missed by all those he touched, including  my husband, Bob, and me. We were cherished friends for decades.   Our hearts go out to Heather and his sons, Gene and Dan, and all  those whose lives he inspired and that he touched. We are so sorry. We  are heartbroken.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 4712, the  Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act.   Of course, if a baby is born alive, everything must be done to  protect that life. No one disagrees with that. Perhaps more  importantly, it is already the law. To suggest otherwise is just wrong.   So don't be fooled. This bill is yet another effort to erode women's  rights to obtain safe, legal abortions and a cynical attempt to appease  those who have come to D.C. to advocate for the reversal of Roe v.  Wade.   H.R. 4712 would insert the opinions of politicians into medical  practice and the individual rights of women to make their own  decisions. This is not what women want, what doctors were trained to  do, and I personally find offensive the fact that there is a suggestion  that Democrats are not for saving the lives of born children. Of  course, we are. We all are.   This is not a necessary piece of legislation. It is already on the  books.
