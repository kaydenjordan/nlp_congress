 Mr. President, earlier this month, I went to Joint Base  Andrews, which, as I think many of you know, is not far from here. It  is where the President boards Air Force One. The mission at Joint Base  Andrews is broad. The Air Force does an incredible job in service to  our country. I went there to take a look at the Child Development  Center. The Child Development Center that I visited was first  constructed in 1941 not as a childcare center but for other purposes.  It has had serious challenges, as the Air Force put in their request to  build a new childcare center--a new child development center.   I visited classrooms that had to be closed because of a sewage  backup, which happens regularly and flows into the kitchen area of this  particular facility. I saw the results of a roof that had collapsed  during a heavy snowstorm that now has been replaced, but the use of  that part of the building is compromised. I saw the concerns expressed  about pest control, about an HVAC system that does not work properly,  and about a facility that doesn't have the capacity they need in order  to deal with the needs of our Air Force personnel.   It was for that reason that the Air Force has made this one of their  top priorities in military construction, to replace this 1941 facility.  Through the competitive process that is used under the Department of  Defense, this project rose to a top priority and was included in the  President's budget and approved by Congress at $13 million for a  replacement.   Let me read from the Air Force's justification in requesting these  funds. It says:         Not providing this facility forces members to use more       expensive, less convenient and potentially lower quality off-      base programs. These off-base child development centers       typically cost $9,400 more than on-base, creating a severe       financial strain on military personnel. Quality of life will       be severely degraded, resulting in impacts to retention and       readiness because Airmen and their families will not have a       safe and nurturing environment for child care.    That will be the consequences if we don't replace the structure. Why  do I talk about that? Because this was one of 64 projects that were  included in the President's emergency power transfer, taking this $13  million from the replacement of a child development center and using it  for his wall. It was one of three projects in Maryland. We had $66.5  million.   There was another project at Joint Base Andrews dealing with  hazardous material, the place where they unload hazardous material.  They want to do it away from where the President's plane flies. That  makes abundant sense. That was cut and transferred over to the wall.   For those of you who have been to Ft. Meade--an incredibly important  facility--try to get there when you have a traffic problem. It is  almost impossible. Part of the moneys that were transferred was to  alleviate those concerns--the traffic.   The President took 64 projects--$3.6 billion, including this Child  Development Center at Joint Base Andrews, to use to pay for his wall.  He told us during the campaign that this was being done in an effort-- that Mexico would pay for it. We now know that the airmen families at  Joint Base Andrews are going to pay for this wall--$9,400 more per  child because they don't have a safe facility. This facility has a hard  time passing accreditation considering the situation. That is not me  telling you this; this is the Air Force telling you this. Yet those  funds were taken away. Why were they taken away? Because the President  used his emergency declaration power to do this.   I believe this was an unconstitutional abuse of power. Let me quote  from the President himself. This is what the President said in the Rose  Garden in announcing the so-called emergency. I am quoting the  President of the United States:         I could do the wall over a longer period of time. I didn't       need to do this. But I'd rather do it much faster.    Is that an emergency? Is that contradicting the direct dictate of  Congress? Let me just remind my colleagues of the Constitution, article  I, section 9, clause 7. It is the Congress that has the power of the  purse strings. We are the ones who appropriate the money, not the  President of the United States. He carries out our instructions. Yet he  uses, by his own words, something he wanted to do for himself rather  than a national emergency to transfer those funds. It is wrong. It is  not just this Senator saying it is wrong; we got a letter from several  Senators, former Senators and former Members of the House-- Republicans--who commented on this. The signatories to this letter  include Senator Danforth, Mickey Edwards, Chuck Hagel, Jim Kolbe,  Olympia Snowe, and Richard Lugar. They are respected Republican Members  of this body. Let me quote from their letter.         Our oath is to put the country and its Constitution above       everything, including party politics or loyalty to a       president. . . . The power of the purse rests with Congress .       . . if you allow a president to ignore Congress, it will be       not your authority but that of your constituents that is       deprived of the protections of true representative       government.    This is not about loyalty to a President or a party loyalty; this is  about exercising the constitutional responsibilities of the article I  legislative branch of government.   We just took a vote. We can do something about it--S.J. Res. 54,  terminating the national emergency. We got a majority of the Senators  who voted for it, 54 to 41, so it will move forward. We expect this  will not be the last word, and that is why I am taking the floor time  now. We are going to have  [[Page S5685]]  another opportunity to do this. We may have an opportunity to override  a Presidential veto. We are going to need more support. I urge my  colleagues to please look at the Constitution of the United States we  took the oath to uphold. Look at Members who have served here in the  past who are warning us that this will come back to haunt our  constituents in their constitutional checks and balances, having the  Congress be the people's body here--not the President of the United  States--in passing laws and making appropriations.   Let us do the right thing. Let us exercise the checks and balances  that are in our system. Let us see this S.J. Res. 54 become law. Let us  reverse this emergency declaration. Let's do it for the Constitution.  Let's do it for the U.S. Congress. Let's do it for the men and women in  our military service who are being denied the necessary military  construction projects, including those service men and women at Joint  Base Andrews who need a child development center that protects the  welfare of their children.   For all those reasons, I hope this becomes law.   With that, Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.
