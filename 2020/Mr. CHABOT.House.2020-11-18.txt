 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I  thank the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Wilson) and the gentleman  from New York (Mr. Espaillat) for their leadership on this legislation  here today and previous to this.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 7954, the Tropical Forest and  Coral Reef Conservation Reauthorization Act of 2020. It is bipartisan  legislation that I introduced with my Democratic colleague and friend  from California, Brad Sherman, as a companion to legislation that  Senator Portman introduced previously in the Senate.   I want to thank Senator Portman. He has been a longtime leader on  this topic, and it makes a lot of sense. It is really common sense. It  helps so many people all across the globe.   Tropical forests and coral reefs are some of the most biologically  diverse and environmentally important ecosystems anywhere. Today,  however, whether it is deforestation or pollution or overfishing or  some other cause, these vital natural resources are threatened across  the globe.   Now, many tropical forests and coral reefs are located in the  developing world where economic realities can often get in the way of  the conservation. It is in the best interest of the whole world to  protect and responsibly manage these resources. That is why I  introduced H.R. 7954.   This legislation builds on our work on the Tropical Forest  Conservation Reauthorization Act of 2018 and the Tropical Forest  Conservation Act back in 1998, so this is 22 years ago.   Back in 1998, we set up a debt forgiveness program under which the  U.S. forgives a debt owed to us by a developing nation in exchange for  that country making investments in conservation work to sustain its  critical ecosystems.   Agreements under this program also strengthen local economies by  supporting sustainable development of these resources as well as civil  society groups in partner nations that conduct conservation works.   And this program has proven results. Since 1998, as was mentioned,  the U.S. has used it to conserve 67 million acres--think of that, 67  million acres--of tropical forests. Further, by assisting developing  countries to properly manage and sustainably develop these resources,  the program follows the old adage of teaching a man to fish.   With these benefits in mind, I am proud to say that our legislation  has received the support of Conservation International, the World  Wildlife Fund, the Wildlife Conservation Society, and The Nature  Conservancy, among others.                                time  1600    Finally, our legislation sets a sharp contrast with what the Chinese  development model is. Through the Belt and Road Initiative, for  example, China has offered elites in developing countries flashy or  get-rich-quick schemes and projects, often with little or no regard for  the local environment. Citizens in these countries are taken advantage  of.   H.R. 7954 keeps one more tool in the State Department's toolbox to  help convince developing countries to choose a sustainable, Western  model of development that stacks up very favorably with China's model  by respecting the country's ecosystem and respecting its people.   Passing this bill, H.R. 7954, extends a highly successful  conservation program and helps counter China's pig in a poke  development model; therefore, I would urge my colleagues to support  this legislation. Again, I thank Mr. Wilson and Mr. Espaillat.
