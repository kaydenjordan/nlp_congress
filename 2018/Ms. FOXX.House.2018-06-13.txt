 Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Virginia for  yielding time.   Mr. Speaker, across the country, communities are struggling to bear  the heavy burden of the worsening trend to opioid addiction. At the  Committee on Education and the Workforce, we like the idea of evidence- based policymaking. We like to see numbers and statistics. We have to  remember, though, that these are never just numbers; they are real  people in our own communities.   We have held hearings, spoken with experts, brainstormed solutions,  and drafted bills. It has become abundantly clear to me that, for every  person living with an opioid addiction, there are countless others who  also have a steep price to pay. Few things are more devastating than  witnessing a neighbor, a friend, a coworker, or a loved one fall prey  to addiction and feeling powerless to stop it.   I want to thank and commend members of the Committee on Education and  the Workforce for leaving no stone unturned as we work to make healing  possible to all victims of this scourge of addiction, not only those  who are struggling with opioid abuse.    Too many people, especially children, have been impacted by this  scourge. Today's bills are designed to bring relief to those who are  affected by the addiction while addressing the needs of children and  families who have been left in this tragedy's wake.   According to many experts, the worst of the opioid addiction is still  to come. If we are to bring this senseless tragedy to an end, we need  to do all we can to ensure that the law addresses the needs of  families, workplaces, and communities at large. I believe the bills the  House is voting on today will do just that, and again, I commend the  members of the Education and the Workforce Committee for all their hard  work.
