 Mr. Speaker, it is my privilege to rise today to honor an  incredible woman, my deputy chief of staff, Sharon Johnson. Today marks  Sharon's 35 years of service to Mississippi's Third Congressional  District.   Sharon was born and raised in Louisville, Mississippi, and began her  career in Washington, D.C., under the legendary G.V. Sonny Montgomery  and has served our district under all three Members of Congress since:  Congressman Chip Pickering, Congressman Gregg Harper, and now I am  blessed that she has been a member of my team since day one.   Over the past 35 years, Sharon has proven to be a true asset to the  people of Mississippi's Third Congressional District. Her unwavering  commitment to service and community has earned her the respect and  admiration of those who have had the privilege of working with her.   Today, we honor Sharon and celebrate her service. I am hopeful that  Sharon's record of public service will inspire future generations of  young women to consider this important work.   On behalf of Mississippi's Third Congressional District, I extend my  sincere thanks to Sharon Johnson for her 35 years of unwavering  service.                            ____________________
