 Mr. President, I come to the floor today to talk again  about the illegal, totally unjustified, unprovoked, and brutal attack  on Ukraine by Russian forces.   This is the 11th week in a row I have come to the Chamber to talk  about this because I think it is really important that the American  people know what is going on over there and that we rally to the  defense of our allies in Ukraine.   This week is the 77th anniversary of what is called V-E Day. That is  the day the war in Europe ended--World War II--when the United States  finally led the allies to defeat the tyranny of Nazi Germany and  liberated millions of people. Then, in the Cold War, we led the world  again to defeat the encroachment of Soviet communism on Eastern Europe.  Again, millions of people were liberated, including Ukrainians.   We cannot forget this because, as we look at Ukraine, what do we see?  The same thing--people who yearn to be free. That is all they want is  to live in freedom in their own sovereign, independent country. Once  again, the United States and our allies in Europe are standing with  these Europeans in fighting to hold onto their freedom in the face of  this illegal, unprovoked, and brutal attack.   When Vladimir Putin spoke at ceremonies in Russia this week to  commemorate the same V-E Day, he used it to justify Russia's invasion,  saying:         The danger was growing day by day, [so] Russia [gave] a       preemptive response to an aggression.    Of course, nothing could be further from the truth. The Ukrainians  were never the aggressors. The Ukrainians just want to live in peace  with their neighbors, including with Russia.   Here is a map of Ukraine today, and this is what has been going on.   In the dark red, what you see here is what the Russians took in  2014--the year that Ukraine decided definitively they wanted to turn to  the West to be a free, democratic country. Russia responded with this:  taking over Crimea and taking over the Luhansk and Donetsk parts of the  Donbas.   The light red is what they have taken in this latest invasion, and  what they intend to take, according to their military generals who have  spoken, is a much bigger area here.   The blue, of course, is where the Ukrainians have pushed back, where  they have gone on the counteroffensive. They have actually pushed the  Russians out around Kyiv, around the northern part of the country and  other parts and, right now, as you can see, in various parts of the  Donbas region, including around this town of Kharkiv.   Now, Kharkiv is an interesting situation. It is actually a sister  city to Cincinnati, OH, my hometown, and I was on the Sister City  Committee decades ago when we developed that relationship. They have a  beautiful river running through the city. It was and will be, in the  future, a beautiful city; but now, as these Ukrainians are in the fight  of their lives just to keep their democracy, you see what is happening  in Kharkiv.   The Ukrainians are beginning to make progress both to the north of  Kharkiv and here to the south and to the east. It is possible that the  Ukrainians could actually push the Russians back far enough so that the  city itself would be out of artillery range of the Russians. That would  be great because, right now, the people of Kharkiv, like so many other  people in places like Mariupol, of course, are being attacked by the  Russians with artillery every night, every day. So, if they could get  the Russian forces pushed back beyond that period, they could get  relief services in to the civilians--food, water--that were previously  denied by the Russians.   I think it might also force the Russians to make a decision. They  would have to decide between addressing Ukraine's counteroffensive near  Kharkiv--that is here--and expanding their forces over here, which they  have said they want to do. I think if they do that--expand their  forces--they are going to be risking their communications and supply  lines here being cut off by the Ukrainians.   So we will see what happens, but this is a crucial time in the  battle. We are at a turning point. I guess that is really my point.   We are being asked to look at legislation that has been sent to us by  the administration--called the Ukraine Supplemental Funding bill--at a  time when there is a crucial battle going on and when there could be a  turning point in this broader war.   Last week, I spoke with the Ukrainian Ambassador to the United  States, Oksana Markarova. I will be speaking to her again tomorrow  morning. She made the point that the Presidential drawdown authority-- that is the funding they are currently using from the United States--is  just about depleted. It was about $3.3 billion in military aid that the  President had, with the authority given to him by Congress, to draw  down some of our resources to be able to provide to Ukraine. As of last  week, she told me that $3.3 billion is just about depleted; therefore,  a new authority is critically needed right now.   You don't want to have a gap--particularly with regard to munitions-- in being able to ensure that they have the more effective weaponry--the  heavy weaponry--that they are now using in places like this and here  and here and can continue to have the ammunition that is needed to be  able to continue the fight.   I also spoke late last week to Bridget Brink. She is the current  Ambassador to Slovakia and is a seasoned Foreign Service professional  whom the Biden administration has now nominated to be the U.S.  Ambassador here in Ukraine. We haven't had an Ambassador there for well  over a year, maybe  [[Page S2377]]  2 years. I have been asking the Biden administration--pushing the  Biden administration--to send an Ambassador to Ukraine for over a year.  I did the same with the Trump administration when we didn't have an  Ambassador there for a while and even with the Obama administration to  try to ensure we had a representative.    Why? It is so important to have an Ambassador there. You need  somebody at the highest level to be able to have the Ukrainian  officials have someone they can work with directly who can answer  questions, make commitments, be someone who is authorized by the  President. It is also helpful to have that information on the ground  being relayed straight back to our teams here in Washington.   At least 17 other countries, by the way, have returned their  diplomatic personnel to the capital, Kyiv. We have not. We are,  apparently, going to do that soon. I hope so. I hope so. I know that  the Ambassador nominee would like to go back to Kyiv. I know that a lot  of members of the team would because I have met with them in Poland.  They are over here in Poland now, for the most part, and are going into  Lviv sometimes; but we need to get back to Kyiv.   In terms of what is going on in the battlefield, let's talk a little  more about that and of the importance of the weapons and the materiel  support that we have already provided and, therefore, what we must  continue to provide.   Since February 24, when this latest Russian invasion began, we have  now provided $13.6 billion in military, economic, and humanitarian aid  for Ukraine. This latest request for funding from the White House is  for $33 billion, so it is for even more. There were reports that this  latest supplemental would be tied to other things, particularly to the  COVID funding that the administration is also eager to get passed. I  was strongly against that because, when you tie it up with other  things, it inevitably slows it down, and this is absolutely urgent.   I was really pleased to see that about an hour and a half ago,  President Biden issued a statement saying he now supports separating  the Ukraine funding from the COVID funding. I commend him for that. It  is good news. Again, we have seen so many times around here when you  combine things, it slows everything down, and it creates a political  football that goes back and forth. This is desperately needed  assistance that is going to determine whether some Ukrainian civilians  and some of their military forces live or die, because this aid is so  critical to their success.   After Vladimir Putin's claim of success during this week's V-E  ceremony--as we talked about--in Moscow, it is very likely, in my view,  that he is now going to feel the need to call up an even fuller  mobilization of his military and engage in even more brutality--if that  is possible--against the innocent civilians in Ukraine. So it is all  the more reason for us to pass this latest spending request now and get  this military equipment to the Ukrainians who need it so desperately.   Some Americans may wonder if we can make a difference in protecting  freedom in Ukraine without directly engaging the American military or  engaging with Russia. I would say we can, and I would say we have made  a difference. The U.S. and our NATO allies and other allies around the  world have already made a positive contribution to Ukraine's success in  pushing back against the Russians--a much larger army with more weapons  of every kind.   Prior to the latest invasion on February 24, the United States and  some allies shipped these Javelin anti-tank weapons, Stinger anti-air  missiles, and other small arms and munitions to Ukraine to be able to  counter what we thought was going to happen and did, which was Russian  battalion tactical groups coming into the country. It was effective. It  was effective in Kyiv, and it was effective in other areas of Ukraine  to be able to push back as you can see. These Russian units were  essentially light-mechanized formations which contained armored anti- infantry vehicles and medium to heavy tanks, along with infantry and  light artillery. The first 2 months of the war have proven that the  Russians were not very effective with their coordination of these  groups, and because of their tactical incompetence, they were largely  defeated up here by a more proficient and a more effective Ukrainian  military.   The mobility at the tactical level among the Ukrainian Armed Forces  is at the core of the NATO doctrine in something called ``combined arms  warfare''--essentially the coordinated employment of the tanks,  artillery, and infantry to defend or seize territory. Since 2014, when  Ukraine turned away from tyranny and toward the West and Russia  immediately invaded, the threat of a larger scale invasion was clear,  so Ukraine's forces began to train and learn alongside U.S. troops and  other NATO allies. Again, we worked with them to transition from a  Soviet-style military to one that emphasized the initiative of  noncommissioned officers and mission-style orders and better  coordination between these groups.   Thanks to an extensive effort by our military and that of our NATO  allies, the Ukrainians were able to build a military that was more  proficient and technically agile. It was able not only to withstand the  initial Russian onslaught but to defeat Russian forces, including  around Kyiv. In the past month, the Ukrainian Armed Forces have  repositioned to the east, taking with them that same tactic, that same  coordination, and have provided tactical reconnaissance through drones  and have used highly accurate artillery. In doing so, they have  thwarted Russian attempts to gain more ground here in the East.   Of course, nothing substitutes for the bravery and grit of the  Ukrainian people and particularly of the Ukrainian soldiers-- professional and civilian soldiers alike. They are defending their  homeland fiercely, and that is the single most important element to  their success. But we also owe a debt of gratitude to our troops who  trained Ukrainians, many of whom are National Guardsmen, perhaps from  your State, and also our British, Canadian, and other NATO partners who  helped the Ukrainian military become the effective battlefield force we  see today.    I say this because we need to know that the help that we are giving  does make a difference, not just in terms of the weapons but also the  training.   The training of Armed Forces and equipping them was done through what  is called the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative, USAI. It was  created back in 2016. I actually modified a McCain amendment to create  this new initiative. Since 2016, it has provided $1.6 billion for  training, equipment, advisory efforts, command and control functions,  cyber defense, and strategic communications. Most importantly, it  helped teach Ukraine mobility on the battlefield--again, a model of  warfare that was superior to what Russia had.   That first phase of our support included the Javelins and the  Stingers we talked about, then a heavy focus on organizing the transfer  of existing stocks of Soviet-era weaponry in Eastern Europe--places  like Poland or Slovakia--to Ukraine. But these Soviet-era weapons and  munitions were always finite, and the war has exhausted a lot of those  supplies coming from these other countries in the region. So this  Ukraine supplemental request from the White House is understandably a  larger amount because Ukraine now requires heavier weaponry and ones  that are NATO standard. So more funds are needed to be able to  transport these larger weapons at greater distances and to train  Ukrainian forces on these weapons and to continue to replenish them  with ammunition. So it is more of a traditional battlefield down here  requiring that heavier weapon, more expensive weaponry, and now, again,  NATO-standard weaponry.   While the United States and our allies are providing significant  resources to this cause, the costs imposed on Russia are much greater.  What do I mean by that?   Russia has now committed more than 70 percent of its total combat  power to Ukraine, and much of that has been degraded and continues to  be degraded. This raises an interesting point: Let's remember that  Russia directly threatened military intervention against a number of  our NATO allies, including the Baltics, Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia,  including Poland, even the UK, and, more recently, two countries that  are not NATO but are our allies, Finland and Sweden.  [[Page S2378]]    Other allies that they have threatened, we are legally obligated to  protect if they are in NATO, under NATO article 5. So downgrading  Russia's Army in Ukraine and supporting Ukraine's Armed Forces is a  pretty effective way to ensure that Russia does not have the ability to  attack NATO and instantly begin a direct U.S.-Russian confrontation-- something we have wanted to avoid.   And speaking of NATO, it is encouraging, again, that Sweden and  Finland are refusing to be intimidated by these Russian threats and are  looking to join the alliance instead. At the end of last week, Finland  already conducted military exercises with NATO military units from the  United States, the UK, Estonia, and Latvia. I am proud that we are  supporting this effort militarily. And Finland is now upgrading its air  force. That is good. The Senate should immediately confirm NATO  membership of both of these nations as soon as it comes before us.   It is important to note that it is not just the U.S. Government and  our allied governments that are supporting Ukraine in its hour of need.  Since this terrible conflict began, everyday Americans across the  country have stepped up to provide much needed assistance to Ukrainian  defenders, refugees, and first responders.   In March, Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine, sent out a request for surplus or  expired personal protective gear to provide to Ukrainian territorial  defense forces. They said they needed more protective gear, and we  responded. I am proud to say that Ohio answered that call. All  together, more than two dozen law enforcement agencies across my home  State have donated almost 2,000 pieces of personal protective gear, 71  vest carriers, 45 helmets, and over 1,800 pieces of body armor. With  the help of the Fund to Aid Ukraine--a nonprofit based in Parma, OH-- this badly needed equipment will soon make its way into the hands of  brave Ukrainian defenders who are fighting for their lives as they  endure Russia's brutal assault.    This organization has also given 24 pallets of supplies, over 7 tons  of medical supplies to Ukraine. I am grateful for everyone who stepped  forward, especially to those law enforcement agencies that have stepped  forward to help those Ukrainian law enforcement entities and first  responders and territorial defense troops who need better protection.  And this is happening all over America.   Additionally, there is a group in Cleveland called MedWish. They are  amazing. I got to go visit them last month. They are a very effective  nonprofit that has worked for years to provide medical supplies,  hospital supplies to countries that have suffered, say, from a natural  disaster but also in the case of Ukraine, of course, from the war. They  have partnered with a group called the United Ukrainian Organizations  of Ohio, headed by my friend Marta Liscynesky, to provide individual  first aid kits and other medical equipment to Ukrainian first  responders, defenders, and civilians. And Cleveland-based KOACORE is  delivering 17,000 individual first aid kits to the frontlines. This is  a company in Cleveland that is a safety management company so it is a  good role for them. They are doing it, again, as volunteers and  donating this.   When I was on the Polish-Ukrainian border in March, I saw Marta and  another Ohio friend Andy Futey, who is president of the Ukrainian World  Congress, in action, organizing some of this equipment that was coming  into Ukraine and particularly helping our refugees coming from Ukraine.   One of my own staffers, Josh Prest, recently volunteered to transport  some of this assistance to Europe. He checked an extra bag on his  flight so he could carry more individual first aid kits, and he  delivered them as well.   Again, there are thousands and thousands of Americans doing these  sorts of things.   As Russian forces intentionally target Ukrainian civilians to spread  fear and panic, this display of generosity from the people of Ohio will  reassure Ukrainians that America has their back. With this donation,  Ukrainian first responders running into the rubble of schools,  apartment buildings, and homes will be able to save more lives. I am  very proud of how the people of the great State of Ohio have given  their time and resources to help those in need.   Tonight in Cincinnati, OH--my hometown--we have organized a  fundraiser, under the leadership of Susie DeYoung, for what is called  World Central Kitchen. They do great work all around the globe,  including here in the United States, in response to natural disasters,  working with FEMA. But they are doing amazing things in Ukraine. The  funding for the fundraiser tonight is going to go to World Central  Kitchen and also to the Kharkiv sister city efforts I talked about  earlier.   I have seen the good work that DC Chef Jose Andres, and his  brainchild World Central Kitchen, is doing when I volunteered, along  with a few of my colleagues, at a World Central Kitchen location,  serving food to refugees--one of his 60 popup kitchens--in the border  areas between Ukraine and its neighbors.   Tonight, in Cincinnati, chefs from our entire Cincinnati region are  volunteering their skills and some great food for the people of  Ukraine. All of these donations are a reflection of how the American  people are united in support of Ukraine.   On the sanctions front, I hope we can focus more of our attention on  energy. I believe the top priority of all Ukraine's allies should be  cutting off the funding of Putin's war machine. The single largest  source of that funding is, of course, their energy exports from Russia.  Europe relies on these energy exports from Russia. They purchase  approximately $870 million of energy from Russia every single day. That  is one reason the ruble has regained some of its value--because these  energy receipts are coming in to fund Russia's government and fund the  war machine.   For Europe, it is about $22 million worth of coal every day, $415  million worth of oil, and $433 million in natural gas every day, again,  funding Russia's brutal assault on Ukraine.   I have talked about this on the floor before, but Putin has long used  energy as a weapon, and we have got to put an end to it.   I applaud those European nations that have recently taken steps to  find alternative sources of energy and transition away from Russia. For  example, recently, Italy, which relies on Russia for approximately 40  percent of its natural gas, is actively working to secure new natural  gas contracts with African nations.    And in the last month, Lithuania became the first European country to  halt the import of all Russian gas.   The EU took its first tangible step away from Russian fuels last  month when it finally agreed to ban coal imports from Russia. This is  expected to take effect in August.   As part of their efforts to mark V-E Day on Sunday, the G7, which  includes, France, Germany, Italy, Britain, Canada, and the United  States, pledged to ban Russian oil. Well, that is good. But let's be  sure that this pledge is converted into reality. We have seen  agreements before with the EU on this topic, and yet we need to be sure  we see actual action.   A total embargo on all energy--oil, gas, natural gas, coal--is  needed. The United States has the energy resources, especially  liquefied natural gas, to be able to substitute for what Russia has  been sending to Europe.   To be there for Europe, the United States must immediately expand our  oil and natural gas production here and build the associated energy  infrastructure that will allow our hydrocarbons to reach the global  market.   Reports are showing that last month in April, European LNG import  terminals--so bringing liquefied natural gas into Europe from the  United States but also from the Mideast--took in a record amount,  hitting their highest level since the start of the pandemic. We have  got to continue to build on that trajectory. We have already got a  general agreement in place with the EU to do that, but certain  countries have blocked its implementation.   More generally, we have got to support all of our domestic producers  here in the United States through a robust ``all of the above'' energy  policy that includes renewables, fossil fuels, carbon capture  technologies, nuclear power, hydropower, hydrogen, and energy  efficiency--all of the above.   Instead of making it more difficult for domestic energy production, I  urge the Biden administration to reject  [[Page S2379]]  their proposed tax increase on energy production proposed in the  President's budget; stop restricting new leases on Federal lands and  waters for oil and gas production and help with the permitting of the  needed infrastructure instead of proposals like rewriting the  definitions of the waters of the United States, which would add  significant time and complexity to permitting new energy projects. This  is a time when we need to focus on how to help Europe get away from  their dependency on Russian energy in order to stop fueling the Putin  war machine.   I have mentioned sanctions over these past 11 weeks, from trading  sanctions and eliminating Russia's preferred tax status with the United  States to banking sanctions to crush President Putin's financial  services economy. But we should and must go further, especially when  Russia not only continues its onslaught on Ukrainians' defensive  combatants but on their noncombatants--on civilians. What they are  doing, in so many instances, is clearly war crimes.   I call on the International Criminal Court, again, which has  announced an investigation, to follow in Ukraine's footsteps and  immediately begin a War Crimes Tribunal. The evidence of war crimes is  now clear. There should be no delay.   Earlier, I spoke about the investment the United States has made  since 2015 in training Ukrainian troops and modernizing its military.  We now know that investment is paying off because Ukrainian troops have  outmaneuvered and pushed back on Russia's military.   Speaking to the current Russian invasion, one Ukrainian officer told  us:         The biggest mistake the Russians made was giving us eight       years to prepare for this.    Thank goodness we had that time. We could have used it even more  productively, but we were able to make great progress.   I close tonight on this because it shows why U.S. leadership around  the world is so important: Without the bipartisan action of Congress  and multiple administrations--including the Obama, Trump, and now Biden  administrations--what Ukraine is achieving would not have been  possible. That is why it is so important we take up this Ukrainian  supplemental immediately, this week, and pass it into law. We have made  a difference. We can continue to make a difference, but we are at a  crucial point in this war.   So much more needs to be done. But do you know what? I am hopeful. I  am hopeful because of what we have all seen. Over the past 2 months,  the resiliency and fortitude of the Ukrainian Armed Forces and the  Ukrainian people, it has shown the world what patriotism and bravery  truly is.   I yield back my time.
