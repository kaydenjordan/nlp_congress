 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the success of  the A-29 Super Tucano light-attack combat aircraft in Afghanistan, a  joint U.S. Air Force, NATO, and Afghan Air Force program.   Starting in December of 2015, the 81st Fighter Squadron at Moody Air  Force Base graduated the first class of Afghan A-29 pilots, and this  April marked the 2-year anniversary of these pilots' first combat  mission in Afghanistan, a remarkable milestone.   As one U.S. Armed Forces commander stated: The A-29 combat mission in  Afghanistan has been a game changer. The program's success has drawn  the attention of our allies with more than 14 air forces using the A-29  and over 320,000 flight hours and 40,000 combat hours. Even our own Air  Force is currently conducting experimentation on adding this light- attack aircraft to the fleet.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud of this contribution in part because, since  2011, the A-29 has been built in my district in Jacksonville, Florida,  by a team of more than 1,000 U.S. employees, 60 percent of which, Mr.  Speaker, are veterans. The A-29 is truly made in America and includes  the support of more than 100 suppliers and subcontractors across 20  States.                            ____________________
