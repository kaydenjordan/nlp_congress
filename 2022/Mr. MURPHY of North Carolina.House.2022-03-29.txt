 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support  of SECURE Act 2.0.   When our military members pledge a commitment to the United States,  we promise, in return, to care for them and their families. As the  proud Representative of close to 90,000 veterans in North Carolina, I  am committed to supporting strong legislation that improves the lives  of our veterans and their families.   When servicemembers change base assignments, their spouses often  relocate with them, putting their own careers at stake and on hold. The  SECURE Act prioritizes military family retirements by providing a tax  credit for small employers that make more benefit plans available for  military spouses.   Incentivizing job creators to hire and retain military spouses is an  important step to strengthening military family retirement savings.   I am proud of the bipartisan effort by the Ways and Means Committee  to lead the charge to support our military families, who so often face  many uphill challenges in attaining retirement security. We must always  fight for those who have given us so much to keep our safety.
