 Mr. Speaker, it is with a heavy heart that I rise today to  mourn the loss of my friend, Kyle Forti. A native of DeKalb County,  Kyle was the epitome of what it means to be a Hoosier. A strong man of  faith, he held deep love for his God, his family, and his country.   Mr. Speaker, as a young man, Kyle was one of the first to believe in  me as I began running for public office. He worked tirelessly to help  me advance the conservative values that we hold dear. On Sunday,  though, Kyle's life was tragically cut short after his helicopter  crashed in northern Kenya.   No amount of words can describe my pride as I watched Kyle grow and  develop into a husband to Hope, a father to Max, and a successful  businessman.   As his mother correctly stated, he had a passion for humanity and the  human soul. Although he left us too soon, his love for people and  passion for liberty will serve as an inspiration for me for the rest of  my life.                            ____________________
