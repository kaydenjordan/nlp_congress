 Madam President, I rise today to urge our colleagues to  join me in voting to confirm Radhika Fox--Isn't that a great name,  Radhika Fox?--to be Assistant Administrator for Water of the  Environmental Protection Agency.   Over the past 2 months, as Radhika Fox has gone through the  confirmation process, I have had the real pleasure to come to know her  and, frankly, to admire her. I am convinced that she is an excellent  choice to lead the EPA's Office of Water at a crucial time in the  Agency's history.   Ms. Fox brings with her an impressive, professional record of service  and accomplishment spanning over two decades, working on water issues  at the local, State, and Federal level.   Most recently, before she was nominated for her position at EPA, Ms.  Fox served as the CEO of the U.S. Water Alliance. There she worked  hand-in-glove with organizations across this country representing a  wide range of water stakeholders, from industries to municipalities,  from service organizations to consumer groups, and from agricultural  groups to environmental organizations. What those organizations have  said again and again about Radhika Fox is that she is an exceptional  leader who will work day and night to come up with practical solutions  for our country's serious water challenges. Moreover, Ms. Fox will make  sure that everyone's point of view is heard and taken into account when  EPA acts to protect our country's precious water resources.   And how do we know these groups say all these wonderful things about  Radhika Fox? Because they have written to us, urging the Senate to act  swiftly to confirm her, again and again and again. In fact, over 80  prominent organizations that are key stakeholders in the nation's water  policies have written letters in support of her nomination to this  important post.   When I say that over 80 organizations have written, I don't mean that  80-plus organizations have signed on to a common letter--one letter of  support. No, no, no. I mean that over 80 organizations have taken the  time to write their own unique, thoughtful letters of support.   In fact, the Senate Committee on the Environment and Public Works,  which I am privileged to lead along with Shelley Capito of West  Virginia, has been inundated with letters of support for Radhika Fox.  Each letter describes the specific and positive impact that Ms. Fox has  already had on issues of importance to those individual organizations  and the members of those they represent, and she has done it under  previous professional positions consistently.   I will take a few minutes. I don't do this very often, but I just  want to take a few minutes here and actually go through some of these  letters, these 80 letters of support. They are remarkably consistent  letters of great compliment and praise for her and the kind of person  she is and the kind of leader that she is. But I want to share the  words of some of those who reached out to us.   The U.S. Chamber of Commerce writes:         Ms. Fox has worked to ensure that businesses and the groups       that represent them are valued stakeholders in water       infrastructure conversations. She has created platforms to       convene stakeholders from the water sector and industry       through her leadership.    The U.S. Water Alliance, what do they say? The U.S. Water Alliance  writes:         Radhika Fox developed a consistent record of working       cooperatively alongside stakeholders from every corner of the       water sector, including drinking water, wastewater, and       stormwater utilities of all sizes, environmental groups,       labor, frontline communities, and countess others.    How about the Family Farm Alliance. Here is what the Family Farm  Alliance writes:         Due to her extensive engagement in policy and public       discourse in her previous positions, Ms. Fox understands the       implications of guidance and regulation but also the       importance of authentic community engagement and the need to       achieve quantified results on the ground.    They go on to say:         Radhika Fox is the type of leader to create the conditions       to catalyze that work and ultimately see it through.    Again, those are the words we received from the Family Farm Alliance.   How about the Iowa Soybean Association? We raise a lot of soybeans in  our State, and I know the Presiding Officer raises a bunch in her  State. And for this gentleman sitting over here on my left, they raise  a few down in West Virginia. But the Iowa Soybean Association says:         Ms. Fox understands how water management issues are       interwoven with the fabric of rural and urban communities and       that farmers must be part of the team and beneficiaries of       this work. This integration is key for making real and long-      lasting progress on protecting and improving water in the       21st century.    And here are some words from one of our neighbors in Delaware, off to  the west of us, Maryland. Ben Grumbles, a Republican-appointed  secretary of the Maryland's Department of the Environment writes that  Ms. Fox has ``impressed public and private sector water leaders on her  abilities to find common ground and skillfully advocate for integrated  `One Water' policies throughout the country. . . . Radhika is well- qualified to organize, inspire, and lead EPA's national water program  and the many diverse constituencies who shape our water future.   Thank you for those words, Ben Grumbles.   Galveston. Galveston, TX, here we go. Galveston Bay Foundation down  in Galveston, TX, says this about Radhika:         Radhika is a proven leader who has demonstrated a desire to       make sure that all stakeholders and all voices have a place       at the table.    And, finally, last but not least, the Community Water Center--that is  an outfit in Central California, not too far from where I was stationed  when I was in the Navy. They write:         Ms. Fox has the rare ability to bring multiple differing       voices into the room (from environmental justice to water       agencies to agricultural entities to state government       leaders), find the common themes, and then  [[Page S4573]]       weave together a shared ground that helps advance the       conversation and create real progress. You will be hard-      pressed to find a more gifted visionary and leader in the       water space than Ms. Fox.    Those are amazing letters. Any one of them by themselves would be, I  think, remarkable and compelling, but when you put them all together-- from the Chamber of Commerce to environmental organizations and  agricultural organizations--we hear this theme repeated again and  again. It is pretty amazing, and the reason why is because it turns out  that Radhika Fox is an amazing human being and leader.   These excerpts that I just shared with my colleagues today are really  a small sample--this is just a small sample--of the expressions of  overwhelming support that our committee, the Environment and Public  Works Committee, has received from organizations and from people around  the country who know water issues and who also know Radhika Fox.   Their message is loud. Their message is clear. We have the  opportunity today to confirm a truly gifted leader and put her to work  serving our country right away from sea to shining sea. I urge my  colleagues to join me in doing just that   With that, I yield the floor.
