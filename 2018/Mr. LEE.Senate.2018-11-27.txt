 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, earlier this month, Utah lost one of our very  finest--former Congressman Jim Hansen, a great leader, an amazing  husband and father, and a fantastic, loyal friend.   It is my privilege to honor his life today. Jim's first and most  important rule for getting involved in politics was ``get involved  because you have a cause, and not simply because you want a job.'' In  fact, his own motivation to first run for local office was with the  objective of improving the local water system in his small town of  Farmington, UT, where the water supply was sometimes dirty and  sometimes even nonexistent.   Though he had lived in Farmington, UT, for only a few years at the  time, he was elected to the Farmington City Council in 1961, and he  oversaw the installation of a new utility system--no small feat for  that small town. That water system allowed the community to grow and to  flourish, just as it continues to do to this very day. Thus began Jim  Hansen's 42 years in public service.   After serving on the city council in Farmington for 12 years, Jim was  elected to the Utah House of Representatives in 1973. He worked hard  and eventually rose to the position of speaker of the house during his  final term. It was then that Jim launched his congressional bid for  Utah's 1st Congressional District, defeating five-term incumbent Gunn  McKay in 1980. He got right to work in representing the citizens of  Utah--this time at the Federal level. Among his proudest  accomplishments were serving on the Base Realignment and Closure  Commission and on the House's Natural Resources Committee. Jim took  great pride in helping save Hill Air Force Base, in Northern Utah, from  closure. Whenever he would hear a jet roaring overhead at a decibel  level loud enough to break the windows, he would tell his children,  predictably: That is just the sound of freedom. You are lucky to hear  and live under that sound every day.    A great lover of the outdoors, so too was he proud of saving the  environment from environmentalists, as he would say. Jim often sparred  with environmentalists about wilderness issues and championed multiple- use policies for public lands, although he was also a sponsor of the  1984 Utah Wilderness Act, which designated wilderness in U.S. forest  areas.   Ever a staunch Republican and always a man of humor, Jim Hansen  delighted in reciting his own version of Proverbs 22:6. He would say:  ``Train up a child in the way he should go, and when he is old, he will  vote Republican.'' Yet Jim was always known for being able to work  across the aisle and was well respected by his Democratic colleagues.  He served as the chairman of the House Ethics Committee during a  partisan crisis among House Members over the investigation into former  Speaker Newt Gingrich. Both parties, at the time, trusted him to handle  any investigations fairly and impartially.   For 22 years, he tirelessly served the First District of Utah in the  U.S. House of Representatives, becoming Utah's longest serving  Congressman. After he announced his retirement in 2002--still at the  top of his game--he said in an interview that he wanted to leave behind  a legacy of hard work. Indeed, Jim Hansen did.   Not only was Jim hard-working, but he was also immensely generous. He  did not keep his success for himself but for years offered mentorship  to anyone who sought to navigate the political waters.   I myself was lucky enough to call Jim a mentor and a friend. When I  first considered running for the Senate in 2010, he met with me at  length and gave me a whole lot of very helpful advice and  encouragement. Even though I was a newcomer with very little chance of  success, he couldn't have been more generous with his time, with his  wisdom, or with his words of support. When I announced my candidacy, he  stood by me and offered his full endorsement. So many others were also  blessed by Jim's friendship and his loyalty.   A lesser known story that illustrates the quality of Jim's character  involves his longtime friend Norm Bangerter, with whom he served in the  State legislature. In 1978, both men had their sights set on the house  speaker's post. They didn't want to run against each other, so they  made a deal that Norm would step aside so long as Jim agreed to step  aside in the future if they were ever interested in running for the  same position again.   Jim hoped to become Governor of Utah. In the 1980s, after Jim had  been serving in the House of Representatives for a few years, there was  an opening for a Republican to take back the governorship, and everyone  expected Jim to make a play for it, except that Norm wanted to run. So  what did Jim do? Well, he stepped aside and allowed his friend to run  for and to eventually win that position--a position that Norm Bangerter  then held for 8 years. That was the caliber of Jim Hansen's character.  He was a man of humility and integrity, who honored his word and always  put others before himself.   I would be remiss if I didn't also mention Jim's piety in the truest,  purest sense of that word. In addition to having a deep loyalty to his  country and to his State, he had a deep loyalty to his family and his  church. Jim married Ann Burgoyne in 1958, which he considered wisely to  be the smartest choice he ever made. Their family grew to include 5  children and eventually 14 grandchildren and 1 great-grandchild.   Grandpa Jim was the center of their family, and his love for them  animated so much of his life. His grandchildren fondly remember his  jokes, stories, and genuine, unmistakable zest for life. His  granddaughter Anna recounted that on Jim's 80th birthday, when he  insisted on going water-skiing, he had waded into the lake while  wearing his slacks and socks, with his grandchildren sloshing behind  him, to fish out the ChapStick tubes and Tic Tac packs that were  floating out of his pockets. That, of course, was Jim Hansen--full of  life and spirit until the very end.   Before his involvement in politics and after he served in the Navy  during the Korean war, Jim went on a mission for the Church of Jesus  Christ of Latter-day Saints for 2 years. He also served as the bishop  of the Farmington 2nd Ward and as the president of the Davis Stake. One  of his jobs as bishop was to supervise the Farmington South Stake  Center, which is where loved ones and dignitaries gathered to honor his  life just this past week.   It is only fitting that we pay tribute to this honorable man, who so  faithfully and nobly served God, family, and country throughout his  entire life. Jim Hansen will be sorely missed by his family, friends,  Utahns, and all those whose lives were touched and changed for the  better by him. I have no doubt  [[Page S7124]]  that his legacy will live on for many years to come.   War Powers Resolution to End Unauthorized U.S. Military Involvement in                                   Yemen    Mr. President, the U.S. Constitution makes unmistakably clear the  fact that in order to declare war, one must go through Congress. There  are good reasons for this requirement. Whenever we go to war, we are  making the greatest of moral decisions--decisions that will imperil the  lives of those involved in that war, including and especially the brave  young men and women who represent us in uniform and who fight to  protect our freedom. The costs of war--and I speak not only of the  economic costs but especially of the deep human costs associated with  war--are such that these decisions should never be made lightly. It is  for this reason that the Founding Fathers wisely put this power into  the hands of those occupying the branch of government most accountable  to the people at the most regular intervals.   You cannot declare war without going through Congress. Sadly, over  time, some of this power has been neglected--neglected by the very  Congress to which the power properly constitutionally belongs. Under  the Constitution to which every Member of this body has sworn an oath  to uphold, to protect, and defend, it is wrong to go into war without  Congress's directing it, ordering it, declaring it. Yet, sadly,  tragically, unconstitutionally, I believe, the United States has been  involved as a co-belligerent in a civil war half a world away in Yemen,  involved in connection with a Kingdom of Saudi Arabia-led coalition  against the Houthi rebels.   What, one might ask, is the interest of the United States in this  war? What is it about this particular civil war in Yemen that is  important to keep the American people safe? That is a question that has  never been fully answered. In fact, it is a question that has never  been answered by the only branch of government that is capable  constitutionally of making that assessment, of answering that question.  We have never answered it.   It is not just a mere formality that we go through when we require  Congress to declare war. It is about the debate that that starts, the  conversation that occurs among the American people, the accountability  that each Member of the Senate and each Member of the House of  Representatives has to his or her constituents. It is about the fact  that we have to be able and willing to look the American people in the  eye--even our own constituents, our own friends and neighbors, even and  especially those who are the parents and loved ones of the men and  women who will be at the battlefront and will be asked, potentially, to  pay the ultimate price for defending freedom. We have to be willing to  do that. Yet we haven't because, for the last 4 years, we have been  fighting someone else's war without a declaration of war by Congress,  without an authorization for the use of military force by Congress.   What, then, is the remedy? There are a number of things that we could  do and that we should do. Among them are the procedures outlined by and  provided in the War Powers Act. The War Powers Act gives us the ability  to halt our military involvement where Congress deems it inappropriate.   A few months ago, Senator Sanders and I ran a resolution to do  precisely that--availing ourselves of the benefits of the War Powers  Act. Sadly, that measure was narrowly defeated; it was tabled; it was  halted from moving forward. It has been filed again. We are going to  have an opportunity again very soon, perhaps as early as tomorrow, to  vote on that yet again.   In the meantime, what has changed? We have continued to fight this  war still in an unconstitutional posture, still without the American  people having been adequately consulted, still without the American  people's elected Senators and Representatives having made a decision to  go to war, still without the opportunity for us to look in the eye our  neighbors, our constituents, and the parents and family members and  loved ones of our brave men and women in uniform who are asked to fight  these battles and to tell them why it is that we are asking for this  potential sacrifice of American blood and treasure. We have not done  those things.   Since that time, we have seen some very unsettling realities unfold  within the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, with credible intelligence  regarding the Crown Prince's involvement in and ordering of the death  of Mr. Khashoggi. We now have not only the eyes of the American people  on Saudi Arabia--more importantly, we have the eyes of people all  around the world on the United States of America. It is not just about  the death of Mr. Khashoggi, but Mr. Khashoggi's death and the way it  came about and the way it is alleged and supposed to have been ordered  by the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia says something about us if we  proceed undeterred in our fighting of an unconstitutional war on behalf  of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. It is not just what the American people  think about Saudi Arabia or about us in Washington; it is also about  what the rest of the world will think about the United States of  America if we turn a blind eye to this and if we continue to fight an  undeclared, unauthorized, unconstitutional war that has no apparent  connection to the safety of the American people, to the security of the  American homeland.   This is why I respectfully--and with all of the urgency I am capable  of communicating--implore my colleagues to support this resolution, to  support the resolution to get us out of fighting Saudi Arabia's war in  Yemen. It is not our war, not our security, not on our watch.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
