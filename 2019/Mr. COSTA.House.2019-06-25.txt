 Mr. Speaker, I would like to talk about a challenge that  we have in California's waterways. It is a challenge of an invasive  species called nutria.   Nutrias are commonly known as swamp rats to many. They came from  South America decades ago, but they raise havoc wherever they go.   They are a problem for California's already challenged water system.  They destroy canals and levees, which, in turn, could lead to flooding  and threaten water delivery to our farmers and our farm communities.   Usually detected in large numbers, they rapidly reproduce, which  makes eradication difficult.   Last week, I cosponsored legislation with fellow Congressmen Josh  Harder and TJ Cox to help fight the nutria population growth. The bill  will reauthorize the Nutria Eradication and Control Act of 2003 and  provide $7 million toward efforts to rid the species from California  once and for all.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this  important legislation for California.                    Celebrating Portuguese Heritage Month     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize June as National  Portuguese Heritage Month.   Representative Cox and I have introduced legislation, along with the  Portuguese Caucus, to officially recognize the key role that Portuguese  Americans have played in the growth of our Nation and highlight their  valuable and significant contributions to our society.   Portugal was the first neutral nation to establish diplomatic ties  with the United States over 240 years ago. They have contributed to  every facet of American society, from manning the early whaling ships  in New England to the introduction of agriculture throughout the  country.   They have served with distinction and proudly in our military and  have been leaders in government at every level in our country. In 1979,  Tony Coelho, my friend from California, was elected as the first  American of Portuguese descent to the United States House of  Representatives.   In addition to lawmaking, Portuguese Americans have made lasting  contributions to science, music, and in other areas of business,  through people like former Secretary of Energy and nuclear physicist  Ernest Moniz and the famous March King, John Philip Sousa, who wrote  the iconic song ``Stars and Stripes Forever'' as he headed the Marine  Corps band.   They are also leaders in agriculture throughout our Nation--in  California, most notably in the dairy industry.   The Portuguese American story is the American story of immigrants  past and immigrants present who have come here through generations to  have a better life for themselves and their families.   Values that my own parents and grandparents instilled in myself and  my sister have never been far from my heart, that family and tradition  and that an ethic of hard work are important in our country for all  immigrant groups, and realizing that with that ethic, anything can be  accomplished in America.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues today to join me in recognizing and  celebrating the many ways in which the Portuguese American communities  have changed, shaped, and influenced our country through our industries  and, most importantly, through their ideals and their love of family  and becoming a part of that American Dream.   Mr. Speaker, I inquire as to how much time I have remaining.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize another ethnic  group that has made so many contributions to America, the Armenian  community, to underscore the importance and the strong relationship  between the United States and Armenia.   The United States has enjoyed a long history working with the  Armenian people toward a shared vision of a free and democratic  society.   The Armenian community has risen over the past 100 years, after  facing one of the most atrocious acts in human history: the first  genocide in the 20th century.   Notwithstanding that, they have prevailed and continue to grow  stronger, not only in Armenia, but also throughout the world.   In 2018, we witnessed the Armenian people standing up and peacefully  demonstrating for change in their country, and it happened. Nearly 1  year later, the dawn of a new era represents an opportunity for the  country and its people to reach their full potential.   The United States can provide valuable support and help to empower  the Armenian people in this new and exciting chapter in their country.   I am pleased, therefore, to support H.R. 452, and I look forward to  the opportunity to work with my colleagues to continue to strengthen  the bilateral relations between the United States and the Republic of  Armenia.      Resolve Humanitarian Crisis at Southern Border on Bipartisan Basis     Mr. Speaker, finally, let me say to my colleagues in the  House that what is going on at the border between the United States and  Mexico is simply not the American way. We can find solutions to resolve  the humanitarian crisis that is taking place at our border, but we must  work together on a bipartisan basis.   We must support the supplemental legislation today that will provide  additional funding while working for meaningful changes to take care of  people, to not separate children from their families, and to act in a  humane way that reflects our values.                            ____________________
