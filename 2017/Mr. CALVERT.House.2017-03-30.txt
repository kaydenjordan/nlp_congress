 Mr. Speaker, on rollcall votes 207 and 208 I was unable  to vote due to obligations in my congressional district. Had I been  present, I would have voted ``no'' on rollcall 207, the Motion to  Recommit, and ``yes'' on rollca11 208, related to H.R. 1431, the EPA  Science Advisory Board Reform Act of 2017, which would ensure EPA  administrator and the Science Advisory Board make public all reports  and relevant scientific information at the same time they are received  by members of the Science Advisory Board.                             personal explanation
