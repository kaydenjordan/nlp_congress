 Mr. Speaker, this bill is very important and  includes important hurricane protection for the Upper Barataria area,  which is going to help Jefferson, St. Charles, and Lafourche Parishes,  all the way up to Ascension Parish. If this had been in place when  Hurricane Ida made landfall, we would have had fundamentally different  conditions.   It is going to make higher, stronger levees. In the New Orleans area,  $3 billion in new investments there, which we worked on with  Congressman Carter and Congressman Scalise.   It clarifies the cost-share for the Mississippi River-Gulf Outlet,  something that never should have been in contention.   It helps to manage water on the Mississippi River, expedites the  Comite project, and makes tens of millions of dollars in additional  authorizations for water and wastewater in the capital, river, and  bayou regions.   Mr. Speaker, there are a lot of people who helped with this  legislation. One of them is Paul Sass, and I thank Paul for his nearly  20 years of service to this House and to this committee. Had he not  been around working on many of these bills, it simply would not have  happened, and I appreciate it. Having worked with the ranking member  for some period of time, I couldn't imagine working 20 years with him.  Amazing.   Mr. Speaker, I also thank Ranking Member Sam Graves for his hard work  on this. I thank Chairman DeFazio, Tim Petty, Leslie Parker, and  Melissa Beaumont for their work on this important legislation.   This is all about making investments of millions of dollars before  disasters happen in order to prevent billions of dollars in disaster  recovery and loss of life.   Lastly, I thank Water Resources and Environment Subcommittee Chair  Napolitano, as well as Ranking Member Rouzer, for their hard work on  this legislation.
