 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember the life of Sami  Natour, a respected member of the Knoxville community who recently  passed away at the age of 86.   Sami lived the American Dream. He was born in Palestine in 1933 and  later immigrated to America in 1953. He returned to Palestine in 1956  to marry his wife, Abla, before they permanently settled in the United  States and became American citizens. The Natours lived in Arlington,  Virginia, before making east Tennessee their home.   In 1972, Sami opened the Copper Kettle Restaurant in Knoxville with  his brothers, Samir and Naji. Sami worked extremely hard to make the  Copper Kettle a success. Sami's son, Peter, remembers his father's work  ethic and how he would often work from 6 in the morning until midnight.   Sami's dedication to his business clearly left an impression on his  sons: all three of them own and operate restaurants in the Knoxville  area. Peter runs Pete's Coffee Shop--one of my favorite places--Basel  runs Rami's Cafe, and Bassam runs Sami's Cafe.   Sami will be greatly missed. His life story serves as a reminder that  anyone willing to work hard can follow their dreams and be successful  in our great Nation.                            ____________________
