 Mr. Speaker, I rise to address the situation that President  Biden has us in right now on fuel.   On April 27, according to his texts, he is going to help bring the  price of fuel down. The price of fuel has gone up since April 27.   In his texts, he is going to release fuel from our reserves. All it  did was put money in Chinese pockets--950,000 barrels of oil--and  someone has got to be answerable for that.   This gentleman pictured on the end, Mr. Seals, is an offshore oil  producer, and Mr. Seals wants his job back.   Let's spend our time trying to get our energy released.   Don't go to Saudi Arabia, Mr. President. Let's stay here and let our  people, Mr. Seals, get and drill. Release our energy.
