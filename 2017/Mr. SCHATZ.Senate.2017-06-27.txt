 Mr. President, this is the beginning, not the end. Today,  we claim an important victory because of thousands of people across the  country. There are not enough Senators who support this Republican  healthcare plan, so there will not be a vote this week. Because of all  of the people who spoke up, the realities of this bill are delayed--the  tens of millions of people without insurance, a decimated Medicaid  Program, the closure of health clinics and hospitals. Yet that is the  key word here--that this bill is delayed. This bill is not dead.   Everyone who spoke up about this bill should take a victory lap. Pat  yourselves on the back tonight. It is an extraordinary moment in terms  of what grassroots democracy can accomplish. You did what you had to do  with what you could, and you succeeded but only for tonight. Tomorrow  morning, we have to get ready because the minute that the Senate comes  back from the July 4 recess, they will have 3 weeks to ram through a  bill. They are not done.   I heard the Vice President say today that they are going to keep  working until they get it done. They are not giving up, so we cannot  rest either.   Most importantly, we cannot let them forget that we are watching,  that we are waiting, and we will still be here when they try to come  back and jam this bill through.   I really hope that the Republicans take another course. In setting  aside the policy disagreements that we are having, there is really a  better way. There is a way for the Senate to be a Senate, which is to  empower two of the best Republican Senators whom we have seen in  generations. They are Lamar Alexander and Orrin Hatch--two people whose  conservative credentials nobody doubts. They are the chairmen of two of  the biggest committees in the U.S. Senate--the Health, Education,  Labor, and Pensions Committee and the Finance Committee. They have done  bipartisan work--  [[Page S3805]]  Orrin Hatch for decades and Lamar Alexander for decades. Both of them,  relatively recently, have done bipartisan work on tax extenders and on  repealing No Child Left Behind. These are not easy issues. For these  two chairmen, because they understand the committee hearing process and  because they earned those gavels, I can only imagine their frustration.   Look, I am a Progressive, and I support the Affordable Care Act, but  if I were sitting there as a Republican member of the HELP Committee or  the Finance Committee and if these bills were going through and taking  the country in a direction to which I objected and if I were the  ranking member or were, maybe, a couple off from being the ranking  member, I would be thinking to myself that I cannot wait until I get  that gavel back.   I can tell you that I can have my own hearings, and I can listen to  expert testimony, and I can craft a bill. That is what I want to do.  The point of being a legislator is to actually work together on a  bipartisan basis. Everybody knows that the chairman or the chairwoman  has the lion's share of the authority, but it is still a collaborative  process. It is politics. You try to accommodate people on both sides of  the aisle, and you have quite an ideological spectrum, both on the D  side and the R side, but that is the fun of it. That is the way the  Senate is supposed to work.   You have a hearing, and the thing that we should remember about a  hearing is that, generally speaking, if you have four testifiers--I do  not know if it is a rule or just kind of an operating assumption--the  majority party gets to pick three out of the four testifiers. So you  are going to get three Republican witnesses and one Democratic witness  if you have a normal hearing in HELP or Finance about the Affordable  Care Act or what ought to happen with the American Health Care Act or  whatever it may be. So it is not as if you cannot control the message,  and it is not as if you cannot, in the end, do whatever bill you want  to do. Isn't that the fun of being in the Senate?   Forget the Democrats for the moment. I mean, the Democrats were  totally in the dark, and the public was totally in the dark. Even for  the Republican Members, I mean, this has to irritate them that 13  people were sort of kept in the loop--some more than others, some less  than others--but it was like these consecutive conversations: What will  it take to get you to yes? OK. We will consider that. We will let you  know what we are able to do.   Why not just have a public hearing?   That is, literally, what we do for everything--for the Defense  authorization, for appropriations bills. Of the 12 subcommittees, we  have several hearings. Whether it is telecommunications or railroads or  education or even other healthcare issues, we have public hearings, and  we do so on a bipartisan basis.   As tough as we are on each other in the election context and as tough  as we are sometimes with each other on the floor, the committee hearing  process is rarely as partisan. The committee hearing process allows you  to kind of get to the work of legislating.   All I am suggesting is that I understand what Leader McConnell is  going to try to do. He is going to try to peel off votes. Senator  Markey is exactly right in that he is going to try to peel off votes.  Yet there is another way to go here, and that is to legislate. Let me  just make the political argument for this on behalf of Republicans.   The problem with being the majority party and trashing the healthcare  system by not properly funding the exchanges right now and by creating  all of this uncertainty is that prices go up, and everybody understands  this. Barack Obama is not the President. He was river rafting when all  of this was happening, and he deserves it. I am happy for him. He is  not the President. So the idea is that you are going to sort of say:  Well, we are going to cut Medicaid, cut opioid funding, and we are  going to turn this into a big tax cut for people who are already doing  well financially because that last bill was called ObamaCare. It had  the word ``Obama'' in it.    Listen, Republicans and Democrats across the country may not be  politically sophisticated like we pretend to be, but they are smart.  They are thinking to themselves, I am a Republican, I am a  conservative, but I don't care about Barack Obama anymore. He is gone.  He is not the President. So if you sit there and tell me we need to  slash funding for mental health services or slash funding for my  community health center in a rural neighborhood, I don't care--your  argument cannot be: Because ObamaCare, right? You can't be: Because  ObamaCare.   Now you have a majority in the House, a majority in the Senate, you  have the Presidency. So now Republicans own the healthcare system. So  here we are trying to figure out a way where we can both own the  healthcare system. We are acting like this is impossible to discover.  We are acting like: Gosh, what way would we work where we can each sort  of shoulder some of the political and policy responsibility, the  personal responsibility for the American healthcare system?   There is a very simple answer to that. We just do this through the  regular order. If you do this through the regular order--what that  means is--it is interesting to me that the difference between now and,  say, 6 months ago is people actually know what reconciliation is. They  know there is a threshold for regular legislation of 60 votes to  overcome a filibuster, but it is a really important point. The moment  the Republicans decided to do this via reconciliation, that was  tactical, and that was kind of technical, but what that meant was, they  said: We have 52. We only need 51. We don't need to talk to you.   I understand that kind of rationale. You have 52 votes. You can give  up actually two and have Vice President Pence break the tie. That may  be a judgment they made; I am not sure if they regret it or not.   So here we are. The way to take this off the table as a political  liability for the Republicans is to get a bill that could get 60 votes  because once it becomes a bipartisan enterprise, it cannot be a cudgel.  We cannot beat each other up over it.   When the Affordable Care Act passed originally, one of the challenges  we had as a political matter is that we had not a single, solitary  Republican vote. I will take everybody at their word that they just  couldn't vote for it because it was against their political ideology  and their principles, but it also had the side benefit of, the moment a  bill doesn't have the patina of bipartisanship--the moment only one  party participates in a process--boy, do you own it.   So the question I have is, Do you really want to own the American  healthcare system, whatever happens, good or bad? You become like the  utility company. Nobody likes their utility company. The best thing  that can happen, if you are a utility company, is the lights stay on  and the rate of increase slightly slows. You are never going to have  cheaper rates, right? And when you flip your light switch on and your  lights go on, you don't say: Gosh, I am so pleased with my utility  company. You ignore it.   The best thing that can happen is, you come up with a brilliant bill,  without any Democratic support, and then everybody shrugs their  shoulders and moves on. More likely you are going to own all the  problems you are creating, and you are creating myriad problems. I just  want to say, there are a lot of Democrats who are on the level about  wanting to legislate here, and we will do it the moment repeal is taken  off the table, the moment there is a commitment to public hearings, the  moment there is a commitment to doing things through the regular order.   Now, those were not my prepared remarks, but that really matters to  me. I really believe in the Senate. For all of our flaws, we are still  the place that has to solve the problems. We are still the world's  greatest deliberative body because we must be, because these are  Federal problems and we are the Federal legislature so we have to fix  this ourselves. There are only two paths; one is the partisan path,  which is great peril for people across the country and great political  peril, and then there is the path of statesmanship and  stateswomanship--the path of us working together and being a Senate  again. We can do that, but we have to decide that is what we want to  do.   I am hoping we go home, we participate in our parades, we hang out  with our families, we cook some burgers, we cook some hot dogs, and we  think: You know what, I want to legislate again. That was the battle,  that was tough, I  [[Page S3806]]  am angry, I am disappointed, I am relieved--it depends on who you are-- but I would like to start legislating again, and I would like to do so  in the regular order.   I am hoping that is what happens over the next week. If it doesn't,  then we will be ready to fight again, and I know there are literally  millions of Americans who are not going to let up until this bill is  dead.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
