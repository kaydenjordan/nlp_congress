 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this  important legislation authored by my friend and colleague,  Congresswoman Wilson.   Since serving on Miami-Dade's School Board and seeing too many young  Black men drop out of school with lifelong repercussions, Congresswoman  Wilson has worked tirelessly to intervene. She single-handedly began  the 5000 Role Models of Excellence Project, a highly successful  mentorship and leadership program that continues to transform countless  young Black men's lives.   In the wake of George Floyd's murder, millions of voices have  demanded justice and a dismantling of the oppressive systems that  harmed Black men for generations.   In America, Black children are three times more likely to be born in  poverty than White children. School districts where the majority of  those enrolled are students of color receive billions less than mostly  White districts, while disciplinary policies in classes  disproportionately impact Black students.   After school, Black male unemployment is consistently almost double  that of their White counterparts. Black men represent 12 percent of the  population but approximately 33 percent of the prison population.   This legislation makes righting these wrongs a priority by creating  this national commission to recommend major changes to policy to  dramatically improve the lives of Black men and boys.   Congresswoman Frederica Wilson has made this her life's work. She has  literally carried thousands of young men on her shoulders to success.   As we honor the legacy of John Lewis, there is no more appropriate  tribute than to pass this bill and continue the long march toward  racial equality.                                time  1115
