 Mr. Speaker, our southern border is in  crisis.   President Biden has been dodging the crisis they caused at our  southern border, calling it a challenge, not a crisis. They have opened  our borders but, at the same time, kept our schools closed.   The Democrat's approach of ``come on in'' has reversed sensible  immigration control measures put in place by the previous  administration and led to disastrous results.   Compared to pre-inauguration numbers, Customs and Border Protection  is encountering five times the number of family units trying to cross  the border. We are on pace to have over 100,000 unaccompanied minors  cross the border illegally this year, up by 45 percent. Customs and  Border Protection is projecting a 20,000-bed shortage for the children  in their custody.   Under his rule, asylum seekers are now allowed to come into America  to wait. And even if they are COVID-positive, they are released into  the country--many of whom will never be seen again.   Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge President Biden to reverse these  disastrous actions and return to sensible immigration policies that  were present to stem the tide of illegal immigration.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong  opposition to H.R. 842, the prounion bosses act.   Here we are once again. This is becoming all too familiar here in  Congress, an exercise for Democrats to steamroll these massive bills  through the House without proper debate or transparency. Our committee  didn't even have a hearing or a markup on this.   Frankly, the bill is disastrous. Bills like this only further  suppress workers' rights, create a one-size-fits-all type of union  contract, and create incentives for disruptive and dangerous union  strikes, especially in healthcare.   One particularly bothersome practice is this legislation would  require employers to hand over workers' private personal information to  union organizers--home addresses, cell phone numbers, email addresses-- without  [[Page H1142]]  their employees' consent. These are privacy violations not to be  tolerated in this country.   I know leadership doesn't want you guys to do this, but we want to  work with you. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to vote  ``no'' on this legislation.
