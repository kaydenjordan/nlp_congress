 Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize Arts in Education Week.   As children return to school from their summer vacations, I am  reminded that true education must go beyond language arts and math. It  must include daily access to creative subjects like dance, poetry,  visual arts, and theater.   Ninety-three percent of Americans agree: The arts are a vital part of  a well-rounded education, and when schools make the investment, we see  ripple effects across students' lives. A student involved in the arts  is four times more likely to be recognized for academic achievement;  they are three times more likely to win an award for school attendance  and are elected to class office more than three times as often as their  peers.   We must do more to ensure every child can regularly access arts  education. In the most recent appropriations bill passed by this  Chamber, we included a $6 million increase to support Arts in Education  at the Department of Education.   I am proud to work with lawmakers on both sides of the aisle to  support this program and will push to preserve a strong increase in any  final spending bill.                            ____________________     Mr. Chair, I thank the chairman for his work on this and  for yielding me the time.   Today I rise in support of the Coastal Marine Economies Protection  Act and to defend Maine's coastline for future generations.   This summer, I was blessed to, once again, become a grandmother. With  the birth of my new grandson, I am now lucky enough to be the  grandmother of four. All four of my grandchildren played in and around  the ocean this summer, the Gulf of Maine, just as their parents have  done and so many other Mainers do every summer.   The Gulf of Maine is an irreplaceable natural resource that is a draw  for millions of tourists each year, and it is critical to the Maine  economy. It should not be exploited for oil and drilling.   The climate crisis has already taken a toll on our waters. It has  caused ocean acidification and rising sea levels, and the warming of  the ocean has put Maine's vibrant fishing industries in peril.   Drilling for fossil fuels in the Gulf of Maine when we should be  investing in renewable energy, is like trying to put out a fire by  dousing it with kerosene.    I believe it is our duty as elected leaders to leave this Nation  better than we found it. That means ensuring we preserve our oceans for  our children and our grandchildren, and we fight this climate crisis  with all we have got.    Mr. Chair, I hope my colleagues on both sides of the  aisle will join me in supporting H.R. 1941, because sacrificing our  coastline to further this Nation's dependence on fossil fuels is  nothing short of irresponsible.
