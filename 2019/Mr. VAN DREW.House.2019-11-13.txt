 Madam Speaker, last month, I had the honor of meeting  with Jack and Jill of America's Eastern Region teen representatives.   For the past 80 years, the Eastern Region of Jack and Jill of America  has been impacting the lives of children by making them civically  engaged, charitable, and selfless leaders. The development of this club  allowed children to come together in a close, social, and cultural  relationship with one another. This organization provides a supportive  community for mothers, children, fathers, and teens to assist in the  positive transformation of not only the communities but the country.  [[Page H8816]]    The Eastern Region is the largest in the country with 56 chapters,  and it continues to provide innovative programming in the new  millennium. Because of the dedication of these individuals working with  the region, the Eastern chapters have provided over 500,000 meals to  families in need in the year 2014 to 2015.   It is a job well done by the Eastern Region of Jack and Jill of  America. We thank them for their support, their help, and their  commitment to America.                            ____________________
