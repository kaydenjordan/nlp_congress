 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         Page 8, line 16, after the dollar amount, insert       ``(increased by $1,974,000)''.        Page 10, line 1, after the dollar amount, insert ``(reduced       by $4,000,000)''.    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 504, the gentleman  from Nebraska (Mr. Bacon) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Nebraska.    Mr. Chairman, I rise to offer amendment No. 5. I plan to  ask unanimous consent to withdraw the amendment. However, before I do,  I would ask to engage Chairman Calvert in a brief colloquy.   Mr. Chair, I yield to the gentleman.    The Fish and Wildlife Service has a backlog of 49 species  waiting to be down-listed or delisted. This issue is further compounded  by the fact that an additional 839 species are overdue for their  mandatory 5-year status review to determine if ESA protections need to  continue.   It is no wonder why States are frustrated that species are put on the  list and rarely removed. To be more effective in species conservation,  the Fish and Wildlife Service must address this backlog so States can  better focus their recovery efforts.   I respect the committee's progress made on this front, but I hope we  can make further efforts to ensure the Fish and Wildlife Service is an  effective ally in species conservation under EPA.   Mr. Chair, I yield to the gentleman.    I thank the gentleman for his feedback and efforts, and I  yield back the balance of my time.   Mr. Chairman, I withdraw my amendment No. 5.   The Acting CHAIR. The amendment is withdrawn.   Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, as the designee of Ranking Member Lowey,  I move to strike the last word.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Minnesota is recognized for 5  minutes.   Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Arizona (Mr. O'Halleran).   Mr. O'HALLERAN. Mr. Chairman, my amendments address critical health  needs in Indian Country by providing the Bureau of Indian Affairs and  the Indian Health Service additional funding to complete projects.   My first amendment ensures communities, including the Hopi Tribe in  my district, have resources for funding to complete their arsenic  medication project.   My second amendment fulfills part of our trust relationship with  federally recognized Tribes by ensuring Indian Health Service clinics  and hospitals opening this year receive staffing and operations  funding.   In my district, the Gila River Health Care Red Tail Hawk Health  Center is scheduled to be opened, but has not received staffing or  operation funding. These healthcare facilities are badly needed to  increase access to healthcare in the community.   Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as she may consume to  the gentlewoman from the Virgin Islands (Ms. Plaskett).
