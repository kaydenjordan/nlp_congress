 Mr. Speaker, once again, the members of the far left are  disregarding this document, the United  [[Page H4390]]  States Constitution, in order to undermine Americans' right to keep and  bear arms.   Just a few weeks ago, New Mexico Governor Lujan Grisham issued an  executive order suspending the right to carry firearms in public across  Albuquerque and Bernalillo Counties for at least 30 days and fining  those who don't comply.   This political power grab is a blatant attack on the Second Amendment  and should infuriate every American. It sets a dangerous precedent for  the rights of law-abiding Americans and threatens the very freedoms we  hold so dear. We cannot allow it to go ignored.   That is why I urge my colleagues to join me in support of the  resolution condemning the actions of Governor Lujan Grisham for  attempting to deprive the citizens of New Mexico of their right to bear  arms.   The people of this great country understand that the House Republican  majority will always fight for their Second Amendment rights and uphold  the Constitution.       Congratulating the Clarke County High School Women's Soccer Team     Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the Clarke County High  School women's soccer team for winning the Class 2 State title, the  program's second State championship in 3 years.   After working hard all season, the Eagles left it all on the field  and defeated the Central of Wise County Warriors by a score of 7-0.   These talented student athletes include Avery and Sidney Shinabery,  Danyelle Franz, Makenna Jarvis, Kelsey Elrod, Ivana Betancourth,  Heather Cartagena, Bailey Mayo, Olivia Morise, Summer and Madison  Toone, Audrey Price, Campbell Neiman, Morgan Walker, Ella O'Donnell,  Lilly Suling, Tatiana Garcia, Kyleigh Goforth, Leah Mitchell, Krysna  Miranda, and Noelle Whalen.   Throughout the final game, the team overcame challenges, displayed  superior skill, and dominated possession of the ball.   This was Coach Ray Hawkins' first year as head coach; and under his  leadership, the coaches, players, and staff built up their confidence  to achieve their goals, and they did just that.   Congratulations, again, to the Clarke County High School women's  soccer team on this incredible achievement.                     Recognizing Martha's Meals on Wheels     Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize Martha's Meals on Wheels  in Staunton, Virginia, for 50 years of service to our local community.   In 1973, Minister Jo Lotz of the Emmanuel Episcopal Church and Martha  Wilkerson began preparing meals in the church for those in need for  Staunton residents, and their efforts eventually became Martha's Meals  on Wheels.   Five decades later, Martha's Meals on Wheels has gone from serving 20  people 5 days a week to now 30 to 35 people per day within the city  limits with the help of Armstrong's Restaurant in Verona, which has  been preparing the meals for 20 years.   In 2019, the program fed 4,900 people, and last year fed 7,700  people. With 60 to 80 dedicated volunteers today, the program is  expected to feed 7,800 people this year.   Martha's Meals on Wheels' longevity stands as a testament to the  civic spirit of the town and an example we should all follow: to always  lend a helping hand to others.   I thank Martha's Meals on Wheels and the volunteers for their  selfless service and wish them many years of success to come.                            ____________________
