 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor and  recognize Texas National Guard Specialist Bishop Evans. Bishop Evans is  a hero. He is a name that we all should learn, should know, and should  be speaking.   Bishop Evans, this young gentleman, was a National Guardsman. He was  stationed in Eagle Pass, Texas. He selflessly gave his life trying to  save people. He didn't care what nationality they were. He didn't care  the circumstances.   When the situation arose and two people fell or jumped into the  river, he immediately took off his body armor. He immediately jumped  into the river, and he tried to save these people, and he lost his life  doing it.   This is something that here in D.C. we should be talking about. The  whole country should be talking about Specialist Bishop Evans. The man  is a hero.   There are many men and women that serve that are just like this, that  when the time comes, it is a fight-or-flight moment and they are  rushing to the fire; they are not running away from it.   I give my condolences to Specialist Evans, his grandparents, Jo Ann  and Dannie Johnson, in Arlington, Texas. Their grandson meant  everything to them, and they are going to have a funeral this weekend.   I celebrate this man's life. I celebrate what he stands for. I  celebrate everything that he has done. He is a patriot. He served our  country. He served in Kuwait. He served in Iraq.   This man, when duty called, he answered the call. And here he was,  stationed in Eagle Pass, Texas, in my district, in Texas 23, and he  jumped into the river. He didn't have to do that. He lost his life  doing that.   This border crisis has impacted everybody, all parts, all walks of  life, Texas. Every State in America has become sucked up into this  crisis, and this gentleman here gave his life. He is a hero that we all  should remember. Bishop Evans is a hero that we should all remember.   Please say a prayer for his family. I was raised by my grandparents.  He was raised by his grandparents. Not all families are traditional  families, per se. And his grandparents, they lost a part of them when  they lost Specialist Bishop Evans.                            ____________________
