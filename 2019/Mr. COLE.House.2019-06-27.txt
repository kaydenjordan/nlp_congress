 Madam Speaker, pursuant to section 426 of the Congressional  Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974, I make a point of order  against consideration of the rule, House Resolution 466.   Section 426 of the Budget Act specifically states that the Rules  Committee may not waive the point of order prescribed in section 425 of  that same act.   House Resolution 466 makes in order a motion ``without intervention  of any point of order.'' Therefore, I make a point of order, pursuant  to section 426 of the Congressional Budget Act, that this rule may not  be considered.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, the bill before us today provides no CBO cost  estimate, so we literally have no idea as to whether or not there are  additional unfunded mandates being imposed on the States. We do know  that the States are already having to use their scarce resources to  deal with this border crisis, and the legislation before us today does  nothing to alleviate that.   Indeed, my colleague from Texas (Mr. Burgess) made that very point  and offered an amendment, which was rejected by the committee, to  consider reimbursing the State of Texas over $800 million for their  expenses. Those same kinds of expenses--probably not to that  magnitude--have been undertaken by other States. Madam Speaker, we  don't think that we should proceed until we have that information and  the House has a chance to consider that.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, actually, on that, we have a great deal in common with  one another. We, too, think we ought to address this matter quickly.   As I am sure my friend recalls, we have tried on 16 different  occasions over the last 8 weeks to bring legislation that would  alleviate this problem to the floor. Our friends rejected that every  single time.   We also have a bill that has been passed by the Senate 84-7: a bill  where 35 Democrats--about three-quarters of the number of Democrats-- supported, a bill that we know would solve, a bill that if we would  bring to this floor we can pass immediately and it would go to the  President's desk; it wouldn't have to go back to the Senate. So my  friends, by not accepting an overwhelmingly bipartisan bill by the  Senate and simply moving it on, are the ones who are actually imposing  a delay here.   What they have got in front of us that we will consider later today,  if they are successful, frankly, is something we know the Senate is  unlikely to accept. I have not heard from the President, but given the  scope of the changes inside the bill, these are all changes that, in  some cases, failed yesterday in the Senate--reductions in spending for  the military and for the Border Patrol--that the administration has  already signaled they will reject.   There is a simple solution here. We could simply take the Senate bill  up that has passed 84-7--overwhelming support on both sides of the  aisle--get that bill down to the President, and the money could start  flowing immediately. If we proceed as my friends want to proceed, we  are simply going to be playing ping-pong back and forth.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I don't doubt my friend's sincerity and compassion and  concern for these young people for one minute. I know him well as a  person and value him as a friend. Although, I must say, this would have  been much nicer 8 weeks ago when the administration first asked for it.   While my friend lays out some of the changes in the House bill, he  neglected to mention that the House bill cuts the administration's  request for reimbursement to the military by $124 million. It cuts the  administration's request for money to the Border Patrol, which is  probably where the most difficult part is, by, I think, $89 million. So  we have substantive disagreements.   Again, we have a bill that has passed overwhelmingly. Many of the  items my friends want to add have already been considered by the Senate  and rejected by the Senate. So it seems to me, when we have a  bipartisan product that has got substantial support on both sides and  that the White House has signaled it would accept, that is the way we  should go.   Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr.  Womack), my good friend and the ranking Republican member of the  Committee on the Budget.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Woodall), my very good friend and distinguished member of  the Rules Committee.    Madam Speaker, I am puzzled as well. I am puzzled why this  wasn't dealt with 8 weeks ago when the administration asked. I am  puzzled why, for 16 times when we tried to bring this matter up on the  floor, our friends in the majority rejected that.   Now we are in a hurry. Well, if we are in a hurry, the way to act is  to take the vehicle that has actually passed the United States Senate  in an overwhelmingly bipartisan fashion and send it to the President of  the United States.   That is not what my friends want to do. They want to prolong the  debate. They have prolonged it for 2 months, for 8 weeks, by not taking  the matter up. They are prolonging it today by not taking what has  already been passed and moving along.   So, obviously, we oppose this rule, and we want to move on. We will  be happy to work with them to move on the Senate legislation. I think  it would pass in an overwhelmingly bipartisan way; the President would  sign it; and that aid would begin flowing. What my friends are  proposing is quite the opposite. It is a prolonged back-and-forth with  the United States Senate.   I have deep respect for the institution, but what is going to come  out of here is going to be partisan; what came out of there is  bipartisan.   What is going to come out of here won't be signed by the President;  what has come out of the United States Senate will be. So if they are  in a hurry to get the money moving, that is the way we should proceed.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, may I inquire as to how much time is  remaining?    Madam Speaker, I am prepared to close and will yield back  the balance of my time at the conclusion of my remarks.    Madam Speaker, we don't think the House bill is a better bill. We  don't think reducing the amount the Senate gave to the military by $124  million is a good idea. We don't think reducing the amount of money  that is going to Border Patrol, which is one of the areas that is a  problem, by $89 million is a good idea. We don't think a lot of this  effort to micromanage a crisis that is thousands of miles away from us  by this body here has good suggestions.   We want some flexibility. We think the Senate bill does take care of  the needs on the border in terms of unaccompanied minors who have  crossed over into our territory. So we just don't think this does it,  and we think this prolongs the process.   We have a bipartisan bill--a perfect bill? No. Is our bill a perfect  bill? No. As a matter of fact, we like the Senate bill on our side  better than this bill. Regardless, that one can pass. That one can pass  on this floor. That one can be signed into law.   This one that my friends are embarking on, they think it is an  improvement. I will just tell them, politically, not passing the  Senate, not likely to be signed by the President.   So if we want to get help there immediately, we have a way to do it  in the Senate bill. We think this leads us to a political dead-end.   Madam Speaker, I would press for my motion, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.

BIGGS, YOUNG, and TIMMONS changed their vote from ``yea'' to  ``nay.''   So the question of consideration was decided in the affirmative.   The result of the vote was announced as above recorded.   A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I want to begin by thanking my good friend, the gentleman from  Massachusetts (Chairman McGovern) for yielding me the customary 30  minutes.   Mr. Speaker, well, we are here for the third time this week and the  second time on a supplemental appropriations bill for the southern  border.   Earlier this week, I spoke on this floor and expressed my concerns  about the House bill. Make no mistake, we need emergency funding for  the crisis on the southern border. We needed it 2 months ago, and we  need it even more desperately today.   Two days ago, I warned that the bill the House was considering would  not pass the Senate and would not become law, and I was proven correct.  The House bill failed in the Senate. In fact, it only received 37 votes  in support. In contrast, the Senate amendment passed in a bipartisan  vote of 84-8.   If the Democratic leadership would allow a vote on the Senate text, I  believe it would pass this Chamber today and be on its way to the  President's desk--today. But, instead, we are here considering a rule  that would further amend the bill, bringing back in provisions that  have already failed to garner support in the Senate.   If this bill fails to pass the Senate, as I expect will happen, then  we will be leaving town for a week without actually having passed  anything to deal with the crisis. And I do remind my friends on the  other side we have attempted on our side, 16 times, to bring up  legislation to deal with this, and the President asked for this money 2  months ago.   So, I am glad they have a sense of urgency now, because we have not  seen it in the past.   My sense is that this is more about maintaining the unity of the  Democratic Caucus than it is about pressing legislation that can be  enacted into law. But that has been true for this entire Congress, and  it is why my friends have, so far, failed to enact any significant  legislation during their tenure in the majority.   Mr. Speaker, we are out of time. We desperately need to get these  emergency funds to the Federal agencies responsible for managing this  crisis. They are out of money and need additional resources to take  care of people, many of them innocent children, who are affected by  this crisis. We do not have the luxury of time in responding to this  emergency.   My friends on the other side of the aisle are about to make the exact  same mistake that they made on Tuesday when they pushed forward a  partisan bill that would not pass the Senate and that the President  would not sign into law.   What I don't understand, Mr. Speaker, is why the majority is so  resistant to acting in a bipartisan manner here. Both Republicans and  Democrats agree that we need additional funding to address the crisis  on the southern border. There is a real chance to send a bipartisan  bill to the President that will become law. And, instead of doing what  will immediately help children and families at the border, the majority  is attempting to cut the needed funding from the Senate bill, add  partisan riders back into it, and then send it back to the Senate,  where it can fail again.   Madam Speaker, we do not have time to waste on purely political  exercises. There is still an opportunity to correct that mistake, Madam  Speaker, and I would urge the majority to take that opportunity  seriously.

Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from the great  State of Maryland (Mr. Harris), my very good friend, for the purpose of  a unanimous consent request.    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from the great  State of Ohio (Mr. Gibbs), my very good friend, for the purpose of a  unanimous consent request.    Madam Speaker, I yield to the distinguished gentleman from  the great State of Illinois (Mr. Rodney Davis), my very good friend,  for the purpose of a unanimous consent request.    Madam Speaker, I yield to the distinguished gentleman from  the great State of West Virginia (Mr. Mooney), my very good friend, for  the purpose of a unanimous consent request.    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from the great  State of Alabama (Mr. Byrne), my very good friend, for the purpose of a  unanimous consent request.    Madam Speaker, I yield to the distinguished gentleman from  the great State of Ohio (Mr. Wenstrup), my very good friend, for the  purpose of a unanimous consent request.

Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from the great  State of Louisiana (Mr. Johnson), my very good  [[Page H5235]]  friend, for the purpose of a unanimous consent request.    Madam Speaker, I yield to the distinguished gentleman from  North Dakota (Mr. Armstrong), my very good friend, for the purpose of a  unanimous consent request.    Madam Speaker, I think you will be delighted to hear that I  yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from the great State of Michigan (Mr.  Mitchell).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, if we defeat the previous question, I will offer an  amendment to the rule to simply concur in the Senate amendment without  further amendment. This will immediately send the bill to the President  and deliver the necessary resources needed to respond to this  humanitarian crisis.   Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately  prior to the vote on the previous question.    Madam Speaker, let me just say again, we can solve this  problem now.   I respect that my friends have strong feelings about their  legislation. We all do. The reality is that that legislation is not  going to get through the Senate; it is not going to be signed by the  President.   We have a vehicle that has already gotten through the Senate, that 75  percent of the Democrats in the Chamber voted for, including the entire  Democratic leadership, and that could go, if this House would act on  it, straight to the President's desk and be signed into law.   Now, my friends are, I know, concerned about resources. And, again,  it is nice that they are. It would have been nice if, in the 18  previous times we have tried to bring this matter up before the House,  they would have helped. It would have been nice if, 2 months ago, we  had actually seen them respond.   We share their concern for these young people. That is why we asked  for extra resources. The administration asked for extra resources 58  days ago. So I think, again, this ought to be pretty easy to resolve  here.   My friends, with all due respect, have a partisan bill that will pass  along partisan lines in this House, that will not be enacted by the  Senate, and that will not be signed by the President.   The Senate has a bill they have already passed in a bipartisan  fashion. It, frankly, has more money to help the people who are being  paid overtime in the Border Patrol to--                   Announcement by the Speaker Pro Tempore     Madam Speaker, I want to thank the Speaker personally for  taking control of a difficult situation.   So, Madam Speaker, just to resume my point, we have a vehicle. It  could literally pass on this floor in less than an hour. It could head  to the President. It satisfies almost all--not all, but almost all--of  my friends' concerns. I would just ask them, in all seriousness, to  just consider political reality here and let's get this done and get  these resources to where they are needed. We can do that. We can do it  in a bipartisan fashion.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished  gentlewoman from Arizona (Mrs. Lesko), my very good friend and  distinguished member of the Rules Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman from Arizona an  additional 30 seconds.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I know my friends are aware of this, but the Senate bill is  actually--well, I certainly would vote for it. I think it would have  overwhelming support on our side. The President, in the past, has  expressed some concerns, and that is an important thing, but the Senate  has really worked through a lot of these differences.   The bill that we would like to see put on this floor and that we know  would pass with overwhelming, bipartisan support is a product of  compromise, so much compromise that the entire Democratic leadership  felt comfortable voting for it.   With all due respect to my friends, their bill is not the product of  compromise. It is not going to get very many Republican votes here, if  any. I would be surprised, frankly, if it did. It is not going to get  accepted by the United States Senate. It absolutely won't be signed by  the President of the United States.   We are all concerned about the conditions. We have been expressing  that concern for 8 weeks. We never called this a manufactured crisis.  We never said that this was made up for political purposes. The  administration recognized it 8 weeks ago.   We have tried multiple times to get this House to focus on it. I am  very pleased that we finally reached a point that both sides are  focusing on it. But we also ought to focus on what is possible to  achieve in a limited timeframe.   We know we are running out of money. We know there are real-life  consequences to that. They are starting to unfold right now. There are  services being cut back. For a lot of these conditions, frankly, we  ought to look in the mirror, as Congress, and ask why we didn't get  these resources there a long time ago.   Frankly, the House rule that we are discussing on the House bill,  that bill actually reduces resources at the border. It doesn't expand  them. It reduces them. It reduces them also for the American military.  That is part of it.   The Senate bill, in my view, frankly, is much superior to my friends'  product, but it has one virtue above all: All we have to do is put it  on the floor and pass it, and it goes to the President of the United  States to be signed immediately. Resources begin to move to where they  are desperately needed immediately.   That is not true with my friends' bill. All it does is reopen the  dialogue with the Senate, where it has very little prospect of passing.  Then, frankly, if it did pass--not likely--it would be vetoed.   I am befuddled, Madam Speaker, that they are pursuing a goal that  they know will not work, but we have seen this time and time again. It  is more important to get a bill across the floor in a partisan fashion  than it is to put something on the floor that is bipartisan, that can  pass the Senate and come into law.   Now, my friends know we live in an era of divided government, and we  have wasted 6 months, in my view, dealing with a lot of things that we  knew would never pass. But I respect my friends' right to bring their  agenda to the floor.   This is different. This is a national emergency. It has to pass. We  have one vehicle where it can be passed and be signed so that help can  go immediately. We have my friends' vehicle, which I know they believe  in passionately, and I respect that, but it can't pass.   It is pretty simple. Sooner or later, I hope we get to the obvious  answer and pass the Senate bill and send it to the President.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I will just make the same point I have been making for days on end.  We have something that can pass versus something that can't. I don't  doubt for a minute that my friends are sincere in their concerns, but I  also respect my colleagues on the other side of the rotunda in the  United States Senate. I think they are sincere, too.   They have worked through and found a way to get something that got 84  votes. Three-quarters of the Democratic minority in the Senate voted  for it. The entire Democratic leadership voted for it. The President  has signaled that he will sign it.   We can continue the debates on some of these other things at a later  point. My friends might want to come back with another piece of  legislation addressing some of their concerns that they think are not  appropriately addressed in the Senate bill. But the reality is that is  the bill that can pass. The bill that they want to bring to this floor  cannot.   We all agree there is a crisis. We all agree we need resources there.  I think my friends know, if they would just put the Senate bill on the  floor, it could pass, and it would go to the President.   We can continue to have this debate. We can even end it, launch some  vehicle over to the Senate, and waste more time. That is all it will  be, a waste of time.   I would hope we have all had our say. We all feel strongly about our  points, but let's agree on the one thing we know can pass and the  President would sign, which would get us resources and relief  immediately on the border where we desperately need it.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I personally thank my good friend, the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms.  Jackson Lee), for the professional and very patient manner in which she  handled the Chair and presided over this body. I wanted to recognize  that.   Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from  New York (Mr. Katko), my very good friend.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Stivers), who is my good friend.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, in closing, I urge opposition to this rule. Once  again, the majority is making the exact same mistake it made earlier  this week. We have a bipartisan bill already approved by the Senate.  The House should simply take it up and work its will on that bill.   Frankly, we all know, if that bill were allowed to come to the floor,  it would pass overwhelmingly with a majority of each side voting in  favor of it. Then it wouldn't have to go back to the Senate. It would  go immediately to the President of the United States. He could sign it,  and these resources would begin to flow.   Now, again, we have had a robust debate today, and I respect the  passions on both sides and every point of view about this. Actually, I  see a great deal of common agreement. We agree, which we did not 8  weeks ago, that there is an emergency on the southern border. We agree  it is a humanitarian crisis. We agree there need to be resources that  go there immediately. We agree that time is short.   We are also all elected officials who are privileged to be in this  Chamber, and my experience with my friends on both sides of the aisle  is that they are basically pretty practical people. They came here to  solve problems. They have different viewpoints, but they are almost  always very practical and try to get something done.   We know the Senate bill is not everything that my side would want. We  certainly know it is not everything that my friend's side would want.  But we know it is bipartisan. We know three-quarters of the Democrats  in the other Chamber voted for it. We know it will pass.   With all due respect to my friends, they have clung so tightly to  their bill, which I know they believe in. It will pass here, but it  won't pass the Senate, and it certainly won't be signed by the  President.   Where will we be if we continue down the road that they are laying  out in front of us?   I know they are sincerely concerned about children on the border, but  we are better off with a bill that passes so we have billions of  dollars moving to where they are supposed to go, and a bill, by the  way, that the entire Democratic leadership thought was appropriate and  good enough.   Let's not sit here and make the perfect the enemy of the good. Let's  be practical and deliver to the American people what they want, which  is a solution, a solution that both parties will vote for and a  solution that the President will sign.   How many times do we go home and hear that from our own constituents:  Can't you guys get together and do anything? Can't you work together?  Can't you put aside your differences and put the American people first?   It pains me as a House Member to admit it, I suppose, but the United  States Senate did that in this case before we did. We can accept that  and move on, and my friends can continue to fight for the things they  believe. It is not as if, for these things that are in this bill that  the administration won't accept, they can't wrap them up again and put  them back in another bill and start the process.   If we do not act, the resources will not get to the border where they  are needed, and these conditions that concern us all will continue.   I urge us to step back a little bit, accept that in this case the  Senate has a bipartisan solution that will work, and for goodness'  sake, just put it on the floor to see what happens.   We know what will happen. My friends will vote for it in overwhelming  numbers. My friends on my side of the aisle will vote for it in  overwhelming numbers. It will go straight to the President of the  United States.   That isn't going to solve the problem, but it is going to ease the  problem, and that is going to move us in the right direction and  provide our very hard-pressed people--who are working this problem by  caring for the migrants, trying to protect our borders, and trying to  provide justice--the resources they need to continue to work on this  problem while, frankly, we continue to try to arrive at a legislative  solution.   Madam Speaker, I want to end with a point I made just a little bit  earlier. I thank the Chair for the patient and professional manner in  which she has allowed us to conduct this debate. I thank her very much  for making sure that when we had an outside disturbance, it was quickly  dealt with.   I urge my friends to reconsider and, hopefully, come together around  a bill that neither of us thinks is perfect but both of us could  probably vote for and the President could sign.    Madam Speaker, I thank my good friend, the chairman of the Rules  Committee, for his participation in debate. It is always helpful and  always enlightening. He is a good friend and a person I admire a great  deal, even when we differ on a particular issue.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I want to begin by thanking my friend. I think this is a wise  decision. I know it was a difficult decision, but I think it is the  right thing because I know we have a common objective here.   We know we need resources at the border right away. We know, by the  action my friend is taking, we now have the possibility of making that  happen and doing it in a very bipartisan way; that is, taking a bill  that passed the Senate 87-8, moving it here with a very substantial  bipartisan majority, and, frankly, getting resources to exactly where I  know my friend and his colleagues want them to go, which is to help  folks at the border deal with this ever-mounting crisis.   Mr. Speaker, I urge that we accept the amendment. I thank my friend.  I thank our friends on the other side for making what I know is a tough  but, I think, a very wise decision. I think the country will be better  off for it.   I appreciate the fact that we will pass this legislation in a  bipartisan manner. As the Senate did, we will here. The President will  sign it, and the resources that we all want to arrive and help  alleviate the difficult situation at the border will start moving  immediately.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend, and I yield back the balance of my  time.
