 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of Mr.  Clyburn's resolution condemning white supremacy and white nationalism.   Congressman   Steve King's recent comments asserting that terms like  ``white supremacist'' should be acceptable have rightly drawn strong  condemnation from both sides of the aisle in this Chamber. Sadly, these  comments are part of a well-documented history of embracing the far  right and making racist and anti-immigrant remarks for more than a  decade.   As all of us know, more and more people are feeling emboldened today  to publicly voice bigoted and evil views like these. We have seen it in  discussions around Charlottesville, the current debate on immigration,  and in criticism of football players silently and peacefully protesting  police brutality.   These views are contrary to our country's founding values of fairness  and equality. America was founded on the simple but powerful idea that  all are created equal and are worthy of dignity and respect.   White nationalism and white supremacy are a vile assault on that  magnificent ideal. These views belong on the ash heap of history. That  is exactly where this resolution will put them.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes.''
