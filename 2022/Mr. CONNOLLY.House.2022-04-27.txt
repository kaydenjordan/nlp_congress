TITLE III--DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS       SEC. 301. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS.         The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H.R. 923, as amended.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today as the author of the Georgia Support Act  and as co-chair of the Congressional Georgia Caucus to express my  support for this legislation, which we introduced with my Republican  colleague and Georgia Caucus co-chair, Mr. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois.   Mr. Speaker, this legislation has twice passed the House with broad  bipartisan support. This bipartisan effort enhances the U.S.-Georgia  relationship on several fronts by bolstering security assistance,  promoting democratic governance reforms, enhancing cooperation to fight  Russian disinformation, and strengthening economic ties.   Mr. Speaker, it is appropriate, as Russia continues its tragic and  horrific invasion of sovereign Ukrainian territory, that we reflect on  2008 and the invasion by Russia and continued occupation of sovereign  Georgian territory in Abkhazia and South Ossetia.   To this day, Russian troops committing abhorrent violations of human  rights, international humanitarian law, and war crimes in sovereign  Ukrainian territory are the same troops that have fomented unrest,  aided separatist movements, and committed clear and evident violations  of human rights for the past 14 years in the Russian-occupied parts of  Georgia.   This bill directs the United States Government to enforce targeted  sanctions on malign actors committing these violations in Russian- occupied territory.   The Georgia Support Act also requires the administration to examine  how best we can utilize the $35 million or more of United States aid  that we provide Georgia in security assistance every year and  reinforces U.S. policy to never recognize Russian sovereignty over  Georgia territory.   As the number one per capita contributor of forces in Afghanistan,  Georgia has demonstrated its dedication to security cooperation with  the West. The United States must continue to reciprocate by helping  Georgia develop the capacity to defend itself against further incursion  of Russian forces.   Mr. Speaker, attacks on Georgian sovereignty have not been simply  through the occupation of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, as bad as that  is. This bill directs the administration to enhance cooperation with  our Georgian partners to help them defend themselves from the various  cyberattacks and disinformation and propaganda campaigns Russia has  launched with the goal of undermining the sovereignty and democratic  institutions of the Country of Georgia.   Mr. Speaker, I traveled to Tbilisi numerous times, both with the NATO  Parliamentary Assembly, of which I am President, and with the House  Democracy Partnership to meet with government officials, civil society,  and the Georgian people.   I am pleased that this iteration of the Georgia Support Act seeks to  buttress Georgian democratic institutions through U.S. democracy and  governance programs that promote Georgian judicial independence,  electoral reforms, freedom of the press, and accountability for attacks  on independent media and Tbilisi Pride activists in 2021.   This legislation provides an opportunity for the United States to  express its robust, bipartisan support for Georgia's sovereignty,  continued democratic and economic development, and security against  renewed Russian aggression.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the Georgia Support Act,  and I reserve the balance of my time.                                           House of Representatives,                                      Committee on the Judiciary,                                     Washington, DC, April 21, 2022.      Hon.

I further acknowledge that       the inaction of your Committee with respect to the bill does       not waive any future jurisdictional claim over the matters       contained in the bill that fall within your jurisdiction. I       also acknowledge that your Committee will be appropriately       consulted and involved as this or similar legislation moves       forward, and will support the appointment of Committee on the       Judiciary conferees during any House-Senate conference       convened on this legislation.        Lastly, I will ensure that our exchange of letters is       included in the Congressional Record during floor       consideration of the bill. Thank you again for your       cooperation regarding the legislation. I look forward to       continuing to work with you as the measure moves through the       legislative process.

Hon. Richard Neal,      Committee on Ways and Means, House of Representatives,           Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Neal: I am writing to you concerning H.R.       923, Georgia Support Act, as amended. I appreciate your       willingness to work cooperatively on this legislation.        I acknowledge that provisions of the bill fall within the       jurisdiction of the Committee on Ways and Means under House       Rule X, and that your Committee will forgo action on H.R. 923       to expedite floor consideration. I further acknowledge that       the inaction of your Committee with respect to the bill does       not waive any future jurisdictional claim over the matters       contained in the bill that fall within your jurisdiction. I       also acknowledge that your Committee will be appropriately       consulted and involved as this or similar legislation moves       forward, and will support the appointment of Committee on       Ways and Means conferees during any House-Senate conference       convened on this legislation.        Lastly, I will ensure that our exchange of letters is       included in the Congressional Record during floor       consideration of the bill. Thank you again for your       cooperation regarding the legislation. I look forward to       continuing to work with you as the measure moves through the       legislative process.            Sincerely,                                                  Gregory W. Meeks,      Chairman.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                     Committee on Ways and Means,                                     Washington, DC, April 25, 2022.      Hon. Gregory Meeks,      Chairman, Committee on Foreign Affairs      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Meeks: In recognition of the desire to       expedite consideration of H.R. 923, Georgia Support Act, the       Committee on Ways and Means agrees to waive formal       consideration of the bill as to provisions that fall within       the rule X jurisdiction of the Committee on Ways and Means.        The Committee on Ways and Means takes this action with the       mutual understanding that we do not waive any jurisdiction       over the subject matter contained in this or similar       legislation, and the Committee will be appropriately       consulted and involved as the bill or similar legislation       moves forward so that we may address any remaining issues       within our jurisdiction. The Committee also reserves the       right to seek appointment of an appropriate number of       conferees to any House-Senate conference involving this or       similar legislation.        Finally, I would appreciate your response to this letter       confirming this understanding, and would ask that a copy of       our exchange of letter on this matter be included in the       Congressional Record during floor consideration of H.R. 923.            Sincerely,                                                   Richard E. Neal,                                                          Chairman.     Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I thank my friend for his support. And I think it is very important  that there be a clarion statement from this Congress, not only about  Ukraine, but about other nations that are threatened by Russian  aggression; Georgia and Moldova are two of the most prominent.   It is critical that the Congress speak with one voice to those  nations, to those peoples, and to Vladimir Putin and Russia, should he  have further designs on either of those two countries.   So I think this is an important piece of legislation. I urge its  passage, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to  the resolution (H. Res. 833) expressing support for Moldova's  democracy, independence, and territorial integrity and strengthening  United States and Moldova relations, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the resolution.   The text of the resolution is as follows:                                H. Res. 833         Whereas the Republic of Moldova gained independence from       the Soviet Union in 1991;        Whereas the United States established diplomatic relations       with Moldova on February 18, 1992, and the 2 countries have       since enjoyed expanded and positive relations;        Whereas United States assistance to Moldova and the       Strategic Dialogue between the United States and Moldova,       which was launched on March 3, 2014, has strengthened the       relationship between the 2 countries and focused on advancing       shared interests in democracy, good governance, rule of law,       anticorruption, energy independence, economic development,       and security cooperation;        Whereas Congress and State and local communities have a       history of engaging with Moldovan young leaders, civil       society, and Members of Parliament through official       exchanges;        Whereas Moldova ratified an association agreement       containing comprehensive free trade provisions with the       European Union in 2014 and the agreement became fully       effective in July 2016;        Whereas Moldova's main trading partner is the European       Union;        Whereas Moldova is a member of the European Union's Eastern       Partnership;        Whereas since the Russian Federation's unprovoked full-      scale invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022, Moldova has       opened its border to refugees fleeing Ukraine;        Whereas, on March 3, 2022, Moldova submitted an application       to become a member of the European Union;        Whereas the Moldovan 2020 Presidential and 2021       parliamentary elections resulted in a government with a       mandate to fight corruption, reinvigorate economic reforms,       enhance judicial independence, revitalize European       integration efforts, and strengthen relations with the United       States;        Whereas, in November 2020, Moldova elected its first female       President, Maia Sandu, and since August 6, 2021, women serve       as both Moldova's head of state and head of government;        Whereas according to the Organization for Security and       Cooperation in Europe's Office for Democratic Institutions       and Human Rights, the most recent elections were ``well       administered, competitive and fundamental freedoms were       largely respected'';        Whereas in a judgment in 2004, the European Court of Human       Rights found that Moldova's separatist region of Transnistria       was created with the support of the Government of the Russian       Federation and considered it ``under the effective authority       or at least decisive influence'' of the Kremlin;        Whereas the United States supports the sovereignty and       territorial integrity of Moldova and on that basis       participates as an observer in the ``5+2'' negotiations to       find a comprehensive settlement that will provide a special       status for Transnistria within Moldova's internationally       recognized borders;        Whereas the Government of the Russian Federation maintains       a contingent of military forces and a stockpile of military       equipment and ammunition within the Transnistrian region       constituting an occupation of Moldovan territory and a       violation of Moldova's territorial sovereignty;        Whereas the Council of Europe, the Organization for       Security and Co-operation in Europe Mission to Moldova, and       the Government of Moldova have called upon the Kremlin to       remove its troops from the territory of Moldova;        Whereas, in July 2017, the Moldovan Parliament adopted a       declaration calling on the Kremlin to withdraw its troops       from Moldova;        Whereas, on September 22, 2021, Moldovan President Maia       Sandu addressed the United Nations General Assembly and       called for the Kremlin to withdraw its troops from the       Transnistrian region;        Whereas Moldova has been a valued and reliable partner in       promoting global security  [[Page H4537]]       by participating in United Nations peacekeeping missions in       the Central African Republic, Kosovo, and South Sudan,       supporting United States efforts to increase international       cooperation in combating terrorism, and providing demining       units and postconflict humanitarian assistance in Iraq;        Whereas, since 1996, Moldova's Armed Forces have       participated in the United States National Guard State       Partnership Program as a partner to the North Carolina       National Guard, which led to the creation of the Moldova-      North Carolina Bilateral Partnership, which has facilitated       cooperation in the areas of civil emergency operations,       expansion of markets, coordination of humanitarian efforts       and cultural, scientific, and academic exchanges;        Whereas Moldova cooperates with the North Atlantic Treaty       Organization through the Partnership for Peace program,       including participation in the Defense and Related Security       Capacity Building Initiative, a flagship defense reform       partnership focused on reforming and modernizing Moldova's       Armed Forces to improve expertise, interoperability, and       peacekeeping capabilities; and        Whereas, on September 21, 2021, President Biden addressed       the 76th United Nations General Assembly stating that the       democratic world ``lives in the proud Moldovans who helped       deliver a landslide victory for the forces of democracy, with       a mandate to fight graft, to build a more inclusive       economy'': Now, therefore, be it        Resolved, That the House of Representatives--        (1) urges the United States Government, European Union, and       other transatlantic partners to increase cooperation,       coordination, and support for the Republic of Moldova's       democratic development, economic and energy independence, and       efforts to root out corruption;        (2) reaffirms that it is the policy of the United States to       support the sovereignty, independence, and territorial       integrity of Moldova and the inviolability of its borders;        (3) affirms Moldova's sovereign right to determine its own       partnerships free of external coercion and pressure, and       affirms Moldova's right to associate with the European Union       or any regional organization;        (4) encourages increased activity related to the Strategic       Dialogue as a means to strengthen relations between Moldova       and the United States;        (5) supports the Joint Commercial Commission between the       United States and Moldova to strengthen the bilateral trade       and investment relationship between the 2 nations and improve       Moldova's investment climate;        (6) encourages the United States Government to engage at a       leadership level to enhance United States partnerships with       the Government of Moldova and civil society organizations;        (7) encourages the Secretary of State, the Administrator of       the United States Agency for International Development, the       Chief Executive Officer of the Development Finance       Corporation, the Secretary of Energy, and the United States       Trade Representative to increase and focus assistance on       justice sector reform, strengthening democratic institutions,       promoting an open and transparent government, fostering       indigenous independent media and an open information       environment, increasing domestic energy development,       diversification of energy supplies and energy efficiency,       improving transport and communication infrastructure, as well       as the promotion of trade and investment opportunities, along       with inclusive economic growth focusing on the rural areas       beyond the capital;        (8) commends Moldova's efforts to take in Ukrainian       refugees and urges increased assistance by the United States,       European Union, and other allies and partners to Moldova to       assist with those efforts;        (9) reaffirms the importance of free, fair, and transparent       elections in Moldova;        (10) urges the Secretary of State, the Administrator of the       United States Agency for International Development, the Chief       Executive Officer of the United States Agency for Global       Media, and other heads of Federal departments and agencies to       continue to work with the Government of Moldova and Moldovan       civil society to strengthen independent media and combat       Russian disinformation and propaganda;        (11) calls upon the Government of the Russian Federation to       fulfill its commitments made at the Organization for Security       and Co-operation in Europe's Istanbul summit in 1999, and to       withdraw its military forces and munitions from within the       internationally recognized territory of Moldova;        (12) calls upon the Government of the Russian Federation to       refrain from military and economic threats to Moldova and       cease any and all actions that support the so-called       ``authorities'' in the separatist region of Transnistria;        (13) supports a results-oriented 5+2 process as a       constructive format for resolving the Transnistria conflict       through a comprehensive settlement that secures Moldova's       sovereignty and territorial integrity; and        (14) affirms that lasting stability and security in Moldova       is in the strategic interest of the United States and that       these can only be achieved if the territorial integrity and       sovereignty of Moldova and all European countries are       respected.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H. Res. 833, as amended.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise today in support of H. Res. 833, which clearly champions  Moldova's push toward democracy and our common work in strengthening  our bilateral ties.   I first thank my colleague, Representative Price of North Carolina,  for drafting this important measure and his years of work on the House  Democracy Partnership.   Moldova, a small country in Europe, nested between Ukraine and  Romania, rightfully deserves our attention today. After centuries of  being fought over and by larger neighboring powers, the country is  making strides toward democracy, combating deep-seated corruption, and  moving closer to the Euro-Atlantic community.   With the Russian invasion in Ukraine, the stakes are now so much  greater. Indeed, more than 400,000 Ukrainian refugees have arrived in  tiny Moldova since February, a number that represents more than 10  percent of Moldova's own population.   Furthermore, Moldova is no stranger to malign Russian influence and  interference. Transnistria, a Kremlin-backed breakaway region in  Moldova's east, is an area of active risk. Moscow uses this wound to  manipulate fears and politics in Moldova. We are reminded of that  constant potential with the explosion in the region earlier this week  and the constant dangerous rhetoric from the so-called authorities  there.   Thankfully, despite these challenges, the Moldovan Government is in a  position to tackle them and advance an agenda to modernize and  democratize its society and its economy.   President Maia Sandu and the parliament in Moldova are ambitiously  fighting corruption and implementing needed reforms, all while  strengthening relations with the European Union and with the United  States.   The Moldovan people's good work to build a stronger democracy is  admirable and deserves our full support, especially today; and passing  this resolution, coupled with the Biden administration's highlighting  of Moldova's progress during the Summit for Democracy, sends a strong  signal that the entire United States Government stands with them.   This resolution looks to build on the momentum in this decisive  moment from Moldova, ensuring that the progress is meaningful and  sustainable. I support this resolution, and I urge all of my colleagues  to do the same.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                           House of Representatives,                                    Committee on Foreign Affairs,                                     Washington, DC, April 22, 2022.      Hon. Richard Neal,      Committee on Ways and Means,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Neal: I am writing to you concerning H. Res.       833, Expressing support for Moldova's democracy,       independence, and territorial integrity and strengthening       United States and Moldova relation, as amended. I appreciate       your willingness to work cooperatively on this legislation.        I acknowledge that provisions of the bill fall within the       jurisdiction of the Committee on Ways and Means under House       Rule X, and that your Committee will forgo action on H. Res.       833 to expedite floor consideration. I further acknowledge       that the inaction of your Committee with respect to the bill       does not waive any future jurisdictional claim over the       matters contained in the bill that fall within your       jurisdiction. I also acknowledge that your Committee will be       appropriately consulted and involved as this or similar       legislation moves forward, and will support the appointment       of Committee on Ways and Means conferees during any House-      Senate conference convened on this legislation.        Lastly, I will ensure that our exchange of letters is       included in the Congressional Record during floor       consideration of the bill. Thank you again for your       cooperation regarding the legislation. I look forward to  [[Page H4538]]       continuing to work with you as the measure moves through the       legislative process.            Sincerely,                                                  Gregory W. Meeks,      Chairman.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                     Committee on Ways and Means,                                     Washington, DC, April 25, 2022.      Hon. Gregory Meeks,      Chairman, Committee on Foreign Affairs,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Meeks: In recognition of the desire to       expedite consideration of H. Res. 833, Expressing support for       Moldova's democracy, independence, and territorial integrity       and strengthening United States and Moldova relations, the       Committee on Ways and Means agrees to waive formal       consideration of the bill as to provisions that fall within       the rule X jurisdiction of the Committee on Ways and Means.        The Committee on Ways and Means takes this action with the       mutual understanding that we do not waive any jurisdiction       over the subject matter contained in this or similar       legislation, and the Committee will be appropriately       consulted and involved as the bill or similar legislation       moves forward so that we may address any remaining issues       within our jurisdiction. The Committee also reserves the       right to seek appointment of an appropriate number of       conferees to any House-Senate conference involving this or       similar legislation.        Finally, I would appreciate your response to this letter       confirming this understanding, and would ask that a copy of       our exchange of letter on this matter be included in the       Congressional Record during floor consideration of H. Res.       833.            Sincerely,                                                   Richard E. Neal,                                                          Chairman.     Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, again, I thank my friend for his bipartisan leadership  and his support for this important piece of legislation.   Again, combined with the Georgia Support Act, this resolution sends a  clear message from this body, on a bipartisan basis, that we will not  tolerate Russian aggression in Europe in 2022.   Combined with our solidarity in opposition to the tragedy unfolding  in Ukraine, it is a powerful message, backed up with, of course,  support by our government, and the bipartisan nature of this is just so  critical.   The people of Moldova, and the people of Georgia, and the people of  Ukraine, they are watching and they are listening, as we hope is  Vladimir Putin and his cronies in Moscow.   I urge support for this resolution, and I yield back the balance of  my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 3344) to prioritize the efforts of and enhance coordination  among United States agencies to encourage countries in Central and  Eastern Europe to improve the security of their telecommunications  networks, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 3344         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Transatlantic       Telecommunications Security Act''.       SEC. 2. SENSE OF CONGRESS; STATEMENT OF POLICY.         (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--        (1) fifth and future generation's telecommunication       networks in allied and partner countries based on common,       secure, transparent, democratic standards have the potential       to increase cultural, political, and economic exchanges       leading to mutual job creation, closer citizen relations, and       stronger democratic institutions;        (2) Russia's unprovoked, unjustified, and illegal invasion       of Ukraine and the People's Republic of China's tacit support       for Russian Federation's actions demonstrate the importance       of secure telecommunication infrastructure in Central and       Eastern European nations;        (3) the United States has national security and economic       interests in assisting Central and Eastern European countries       to improve the security of their telecommunication networks       by reducing dependence on covered telecommunication equipment       or services that are often offered with predatory economic       inducements and replacing them with secure telecommunication       equipment or services;        (4) China's Belt and Road Initiative and the 17+1       Initiative seek to undermine Central and Eastern Europe's       infrastructure resilience and sovereignty through predatory       inducements from state-linked providers of telecommunication       equipment or services such as Huawei Technologies Company and       ZTE Corporation;        (5) China's 2017 National Intelligence Law obligates       Chinese businesses to fully cooperate with state intelligence       work, and thereby compromises the integrity of any network       that utilizes equipment from Chinese companies because       providers could be forced to hand over sensitive data or shut       down networks at the command of China;        (6) Russia's campaign to elect a Russian national, who is a       former Huawei Technologies Company executive, to serve as the       Secretary-General of the International Telecommunication       Union (ITU) is indicative of China and Russia's efforts to       use international organizations to promote their interests       and their malign influence;        (7) at global fora such as the ITU, the United States       Government should actively support candidates that espouse       democratic values, internet freedoms, and secure       telecommunication networks;        (8) the United States International Development Finance       Corporation's development priorities, as described in section       1412 of the Better Utilization of Investments Leading to       Development Act of 2018, properly includes a focus on less       developed countries;        (9) the United States should assemble a coalition of       democratic and like-minded allies and partners to counter the       rise of global malign actors such as China and Russia and       build resilience in Central and Eastern Europe against malign       influences; and        (10) in order to ensure robust military coordination and       interoperability with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization       (NATO) and transatlantic allies and partners, the United       States should ensure that allies and  [[Page H4539]]       partners' telecommunication networks are secure and free from       potential threats in accordance with the 2019 NATO London       Declaration.        (b) Statement of Policy.--It is the policy of the United       States--        (1) to strengthen the transatlantic alliance based on       shared values in the face of rising malign influence from the       People's Republic of China and the Russian Federation,       countries that seek to undermine democratic institutions and       values;        (2) to encourage public and private sector investment in       European telecommunication infrastructure projects to ensure       secure telecommunication and to catalyze economic advancement       through the highest standards of transparency, accessibility,       and competition;        (3) to provide economically feasible alternatives to       financing from providers of covered telecommunication       equipment or services;        (4) to engage in diplomacy with European allies and       partners to strengthen the United States and European private       sector efforts to develop common telecommunication technology       and industry standards, and in turn promote them globally;        (5) to support the Three Seas Initiative organized by 12       Central and Eastern European countries of the European Union       to increase infrastructure resiliency and reduce reliance on       malign actors, including in the telecommunication space;        (6) to enhance telecommunication security and freedom       around the globe by engaging in elections at the ITU and       promoting the candidacies of individuals that will promote       democratic values, the rule of law, technological freedoms,       and telecommunication security;        (7) to support the people of Ukraine, Moldova, Georgia, and       the Western Balkan countries in their desire for integration       into Euro-Atlantic institutions and economies through       enhanced cross-border telecommunication infrastructure       connectivity; and        (8) to ensure that frontline NATO allies have       telecommunication services that cannot be controlled by China       or Russia, especially considering Russia's illegal and       unjustifiable invasion of Ukraine.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H.R. 3344, as amended.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3344, as amended, the  Transatlantic Telecommunications Security Act.   Let me start by thanking Representative Marcy Kaptur of Ohio, the  chairwoman of the Ukraine Caucus here in Congress. She has been an  incredible leader and a very important voice for Ukraine, not just  these past 2 months, but for decades as a Member of Congress. This bill  is part and parcel of her many efforts to aid the people of Ukraine and  Eastern Europe.   I emphasize a key point throughout my remarks today:  Telecommunication security is a central pillar of national security.   If a hostile power has the ability to shut down a country's access to  the internet, then both telecommunications and national security have,  in fact, been breached.   If a strategic competitor can disable telecoms gear or cut an  underseas cable to turn off a country's mobile network, then both  telecommunications and national security have, in fact, been breached.   And if foreign rivals can snoop on a country's calls and steal  classified information because they can access the network, then both  telecommunications and national security have, in fact, been breached.   The lesson is clear: The United States and its allies cannot rely on  telecoms gear produced and supplied by countries and companies close to  the People's Republic of China government or the Putin regime in  Moscow. This is especially true in Eastern Europe, as President Putin  has decided to act on violent imperial hubris rather than respect the  law of nations.   If the problem is PRC-affiliated technology and Russian aggression,  then the Transatlantic Telecommunications Security Act is a key part in  the solution to bolster our national security and that of our friends  and allies.   First and foremost, the bill allows the Development Finance  Corporation to fund telecom security projects to ensure that all  network gear in Eastern Europe is safe. As Ukraine faces the immediate  threat to its national security, projects in the region must and will  receive priority assistance.   Second, this bill authorizes the State Department to create a new  position of campaign coordinator at the Department to focus on upcoming  elections in the U.N. body called the International Telecommunications  Union. That election comprises of an American with significant  experience with the ITU and a Russian who previously worked for the  Chinese company, Huawei. What could go wrong with that?   This is an election the free world can ill afford to lose, and we  must do everything in our power to ensure corrupt actors are kept from  its power. This includes a whole-of-government response, such as the  State Department working with Commerce and the FCC, as well as the  Foreign Affairs Committee teaming up with our good friends on the  Energy and Commerce Committee to make sure the ITU promotes free and  secure telecom systems around the globe.                                time  1400    The TTSA is a critical bill that would deliver tangible security  benefits for Ukraine and frontline NATO allies. We can, should, and  must get this bill to the President's desk quickly.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to make that reality one  step closer by voting for this legislation today.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, again, I thank my friend for his  leadership and bipartisanship on this critical piece of legislation. I  think it is timely. I think it is urgent. I urge my colleagues to  support the legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 7311) to direct the Secretary of State to develop and submit  to Congress a strategy and implementation plan outlining United States  efforts to counter the malign influence and activities of the Russian  Federation and its proxies in Africa, and for other purposes, as  amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 7311         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Countering Malign Russian       Activities in Africa Act''.       SEC. 2. SENSE OF CONGRESS.         It is the sense of Congress that the United States--        (1) should regularly assess the scale and scope of the       Russian Federation's influence and activities in Africa that       undermine United States objectives and interests; and        (2) determine how--        (A) to address and counter such influence and activities       effectively, including through appropriate United States       foreign assistance programs; and        (B) to hold accountable the Russian Federation and African       governments and their officials who are complicit in aiding       such malign influence and activities.       SEC. 3. STRATEGY AND IMPLEMENTATION PLAN; REPORT.

(3) Form.--The report required by paragraph (1) shall be       submitted in unclassified form but may include a classified       annex.       SEC. 4. APPROPRIATE CONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEES DEFINED.         In this Act, the term ``appropriate congressional       committees'' means--        (1) the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the House of       Representatives; and        (2) the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 7311, as amended.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 7311, the Countering  Malign Russian Activities in Africa Act, as amended, introduced by  Representative   Gregory Meeks, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs  Committee.   As Putin pursues a violent, illegal, and unjustifiable war in the  sovereign nation of Ukraine, we must remember that he is also  destabilizing fragile states in Africa to feed his ruthless war  machine.   As a matter of fact, the Russian Federation has conducted malign  activities throughout Africa for several years now to raise funds and  evade sanctions that would inevitably result from Putin's brutal war.   From troll farms that spread disinformation to unaccountable private  military contractors, the Kremlin continues to destabilize parts of  Africa in order to achieve its objectives regardless of consequences.   Those consequences are deadly and draining African governments of  sorely needed resources. For example, Putin has used his network of  oligarchs to deploy the Wagner Group mercenaries to countries like Mali  and the Central African Republic, where allegations of human rights  abuses such as mass executions, forced disappearances, torture, and  other unspeakable acts are mounting every day by those groups.   That is why I call on my colleagues to support H.R. 7311, which would  require the Secretary of State to submit to Congress a strategy and  plan outlining U.S. efforts to counter Russia's malign activities on  the continent of Africa that undermine U.S. interests.   It would also require the State Department to identify and hold  accountable Russian and African officials who facilitate Russia's  malign activities, including those that exploit the continent's natural  resources and manipulate democratic processes in order to evade  sanctions.   I am pleased to see the administration is taking several steps toward  this end in recent days, including through designating several Russian  companies involved in illicit activities in Africa that were, in  essence, designed to evade sanctions.   With H.R. 7311, I am confident the State Department, with the support  of our other Federal agencies, will help Congress develop a clear  picture of what Putin is, in fact, doing in Africa and how we can  effectively push back to protect our interests and those of our  partners throughout the African region.   Mr. Speaker, I support the bill and urge my colleagues to do the  same. I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend again for his leadership  and bipartisanship on this bill. I think it is a very important bill  because Russia is spreading its malign influence all over the world,  and it is having a particular impact in the African continent, so we  need to be prepared. We need to respond. This bill will help do that.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this important piece of  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 4133) to authorize appropriations for the Caribbean Basin  Security Initiative, enhance the United States-Caribbean security  partnership, prioritize disaster resilience, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 4133         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Caribbean Basin Security       Initiative Authorization Act''.       SEC. 2.

(2) Specific, measurable benchmarks to track the progress       of the Initiative towards accomplishing the outcomes       described pursuant to paragraph (1).        (3) A plan for the delineation of the roles to be carried       out by the Department of State, the United States Agency for       International Development, the Department of Justice, the       Department of Defense, and any other Federal department or       agency in carrying out the Initiative, to prevent overlap and       unintended competition between activities and resources.        (4) A plan to coordinate and track all activities carried       out under the Initiative between all relevant Federal       departments and agencies, in accordance with the publication       requirements described in section 4 of the Foreign Aid       Transparency and Accountability Act of 2016 (Public Law 114-      191; 22 U.S.C. 2394c).

SEC. 5. DEFINITIONS.         In this Act:        (1) Appropriate congressional committees.--The term       ``appropriate congressional committees'' means--        (A) the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Committee on       Appropriations of the House of Representatives; and        (B) the Committee on Foreign Relations and the Committee on       Appropriations of the Senate.        (2) Beneficiary countries.--The term ``beneficiary       countries'' means the beneficiary countries of the Caribbean       Basin Security Initiative.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H.R. 4133.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4133, the Caribbean  Basin Security Initiative Authorization Act of 2022.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague, Representative Espaillat, for  drafting this important measure.   CBSI has been essential in helping our partners in the Caribbean  improve their capacity to combat transnational crime, violence, and  regional instability while also enhancing our own security and  strengthening our critical partnerships in the region.   By supporting a multiyear authorization, we can effectively assist  our Caribbean partners in citizen safety, security, and the rule of law  in the Caribbean Basin; reducing corruption and the malign influence of  authoritarian regimes like Xi Jinping's China and Vladimir Putin's  Russia; and strengthening the ability of countries in the region to  prepare for and respond to natural disasters.   According to a status report from the State Department's U.S.  Strategy for Engagement in the Caribbean released in July of 2019 is  says: ``Rising crime and endemic corruption threaten governments'  ability to provide security and good governance'' in many of the  nations in the region.   With ongoing efforts to mitigate transnational organized crime in  Central America and Mexico, the drug trade and in other illegal  activities likely will move further into the Caribbean, particularly as  the regional economic outlook deteriorates due to the continuing  economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.   Given the tragic impacts of the recent hurricane season in the  Caribbean and trends pointing toward more frequent and intense natural  disasters, this renewed support for CBSI can also help make it possible  for our friends in the region to become more climate resilient by  building robust rapid-response mechanisms and resilient infrastructure  responses throughout the region.   The support from CBSI can help to avoid a climate of fear and  uncertainty among citizens that leads to diminished economic growth.   Mr. Speaker, I support this bill and urge my colleagues to do the  same, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  New York (Mr. Espaillat), my good friend and author of this  legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for his leadership and  bipartisanship on this important bill. I really can't add to the  eloquence of our friend and colleague from New York (Mr. Espaillat).   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this important and  critical piece of legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 6089) to clarify that section 107 of the Countering  America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act applies sanctions with  respect to unmanned combat aerial vehicles following a 2019 change by  the United Nations providing additional clarity to the United Nations  Register of Conventional Arms, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 6089         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Stop Iranian Drones Act''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress finds the following:        (1) A July 15, 2013, United Nations General Assembly Report       on the continuing operation of the United Nations Register of       Conventional Arms and its further development (document A/68/      140) states in paragraph 45, ``The Group noted the discussion       of the 2006 Group that category IV already covered armed       unmanned aerial vehicles and of the 2009 Group on a proposal       to include a new category for such vehicles. The Group       reviewed proposals for providing greater clarity to category       IV.''.        (2) Section 107 of the Countering America's Adversaries       Through Sanctions Act (22 U.S.C. 9406), enacted August 2,       2017, requires the President to impose sanctions on any       person that the President determines ``knowingly engages in       any activity that materially contributes to the supply, sale,       or transfer directly or indirectly to or from Iran, or for       the use in or benefit of Iran, of any battle tanks, armored       combat vehicles, large caliber artillery systems, combat       aircraft, attack helicopters, warships, missiles or missile       systems, as defined for the purpose of the United Nations       Register of Conventional Arms, or related materiel, including       spare parts''.        (3) In 2019, the United Nations formally changed the       heading of category IV of the United Nations Register of       Conventional Arms to ``combat aircraft and unmanned combat       aerial vehicles''.       SEC. 3. STATEMENT OF POLICY.         It shall be the policy of the United States to prevent Iran       and Iranian-aligned terrorist and militia groups from       acquiring unmanned aerial vehicles, including commercially       available component parts, that can be used in attacks       against United States persons and partner nations.       SEC. 4. AMENDMENT TO COUNTERING AMERICA'S ADVERSARIES THROUGH                     SANCTIONS ACT RELATING TO SANCTIONS WITH                     RESPECT TO IRAN.         (a) In General.--Section 107 of the Countering America's       Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (22 U.S.C. 9406) is       amended--        (1) in the section heading, by striking ``enforcement of       arms embargos'' and inserting ``sanctions with respect to       major conventional arms''; and        (2) in subsection (a)(1), by inserting ``or unmanned combat       aerial vehicles'' after ``combat aircraft''.        (b) Clerical Amendment.--The table of contents for the       Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act is       amended by striking the item relating to section 107 and       inserting the following:  ``Sec. 107. Sanctions with respect to major conventional arms.''.         (c) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section       take effect on the date of the enactment of this Act and       apply with respect to any person that knowingly engages in       any activity that materially contributes to the supply, sale,       or transfer directly or indirectly to or from Iran, or for       the use in or benefit of Iran, of any unmanned combat aerial       vehicles, as defined for the purpose of the United Nations       Register of Conventional Arms, before, on, or after such date       of enactment.       SEC. 5. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS.         The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H.R. 6089.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 6089, the Stop Iranian  Drones Act, which was introduced by Ranking Member McCaul and Chairman  Meeks, along with Congressmen Deutch and Wilson, chair and ranking  member of the Middle East, North Africa, and Global Counterterrorism  Subcommittee.   As we have seen in recent months, Iran and Iranian-aligned terrorists  and militia groups have been growing increasingly aggressive with their  drone attacks throughout the Middle East--targeting U.S. troops,  commercial vessels, partner countries, and more.   Not long ago, an Iranian-sponsored militia in Yemen utilized drones  to cause death and destruction in the UAE, hundreds of miles away.  Similarly, Saudi Arabia has faced repeated drone attacks on its  civilian areas and its critical infrastructure.   This bill clarifies that existing conventional weapons sanctions  against Iran include unmanned combat aerial vehicles and brings U.S.  code up to date with the United Nation's categories of major  conventional arms.   By doing this, this bill will allow the United States to better  respond to the threat posed by Iran and its proxies' aggressive UAV  tactics with respect to the United States and its partners.   This is not a new sanction, but rather a clarification of current  law. It will in no way interfere with the ongoing nuclear talks. We  have confirmed this with the State Department.   The Biden administration is taking this threat seriously. They have  sanctioned the top Iranian military official for his role in the July  attack on a commercial shipping vessel in the Gulf of Oman, in addition  to blacklisting a network of individuals and companies behind Iran's  UAV program.                                time  1430    But we can do more, and we need our allies to do more as well. The  clarification included in this legislation will help show the  international community that Iranian UAV proliferation will not be  tolerated by this government or this Congress.   Mr. Speaker, I ask for full support of this House in passing this  legislation so we can move it one step closer to the President's desk,  and I reserve the balance of my time.                                           House of Representatives,                                      Committee on the Judiciary,                                     Washington, DC, April 21, 2022.      Hon. Gregory Meeks,      Chairman, Committee on Foreign Affairs,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Meeks: This letter is to advise you that the       Committee on the Judiciary has now had an opportunity to       review the provisions in H.R. 6089, the ``Stop Iranian Drones       Act,'' that fall within our Rule X jurisdiction. I appreciate       your consulting with us on those provisions. The Judiciary       Committee has no objection to your including them in the bill       for consideration on the House floor, and to expedite that       consideration is willing to forgo action on H.R. 6089, with       the understanding that we do not thereby waive any future       jurisdictional claim over those provisions or their subject       matters.        In the event a House-Senate conference on this or similar       legislation is convened, the Judiciary Committee reserves the       right to request an appropriate number of conferees to       address any concerns with these or similar provisions that       may arise in conference.        Please place this letter into the Congressional Record       during consideration of the measure on the House floor. Thank       you for the cooperative spirit in which you have worked       regarding this matter and others between our committees.            Sincerely,                                                    Jerrold Nadler,      Chairman.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                    Committee on Foreign Affairs,                                     Washington, DC, April 21, 2022.      Hon. Jerrold Nadler,      Committee on the Judiciary,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Nadler: I am writing to you concerning H.R.       6089, Stop Iranian Drones Act. I appreciate your willingness       to work cooperatively on this legislation.        I acknowledge that provisions of the bill fall within the       jurisdiction of the Committee on the Judiciary under House       Rule X, and that your Committee will forgo action on H.R.       6089 to expedite floor consideration. I further acknowledge       that the inaction of your Committee with respect to the bill       does not waive any future jurisdictional claim over the       matters contained in the bill that fall within your       jurisdiction. I also acknowledge that your Committee will be       appropriately consulted and involved as this or similar       legislation moves forward, and will support the appointment       of Committee on the Judiciary conferees during any House-      Senate conference convened on this legislation.        Lastly, I will ensure that our exchange of letters is       included in the Congressional Record during floor       consideration of the bill. Thank you again for your       cooperation regarding the legislation. I look forward to       continuing to work with you as the measure moves through the       legislative process.            Sincerely,                                                  Gregory W. Meeks,                                                          Chairman.     Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  New Jersey (Mr. Malinowski) who serves on the Committee on Foreign  Affairs.    Mr. Speaker, I think this is an important piece of  legislation in trying to contain the malign activities of the Iranian  Government especially in a critical region, critical to us and critical  to the world.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 4693) to advance targeted and evidence-based interventions  for the prevention and treatment of global malnutrition and to improve  the coordination of such programs, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 4693         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Global Malnutrition       Prevention and Treatment Act of 2021''.       SEC. 2. AUTHORIZATION OF EFFORTS TO PREVENT AND TREAT                     MALNUTRITION GLOBALLY.         (a) In General.--The Administrator, in coordination with       the heads of other relevant Federal departments and agencies,       is authorized and encouraged to support efforts to prevent       and treat malnutrition globally, including by--        (1) targeting resources and nutrition interventions to       support the most vulnerable populations susceptible to severe       malnutrition, including children under the age of 5 and       pregnant and lactating women;        (2) increasing coverage, particularly in priority       countries, of nutrition interventions that include       coordinated deployment of prenatal nutrient supplements,       breastfeeding support, vitamin A supplementation, specialized       nutritious food products for the treatment of acute       malnutrition, and other evidence-based interventions, as       appropriate;        (3) increasing the use of context and country-appropriate       fortification of staples and condiments with essential       nutrients;        (4) advancing evidence-based programs and interventions       carried out using data-driven approaches, best practices, and       targeted to country-specific contexts and needs;        (5) supporting partner governments to develop policies to       prevent and treat malnutrition;        (6) leveraging investments to strengthen health systems,       including to support community health workers to advance       improved nutrition outcomes;        (7) improve diets through safe, affordable, nutritious       foods in the food system; and        (8) ensuring rigorous monitoring and evaluation of such       efforts.        (b) External Coordination Efforts Related to Nutrition       Programs.--The Administrator, in coordination with the heads       of other relevant Federal departments and agencies, should       coordinate, as appropriate, with bilateral and multilateral       donors, governments of partner countries, United Nations       agencies, civil society organizations, nongovernmental       organizations, including faith-based organizations, and the       private sector to prevent and treat malnutrition globally,       including by supporting efforts to--        (1) build the capacity of local and community-based       organizations and governments of partner countries to ensure       sustainability of nutrition interventions;        (2) expand research and innovation to identify and increase       effective and evidence-based nutrition interventions based on       country-specific contexts;        (3) improve coordination and structure of supply chains for       nutrition interventions;        (4) expand domestic resource mobilization and domestic       financing for nutrition interventions; and        (5) seek to leverage additional resources and encourage       investment into innovative and multi-stakeholder finance       partnerships to advance burden sharing in nutrition-related       assistance.        (c) Interagency Efforts.--In carrying out subsections (a)       and (b), the Administrator, in coordination with the heads of       other relevant Federal departments and agencies, consistent       with the Global Nutrition Coordination Plan, shall seek to       leverage additional resources to prevent and treat       malnutrition globally, including by--        (1) increasing cooperation among relevant Federal       departments and agencies represented in the Global Nutrition       Coordination Plan to better leverage grants, technical       assistance, debt, equity, loan guaranties, and public-private       partnerships; and        (2) utilizing the Administrator's role as a member of the       Board of Directors of the United States International       Development Finance Corporation to consider opportunities       within the Corporation's development impact framework that       support improved nutrition outcomes.       SEC. 3. SELECTION OF PRIORITY COUNTRIES.         (a) In General.--The Administrator, in coordination with       the Nutrition Leadership Council, shall select foreign       countries as priority countries for purposes of targeting       programs to prevent and treat malnutrition globally.  [[Page H4548]]         (b) Criteria.--The selection of priority countries under       subsection (a) shall be based on the following:        (1) The prevalence of severe malnutrition among children       under the age of 5 and pregnant and lactating women.        (2) The presence of high-need, underserved, marginalized,       vulnerable, or impoverished communities.        (3) The enabling environment for improved nutrition,       including presence of national nutrition plans and       demonstration of strong political commitment.        (4) Any other criteria that the Administrator determines to       be appropriate.        (c) Updates.--The Administrator shall update the selection       of priority countries under subsection (a) not later than 5       years after the date of the enactment of this Act.        (d) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that       the Administrator should continue to undertake nutrition       interventions in countries not selected as priority       countries, particularly in contexts in which opportunities       are identified to advance multi-sectoral development       programming and integrate efforts to prevent and treat global       malnutrition with other priority areas and program       objectives.       SEC. 4. NUTRITION LEADERSHIP COUNCIL.         (a) Establishment.--The Administrator is authorized to       establish in the United States Agency for International       Development the Nutrition Leadership Council (in this section       referred to as the ``Council''), which shall coordinate       Agency efforts to prevent and treat malnutrition globally.

(c) Membership.--The Council shall include representatives       of the following bureaus and independent offices of the       United States Agency for International Development:        (1) The Bureau for Global Health.        (2) The Bureau for Resilience and Food Security.        (3) The Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance.        (4) Any other relevant bureau or independent office that       the Administrator determines to be appropriate.       SEC. 5. IMPLEMENTATION PLAN.         (a) In General.--Not later than 260 days after the date of       the enactment of this Act, the Administrator, in coordination       with the heads of other relevant Federal departments and       agencies, shall develop and submit to the appropriate       congressional committees an implementation plan for programs       to prevent and treat malnutrition globally described in       section 2.        (b) Matters To Be Included.--The implementation plan       required by subsection (a) shall include the following:        (1) A description of specific and measurable goals,       objectives, and performance metrics with respect to such       programs, including clear benchmarks and intended timelines       for achieving such goals and objectives.

(c) Consultation.--The implementation plan required by       subsection (a) shall be developed in consultation with, as       appropriate and to the extent possible, representatives of       nongovernmental organizations, including faith-based       organizations, civil society organizations, multilateral       organizations and donors, relevant private, academic, and       philanthropic entities, and the appropriate congressional       committees.       SEC. 6. REPORT.         (a) In General.--Not later than one year after the date of       the enactment of this Act, and annually thereafter for 5       years, the Administrator shall submit to the appropriate       congressional committees a report that describes progress       made towards preventing and treating malnutrition globally.        (b) Matters To Be Included.--The report required by       subsection (a) shall include the following:        (1) A summary of progress made towards achieving the       specific and measurable goals, objectives, and performance       metrics towards ending global malnutrition.        (2) In priority countries--        (A) a detailed summary of nutrition programs and activities       in the previous fiscal year, including a breakdown of the       countries to which nutrition resources have been allocated       and an estimated number of people reached through nutrition       interventions; and        (B) an description of the coordination of nutrition       programs with other health and development programs and       priorities.

SEC. 7. COMPLIANCE WITH THE FOREIGN AID TRANSPARENCY AND                     ACCOUNTABILITY ACT OF 2016.

SEC. 9. SUNSET.         The requirements of this Act and the amendments made by       this Act shall terminate on the date that is 7 years after       the date of the enactment of this Act.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H.R. 4693.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4693, the Global  Malnutrition Prevention and Treatment Act of 2021.   In the wake of COVID-19, we have seen malnutrition rates climb and  food insecurity become an ever-greater challenge. Jarringly, it is  predicted that disruptions to global food and health systems will  double global malnutrition rates--double--with women and children  bearing the brunt of those effects. It is estimated that in 2022 the  devastating global effects of COVID-19 could add an additional 17  million severely malnourished children worldwide. We cannot stand by  while millions of children's lives are on the line with COVID, climate  change, and conflict worsening the global situation. That is why the  Foreign Affairs Committee took action with H.R. 4693 which will direct  USAID to implement solutions to prevent and treat this global  malnutrition.   This bill establishes a nutrition leadership council to identify  populations most at risk to severe malnutrition and to prioritize  prevention and treatment programs. Preventing and treating malnutrition  is relatively inexpensive to implement and has high returns. With every  $1 we spend, we improve health and increase cognitive  [[Page H4549]]  and physical development yielding the equivalent of a $35 return.   By coordinating activities throughout the U.S. Government with our  partner countries with the Untied Nations' specialized agencies, civil  society, private-sector actors and more, we can sustain nutrition  interventions that save lives.   This bill also requires USAID to provide Congress an implementation  plan and annual reports concerning its programs for treating and  preventing malnutrition.   Mr. Speaker, we must do more to support those in dire need, and we  must answer their call for help. H.R. 4693 is this Chamber's  opportunity to do just that: to prevent the lives of those suffering  from malnutrition all around the world. This measure builds on the work  and jurisdiction of USAID and will bolster efforts to respond to and  prevent malnutrition everywhere.   While the United States has led the world in responding to COVID-19  and its effects around the world, we must also ensure we don't lose  ground in longstanding investments such as food security. By supporting  this legislation we can take a meaningful step in doing both.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this measure so we can  move it one step closer to the President's desk, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   The United States has a long tradition, on a bipartisan basis, of  dealing with the issue of food insecurity and malnutrition. Herbert  Hoover led some of the early efforts by the United States Government  after World War I to feed a starving Europe. He even provided food  assistance to the Bolshevik regime in Russia because we understood that  malnutrition didn't respect political ideology or labels.   Through the Food for Peace program in the early Kennedy and Johnson  years, there was cooperation between the late Senator Bob Dole and the  late Senator George McGovern to make sure that both domestic and  international food security were staples of U.S. policy and bipartisan  support.   This is an important piece of legislation. No child in 2022 should  ever be malnourished, and certainly, no child should ever die from  malnourishment.   This is an important statement by this Congress about our values as  human beings and as a society and reaffirms a longstanding commitment  by the American people to not let this kind of tragedy happen anywhere.   Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of the bill, and I yield back the balance  of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (S. 812) to direct the Secretary of State to develop a strategy to  regain observer status for Taiwan in the World Health Organization, and  for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                   S. 812         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. PARTICIPATION OF TAIWAN IN THE WORLD HEALTH                     ORGANIZATION.         (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:        (1) The World Health Organization (WHO) is a specialized       agency of the United Nations, charged with coordinating       health efforts within the United Nations system. The World       Health Assembly (WHA) is the decision-making body of the WHO,       which convenes annually in May to set the policies and       priorities of the organization. Statehood is not a       requirement for attendance at the WHA, and numerous       observers, including non-members and non-governmental       organizations, attended the most recent virtual WHA in May       2020.        (2) Taiwan began seeking to participate in the WHO as an       observer in 1997. In 2009, with strong support from       successive United States Administrations, Congress, and like-      minded WHO Member States, and during a period of improved       Cross-Strait relations, Taiwan received an invitation to       attend the WHA as an observer under the name ``Chinese       Taipei''. Taiwan received the same invitation each year until       2016, when following the election of President Tsai-Ing Wen       of the Democratic Progressive Party, Taiwan's engagement in       the international community began facing increased resistance       from the People's Republic of China (PRC). Taiwan's       invitation to the 2016 WHA was received late and included new       language conditioning Taiwan's participation on the PRC's       ``one China principle''. The WHO did not invite Taiwan to       attend the WHA as an observer in 2017, 2018, 2019, or 2020.        (3) Taiwan remains a model contributor to world health,       having provided financial and technical assistance to respond       to numerous global health challenges. Taiwan has invested       over $6,000,000,000 in international medical and humanitarian       aid efforts impacting over 80 countries since 1996. In 2014,       Taiwan responded to the Ebola crisis by donating $1,000,000       and providing 100,000 sets of personal protective equipment.       Through the Global Cooperation and Training Framework, the       United States and Taiwan have jointly conducted training       programs for experts to combat MERS, Dengue Fever, and Zika.       In 2020, after successfully containing the spread of the       novel coronavirus within its borders while upholding       democratic principles, Taiwan generously donated millions of       pieces of personal protective equipment and COVID-19 tests to       countries in need. These diseases know no borders, and       Taiwan's needless exclusion from global health cooperation       increases the dangers presented by global pandemics.        (4) Taiwan's international engagement has faced increased       resistance from the PRC. Taiwan was not invited to the 2016       Assembly of the International Civil Aviation Organization       (ICAO), despite participating as a guest at the       organization's prior summit in 2013. Taiwan's requests to       participate in the General Assembly of the International       Criminal Police Organization (INTERPOL) have also been       rejected. In May 2017, PRC delegates disrupted a meeting of       the Kimberley Process on conflict diamonds held in Perth,       Australia, until delegates from Taiwan were asked to leave.       Since 2016, the Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principe,       the Republic of Panama, the Dominican Republic, Burkina Faso,       the Republic of El Salvador, the Solomon Islands, and the       Republic of Kiribati have terminated longstanding diplomatic       relationships with Taiwan and granted diplomatic recognition       to the PRC.        (5) Congress has established a policy of support for       Taiwan's participation in international bodies that address       shared transnational challenges, particularly in the WHO.       Congress passed H.R. 1794 in the 106th Congress, H.R. 428 in       the 107th Congress, and S. 2092 in the 108th Congress to       direct the Secretary of State to establish a strategy for,       and to report annually to Congress on, efforts to obtain       observer status for Taiwan at the WHA. Congress also passed       H.R. 1151 in the 113th Congress, directing the Secretary to       report on a strategy to gain observer status for Taiwan at       the ICAO Assembly, and H.R. 1853 in the 114th Congress,       directing the Secretary to report on a strategy to gain       observer status for Taiwan at the INTERPOL Assembly. However,       since 2016, Taiwan has not received an invitation to attend       any of these events as an observer.        (b) Augmentation of Report Concerning the Participation of       Taiwan in the World Health Organization.--        (1) In general.--Subsection (c) of section 1 of the Act       entitled, ``To address the participation of Taiwan in the       World Health Organization'' (Public Law 108-235; 22 U.S.C.       290 note) is amended by adding at the end the following new       paragraph:        ``(3) An account of the changes and improvements the       Secretary of State has made to the United States plan to       endorse and obtain observer status for Taiwan at the World       Health Assembly, following any annual meetings of the World       Health Assembly at which Taiwan did not obtain observer       status.''.        (2) Effective date.--The amendment made by paragraph (1)       shall take effect and apply beginning with the first report       required under subsection (c) of section 1 of the Act       entitled, ``To address the participation of Taiwan in the       World Health Organization'' (Public Law 108-235; 22 U.S.C.       290 note) that is submitted after the date of the enactment       of this Act:     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on S. 812.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of S. 812, a bill to direct the  Secretary of State to develop a strategy to regain observer status for  Taiwan in the World Health Organization, and for other purposes.   S. 812 will help support Taiwan's effort to gain observer status at  the World Health Assembly, the decisionmaking body of the World Health  Organization.   Since the end of 2019, the unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic has  reminded the global community of the importance of international  cooperation and collaboration on global health.   Taiwan has been a leader on global health. While the People's  Republic of China was actively censoring public discussion of and  silencing doctors about the effects and outbreak of the virus in China  itself, Taiwan was saving lives globally with its early detection and  dissemination of information about the virus.   Despite its proximity to the original outbreak in China, Taiwan  employed a strategy of social distancing, border controls, mask  mandates, quarantine,  [[Page H4551]]  and contact tracing so that it succeeded in suppressing widespread  transmission. Incredibly, with a population of 23.5 million, Taiwan  experienced roughly 37,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases and fewer than 900  deaths. That is a tremendous feat compared to everybody else.   Taiwan was not only able to use its knowledge to effectively respond  to the COVID-19 pandemic within its own borders, but it shared its  expertise and medical supplies when the world badly needed it most.  Taiwan donated millions of masks and PPE to many countries around the  world, including here in the United States.   These actions symbolize Taiwan's leadership and contributions to  global health security and demonstrate why it ought to be part of the  global conversation on public health. Unfortunately, China has tried to  limit and constrain Taiwan's meaningful participation in all  international organizations, including pressuring the WHO to strip  Taiwan of its observer status in the WHA in 2017. As the co-chair of  the Taiwan Caucus, I can tell you that makes no sense.   This bipartisan measure would support efforts that enable Taiwan to  share its public health expertise and experience with the world at  times when we need it badly.   Led by Senator Menendez, this legislation has already passed the  Senate. The House Foreign Affairs Committee was proud to pass out of  committee a near-identical bipartisan measure led by Representative  Young Kim of California.   Passage of this bill today, ahead of the World Health Assembly  meeting next month, would not only be timely; it would also demonstrate  the strong bipartisan, bicameral commitment the U.S. Congress has to  our democratic friend Taiwan.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to adopt this resolution, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time for  the purpose of closing.   Why is this bill important at this time, Mr. Speaker? It is important  because an authoritarian, delusional autocrat in Moscow is wreaking  havoc and inflicting death on the ground and from the skies on an  innocent people seeking freedom in Ukraine.   It is important that other autocrats and authoritarian regimes  understand that they will pay a heavy price for such behavior, that we  will not resolve disputes that way in the 21st century, and that the  consequences will be severe.   Isolating Taiwan is part of a policy to intimidate, threaten, and  assault democracy on the island of Taiwan. We can't be a party to that.   Taiwan has a voice. Taiwan has expertise. It can contribute in a  pandemic, and it should not be silenced because of somebody's political  agenda. That is what this bill is about. That is why this Congress  should speak with one voice and support this important piece of  legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I urge its passage, and I yield back the balance of my  time.
