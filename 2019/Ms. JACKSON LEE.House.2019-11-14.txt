 Mr. Speaker, let me speak to a young man in my  office who is studying at St. Edwards College in Austin, Texas. He is a  person who is able to fulfill his dreams because of DACA.   Yesterday, the Supreme Court heard the case about all of these young  people, 800,000 who are working as paramedics, in medical school, in  law school, going into rural communities and being servants of the  people, some wanting to go into the United States military. Here is a  program that was working well, and this administration imploded it  because of wrongheaded decisions about immigrants.   This is a nation of laws and of immigrants. We want to comply with  the law. That is what DACA was allowing these young people to do.   We need to restore DACA, work together so that young people all over,  no matter what walk of life they come from, can have opportunity.   At the same time, I am looking to reform the juvenile justice system.  Most people don't know that when you go into a juvenile detention  center, there is no sentence, and there is no bail. The bail process is  complicated.   We are looking to provide what we call an omnibus bill to deal with  how we treat juveniles to ensure that we don't throw away lives; that  if you have a mistake at the age of 12 or 14, your life is in front of  you; and that we help parents with wraparound services.   What I hear most of all is a parent saying: ``Help me. I don't know  where to go. I don't have the resources.''   A nation as great as America can invest in her children, whether it  is the DACA status of our young children attempting to be part of this  Nation or whether or not, in fact, it is those young people who made a  slight wrong turn and are thrown away for years in detention centers  that are like jails. We are a nation that can do better.   And, yes, God bless our veterans.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from California  (Mr. DeSaulnier) for his leadership, and my good friend from Georgia, I  thank him for his explanation of the process of democracy in this  place.   But I am excited to announce that this is a bipartisan effort,  because the bipartisan aspect of it are the results of how this  legislation will impact all of America irrespective, not respecting,  their region, their faith, or their party.   Let me be very clear to say what we are actually talking about today  and the real-life stories that make a difference. It is called the  Export-Import Bank and it is legislated as the United States Export  Finance Agency, and its short name, as I said, Export-Import.   What does that mean?   I rise to support it, because it means something to individual  businesses. It means something to rural American farmers. It means  something to small manufacturers.    We have been documenting that manufacturing is going down,  manufacturing based upon how you sell your products.   This is a 10-year plan with $175 billion to help those businesses,  those small farms, those entrepreneurs in your community. That is jobs.   What it means is the company that makes light bulbs can now export  those to developing nations on the continent of Africa or they can go  deep into Southeast Asia or Asia and sell products from the United  States to a foreign country.   For those of us who have seen the lopsidedness, there are governments  that actually fund businesses outside the United States. We don't do  that, mostly, unless it is through a grant or through a funding for a  project that we need, and so you are on your own.   But this is going to provide small businesses with an extra hand up.  It is going to help those who are, in particular, minority and women- owned businesses, along with others. It is going to create a process so  that it does not lapse.   We had a period where there was no quorum. We couldn't help small  businesses.   I remember sitting in a room with this company in a foreign country,  a U.S. company that was there, and they said, ``If it had not been for  the Export-Import Bank, we would have lost 300 employees in the United  States.''                                time  1300    This is bipartisan. This is where we help people, no matter who they  are. I am a strong supporter of this bill because it takes into  consideration working men and women, and it takes into consideration  the environment.   All of our union friends, who provide a pathway of success for  working Americans, support this bill because it helps bring back  manufacturing. We support it because it gives alternative options for  energy a boost where jobs can be created with renewable energy.    Mr. Speaker, let me just simply say that you have to  live this to understand it, and I have spoken to those businesses that  have benefited from Export-Import.   It sounds like a name that you can't get your hands around, but just  understand it simply. You want to do business overseas. You want to get  your products overseas. It is a big hurdle. You need additional  finance. This is the place to come.   And they have been successful in paying for themselves. That $175  billion is over 10 years, but it pays for itself with the number of  businesses that Americans can take advantage of and create new  businesses for the sole purpose of selling that product overseas,  selling that small farmer produce, what is on that small farm, allowing  them to send it to markets that are desperate for the wonderful bounty  of food products that we are able to raise in this wonderful country.   In particular, I would like to add, it is a good place for veterans  who want to start their business, to add to their business, because  many of them, obviously, understand the international realm.   Mr. Speaker, this is a good bill. I support this bill, the Ex-Im  Bank, and I hope that my colleagues will support it.
