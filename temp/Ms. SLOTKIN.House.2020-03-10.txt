 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the Support  for Veterans in Effective Apprenticeships Act. I am so proud to be  coleading this bipartisan bill with Representative Clark, and I want  to, in particular, thank Senator Gary Peters from the great State of  Michigan for his leadership in driving this legislation through the  Senate.   When we make the decision to send men and women to fight for our  country, we make that decision to support them for the rest of their  lives. That means veterans should have every opportunity to enroll in  an apprenticeship that connects them with good-paying jobs.   The bill before us today expands the number of programs veterans can  access with their GI benefits. GI benefits can cover things like  housing and living expenses when they are going through their  apprenticeship.   This bill came straight from concerns raised by veterans in the  district. In particular, I want to thank Rick Donovan, a veteran from  Oakland County, who brought this idea to our attention.   Just last month, I visited Lansing Community College with Senator  Peters, which has some amazing apprenticeship programs.   This bill has already passed the Senate with bipartisan support. It  is a great example of what can happen when we work together on issues  that matter to all of us across Chambers and across parties.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote in support of this bill  and send it to the President's desk.                            ____________________
