 Mr. Speaker, after months of negotiation and conference, I  am proud to come to the floor today to say the 2018 farm bill is now a  strong, bipartisan bill which works for families, farmers, and  communities.   The bill now avoids disastrous cuts to SNAP, a program which helps  put food on the table for 44,000 people in Mecklenburg County alone. It  also provides $10 million in funding for urban agriculture research and  mandatory funding for programs that support local food systems.   As co-founder and co-chair of the bipartisan HBCU Caucus, I am  particularly proud to have helped secure key resources for 1890 land- grant universities in the bill. It authorizes $50 million to create  three centers of excellence at 1890s and ensures equity between land- grants by removing provisions that strip away unspent extension funds  for 1890s, and it mandates a report that outlines research and  extension funds for all land-grant schools.   I thank my colleagues on the conference committee, and I urge all of  my colleagues to support the bill when it comes to the floor.                            ____________________
