 Madam Speaker, I am proud to rise today to congratulate  Mrs. Elizabeth Raff of Lancaster County, who was recently named  Pennsylvania's Teacher of the Year for 2022.   Elizabeth teaches sixth grade at Pequea Elementary School, in the  Penn Manor School District in Lancaster County, where she has taught  since 2014. Penn Manor School District Superintendent, Dr. Mike  Leichliter, described Elizabeth as a ``dynamic and creative teacher who  is always looking to find new ways to reach her students'' and noted  that ``she creates a space where students are encouraged to explore  ideas in a supportive and respectful environment.''   There is no question that teachers and students have been impacted;  they have had challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic over the  last 2 years, and we thank our teachers for all they have done to make  sure that our students are receiving the best education possible.   That is certainly true of Mrs. Raff, whose classroom is well- decorated and offers students access to a large library of books to  pique their interest, and a raised stage to provide students the  opportunity to present to their classmates.   Thank you to Mrs. Raff for all you have done to educate students in  our community. We all appreciate your efforts and wish to congratulate  you on being named Pennsylvania's 2022 Teacher of the Year.                            ____________________
