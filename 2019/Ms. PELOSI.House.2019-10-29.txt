 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and,  more importantly, I thank him for bringing this very important  legislation to the floor today.   I thank Mr. Smith for his ongoing commitment to justice in the world  in terms of respecting the dignity and worth of people and not ignoring  atrocities when they happen, now and a long time ago. It is a pleasure  to work with him always.   Mr. Speaker, we have tried this bill out of committee more than one  time, and now it has come to the floor. It is an honor to speak on it,  and it is a great day for the Congress that we have that privilege.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to join my colleagues in solemn remembrance of  one of the great atrocities of the 20th century, the systematic murder  of more than 1.5 million Armenian men, women, and children by the  Ottoman Empire.   Too often, tragically, the truth of this staggering crime has been  denied. Today, let us clearly state the facts on the floor of this  House to be etched forever into the Congressional Record: The barbarism  committed against the Armenian people was a genocide.   As international observers wrote at the time, it was a ``campaign of  race extermination,'' one that we as Members of Congress and as  freedom-loving people have a moral obligation to never forget.   If we ignore history, then we are destined to witness the mistakes of  the past be repeated. The recent attacks by the Turkish military  against the Kurdish people are a stark and brutal reminder of the  danger in our own time.   That is why it is critical, year in and year out, to reaffirm our  dedication to recognizing the Armenian genocide and to placing the U.S.  Congress firmly on the side of honesty in our history.   For that, I thank Chairman Schiff, Chairman Engel, Congresswoman  Eshoo, Armenian Caucus Co-chairs Pallone and Speier, and all who have  worked relentlessly on this critical resolution, which states that  Democrats and Republicans join to:   ``Commemorate the Armenian genocide through official recognition and  remembrance;   ``Reject efforts to enlist, engage, or otherwise associate the United  States Government with denial of the Armenian genocide or any other  genocide; and   ``Encourage education and public understanding of the facts of the  Armenian genocide, including the United States role in the humanitarian  relief effort, and the relevance of the Armenian genocide to modern-day  crimes against humanity.''   To honor the memory of those lost and the suffering of those who  survived, we firmly and unequivocally denounce all attempts to devalue  or minimize these heinous crimes.    Mr. Speaker, I urge a strong vote for this resolution, which is a  statement to America's commitment to human rights and to the truth.   We are blessed in our country with a large Armenian American  population, some serving--Congresswoman Speier, Congresswoman Eshoo,  and others--in this House. Every year, we come together to observe the  sadness of the genocide, but today, Mr. Speaker, we have the  opportunity. And may we have the strength and courage to always  denounce hate, violence, and bigotry; to right the wrongs of history;  and to build a future of hope, peace, and freedom for all mankind. That  is who we are as Americans.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman and others for giving us the  opportunity to state our values.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I  thank Mr. Engel, distinguished chairman of the Foreign Affairs  Committee, and the distinguished ranking member of the committee, Mr.  McCaul, for their leadership in bringing this important, bipartisan  bill to the floor.   Mr. Speaker, as we all know, 3 weeks ago the President unleashed an  escalation of chaos and insecurity in Syria when he gave Turkey the  green light to attack our Kurdish partners, threatening lives, risking  regional security, and undermining America's credibility as a  trustworthy ally.   And then, instead of holding Turkey accountable for its aggression,  the President reversed his sanctions in exchange for a so-called cease- fire, which the Turks clearly stated was not a cease-fire.   Today, Democrats and Republicans come together to demonstrate the  strong, smart leadership that has sorely been lacking from the White  House, as the House passed this tough, targeted sanctions bill to hold  the Turks accountable for their attacks on our Kurdish partners.   We salute Chairman Engel and Ranking Member McCaul once again for  their leadership on this PACT Act and on the resolution opposing  President Trump's decision on Syria, including H.J. Res. 77, a  bipartisan, bicameral resolution which passed the House on a 354-60  vote.   Here are the facts:   Our Kurdish partners freed millions of people and tens of thousands  of square miles from the grip of ISIS. Throughout the fight, they  sustained nearly 11,000 casualties.   Until recently, our Kurdish partners protected America's security and  the security of the region as more than 10,000 ISIS fighters and tens  of thousands of ISIS family members were under their control.   Yet, in a matter of weeks, the President has put our progress at  risk. Even with the death of al-Baghdadi, ISIS remains a serious and  resurgent threat. The death of a top ISIS leader does not mean the  death of ISIS.   Scores of fighters remain under uncertain conditions in Syrian  prisons and at risk of a jailbreak. Nearly 800 ISIS supporters and  family members have reportedly escaped. To say that Turkey and Syria  still adequately guard the prisoners is outrageous and dangerous.   At the same time, more than 250,000 Kurdish civilians have fled their  homes because of Turkish attacks. Dozens of civilians, in addition to  possibly hundreds of brave Kurdish fighters, have been killed.   The only winners from the President's disastrous decision in Syria  are ISIS, the Syrian Government, Iran, and Russia.   With these targeted, strong sanctions, America is holding accountable  top Turkish officials responsible for human rights abuses, including  attacking our Kurdish partners.   We are penalizing Turkish financial institutions that perpetuate  President Erdogan's corruption and abuses, and  [[Page H8576]]  are preventing the sale of arms to Turkey for use in Syria.   As the House passes this legislation, we again call upon the  President to support the Kurdish communities and work to ensure that  the Turkish military acts with restraint, and we require the Trump  administration to finally present a clear strategy to defeat ISIS.   Mr. Speaker, I know we have bipartisan support for this legislation.  Again, I salute Ranking Member McCaul and Chairman Engel for bringing  this legislation to the floor, which is a vote to support the sacrifice  of our military and our allies and a vote to restore strength,  strategy, and sanity to our national security policy.   I think that a very strong, bipartisan vote in the House, similar to  the one we had on H.J. Res. 77, will send a very clear message that we  can come together--and we will come together--in the interest of our  national security; in the interest of Americans' values, which are part  of our strength; and, again, to fight terrorism wherever it exists so  that it does not reach our shores.                                time  1600
