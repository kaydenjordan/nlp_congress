 Mr. Speaker, it has been 3 legislative  days since House Democrats undermined the Military Surviving Spouses  Equity Act by shifting the bipartisan bill into a partisan NDAA.   There is still time to correct the widow's tax on spouses of  servicemembers whose lives were lost during Active Duty or through a  service-connected cause.   Members of Congress know this legislation is critical, with over 365  cosponsors being 86 percent of the Members of Congress.   Congress needs to act out of respect of members of the military and  their families.   According to the ongoing WUSA 9 report, thousands of surviving  military spouses feel their government has abandoned them. This is  unconscionable.   As Edith Smith, a surviving spouse, said, those who died earned this  benefit. It is not a gratuitous benefit. They earned it.   Mr. Speaker, in conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never  forget September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.                            ____________________
