 Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Ohio for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, the fundamental truth is that the Second Amendment  guarantees the right of law-abiding citizens to keep and bear arms to  protect themselves and their loved ones.   America's Founders spoke on this issue extensively. Benjamin Franklin  warned that those who would give up essential liberty to purchase a  little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety. Benjamin  Franklin was right. The American tradition of self-reliance, self- determination, and self-defense has been fierce. It has been what makes  this country so exceptional and so great.   Today, the House will vote on legislation that would undermine that  very right. What is worse is that both of these bills would not have  prevented mass shootings or tragedies across this Nation. Those are  awful events. We all agree that those events are awful. But in those  cases, the criminal either passed a background check or they stole  their weapons.   We cannot sacrifice our rights by passing laws that will make our  families less safe and laws that criminals will simply ignore. We must  always protect and preserve our God-given Second Amendment right.    Mr. Speaker, point of order. I would request that the  colleague from Virginia direct his remarks to you and not to other  colleagues.
