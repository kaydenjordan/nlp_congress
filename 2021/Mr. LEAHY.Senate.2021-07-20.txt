 Mr. President, I will oppose this amendment today. I base  it on my experience as an advocate for victims of crime that began when  I was a prosecutor, certainly during the time when I was the Vice  President of the National District Attorneys Association and on their  executive board.   If you look at the Victims of Crime Act Fix bill, it has passed the  House. It would deposit the proceeds in deferred prosecution agreements  and nonprosecution agreements into the Crime Victims Fund. And I  mention this because in recent years, deposits into the fund have  shrunk significantly. They actually threatened the ability to sustain  payments to crime victims.   Senator Toomey's amendment would create a point of order if  expenditures from the Crime Victims Fund fall below the 3-year average.  The current 3-year average is $583 million, assuming the CBO estimate  of collections in fiscal year 2021 is $750 million.   The Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agency Subcommittee,  Appropriations, has worked to ensure the release of the fund is more  than the 3-year average. For example, in fiscal year 2021, the CJS bill  allows spending of $2 billion--$2.015 billion out of the fund. Now,  that is $1.5 billion more than the 3-year average of fiscal years 2018,  2019, and 2020.   I mention all of this because I support the crime victims. I spent a  career supporting and advocating for them. I did that, as I said,  before I was in the Senate, when I was a prosecutor.   But this amendment offered by Senator Toomey impinges on the ability  of the Appropriations Committee to do its job. If it were adopted, here  is what would happen. It would create a point of order. It would delay  the movement of any appropriations bill that the Crime Victims Fund is  part of.   I just put over on the--talking about the average--we have been  releasing more than the 3-year average of the fund over the last  several fiscal years, but then there could be a time when there is not  enough funds to keep it sustainable.   And that is why we are here to vote on the underlying bill, the VOCA  Fix Act. That would direct deposits from nonprosecution agreements and  deferred prosecution agreements to go into the Crime Victims Fund so we  can continue to spend out of the fund at or above current levels. And  without it, the spending would continue to fall.   Victims groups like the National Alliance to End Sexual Violence are  asking for clean passage of this act.   I went down through it and looked at the various States. I mention a  couple: the Pennsylvania Coalition Against Domestic Violence, the  Children's Advocacy Centers of Pennsylvania. The Pennsylvania Coalition  Against Rape authored an opinion piece on July 5. They ask for clean  passage of the VOCA Fix Act.   By the way, this bill also has nearly 60 cosponsors, including a  number of my Republican colleagues like Senators Murkowski, Graham,  Cornyn, and Grassley. And the Senate bill is identical to the one  before us, H.R. 1652.   Now, if we don't include amendments, if we pass this bill, we can get  it to the President for signature immediately. We can help to ensure  deposits into the Crime Victims Fund. That means all crime victims are  going to be helped. I want that passage without an amendment.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record  a letter from the Association of Prosecuting Attorneys, the National  Latin@ Network for Healthy Families, Council of State Governments,  Futures Without Violence, and numerous others be placed in the Record  at the conclusion of my remarks   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                      July 13, 2021.      Hon. Member,      U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.        Dear Senator: The organizations below, comprising the       national VOCA stakeholder workgroup, are writing today to       urge you to support a floor vote on the House-passed H.R.       1652, the VOCA Fix to Sustain the Crime Victims Fund Act of       2021 (``VOCA Fix Act'') by allowing a vote on the bill. We       further urge you to vote in favor of the VOCA Fix Act and to       oppose controversial amendments.        The bipartisan and bicameral VOCA Fix Act, introduced in       the Senate as S. 611 by Senators Durbin, Graham, Baldwin,       Grassley, Feinstein, Cornyn, Klobuchar, and Murkowski, is a       narrowly-focused, carefully negotiated technical fix to       address an immediate crises--massive cuts to Victim of Crime       Act (``VOCA'') victim service grants and insufficient funding       for victim compensation.        VOCA grants are funded by monetary penalties associated       with Federal criminal convictions--they are not funded with       taxpayer money. In recent years, deposits into the VOCA's       Crime Victims Fund (``CVF'' or ``the Fund'') have dropped       dramatically, due to the Department of Justice's increasing       reliance on deferred prosecution and non-prosecution       agreements (DPAs/NPAs). Unlike criminal convictions, monetary       penalties associated with DPAs/NPAs are deposited into the       General Fund of the Treasury--they do not go into the Crime       Victims Fund, despite being outcomes based on the same       crimes.        The VOCA Fix Act fixes this discrepancy by making a       technical fix to deposit monetary penalties associated with       DPAs/NPAs into the CVF instead of the General Fund, in       alignment with the original intent of the statute. It also       increases funding for state victim compensation programs and       includes other provisions outlined in this letter of support,       signed by more than 1,710 national, regional, state, Tribal,       and local organizations and government agencies.        The VOCA Fix Act passed the House with overwhelming       bipartisan support, but it has stalled in the Senate due to       attempts to use the non-controversial VOCA Fix Act to force a       vote on the controversial use of Changes in Mandatory       Programs (``CHIMPs'') in the Appropriations process.       Recognizing the critical need to pass the VOCA Fix Act       without further delay, Senators are pursuing a consent       agreement to vote on both the VOCA Fix Act and an amendment       by Senator Toomey relating to the use of the VOCA CHIMP. We       urge you to support a floor vote on the VOCA Fix Act by       letting the unanimous consent agreement to go through. Upon       the acceptance of the consent agreement, we urge you to vote       in favor of the VOCA Fix Act.        We also urge you to vote against Senator Toomey's amendment       to limit the use of the VOCA offset by requiring       Appropriators to release the average of the past three years'       deposits from the CVF annually. We recognize Senator Toomey's       desire to help survivors, but his amendment is not the best  [[Page S4972]]       way to do so. While on the surface, this proposal may seem       reasonable, it actually has the potential to be harmful. The       average of the past three years' deposits was less than $500       million. If there was no balance in the Fund to offset the       low deposits, victim service grants would have been $200       million--a cut of 95% compared to four years ago. The cuts to       grants over the last few years have been catastrophic, but a       cut of 95% would completely decimate the entire victim       service infrastructure. The $2 billion balance allowed by       Senator Toomey's amendment is less than yearly disbursement       over the past five years and is insufficient to meet the       needs of survivors.        It is also important to note that funding is not being       diverted from victims to pay for other programs, as stated by       those seeking to amend the VOCA Fix Act. When the CVF is used       as a paper offset, funds are not transferred to pay for other       programs--they remain in the Fund. Moreover, despite claims       to the contrary, Appropriators are not hoarding money in the       Fund to use as an offset. Over the past several years, they       have reduced the balance in the Fund from $13 billion in       Fiscal Year 2017 to an anticipated $2.5 billion at the end of       this fiscal year by increasing grants to victim service       providers. While $2.5 billion may seem like a large balance,       in actuality, it would only cover one year's VOCA grants at       Fiscal Year 2020 levels, which were already at a five-year       low. The amendment has the potential to bring down future       funding bills and cause a government shutdown, and a bill       with this language would not pass the House of       Representatives. We ask that you join us in opposing this       amendment.        Victims, survivors, and victim service organizations are       telling us that they are cutting services, laying off staff,       and even closing. They are asking for the VOCA Fix Act--they       are not asking for CHIMP reform. While we wait for passage,       survivors and advocates have watched criminal settlements       totaling more than $545 million directed towards the General       Fund rather than into the Crime Victims Fund this calendar       year, because this technical fix has not passed. Ultimately,       there may be merit in holding a conversation about the       structure of Congressional spending bills, but the VOCA Fix       Act is not the appropriate forum. The use of CHIMPs is       controversial; the VOCA Fix Act is not.        The VOCA Fix Act is a narrowly tailored, carefully       negotiated technical fix bill to address the immediate needs       of survivors, and the Senate must act now to pass this       critical legislation without any amendments. On behalf of a       broad and committed group of national, regional, state,       Tribal, and local stakeholders, we urge you to support a vote       on the VOCA Fix Act, to vote in favor of the VOCA Fix Act,       and to vote against the Toomey amendment. Every delay allows       potential funds that should be deposited into the Crime       Victims Fund to serve victims to instead be deposited into       the General Treasury. The House passed the VOCA Fix Act more       than four months ago with overwhelming bipartisan support; we       urge the Senate to similarly pass the House-passed VOCA Fix       Act, as is, immediately.
