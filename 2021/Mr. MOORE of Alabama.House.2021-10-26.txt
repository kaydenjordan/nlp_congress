 Madam Speaker, Democrats are always looking for  a new way to pick your pocket. Their latest scheme, tucked away in  their reconciliation bill, is a heat your home tax just in time for  winter.   This tax would eliminate almost 90,000 American jobs and increase  Americans' heating bills by up to $242 per year. Pain from the heat  your home tax would hit Americans who are already suffering from the  Biden energy crisis.   The national average for a gallon of gasoline reached $3.38 on  Monday--the most Americans have paid since Biden was Vice President.  And the heating home costs are already projected to rise as much as 54  percent on some homes and households in America.   This crisis is driven by bad policies. On Joe Biden's first day in  office, he killed 11,000 American jobs by blocking the Keystone  pipeline. Basically, Joe Biden's energy policy is this: You kill the  Keystone pipeline and then you allow Russia a green light to build a  pipeline, and then you beg OPEC to increase production, and you buy  solar panels from China.                            ____________________
