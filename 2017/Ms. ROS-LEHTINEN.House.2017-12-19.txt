 Mr. Speaker, I am proud to rise today to celebrate  the 100th anniversary of Jackson Health System.   Jackson Memorial Hospital first opened its doors in south Florida a  century ago as a 13-bed community hospital. In the years since, Jackson  has grown to become one of the Nation's largest and most renowned  public hospital systems.   But, throughout the many periods of growth and expansion, Jackson has  remained true to its core mission: to build and improve the health of  our community by providing the best possible care for Miami's  residents.   Mr. Speaker, by caring for those most in need, Jackson Health System  has created a solid foundation that has empowered our families to  thrive.   Congratulations to their leader, Carlos Migoya, and all of the staff  of Jackson Health System on a century of excellence and care to our  community. I thank them for continuing to serve as stewards of  Jackson's legacy and for continuing to use healthcare to improve  people's lives and to help shape their bright futures.
