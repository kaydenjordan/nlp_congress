 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of my bill, H.R. 26,  the Construction Consensus Procurement Improvement Act of 2021.   It is vitally important that the Federal Government procure complex  design and construction services that remain on time and on budget.  This bill would prevent the Federal reverse auctions procurement  process from being used for complex projects. Using reverse auctions  for major construction projects only causes problems, such as delays  and wasteful spending.   Who pays the price?   The taxpayer.   The Federal Government must be good stewards of taxpayer dollars and  get the best possible services for the best price. As ranking member of  the Committee on Oversight and Reform, I want to continue to deliver  savings to the taxpayer and make stakeholder interaction with the  government much easier, and H.R. 26 does just that.   This bill is the result of strong bipartisan, bicameral negotiations  and the hard work of many private sector groups. I thank Senator  Portman for his hard work on this legislation last Congress. I am also  thankful for the support of my Committee on Oversight and Reform  colleague, Mr. Khanna.   Mr. Speaker, I would also like to particularly thank the Construction  Industry Procurement Coalition, the Association of General Contractors,  the Design-Build Institute of America, the American Subcontractors  Association, and numerous others for their hard work on this  legislation.   I look forward to continuing to work with the majority to advance  commonsense legislation to make government more efficient and  effective. I encourage the Senate to quickly consider this bill and  send it to the President's desk.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my House colleagues to support H.R. 26.
