 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the motion to  reconsider be considered made and laid on the table and the President  be immediately notified of the Senate's action.                            ____________________     I further ask that the Senate proceed to legislative  session for a period of morning business, with Senators permitted to  speak for up to 10 minutes each; further, that at 2:15 the Senate vote  on the Kobes nomination as under the previous order; finally, if the  nomination is confirmed, that the motion to reconsider be considered  made and laid on the table and the President be immediately notified of  the Senate's action.    Mr. President, I know that we have a number of things  scheduled here, including some farewell speeches from some of our  colleagues. I was scheduled to speak, and I do want to speak, and I  will try not to take too much advantage of the time.   I wanted to speak today and this week about the importance of  treating mental health and the importance of  [[Page S7396]]  the role that law enforcement plays in the way we treat mental health  in this country. For too long, law enforcement and emergency room  personnel have been, in effect, the de facto mental health delivery  system for the country.   The National Institutes of Health says that one in five Americans has  a mental health or behavioral health issue and that one in nine adult  Americans has a behavioral health issue that impacts how they live  every single day.   Two Congresses ago, in the 113th Congress, Senator Stabenow and I  worked to pass legislation--the Excellence in Mental Health Act. What  that did was to create eight State demonstration projects that would  last for 2 years each to see what would happen if we treated mental  health like all other health concerns--something that everybody knows I  believe we should have been doing and something that in eight States we  are doing.   The good news was that 24 States applied, a number that exceeded  every discussion that anybody had about how many States would step  forward and say: We would like to be the States that try to do this  first. Twenty-four States applied. I was certainly proud that Missouri  was one of the eight States chosen to be in the demonstration project.   We are about halfway through the 2-year project, and in our State and  in the seven other States, people have access to mental health services  they didn't have before. Most Missourians are within a relatively short  drive of a facility that will treat their mental health problem like it  was any other health problem, and as we begin to do that, I think we  are going to see the kind of impact on law enforcement and the kind of  help that law enforcement needs as well.   Just a couple of years ago, I rode with both the crisis intervention  teams in Kansas City and in my hometown in Springfield. In Springfield  what I saw there were officers dealing with a 24/7 linkup to the  Burrell mental health clinic, the local and regional mental health  provider.   Sixteen officers, at that time, had, in effect, iPads that linked  them up to a mental health professional. It didn't take too long--and I  think this would be indicative of what most law enforcement officials  see almost every day--before we came on someone huddled in the alcove  of a building that was vacant who clearly had a behavioral health  problem. It wasn't at that point a drug problem or an alcohol problem.  They were where they were because they had a mental health problem.   The officer was able to Skype back immediately with a mental health  professional. What I was really most interested in is that even with a  well-trained officer who knew exactly what they were doing and how to  do it--even with that officer there--as that officer linked the person  up with someone--in effect, a telemedicine linkup with a mental health  professional--you could tell that that person was more comfortable  talking to the iPad and communicating that way than he was with the  officer that was right there with him, and it wasn't because the  officer was in any way intimidating or unprofessional. It was just  because of what it was--a linkup with someone at another site, but  someone who clearly was well prepared to deal with those kinds of  issues.   So we are going to see that this benefitted the kinds of things that  the mental health community can do to provide more resources to the law  enforcement community. The Excellence in Mental Health Act is providing  a service and, I think, producing real results.   I would also say, as I conclude my remarks on this topic, that what  we hope to see is a significant number of people. Remember, I said NIH  said that one out of five adult Americans has a behavioral health  issue. What happens when you deal with that behavioral health issue in  terms of how you deal with all of the other health issues that that  individual or that community will be dealing with? What happens if  somebody is feeling better about themselves--taking their medicine,  eating better, sleeping better, showing up for the doctor's  appointments, showing up for the dialysis appointment, doing what they  ought to be doing?   I believe what we are going to find and what has been found in  earlier big county studies of this kind is that actually doing the  right thing winds up saving money, not costing money. But also doing  the right thing for police officers, for people in emergency rooms and  providing the kinds of connections and alternatives needed make a big  difference.   For all of the healthcare providers and the law enforcement  individuals involved, I am grateful for what they do, and I think we  are seeing some real results from the bill that this body passed,  President Obama signed into law, and is producing great results.   I yield the floor.
