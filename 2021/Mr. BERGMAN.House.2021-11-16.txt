 Mr. Speaker, in Michigan's First District, we are  hunkering down for the usual long but beautiful winter season. We enjoy  it, and we prepare for it.   This year, that preparation is much more complicated. The supply  chain crisis, labor shortages, and inflation have made our gas and  groceries that much more expensive at a time when we can't necessarily  afford it at that working-family level.   In my district, we are truly feeling the negative impacts of this  administration's failed policies. The White  [[Page H6277]]  House and congressional Democrats seem to be living in a different  reality, telling us that the President's agenda ``will not add to  inflationary pressure.''   Mr. Speaker, the real risk here would be passing the Democrat's  multitrillion-dollar tax and spend package. My colleagues in the House  seem to be turning a blind eye to what Americans are actually  experiencing.   Make no mistake, spending trillions, while punishing the middle class  and job creators, will make inflation worse.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to oppose this legislation.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I am proud to rise today in support of my  bill, H.R. 4626, as amended, the Department of Veterans Affairs  Assessment by Independent Measures Act, or AIM Act.   When it comes to bureaucracies, I have never believed that  maintaining the status quo is an acceptable path forward. In fact, it  is an impossible path forward.   The world is constantly in a state of change. The way American men  and women defend freedom around the world, and the way those same men  and women seek care when they come home, is constantly changing as  well. The VA healthcare system must change, too, or it will never  fulfill its obligations to all of our veterans.   That is where the AIM Act comes in. The AIM Act would require an  independent assessment of the operations and management of the VA  healthcare system once every decade, beginning in 2025.   The independent assessment framework in the AIM Act is modeled after  the independent assessment that was required in the Choice Act, which  was signed into law in 2014 following the nationwide VA access and  accountability crisis that saw some veterans literally dying on VA  facilities' waiting lists.   That independent assessment was completed in 2015, and the findings  and recommendations it contained directly underpinned many of the  necessary improvements that have occurred in the VA healthcare system  since then.   The AIM Act would ensure that this successful model is not a one-and- done but instead regularly recurs to ensure that the VA keeps improving  for veterans long into the future.   I am grateful for the support the AIM Act has received from veterans  service organizations, particularly the Veterans of Foreign Wars, the  Wounded Warrior Project, and the Minority Veterans of America.   I am also grateful for the bipartisan support the AIM Act received in  the Veterans' Affairs Committee. I thank all of my colleagues for that.  I hope that there will be a similar show of bipartisan support for the  bill today. My fellow veterans have earned it.
