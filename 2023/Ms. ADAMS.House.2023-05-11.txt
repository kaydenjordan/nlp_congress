 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the president of  Johnson C. Smith University, Clay Armbrister.   JCSU is Charlotte's own HBCU and the only accredited historically  Black college or university in the 12th Congressional District.   The Golden Bulls have a rich legacy in the Biddleville neighborhood  in Charlotte that extends all the way back to 1867. President  Armbrister has helped preserve and extend that legacy during his  tenure.   I have been so very proud to work with President Armbrister to grow  Johnson C. Smith University. For 5 years, President Armbrister has been  a transformative leader, not only for JCSU but for the West End and the  entire Charlotte community.   Under Clay's leadership, JCSU has modernized its campus, overcome a  pandemic, and led a historic fundraising drive to raise $80 million to  support the university's academic and career-ready programs.   He courageously excused student loan debt for hundreds of students.   Last year, I said President Armbrister is one of the true heroes  behind America's progress during the pandemic, and he has continued to  earn that compliment with his leadership in our community.   I am so very proud to call him a friend. I wish him and his  incredible wife, Denise, the very best in their future endeavors, and I  congratulate him on his retirement. May God bless him.                            ____________________
