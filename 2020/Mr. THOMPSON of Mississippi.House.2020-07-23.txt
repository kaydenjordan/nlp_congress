 Madam Speaker, I would like to enter  into a colloquy with the agriculture chair, Mr. Bishop of Georgia.   Mr. Bishop, I have a concern about the eligibility of Piney Woods  School and Farm in Piney Woods, Mississippi, which is the only African- American boarding school left in America to receive Community  Facilities Grant funding.   Currently, Piney Woods is ineligible to receive Community Facilities  Grant funding because its geographic location is considered to be in a  suburban area in Mississippi, when, in fact, the school's location  should be designated as rural. The current designation is limiting  Piney Woods from receiving much-needed funding.   Can we work together to try and find a solution?   I yield to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Bishop), the subcommittee  chair, for an answer.    Madam Speaker, reclaiming my time.   I look forward to working with the gentleman from Georgia. There is  no question that Piney Woods Country Life School is a model for helping  shape minds for the future. Their record speaks for itself. The kids  who are fortunate to matriculate there come out and actually do very  well in society. And so it is with this spirit that I offer the  opportunity for us to help Piney Woods be even better. I look forward  to working on crafting a solution.
