 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to applaud the passage of the  Veterans Administration Scheduling Accountability Act.   All too often, I hear from veterans across the 22nd District of New  York who have waited months, and some years, to have their claims  addressed.   In their service to our great Nation, our veterans sacrifice so much.  They should never die waiting for care they deserve and need. That is  why the House took important steps to reform the scheduling and appeals  process while expanding access to the important resources that our  veterans depend on. This bill will hold every VA accountable. We seek  to correct a wrong that has hurt so many of our veterans.   On behalf of the veterans in the 22nd District, I thank my colleague,  Representative Jackie Walorski, and my colleagues in the House, for  putting our Nation's heroes first and unanimously passing this  important piece of legislation right before Memorial Day.                            ____________________
