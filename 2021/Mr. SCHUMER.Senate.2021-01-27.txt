 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, it has been 3 weeks since a mob of  domestic terrorists stormed the U.S. Capitol in an effort to thwart our  democratic system of government. In the weeks since, the underlying  threat of violence to our government remains of great concern.   One of the most important responsibilities of the new  administration--of any administration--is to protect our country and  its citizens. The Senate must continue the process of confirming  President Biden's Cabinet by installing Alejandro Mayorkas to serve as  Secretary of Homeland Security. In truth, we should have been able to  confirm Mr. Mayorkas days ago. He is supremely well qualified for the  job. He is the son of immigrants whose family escaped from the  Holocaust, a prosecutor, a veteran of 7 years who led the Agency's  response on Ebola, cyber security, border security, counterterrorism,  and domestic terrorism.   Just 4 years ago, President Trump had his Secretary of Homeland  Security installed on Inauguration Day. As four previous Secretaries of  Homeland Security under Presidents of both parties wrote recently:  After the attacks on the Capitol on January 6, it is more urgent than  ever to have in place an experienced, capable, and Senate-confirmed  leader. That person is Mayorkas.   That was four previous Homeland Secretaries from both parties.   Unfortunately, because of the objections of one Member, the Senate  has not been allowed to vote on this nomination yet. It is the Senate's  responsibility to make sure national security officials are on the job  and keeping our country safe.   My friends on the other side don't have to agree with Mr. Mayorkas on  the finer points of every policy, but surely we can all agree that he  knows the Department, he understands the threats to our Nation's  security, and he has what it takes to lead DHS. The Senate must confirm  his nomination in very short order, and we will make sure that happens.   We must continue on to the rest of the President's Cabinet as well.  The President's nominee for Secretary of Transportation was voted out  of committee this morning on an overwhelmingly bipartisan vote, 21 to  3. With cooperation, the Senate can and should confirm Mr. Buttigieg  soon, as well.                            ____________________     On climate, today President Biden is set to announce a  slew of Executive actions on climate, including critical measures to  increase the conservation of Federal lands, reduce oil and gas  development, and  [[Page S158]]  place environmental justice, green jobs, and, yes, science at the heart  of our Nation's climate policy.   I think Americans are saying: Welcome back, science. We are glad you  are playing a role in the decisions we make and not being ignored and  trampled on like the previous administration did. Understanding that  the United States cannot defeat a global threat on its own, the Biden  administration has already wisely joined the Paris accords and will  also propose convening an international climate summit this year, on  Earth Day.    These Executive actions are a very strong opening push by the Biden  administration to refocus our Nation's energy toward the threat of  climate change. President Biden's commitment to deal with climate  change is unquestioned. He is off to a fast start, and it couldn't come  soon enough.   The Federal Government has a great deal of power to set the direction  for our Nation's energy and environmental policy, but climate change  represents an existential threat to our country and our planet. Every  tool in the toolbox should be brought to bear. In my view, President  Biden should consider the declaration of a national emergency on  climate change.   Former President Trump, of course, issued an emergency declaration to  divert funds toward an expensive and ineffective border wall when there  was no emergency at all. Declaring one for climate change--an actual  emergency--would be a giant step in the right direction, and it would  allow President Biden to tap additional resources and pursue additional  policies in the fight against climate change, even if Republicans in  Congress remain intransigent and unable to recognize the severity of  this crisis.   Japan, the United Kingdom, New Zealand, and scores of regional and  local governments have declared states of emergency on climate change.  The United States would send a powerful signal to the world about our  commitment to defeating climate change if we did so as well.                            ____________________     Mr. President, now on COVID, as I mentioned yesterday,  the Senate will soon begin the process of considering legislation to  help the country defeat COVID-19 and provide relief to those Americans  who are still suffering great economic hardship.   There has been a lot of action in Washington recently. We inaugurated  a new President, a new administration is getting off the ground, and an  impeachment trial of the former President will commence in a few weeks.  But COVID-19 hasn't gone anywhere, unfortunately. Americans are still  losing their jobs. American businesses are still closing. Americans are  still getting sick. Americans are still dying.   The needs in our country are still great, and the Congress must  pursue a bold and robust course of action to defeat the disease and get  our country back to normal. We must not--we must not--repeat the  mistakes of 2008 and 2009, when Congress was too timid and constrained  in its response to the global financial crisis.   The Congressional Budget Office has told us last fall that COVID-19,  the pandemic, has taken more than $17 trillion out of our economy--$17  trillion out of the economy. The danger of undershooting our response  to COVID-19 is far greater than overshooting it. So Congress must  pursue a bold response to the prevailing crisis of our time.   Here in the Senate, we want that work to be bipartisan. Let me say  that again. We want the next legislative response to COVID-19 to be  bipartisan. We want to work with our Republican colleagues, if we can,  to include their ideas and input if they will offer them. That is our  preference. But if our Republican colleagues decide to oppose the  necessary, robust COVID relief that is needed, we will have to move  forward without them. It is not our preference, but dealing with this  crisis in a bold and sufficient way is a necessity. The Senate is going  to respond to the country's needs and deliver help to the American  people fast.                            ____________________     Mr. President, now on impeachment, finally, I want to  address the vote the Senate took yesterday on the point of order raised  by the junior Senator from Kentucky. I regret to say, for 45 Republican  Senators to vote for a spurious constitutional objection to the coming  impeachment trial was deeply, deeply irresponsible.   The trial is still 2 weeks away. The constitutional objection has  been completely debunked by more than 150 constitutional scholars  representing the entire breadth of the political spectrum, including  very prominent conservatives. But only five Republican Senators were  willing to take a principled stand against this reckless and ill- advised effort by Members of this body who are eager to excuse  President Trump's campaign to overturn the election and, apparently, to  excuse his incitement of the mob that every one of us experienced in  this Capitol.   I would simply say to all of my colleagues: Make no mistake. There  will be a trial, and the evidence against the former President will be  presented in living color for the Nation and every one of us to see  once again. No one will be able to avert their gaze from what Mr. Trump  said and did and the consequences of his actions. We will all watch  what happened. We will listen to what happened, and then we will vote.  We will pass judgment, as our solemn duty under the Constitution  demands, and, in turn, we will all be judged on how we respond.   I am glad to see my colleague from Vermont here, as well as my  colleague from Illinois.    I yield the floor                            ____________________     Mr. President, I move to proceed to executive session to  consider Calendar No. 4.    Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.    I ask unanimous consent that the mandatory quorum call  for the cloture vote be waived.
