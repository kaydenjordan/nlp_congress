 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from  Ohio for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 8199, the 504 Credit Risk  Management Improvement Act of 2020.   Small businesses are the core of our Nation's entrepreneurship,  innovation, and creative activity. It is paramount that Congress invest  its resources into empowering small businesses to fuel job growth and  transform communities.   The 504 program gives small businesses necessary resources, and this  legislation will bolster and improve the implementation of that  program. By giving small businesses access to fixed-rate financing,  through the 504 program, small businesses that have limited capital are  able to afford costly down payments.    This program has made Queen City Catering a success story. When the  company needed financing for a larger location, they turned to Business  Expansion Funding Corporation, a certified development company in  Charlotte that helped them secure a 504 loan. These funds led to a new  state-of-the-art kitchen for high-quality food preparation, management  offices, high-tech conference areas, and warehouse space for rental  items.   Better yet, since receiving this 504 loan, Queen City Catering has  grown astronomically. This small business investment allowed the  business to grow, while creating jobs for North Carolinians.   Fellow Members of Congress, I implore you to imagine the impact that  504 loans have on small businesses in your communities. That is exactly  what my colleague, Congresswoman Craig, did with me when we crafted the  504 Credit Risk Management Improvement Act.   While the existing loan program has offered financial tools to help  small businesses, we must act today and improve the program so it can  help businesses serve their communities for years to come.   The bill before us outlines important capabilities of the SBA's  Office of Credit Risk Management pertaining to the 504/CDC Loan  Program. Importantly, the changes will ensure the program's  [[Page H6078]]  longevity by detailing how it should supervise a file review.   Additionally, this legislation requires the SBA to provide clear  direction to certified development companies as they navigate  environmental rules and regulations.   Lastly, this will help ensure that the program continues to operate  on the fees built into the program.   I am confident that these improvements will strengthen the program  for both small businesses and the program's lending partners. This  legislation is a step in the right direction to ensure that small  businesses can thrive as they bring innovative goods and services to  consumers around the country.   I want to, again, thank Congresswoman Craig, Chairwoman Velazquez,  and Ranking Member Chabot for their work and their help on this  legislation. I urge my colleagues to support it.                                time  1545
