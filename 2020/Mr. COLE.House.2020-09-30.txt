 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume, and  I thank my good friend, the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr.  McGovern), the distinguished chairman of the Rules Committee, for  yielding me the customary 30 minutes.    Mr. Speaker, we are here today to consider a rule that provides for  consideration of a single item, the Senate amendment to H.R. 925, the  majority's second attempt to pass a partisan wish list under the guise  of a coronavirus relief bill.   There are two quotes that sum up how I feel about today's rule, Mr.  Speaker. The first, widely misattributed to Albert Einstein, is that:  ``The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over  again and expecting different results''; the second, accurately  attributed to Yogi Berra, is that today's action feels like: ``It's  deja vu all over again.''   Today, the House majority is bringing up again a partisan coronavirus  relief package, just as they did in May.   As in May, today's bill was written with only Democratic input.   Like in May, today's bill has a massive price tag. This sits at $2.4  trillion.   As in May, today's bill contains a plethora of provisions that are  completely unrelated to coronavirus relief.   Indeed, just like in May, today's bill is more akin to a Democratic  policy wish list than to an actual relief bill.   And just as in May, we all know what the end result will be: the  Senate will not pass this bill and the President will not sign it into  law.   But it doesn't have to be this way, Mr. Speaker.   For whatever reason, the majority is refusing to truly negotiate on a  bipartisan coronavirus relief bill that would provide real relief for  millions of Americans.   I grant them, discussions have taken place. But when the majority  continues to insist that it is their way or no way and refuses to meet  Republicans halfway, one begins to understand how we got to this point.   Mr. Speaker, I would remind both this Chamber and the American people  that it has been the Democrats who have blocked a second coronavirus  relief bill. Just last week, House Democrats blocked Republicans from  bringing up a simple bill to extend the Paycheck Protection Program. In  the Senate, Democrats blocked the majority from bringing up a clean  extension of PPP, and later, Democrats blocked a Republican-led  coronavirus relief bill from being considered, not because they  disagreed with anything in the bill, but because they just thought  other things should be in the bill.   All of these bills are bills that the President would have signed  into law.   At a time when so many Americans are truly suffering, why the House  majority insists on blocking these measures and bringing up their own  partisan wish list instead does not make sense to me.   But what makes even less sense is the egregious process they followed  in considering this bill. The process, if you can even call it that,  violated House rules and any notion of fairness.   The bill was introduced on Monday night after being drafted in secret  in Speaker Pelosi's office without any Republican input whatsoever. No  committee held a hearing on it and no committee marked it up. That is  violating the McGovern rule, which requires any bill coming before the  Rules Committee to have a hearing and a markup in the committee of  jurisdiction.   The bill is 2,152 pages long, and I highly doubt that most Members  have had time to read, review, and digest it in that short amount of  time.   I will say this, though: it does set a record. It spends $1 billion a  page. That is pretty remarkable spending.   When your process is that bad, no wonder the output is as bad as the  bill we are considering today.   The majority claims that today's bill is a scaled-down version of the  Heroes Act, a bill we considered back in May. If the majority's funding  calculations on the amount of money we are spending in this bill are  accurate, that may be technically correct, but it still has the exact  same policies and problems as the Heroes Act.   This bill includes massive spending even in areas where we  appropriated funds as part of the CARES Act in March and haven't fully  spent them yet: funding for Democratic policy priorities at the expense  of bipartisan ones; inclusion of provisions that are completely  unrelated to coronavirus relief, like a complicated and controversial  multiemployer pension bill, a provision revealing an existing provision  of law requiring the auction of T-Band spectrum, massive student loan  forgiveness, and the mandating of a national vote by mail.   Some of these may deserve consideration, but what they are doing in a  bill that is supposed to be about providing relief to Americans  affected by the coronavirus pandemic is beyond me.   Mr. Speaker, in any bill this size, it is inevitable that all Members  will find at least one provision that they like, but it is the package  as a whole that is offensive and objectionable.   Drafted without Republican input and with nothing but Democratic  ideas and extraneous policy priorities, it is doomed to the same result  as happened the last time the majority tried this approach.   With their actions today, we will not move the ball forward, we will  not draw closer to a final deal that actually helps Americans. And what  they will do is to continue to pass on the chance to actually work  together as a bipartisan institution and to provide real help to the  American people.   Just as in May, the majority is putting up a partisan bill, when what  we  [[Page H5092]]  need is a bipartisan deal. We did that four times before, Mr. Speaker.  If we chose to, we could do so again.   They are doing the same thing again and expecting a different result.   Mr. Speaker, it didn't have to be this way. There are many areas  where we agree: Paycheck Protection Program; additional money for  schools to reopen; a one-time payment of $1,200 per individual, $500  per child in households making less than $75,000 a year;  additional money to speed the distribution of vaccines.    Those are areas we could bring out one at a time or bundled together  and pass. Instead, my friends have chosen to use a formula they know is  doomed to failure.   As to the amount, the President has actually been flexible. The  original Senate proposal was $1 trillion, no inconsiderable sum of  money, I might add. The President moved that up to $1.5 trillion. That  wasn't good enough, even though many members of my friend's party  actually supported that, the so-called Problem Solvers Caucus.   So I don't want to belabor the point, but I know the difference  between a serious effort to pass legislation that has a chance of  passing in the Senate and being signed by the President and a messaging  exercise, and that is all we are engaged in today. So it is indeed, Mr.  Speaker, deja vu all over again.   Mr. Speaker, I urge opposition to the rule, and I reserve the balance  of my time.    Mr. Speaker, let me yield myself such time as I may consume  just to quickly make a couple of points and then move to my friend from  Arizona.   Far be it for me, Mr. Speaker, to defend the upper body. I am a very  proud Member of this House, as I know all of us here are.   But it is worth noting for the Record the Senate actually had 52  votes to pass a bill. It was my friend's party that kept them from  considering it.   As to the Supreme Court, thank goodness they don't have to deal with  the House of Representatives. That is why they are able to move  quickly. They could move pretty quickly if they had somebody they could  deal with here as well.   It is my friends who have chosen to craft legislation that they know  will be unacceptable, that they know the President will not sign, and  then rail at them for not passing it and the President for not signing  it. That is the height of chutzpah, if you will.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Arizona (Mrs.  Lesko), my distinguished friend and fellow member of the Rules  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman from Arizona an  additional 1 minute.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, if we defeat the previous question, I will offer an  amendment to the rule to immediately bring up H.R. 8265, a bill to  extend the Paycheck Protection Program through the end of the year and  release $137 billion in unspent funds for that program.   Mr. Speaker, every Member of Congress can agree we need to enact  relief for the millions suffering from the pandemic, but we should only  move forward on legislation that can actually be signed into law. The  measure the majority is attempting to pass today simply doesn't fit  that bill. Absent a comprehensive bipartisan package, we should pass  smaller pieces where there is broad consensus, such as the Paycheck  Protection Program.   PPP is of great importance to our constituents. It is helping keep  millions of Americans employed and receiving a paycheck. Members on  both sides of the aisle and in both Chambers agree that this crucial  program needs to be extended, and it could be extended today if the  majority were to bring a bipartisan bill extending PPP to the floor.   But you don't have to take my word for it, Mr. Speaker. Many House  Democrats agree we need to pass a true relief bill now rather than just  another political messaging bill.   A bipartisan letter recently sent to the Speaker stressed that  ``failing to reach a deal is unacceptable and is a failure of duty to  the American people.''   A separate letter sent to the Speaker by eight Democrats last week  demanded ``a vote on a clean relief package that has direct assistance  for those in need.''   Perhaps the most telling is a third letter sent just a few days ago  and signed by 23 Democrats. These Members correctly point out to their  leaders that, absent a bipartisan deal, a ``discharge petition is the  only potential option for COVID-19-related action on the House floor.''   As my colleagues know, House Republicans have such a discharge  petition ready to be signed, and we look forward to these Members  joining us.  [[Page H5094]]    However, I would point out, Madam Speaker, to my colleagues that we  don't have to wait for a discharge petition to succeed. We can take a  clear step right now by defeating the previous question and bringing  H.R. 8265 up for an immediate vote.   Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately  prior to the vote on the previous question.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Chabot), who is my good friend and the ranking  member of the Small Business Committee, to explain more about this  critical bill.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I just want to respond quickly to my friends and point  out something that is striking to me in listening to the debate. There  is almost nothing that any of my friends have mentioned that we don't  support--almost nothing. All these worthy programs for restaurants, all  this relief for individuals, and all this help, we all agree with that.  It is the things my friends don't mention that they have in their bill  that we don't agree with.   We don't agree with more money for Planned Parenthood. That has no  place in this bill.   We obviously have very serious objections to federalizing the  election system of this country, which is State based. That has no  place in this bill.   We obviously don't want to give a tax break to millionaires and  billionaires in blue States by getting rid of the State and local tax  limitations that were placed in.   Those are the things, none of which have anything to do with  coronavirus, that we object to. Those are the things that my friends  are insisting on that they cannot pass in the United States Senate and  that the President will not sign.   If they want to actually pass all these other wonderful things, we  agree with them, and we have been very generous in terms of the amount  of money. The President has moved up on that.   Money is a negotiable item here. Policy positions--poison pills, as  my good friend from Arizona said--are not, and that is what is keeping  us from acting.   Frankly, that is a tragedy and a travesty, in my view, Madam Speaker.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1715     Madam Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I yield myself  the balance of my time.   Madam Speaker, in closing, I urge opposition to the rule. Today's  bill is nothing more than a Democratic wish list masquerading as a  coronavirus relief bill, roughly the same as the partisan bill the  majority passed back in May and it was never taken up by the Senate,  would never be signed by the President.   As in May, today's bill is ultimately doomed. It will not pass the  Senate. The President has made it clear he will not sign it.   Madam Speaker, the majority is missing a real chance here. The  American people are suffering as a result of the coronavirus. It is  past time for the two parties to do what we did very successfully four  times in a row in a 10-week period and work together and actually  provide a package that provides real relief for the American people.   There are plenty of things we agree on, such as the extension of the  Paycheck Protection Program, such as ensuring that more funds are  provided for testing and tracing, such as one-time payments of $1,200  per individual and $500 per child to every household making less than  $75,000 a year. We disagree about the exact amount, but we agree every  American who is unemployed, through no fault of their own, should get  at least $400 more a week.   Frankly, because the Democrats did not take up that offer, those  people have gotten zero since the end of July. We absolutely agree that  we need additional money for the opening of schools.   Madam Speaker, so why don't we put on the floor--it is a novel  suggestion--the things we agree on, the things we know the Senate will  pass and we know the President would sign. The only reason we have  failed to do that is because the Democratic leadership has made the  decision that we have to agree on everything before we do anything.  That is no way to legislate in a body that has a Democratic majority in  the House, a Republican majority in the Senate, and a Republican  President.   The majority is not in the position to dictate to either the Senate  or the President what is going to happen, but they are in a powerful  position to negotiate, and negotiate in good faith, and focus on the  areas where we agree.   Madam Speaker, I think that would move us forward productively. I  think that would be in the best interests of the American people. So I  call on the majority to end this charade and engage with Republicans in  the House, the Senate, and the administration and come to an agreement  on a real bipartisan relief package. I know my friends can do it  because we did it together four times in a row.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the previous  question, ``no'' on the rule, and ``no'' on the underlying bill, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
