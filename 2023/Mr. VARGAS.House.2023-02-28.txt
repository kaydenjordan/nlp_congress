 Mr. Speaker, many times, things around here get topsy- turvy. We have a group here involved in an anticapitalist crusade  against free-market principles, attempting to prevent financial  institutions from allocating capital in accordance with investors'  preferences and risk management priorities.   Under their proposed resolution, investment advisers can no longer  consider environmental, social, and governance factors that materially  impact a company's performance and bottom line. That means that your  hard-earned dollars cannot be adequately invested because you, the  American worker, are now exposed to greater risk.   It is interesting it doesn't say that you must invest in ESG. All  that the Biden administration says is that you can if you want to.   Whatever happened to capitalistic ideals that you should be able to  invest in what you want? You are trying to force people to say: No, you  cannot invest looking at a strategy of ESG.   That doesn't make any sense at all. It doesn't make any sense at all.  It is anticapitalistic. It is antimarket. We should not support this  resolution.
