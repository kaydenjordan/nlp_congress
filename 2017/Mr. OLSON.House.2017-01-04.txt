 Mr. Speaker, as you know, everything is bigger in Texas.  But as any Texan knows, the biggest, most grand thing is the heart of a  Texan. The best example of these hearts are my two dear friends, Kevin  and Trish Kline. Their huge Texas hearts want to end childhood cancer,  so they started the Snowdrop Foundation. They have raised over $1  million in less than 10 years to stop cancer.   They do this for kids like Ana. When Ana was 14, she was told she had  acute leukemia. She wondered: Will my soul be taken away? Who will take  care of my younger brother? Am I going to die?   After nearly a decade of fear, with Snowdrop's help, Ana now says:  Cancer, been there, beat that.   God bless Ana, Snowdrop, Kevin, and Trish.                            ____________________
