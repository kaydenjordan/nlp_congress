 Mr. President, I am proud to recognize Jo-Ann  Clark of Stratham as November's Granite Stater of the Month. Jo-Ann is  a Gold Star mother who, 10 years ago, lost her son, Army Specialist  Christopher Journeau, to suicide. After learning about the benefits  that companion animals can bring to veterans who suffer from  posttraumatic stress disorder--PTSD--the same condition that  Christopher suffered from, Jo-Ann started an organization in her son's  name to fund adoptions of shelter animals by veterans.   Jo-Ann's son, Christopher, served a year in Iraq during Operation  Iraqi Freedom and returned home with undiagnosed PTSD. When Christopher  took his own life 6 months later, Jo-Ann was devastated. Over time, she  learned about the symptoms of PTSD and recognized that her son had  exhibited these symptoms when he returned home from his deployment.   During her research, Jo-Ann also learned that, for some people, a  companion animal can help to mitigate the impacts of PTSD. Jo-Ann began  to research national organizations that help veterans adopt pets, but  she found that many veterans faced significant hurdles in the process.   In response, Jo-Ann founded Chris' Pets for Vets to make it easier  for veterans to adopt companion animals from local shelters. Among  other things, the organization pays the pet adoption fees to ensure  that cost isn't a barrier for any veteran.   Since its founding in 2015, Jo-Ann has helped approximately 400  veterans adopt companion animals at various shelters throughout New  Hampshire. Despite health concerns that she herself has faced, Jo-Ann  has invested an incredible amount of her time and energy into making  Chris' Pets for Vets a success.   Jo-Ann's determination to turn her own loss into productive and  positive support for veterans has helped hundreds of veterans avoid the  confusion and despair that accompanies PTSD. Her commitment is also  consistent with the Granite State's long tradition of military service  and support for veterans. Jo-Ann understands the importance of  supporting veterans in every aspect of their lives, and through Chris'  Pets for Vets, she is both honoring her son's memory while making a  real difference in veterans' lives. I am honored to recognize her  efforts.                            ____________________
