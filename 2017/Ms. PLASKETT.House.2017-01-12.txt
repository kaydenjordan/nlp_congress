 Mr. Chairman, I rise today to speak in opposition to  H.R. 238 and express my concerns with the process and the need for this  legislation at this time.   As we all know, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission is an  independent Federal regulatory agency that, after the 2008 financial  crisis, took on more responsibility to bring  [[Page H409]]  greater transparency and oversight to the multihundred-trillion-dollar  derivatives market.   This new bill, H.R. 238, has new mandates and steps in it which will  force the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to redirect funding from  its core mission to satisfy some of the new mandates within this rule.   H.R. 238 sets a flat reauthorization level of $250 million per year  for the next 5 years, despite the annual average budget requests of the  agency of well over $300 million since passage of Dodd-Frank. Freezing  the funding level makes the new rules almost impossible to enforce.  While we understand the need for the end users, the work of this group  must go forward.   This punitive level effectively caps the CFTC budget and is a  substantial departure from past reauthorization language providing for  such funding as may be necessary for CFTC to carry out its expanded  authorities under Dodd-Frank.   H.R. 238 will make it more difficult for CFTC to function and stifles  its ability to respond quickly to the rapidly changing markets it  regulates.   I thank Chairman Conaway for having allowed us in the last Congress  to have many hearings and discussions about this bill; but we have not  even, as a matter, organized the Agriculture Committee in the 115th  Congress to bring this matter to the floor at this time. Therefore, the  substance of the bill, as well as the process by which it is coming to  this floor, are to be questioned at this time.   I urge my colleagues to vote against the bill.
