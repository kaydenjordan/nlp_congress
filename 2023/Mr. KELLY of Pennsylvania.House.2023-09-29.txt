 Mr. Speaker, there is no reason for any of  you to know me. My whole life has been spent in the private sector, and  I have really come to believe that nobody should serve in the public  sector unless they first have been in the private sector.                                time  1445    My whole life has been about making sure that on the 6th of each  month and the 21st of each month--they are special days for me because  those were days that the people who worked with me every day got paid.   We use something called kitchen table economics. I sit beside David,  and I talk to him all the time. I am more of a person who says: Do you  know what? Let's use kitchen table economics.   Now, I am told that Army manuals are written on a sixth-grade level  so that people can understand them. I want to show you something. I  reduced this down to a $1 bill because when you hear our friends  talking about: Oh, no, you can cut spending. You can do this.   I want you to think not as a Member of Congress who can spend  whatever he or she wants because it is not coming completely out of  your pocket but of the American people, hardworking American taxpayers.   We took a dollar bill and said: Let's look at this dollar bill.  Mandatory spending is money that has to be spent out of every dollar we  collect from a taxpayer, $0.63. Look at this. What do you mean by that?  Well, we are talking about Social Security. We are talking about  Medicare. We are talking about Medicaid.   As all of you know, any loan you ever had, you are actually charged  interest on it, $0.10 of every dollar. This year, that represents $663  billion just to pay for the interest on our debt. That leaves us a  whopping $0.27 out of every single dollar we collect from you.   This is the important thing. I am so fed up with elected officials  talking about what they have done for you. They do nothing for you.  Every single thing we do in this country is paid for by a taxpayer or a  debt that you cosigned that you didn't know about.   Now, I told you a bit of my history. I am an automobile dealer. Most  people, 97 percent of the people that we sell a car or truck to, borrow  money to pay for that car or truck. They sign their name to a contract.  We take great time to explain to them exactly what is expected of them.   I told you this $0.63 goes for Social Security, Medicare, and  Medicaid, and 10 percent, $0.10 on each dollar, just to pay our debt  down--$663 billion.   That is why I wanted to reduce it down to kitchen table economics.  This is what is happening to your dollar.   We have $0.27 that we can spend any way we want. What does that mean?  Well, that includes transportation, education, defense, and other  programs. Let's take a look at the $0.27 of our budget, of our  revenues, that we have left to spend.   Of the $0.27 of each dollar, spending for defense, $0.13. We don't  ever want to walk away from that. In the world we live in now, are you  kidding me? We are going to stop that?   That leaves us, my friends, with $0.14 that we can actually control.  Every single dollar out of your pocket is reduced down to this.   When people say that you have to learn how to cut spending, I say:  You gave me a dollar bill? I can adjust $0.14.    Yes.    Yes.    Mr. Speaker, Mr. Schweikert and I sit  beside each other every day, and we keep--honestly, these are things  that keep me up at night.   In another month, my wife and I will be celebrating our 50th  anniversary. I don't know what she was thinking. All I did was ask, and  she said yes. Then, for half a century, we have been going at this.   We have 10 grandchildren, and I am constantly asked by people: How  can you be so responsible when it comes to spending our tax dollars?   We don't want to be irresponsible. David and I sit there, and I have  to tell you, sitting beside him is hard because he has so much going on  in his head at one time. He is like a calculator, and I keep going back  just to the basics.    Social services, natural resources,  science, space, technology, and other programs, we are down to $0.14 of  a dollar. This is a dollar that you paid, by the way. This is out of  your taxes.    The interest is $663 billion of what we  owe.    It keeps growing and growing and growing.  No responsible person would ever sit back and work this model.   The greatest nation the world has ever known, the wealthiest nation  the world has ever known, has been totally irresponsible in the way she  spent her money, and it wasn't done by her.   This incredible group of people that sit down here--remember, I said  this to begin with. I don't believe anybody should serve in public  office until they have been in the private sector. I, myself, have been  in situations on the 6th of the month and the 21st of the month where I  made sure every person that worked at the dealership got paid. There  were many times I did not pay myself because I didn't have enough money  to do it.    The point I think we keep trying to make is: When are we going to  wake up to what is going on? This is a Titanic moment for our country.   The reason I say that is because the Titanic went full speed ahead  into an iceberg. What did the captain of the Titanic see? Just a small  part of the iceberg. They didn't see what was hidden.   My friends, right now the hidden part of what it is that we are  spending--I would just ask you to please think with us as we go through  this.   Reduce it down to where it makes sense and understand what is  happening right now on the floor of this Congress. We represent you. We  do not represent ourselves alone. We represent you.   If we talk about this, and this is where we are--I would just think  at some point, we would sit back and say I cannot watch this and allow  this to happen to hardworking American taxpayers.    When we have talked about this, because we  have time when we are in meetings to talk about this--I want you all to  try and just bear with me a little bit. I know that at some point, you  say, I don't know if I like this dog-and-pony show.   In my district, PA-16, the average income for a family of four--mom,  dad, two children--is $54,000. This is where it really starts to make  sense.   Federal revenues this year will be the highest we have ever gotten.  They are projected to be $5 trillion. That is a lot of money. I mean,  it is almost incomprehensible.   What we are projected to spend is $6.9 trillion. You say, okay, well,  that is only--that is not that far apart. It is only $1.9 trillion.  Here is what it means. This is where it starts to sink in. That means a  family that I represent in western Pennsylvania earning about $50,000 a  year is spending $69,000 a year.   You see what we are getting to. Because when we reduce the numbers  down, first of all, the high numbers are just so high, it is  unimaginable. It is  [[Page H4905]]  also unimaginable that we can ever pay the debt down.   I would just say this to you. If we continue on the path we are  going, if we disregard the basic math that stands there, and the way we  do it--I can tell you that most of the time that I pay monthly bills,  it is at our kitchen table. I open my checkbook, and I start doing the  subtract, subtract, subtract, subtract. I am just trying to understand  how we can be so reckless.   None of you would do this because you have too much respect for your  children and grandchildren's future, and you also have too much respect  for yourselves. Nobody would consciously do this. That is the problem.   One of my favorite movies--I just want to make a point.    The movie I love is called ``A Few Good  Men.'' Have you seen this movie?    Jack Nicholson is in it, and he is being  cross-examined in a military trial.   They keep asking him questions, and at the end, he becomes so  frustrated, he said: ``You can't handle the truth.''   In our lives, the people who raised us--our moms, our dads, our  grandparents--would never have done to us what is happening right now  and what we are doing to our own grandchildren.                                time  1500    We have to handle the truth. We have to face the truth--this path  that we are on, this mission that we are on, and this idea that somehow  we have to get the message out to our hardworking American taxpayers  that our future is being destroyed because of irresponsible spending.   Now, just to be sure on this, your Social Security will never be  touched. Medicare and Medicaid are not going to be touched. The banks  are never going to forgive the interest on our loans. That is the  reality of it.   When you understand it that way, it becomes, oh, my gosh, what are we  going to do? So, we sit there and try to figure out what it is that we  can do to save the future for our children, and I looked at pictures  yesterday with your two children. What are we doing to these kids? What  are we doing to them?    I don't think there are many. The people I  represent are either in ag or in the fields, in the mines, in the  mills, on the rails. They are blue-collar people who are living an  incredibly strong life because those families, the nuclear family, the  mom and dad raising children, are the key to our success going forward,  and an education. Based on the very foundations of what we know is  true, is accurate, has been proven over the ages, the gift that America  gave all of its citizens was the gift of education.   Mr. Schweikert and I can talk all day. I wish the gallery was full. I  really wish the gallery was full. It is not a message of anger. It is a  message of hope. We have to change our spending. We cannot sustain this  irresponsible trajectory.    I would pose this for those of you who  have been watching: Are we making sense? If we are making sense, can  you please raise your hand? Does this make sense to you about what we  are talking about or what we are doing with your dollars? No, it  doesn't make sense.   We can't have the interaction with the gallery.    This is their House. We just happen to  represent them. This is your House. Everything that goes on in this  House is being done by people who are voted in to represent you, not  represent themselves, but represent you. If it is not making sense, we  need to know because, I have to tell you, it makes no sense to me at  all what we are doing, not only to our future, but to our present.   If we can't grasp what is happening right now--that is why I talk  about kitchen table economics. If I can reduce this down to a $1 bill  that I would hand you and say, oh, by the way, that first 73 cents,  give it back to me. You can keep the 27 cents, but then I am going to  take another 13 cents.   When you really get down to it, it is so small what it is that we can  control. In your own lives, you know if you have a mortgage payment  come due, if you have a car payment come due, if you have healthcare  costs come due, you can't walk away from that. At some time or other, a  lender is going to say to you: Do you know what? We would love to help  you, but we can't. The math doesn't work. It is not good for you.   When we talked about this the other day, the real challenge is to  make sure that we understand the path that we are on and not try to  sugarcoat it for you.   I know for myself the hardest lessons in life to learn are the days  that you lost something. I wish I could go back and sit across from my  mother and father and thank them for what they did for us, sit across  from my grandparents and thank them for what they did for us. I can't  thank them enough for what they did for us.   I am just so disappointed that we haven't performed as well as they  have and made it possible for us to enjoy the most incredible country  the world has ever known, a nation of people that is so diverse. There  is no place else in the world. None of us are thinking about leaving to  go someplace else, but it is our responsibility to make sure that it is  a sustainable business model.   If I am not connecting with you, I apologize for that, but only  because we have to understand the dilemma that we are in. This is not a  scare tactic, by the way. This is a wake-up moment that we have to be  aware of what is happening right now to each of us every day in every  way.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from  Arizona for the chance to work with you, and all our friends in the  gallery.   This is called the people's House because it is truly your House.  Anybody that is here was elected, they didn't just walk in and sit  down. They take an oath of office to do things in your best interest.   What we have been trying to go through--and we have looked at all the  different charts. All of you probably have a $1 bill somewhere in your  wallet or your purse. I want you to imagine, taking this $1 dollar  bill, and this is what you actually can control when it comes to the  spending.   So when I hear this thing about: Well, you just have to cut spending,  you just have to cut spending. That is fine. Could you please give me a  road map of what you want us to cut?   That is not accepted because that is not what is being fed to you. I  am going to tell you; we are here because of you. We are here for you.  I thought the dollar bill was the easiest way to show it because we are  all used to that.   Mr. Speaker, I have 10 grandchildren--and maybe you can all relate to  this. When our kids were growing up they liked to go skiing in the  wintertime because I am from Pennsylvania. They came to me one time,  and said, Dad, can we go skiing? I said, No, I don't have the money to  go this weekend. They said, Sure you do. They went under the bed and  picked out my checkbook that has three checks to a page. My son said,  Here, you have all kinds of money. I said, Well, you have to put the  money in before you can write the check to take it out.   That was a concept that a child didn't understand, and unfortunately,  there are too many children representing you here right now that don't  understand what is taking place in every American home and with every  one of our hardworking American taxpayers.   We are here for you. I don't care if you are Republican, Democrat,  Libertarian, or say, I wish you people would stay the heck out of our  lives, we are here representing you. I would ask you to please  communicate with the people who represent you to let them know that you  are concerned about the way the country is going and the future, not  only for our grandchildren and children, but also for us.   I hope we get through, and if we didn't, please contact us. We are  here every day for you. There is no other reason for us to be here  other than for you.
