 Mr. Speaker, I rise today with a heavy heart to  honor the extraordinary life of one Allison Getz, who was a friend, a  public servant, and a true Texan who has left a tremendous mark on  southeast Texas.   Allison's public service wasn't just a job, Mr. Speaker. It was a  calling. From chairing events like the Spindletop Ball to leading  organizations such as the Symphony League, Temple Emanuel, and the Fire  Museum of Texas, she demonstrated a deep commitment to the betterment  of our community.   For the last 9 years, she served as Jefferson County tax assessor- collector. Her innovation and modernization efforts as tax assessor  earned her the prestigious title of Tax Assessor of the Year for the  entire State of Texas in 2021, and that is no easy task.   I speak for southeast Texas, Mr. Speaker. We are forever indebted to  Allison's tireless devotion and dedication. Allison had always said  three things when she talked with anyone. She said, ``How can I help?  Is there anything you need?'' and she always finished with, ``I  appreciate you.''   She was known for her huge heart, her love for her husband, Mike, her  parents, children, grandchildren, and, most of all, southeast Texas.   Brenda and I were deeply saddened to learn about her passing on  October 10, 2023. Our prayers are with her family during this very  difficult time.   As we bid farewell to this remarkable public servant, let's remember  Allison Julia Getz with a great deal of gratitude. May her legacy  continue to inspire us to continue the work of service and compassion  she so fervently championed.   We are grateful for Allison's dedication to community. We will miss  her. She will never be forgotten and will always be in our hearts.             Honoring the Life and Legacy of Joseph ``Joe'' Ruta     Mr. Speaker, I also rise to honor the life and  legacy of one Joseph ``Joe'' Ruta, who passed away on October 14, 2023,  at the age of 96.   Joe Ruta was born on February 25, 1927. He was one of the dwindling  members of the Greatest Generation. Like so many others of his time, he  actually lied about his age to join the Army during World War II. Joe  served in Germany as an ambulance driver at Dachau concentration camp,  where he saw firsthand the horrors of the Holocaust.   Upon returning home, he married Victoria Damico and became a truck  driver. Vicky and Joe were married for 75 years, Mr. Speaker, having  two children, six grandchildren, and nine great-grandchildren. One of  those grandchildren is my chief of staff, Jeanette Whitener. She is a  jewel.   Joe was an avid card player, enjoyed doing puzzles, and especially  enjoyed time spent with his family. He was an amazing husband and an  amazing father, grandfather, and great-grandfather. He served this  country and his family with pride, generosity, and devotion.   Joe will be missed by his family and everyone who knew him. Another  from the Greatest Generation is now gone.            Honoring the Life and Legacy of William ``Bill'' Biggs     Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the life and legacy  of William ``Bill'' Ambrose Biggs III, who passed away on November 16,  2023.   Bill Biggs was born in Abilene, Texas, on February 19, 1937. At the  age of 11, he and his family, Mr. Speaker, moved to Austin, Texas,  where his local adventures would make Tom Sawyer green with envy.   Bill graduated from Austin High School in 1955 and went directly to  the University of Texas, where he graduated with a degree in chemistry  in the year 1959. He also earned his MBA from Texas in 1961.   Following graduation, Bill went on Active Duty in the United States  Army in 1962. During his military career, he earned his Ranger Tab,  graduated from the Army War College, and rose to the rank of colonel in  the U.S. Army Reserve before retiring in 1988. His final commendation  was the Legion of Merit.   Perpetually in motion, after the Army and retiring from his  successful business in Pennsylvania, Bill returned to school, earned  his J.D., juris doctor, from the St. Mary's School of Law in San  Antonio, and graduated in 2020.   He was a tremendous husband, father, grandfather, brother, son,  entrepreneur, citizen, soldier, and devoted Texas Longhorn. Bill will  be sorely missed by his family and all who knew him.                        Bidding Farewell to Bob Harvey     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to bid farewell to a  true titan of Texas, a man whose dedication has left an indelible mark  on the landscape of the greater Houston region, Bob Harvey, the  president and CEO of the Greater Houston Partnership.  [[Page H6733]]    Bob is retiring at the end of 2023. Over the past decade, under his  steadfast leadership, the Houston metro area has witnessed  unprecedented growth and prosperity.   A lifelong Houstonian, Bob dedicated each waking day to championing  the city's expansion, working hand in hand with the business community  to foster opportunities for every single Houstonian.   The Greater Houston Partnership is so much more than the Chamber of  Commerce for one of America's great cities. Under Bob's guidance, the  partnership became a beacon for economic development, advocating for  policies that sustain the thriving business environment while enhancing  the overall quality of life for all its citizens.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues in the House to join me in  congratulating my friend, Bob Harvey, on a well-deserved retirement.   I thank Bob for his service to our dynamic region and our beloved  State of Texas. Blessings to him and his lovely wife, Vicki, and three  great kids, Michael, Tom--who worked for us--and Mary, as he embarks on  the next chapter of a life well lived.             Honoring the Incredible Life of John Paul Spees, Sr.     Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the incredible life  of one Mr. John Paul Spees, Sr., a man whose journey from Gary,  Indiana, through Lake Charles, Louisiana, to the great State of Texas  left an indelible mark on our community.   Born in 1936, he went to be with Jesus on December 1, 2023.   Paul was a proud Navy veteran. Paul served 2 years on the USS  Randolph. His dedication to our great country was surpassed only by his  devotion to his family.                                time  1215    In 1958, he married his beautiful wife, the former Sheila Sarver, and  together they were blessed with four children, of which we get the  privilege of knowing Kelly and her great husband, Paul; four children;  fourteen grandchildren; and four great-grandchildren.   In addition to God, family, and country, Paul loved skeet shooting-- at the world championship level, I might add--tinkering with cars, and  sharing his musical talents on the piano and accordion. Now, we know  where Kelly gets it from.   Mr. Speaker, though, we mourn his passing, we celebrate a life well- lived with Kelly and Paul and all their family. We commend Paul Spees'  legacy of love, laughter, and service.                 Honoring the Life and Legacy of Robert Moody     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and  legacy of a businessman and philanthropist, Robert Moody, who was known  to many of us as Bobby.   Bobby's journey was one of resilience, integrity, and an unwavering  commitment to family and community in the city he cherished, which I am  privileged to represent, Galveston, Texas.   Bobby's legacy is etched in the successes of businesses he shepherded  for over six decades. His leadership transformed National Western Life  Insurance Company and American National Insurance Company into industry  leaders, providing financial security for millions.   Yet, Bobby's heart beat the strongest for our Galveston community,  with a passion that is reflected in the creation of Moody Gardens and  the Moody Neurorehabilitation Institute, both testaments to his  philanthropic vision.   Beyond his professional achievements, Bobby's devotion to his family  was unparalleled. As a loving father, grandfather, and a great- grandfather, he effortlessly blended business acumen with the warmth of  family life.   As we bid farewell to such a stalwart leader, a compassionate  patriarch, and a beacon of generosity, let us hope, pray, and carry  forward Bobby's legacy of resilience, empathy, as well as community  stewardship. The island city of Galveston and the Moody family have  lost a guiding light, Mr. Speaker, but Bobby's spirit lives on in the  institutions he built and in the countless lives that he touched.                 Celebrating 125 Years of Port Arthur, Texas     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate 125 years  of Port Arthur, Texas, a community with a storied history, located in  the 14th Congressional District of the great State of Texas.   The city of Port Arthur began as a dream, quite frankly, of a  railroad man named Arthur Stilwell, who envisioned it as a trade and  tourism center and a port town that eventually wound up bearing his  name.   From tankers navigating the waves to an oil boom that echoed with  promises of prosperity, Port Arthur has been a beacon on the Gulf  Coast. Refineries proudly claiming, ``we oil the world,'' the allure of  Pleasure Island, a Cajun influx adding spice to our culture--I know  that is true because my bride grew up in Italy. She can cook that Cajun  food--and a museum on the Gulf Coast honoring our famous folk, Port  Arthur is a tapestry of history as rich as the soil beneath our feet.   Earlier on, Port Arthur became the heartbeat of the petrochemical  industry. In 1901, following the game-changing gusher of Spindletop,  Gulf Oil Corporation set up shop, followed by Texaco in 1902.   This marked the dawn of a new era.   By 1957, we had become the center of the world's prosperous oil  refining facilities, fueling not just our city, not just our State, but  the world.   Today, Port Arthur is home to over 55,000 hardworking, salt-of-the- Earth folks. It is truly something special.   May I add that as your Representative of Port Arthur, I am grateful  every day to stand before you as the voice of Port Arthur here in the  hallowed Halls of Congress. Representing a community with such a rich  history, where resilience and progress echo from every corner, is an  honor beyond measure.   Here is to 125 years of Port Arthur's pride, their progress, and that  enduring southeast Texas spirit that defines us. Happy anniversary,  Port Arthur.          Congratulations to Norman Reynolds, Jr., on His Retirement     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the Groves  City Marshal, Mr. Norman Reynolds, Jr., on the occasion of his  retirement.   This is the end of an era for the Groves Police Department. Norman  Reynolds, Jr.'s, journey into law enforcement is a tale deeply  intertwined with his family's legacy. A third-generation police  officer, Norman joined the ranks through the encouragement and wise  counsel of his father, Norman Reynolds, Sr.   With over 41 years of dedicated service, Mr. Speaker, Reynolds has  not only become the longest serving law man in southeast Texas, but  also a steadfast pillar in the Groves Police Department.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Marshal Reynolds for his unwavering service, his  commitment to keeping our community safe, and for leading the Groves  Police Department with dignity, as well as honor.   On behalf of a grateful community, it is my absolute honor and  privilege to honor City Marshal Norman Reynolds. I join his wife,  Becky, and his family and friends and colleagues in extending him best  wishes in his retirement.                             Crisis at the Border     Mr. Speaker, I rise to talk about the border for  just a second.   Joe Biden and company have allowed this situation at our southern  border to escalate from a crisis to a full-blown catastrophe. It was  announced just this past Tuesday, CBP saw more than 12,000 encounters  with illegal immigrants along the border.   Let that sink in. Twelve thousand in one day crossed the border-- those are the ones they know about--that American taxpayers are having  to pay for, I want to add. It is unconscionable.   Under this administration's failed policies, every town is a border  town, Mr. Speaker, and the rest of the country is beginning to feel the  strain that my home State of Texas has felt for so long under a  constant stream of illegal migrants encouraged by President Biden's  wide-open border.   That is why I introduced H.R. 6477, a bill that would effectively  reimplement the remain in Mexico protocols established by and under  President Trump.   It would crack down on the rampant abuse of the asylum system that  has enabled so much of this problem. My bill would also hold the  administration responsible for knowing the whereabouts and the status  of illegal migrants throughout the parole process,  [[Page H6734]]  and I urge my colleagues to cosponsor it.    Congratulations to Alvin Community College for Educating Generations                                 from Texas     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to proudly acknowledge  and celebrate the remarkable achievement of Alvin Community College.   Let me hasten to add that it is where I met my beautiful bride of 47  years 49 years ago in the cafeteria there at Alvin Junior College, or  what was called Alvin Junior College.   Alvin Community College, once again, for the seventh time, ACC has  been recognized by their prestigious Aspen Institute as one of the top  150 community colleges in America.   The Aspen Institute's recognition, citing ACC's achievements in  teaching, degree completion, workforce success, and equitable outcomes  underscores the college's commitment to student success. Don't I know  it.   As an ACC alum, I can personally attest to the transformative power  of this institution. It laid the academic groundwork for my future and  even, more importantly, became the serendipitous backdrop where I met  my beautiful bride. Did I mention that, Mr. Speaker? I think I did.   Mr. Speaker, let me just say that I thank Alvin Community College for  not only educating generations of folks from Texas 14th Congressional  District and the neighboring communities, but I congratulate them for  continuing to shine as one of the best in the Nation. ACC rocks.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
