 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the life and  legacy of Dr. Noa Emmett Auwae Aluli, a pillar in the Native Hawaiian  community who passed away on November 30, 2022, at the age of 78.   Born and raised in Kailua on the island of Oahu, Dr. Aluli was one of  five Native Hawaiians in the first graduating class of the University  of Hawaii's School of Medicine.   Even in the final days before his passing, Dr. Aluli mentored  aspiring doctors, made house calls, and provided care to all  generations, from keiki to kupuna.   Dr. Aluli was also a leader of the Protect Kaho`olawe `Ohana, forcing  an end to the bombing practices on the island of Kaho`olawe and its  return to the State of Hawaii.   I will work to continue his legacy to ensure access to healthcare in  rural communities and strengthen pathways to health professions.   This weekend, I will fly to Molokai to celebrate his life with his  extended `ohana. I ask that my colleagues join me in honoring the  legacy of a visionary, Dr. Emmett Aluli.                            ____________________
