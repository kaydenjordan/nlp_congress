 Mr. Speaker, I think it should be noted that this  bill, H.R. 6448, the Invest to Protect Act of 2022, is bipartisan  legislation that would bolster small law enforcement agencies' ability  to address staffing shortages and improve community safety through de- escalation training and other resources.   It was Democrats who spent 2 years negotiating and working with law  enforcement to introduce and pass the comprehensive George Floyd  Justice in Policing Act, which recognized the necessity of balancing  the needs and safety of community in which law enforcement interests  engage. I worked on that.                                time  1415    I worked on that. That is why I tried to make this bill better by  adding  [[Page H8088]]  three additional purposes for grant funding which include issues  dealing with use of lethal force, excessive force, and duty of care.   I am glad that they were added, and grantees who choose these  activities will be required to do this under this particular provision.   We can do this together. And let me be very clear: this is not a  last-ditch effort by Democrats to distance ourselves from efforts to  defund the police.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 6448, the ``Invest to Protect  Act of 2022,''--bipartisan legislation that would bolster small law  enforcement agencies' ability to address staffing shortages and improve  community safety through de-escalation training and other resources.   First, let's be clear--This is not a last-ditch effort by Democrats  to distance ourselves from efforts to defund the police. Democrats have  always been supportive of law enforcement.   We have been accused of spending the last two years bashing the  police. Yet, it was Democrats who spent two years negotiating and  working with law enforcement to introduce and pass the comprehensive  ``George Floyd Justice in Policing Act of 2021''--which recognized the  necessity of balancing the needs and safety of the community with law  enforcement interests.   H.R. 6448 would establish a grant program within the Department of  Justice's Community Oriented Policing Services, or COPS, program  focused on improving recruitment and retention of officers and  providing additional training and access to mental health resources for  small law enforcement agencies.   When police departments are unable to recruit, retain or provide  suitable resources to qualified officers, communities suffer a clear  threat to public safety. A June 2021 national survey by the Police  Executive Research Forum found that, on average, police departments  around the country were filling only 93 percent of their available  budgeted positions.   These officer staffing shortages can cause longer wait times for  emergency calls, fewer crimes cleared, and more overworked officers,  which can threaten both officer health and the quality of life in our  communities.   This bill seeks to address these challenges by providing additional  federal resources to small agencies--that often have the most trouble  accessing federal grant funding--to recruit and retain qualified  officers as well as provide additional training and support.   A 2016 study by the Department of Justice (DOJ) found that of the  12,261 local police departments in the country, 11,638 of them had less  than 100 full-time sworn officers. That is 11,638 police departments  that would be eligible to access much-needed funding as authorized by  H.R. 6448.   Importantly, H.R. 6448 includes limitations on the use of grant funds  for hiring and retention to ensure that the funds are not misused, and  gives preference to applicants that plan to use grant funds for certain  training purposes, including:   de-escalation; the use of lethal and nonlethal force; the duty of  care and the duty to intervene--as well as--   victim-centered training on handling domestic violence situations;  and   safety training for officers responding to calls involving persons  with substance use disorders, mental health needs, disabilities, and  vulnerable youth.   This bill would also allow departments to use funds to provide mental  health services and treatment to officers and collect data on policing  practices that focus on officer and community safety.   In its totality, H.R. 6448 provides critical funding to law  enforcement agencies that need it while encouraging improvement among  their ranks. This bill makes clear that Democrats will continue to  uplift and support law enforcement--as we always have--and we will do  so in a manner that ensures officers are well-trained to keep  themselves safe as well as the people and communities they serve.    Democrats have always been supportive of law  enforcement along with our civil rights friends, and we have put in  firewalls to insist that we work together with law enforcement and  large and small entities and that we work with on behalf of justice for  our constituents and for providing wellness to our police officers,  providing intervention of violence, and as well to ensure that we  assist in cases that are backlogged. Democrats have been at the  forefront. I am very glad to say that we don't ask to defund the FBI,  we ask to be supportive of our community.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 6448, the  ``Invest to Protect Act of 2022,''--bipartisan legislation that would  bolster small law enforcement agencies' ability to address staffing  shortages and improve community safety through de-escalation training  and other resources.   It was Democrats who spent two years negotiating and working with law  enforcement to introduce and pass the comprehensive ``George Floyd  Justice in Policing Act of 2021''--which recognized the necessity of  balancing the needs and safety of the community with law enforcement  interests.   That is why I tried to make this bill better by adding three  additional purposes for the use of grant funding.   Development and implementation of best practices and training on the  use of lethal and nonlethal force;   Development and implementation of best practices and training to  eliminate the use of excessive force;   Development and implementation of best practices and training on the  duty of care and the duty to intervene.   I am glad those provisions were added where grantees who choose to  implement those activities will be given preference.   This bill seeks to address these challenges by providing additional  federal resources to small agencies--that often have the most trouble  accessing federal grant funding--to recruit and retain qualified  officers as well as provide additional training and support.   A 2016 study by the Department of Justice (DOJ) found that of the  12,261 local police departments in the country, 11,638 of them had less  than 100 full-time sworn officers. That is 11,638 police departments  that would be eligible to access much-needed funding as authorized by  H.R. 6448.  [[Page H8090]]    Importantly, H.R. 6448 includes limitations on the use of grant funds  for hiring and retention to ensure that the funds are not misused, and  gives preference to applicants that plan to use grant funds for certain  training purposes, including:   de-escalation; the use of lethal and nonlethal force; the duty of  care and the duty to intervene--as well as--   victim-centered training on handling domestic violence situations;  and   safety training for officers responding to calls involving persons  with substance use disorders, mental health needs, disabilities, and  vulnerable youth.

Let's be clear--This is not a last-ditch effort by Democrats to  distance ourselves from efforts to defund the police. Democrats have  always been supportive of law enforcement.    Mr. Speaker, if you could ever be fed up--I am fed  up. Fed up, and fed up with the babbling that we are hearing from  Republicans on the other side.   You know, the question should be: Where were you on January 6 when  law enforcement were bleeding on the steps of the United States  Capitol, passing out, and dying? Where were you? This is not a  political circumstance. These are people who are standing here because   Steve Horsford had a personal experience.   The Judiciary Committee has consistently supported intervention  programs dealing with countering violence. This bill, Break the Cycle  of Violence Act, is needed in America. Stand up with us, Republicans. A  bill that takes a vital step toward reducing community violence and  improving public safety by investing in people, their communities, and  establish evidence-based programs proven to help reduce violence. Our  law enforcement are begging for this.    Mr. Speaker, our Nation has a crisis of violence,  particularly gun violence, and it is tearing at our communities.   I have a husband and a baby shot dead, the mother calling: Where is  my husband and baby? The baby is found dead.   The cause of gun violence, $280 billion, $700 annually for every  American, $488,000 for shootings dealing with medical and criminal  expenses.   My brothers and sisters, where are we in standing for America and law  enforcement and families and children?   Support H.R. 4118 so that we can divert children away from violence  and move toward opportunities. I don't know what you are saying. I am  fed up. Do something about it so that we can fight for justice in this  country and stand for people who want to be safe in their community.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4118, the ``Break the Cycle of  Violence Act,'' a bill that takes a vital step towards reducing  community violence and improving public safety by investing in people,  their communities, and established, evidence-based programs proven to  help reduce violence.   Our nation has a crisis of violence, particularly gun violence, that  is tearing our communities apart. Violent crime is not a blue or red  state problem--it ravages large cities, small towns, and even rural  communities. It causes unspeakable pain to its victims and their  families--regardless of party affiliation.   The bill would provide $1.5 billion in workforce development grants  for youth in communities that are disproportionately impacted by  violence; and $5 billion in grants over 8 years for evidence-based,  community violence intervention programs likely to succeed--to develop  and support:   community outreach programs, staffed by violence intervention  specialists with ties to their communities;   hospital-based violence intervention programs to provide intensive  counseling, peer support, and social services;   group violence intervention strategies that provide culturally  responsive support and services; and   violence interruption and crisis management initiatives that respond  to and mediate potentially violent conflicts and provide support  services where violence has already occurred.   While the human cost of gun violence is at times overwhelming, the  economic costs for communities and taxpayers is also stunning. The  total cost of gun violence is $280 billion--every year--with every  American bearing $700 of the cost annually as well.   Because a single gun homicide costs taxpayers $448,000 in medical and  criminal justice expenses and we know that community violence  intervention programs have been shown to dramatically reduce rates of  homicide and other gun violence by as much as 50 percent--and sometimes  more--this bill will save lives and taxpayer dollars.   Many violence intervention programs work side-by-side with law  enforcement to stop violence before it starts and engage in targeted  enforcement actions. Trained violence interrupters and crisis  management specialists do the same, while also providing trauma- informed grief counseling.   We know these programs work. In communities across the country, from  New Jersey to Nebraska, from Massachusetts to Missouri, community  violence intervention programs have reduced incidences of homicide and  other gun violence by as much as 50 percent, sometimes more.   Recognizing the critical role that education, training, and viable  employment play in unlocking economic mobility, long-term stability,  thereby preventing violence, H.R. 4118 would divert young people away  from the circumstances that foster gun violence toward opportunities to  gain useful skills to obtain good jobs that pay a living-wage.   If we are truly going to break the cycle of violence--we must  acknowledge that violence is neither red nor blue--support programs  that address the root causes of violence, and give aid to those who  need it most--through the community members and leaders who know them  best.   I commend Representative Steven Horsford for his work on this  important bill and urge my colleagues to support it.    Mr. Speaker, this is a victims' act. So many of us  have worked with our law enforcement and victims.   The VICTIM Act would provide $100 million annually in grant funding  to law enforcement agencies and prosecuting officers to bolster their  ability to investigate and clear cases of homicide, rape, sexual  assault, kidnapping, and nonfatal shootings. All have family members  that are left wondering and in pain. This VICTIM Act, as someone who  has always worked with victims, ensures that they are not left empty.   Homicide clearance rates, in particular, have dropped consistently  since the 1960s, leaving many unsolved cases and many victims and their  families still searching. I want my colleagues to have a heart. They  are still searching for justice.   This legislation by Congresswoman Demings addresses the challenges  our law enforcement agencies are facing in solving homicides and other  violent crimes in red States and blue States. This critical funding  would help agencies improve their clearance rates through various  means. It helps retain detectives. It helps in training personnel.    It provides for low clearance rates, which  disproportionately affect victims and families of victims of  marginalized communities. Not only do they prevent victims from  accessing justice, but they also damage the public's trust.   I have given money to help victims, and victims say: ``Do you know  what? We are left alone,'' the victims or families. ``We are left alone  to address this disparity.''   This bill will help not leave them alone, keep pressure on finding  that culprit, that individual who violated them, that criminal who has  violated them, and also by providing agencies with additional  resources.   This $100 million is to help victims. Is there anybody on the floor  that wants to join in a bipartisan manner to help victims or to work  with law enforcement who are on the job, who are saying: We need help  because victims need help, and we certainly need to solve the crimes  for these families who are longing to understand about their loved ones  who have been raped, assaulted, and those who have lost their lives.   I remind my colleagues of the father and baby in my community who  were found dead. They need help.   Support the VICTIM Act.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5768, Violent Incident  Clearance and Technological Investigative Methods Act of 2022'' or the  ``VICTIM Act,'' that would provide $100 million annually in grant  funding to law enforcement agencies and prosecuting offices to bolster  their ability to investigate and clear cases of homicide, rape, sexual  assault, kidnapping, and non-fatal shootings.   As someone who has always supported law enforcement, let me state  plainly--this bill is about funding law enforcement agencies--not  defunding them.   Homicide clearance rates, in particular, have dropped consistently  since the 1960's leaving many unsolved cases and many victims and their  families still searching for justice. In 2020, the clearance rate for  homicides fell to roughly 50 percent while pressure on law enforcement  officials increased--leading to calls for more funding for overburdened  departments with sizable caseloads and depleted resources.  [[Page H8099]]    To address the challenges our law enforcement agencies are facing in  solving homicides and other violent crime--in red states and blue  states--this critical funding would help agencies improve their  clearance rates through various means, including:   ensuring retention of detectives assigned to violent crimes;   hiring and training additional detectives and investigators dedicated  specifically to investigating homicides and other violent crimes;   hiring and training personnel for collecting, processing, and testing  forensic evidence; and   hiring and training personnel to analyze violent crime trends.   Low clearance rates--which disproportionately affect victims and  families of victims of marginalized communities--not only prevent  victims from accessing justice, but they also damage the public's trust  in law enforcement.   To address this disparity, funding in the bill could be used to train  personnel to address the needs of victims and family members and  develop competitive and evidence-based programs and practices to  improve both clearance rates and victim services--thereby rebuilding  public confidence and improving community safety.   The bill would also ensure victim services programs are funded,  staffed, and trained, and that they provide restorative support to  victims and their families.   Investing in personnel as well as the technology needed to solve  cases of homicide and other violent crime, also helps build public  confidence and improve community safety.   That is why H.R. 5768's funding can be used to acquire, upgrade, or  replace investigative or evidence processing technology or equipment.   By providing agencies with additional resources--drawing from an  authorized amount of $100 million dollars--the VICTIM Act would equip  agencies to better respond to and investigate serious crimes-- delivering justice to victims and making our communities safer.   I commend Representative Val Demings for championing this thoughtful,  bipartisan legislation and urge my colleagues to support it.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter dated November 1, 2021,  from the Major Cities Chiefs Association and an article from Third Way  titled ``The Red City Defund Police Problem.''                                Major Cities Chiefs Association,                                                   November 1, 2021.      Hon. Val Demings,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Rep. Demings: I write on behalf of the Major Cities       Chiefs Association (MCCA) to register our strong support for       H.R. 5768, the VICTIM Act. The MCCA is a professional       organization of police executives representing the largest       cities in the United States and Canada.        Nearly every major city in the United States is contending       with a rise in violent crime. According to the MCCA's most       recent Violent Crime Survey, comparing midyear 2020 with       midyear 2021, homicides are up roughly 20 percent in major       cities. In addition, most MCCA members have reported       significant increases in gun violence, evidenced by the       uptick in aggravated assaults.        The grants authorized in the VICTIM Act will help law       enforcement agencies overcome some of the challenges       associated with responding to the current increase in violent       crime. More specifically, this bill will provide law       enforcement with critical resources to address staffing       challenges, enhance their forensics capabilities, further       deploy investigative technologies, and provide services to       victims of violent crime and their families.        Thank you for your continued leadership and support for our       brave law enforcement officers. The MCCA stands ready to help       advance this legislation.            Sincerely,                                                     Jeri Williams,                                  Chief, Phoenix Police Department,      President, Major Cities Chiefs Association.                                   ____                        [From Third Way, June 8, 2022]                     The Red City Defund Police Problem      (By Jim Kessler, Executive Vice President for Policy, and Kylie                      Murdock, Executive Coordinator)         In recent years, Republicans have tagged Democrats as the       party of ``defund the police.'' This political charge has at       it roots an unfortunate choice of sloganeering and policy       from a small number of progressive activists frustrated and       fed up with longstanding police violence and abuse directed       toward minorities. However intentioned, the defund charge       proved damaging to Democrats. Republicans ran myriad attack       ads in 2020 and the attack was credited with Republican       upsets in swing districts that narrowed Democratic majorities       in the House. This attack was so successful that during his       2022 State of the Union address, President Biden felt       compelled to say, ``We should all agree: The answer is not to       defund the police. The answer is to fund the police. Fund       them. Fund them. The President also dedicated $10 billion       from the American Rescue Plan for public safety, including       $6.5 billion in crime-fighting aid to state and local       communities.        But is the Republican charge even remotely true? It has       been taken as a given by much of the media just as Democrats       have been pigeon-holed as soft on crime and being responsible       for rampant crime across the country. Yet as our March 2022       report showed, the 25 states that voted for Donald Trump had       a murder rate 40% higher than the 25 states that voted for       Joe Biden. And 8 of the 10 states with the highest murder       rates not only voted for Donald Trump, they voted Republican       in every presidential election this century. Is the       Democrats, defund the police portrait as inaccurate as its       soft on crime portrait?        To answer this question, we compared the police budgets of       the 25 largest Democrat-run cities and the 25 largest       Republican-run cities. We pulled FY2021 and FY2022 funding       data directly from city operating budgets, as well as police       force data from a mixture of police department websites, city       budgets, and local news sources. Using this, we calculated       several key metrics--the number of police officers, police       officers per capita, police funding per capita, and percent       change in police budgets from FY2021 to FY2022. Per capita       data allows us to control for population and compare cities       like New York City and Fort Worth.        We found that despite conventional wisdom to the contrary,       Democrat-run cities employ far more police officers and spend       far more money on policing per capita than Republican-run       cities. In fact, police forces in Dem cities are 75 percent       larger than police forces in GOP cities. And Democrats spend       about 38 percent more per person on policing than Republicans       do. On average, Democrat- and Republican-run cities all saw       an increase in police funding in 2022, with Democrats       actually increasing police budgets by slightly more.        The data make clear-Republicans may talk about funding the       police, but they trail badly as compared to Democrats.      Dem cities employ more police officers per capita than GOP cities         The size of a city's police force is often seen as       indicative of its support for law enforcement. Democrats have       been accused of defunding the police and cutting police       funding and staff. We compared the 25 most populous cities       run by each party as defined by the political affiliation of       its mayor to see if this potent political charge is true.        The 25 most populous Democratic cities run from New York       City with 8,177,025 inhabitants to Memphis with 650,980. The       25 most populous Republican cities run from Jacksonville with       a population of 949,611 to Glendale in Arizona with 248,325       residents. In total, the 25 most populous Democratic cities       are home to 37,470,584 people, while the commensurate 25       Republican cities have a combined total of 10,415,763.        We found that in the aggregate:        Democrat-run cities employ 288.2 officers per 100,000       residents, compared to Republican-run cities with only 164.6       officers per 100,000 residents.        Police forces in cities with Democratic mayors are 75.1%       larger than police forces in GOP cities.        Of the ten cities with the largest per capita police       forces, nine are run by Democrats--Washington DC, Chicago,       Las Vegas, New York City, Detroit, Philadelphia, Memphis,       Boston, and Los Angeles. Miami, coming in at ninth, is the       only Republican-run city in the top ten.        We also compared the median per capita police force average       since larger cities like New York and Los Angeles can skew       results. Among these same cities, those with Democratic       mayors had a median of 195.3 officers per 100,000 residents,       or 23.1 percent more than the 158.7 median for Republican run       cities.        The size of a city didn't seem to be a determining factor       in the per capita rate of police officers. For example,       Phoenix, San Antonio, and San Diego ranked 5th, 6th, and 8th       in population, but ranked 34th, 40th, and 42nd in police per       capita. Meanwhile, Las Vegas, Detroit, Memphis, and Miami       ranked 25th, 27th, 28th and 33rd in population, but ranked       3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th in police per capita. Oklahoma City       and Las Vegas have nearly identical populations (676,492       versus 675,592), but Republican-led Oklahoma City had a       police force roughly onethird the size of Las Vegas with its       Democratic mayor (162.6 officers compared to 444.1 per       100,000 residents).           Dem cities spend more money on policing than GOP cities         Republicans have decried Democrats, attempts to cut police       budgets in liberal cities across the country. But we found       that Democrats spend more on policing than Republicans do.        Republican-run cities spend $361 per resident on police.       Democrat-run cities spend $498 per resident, about 38 percent       more than Republicans. Because aggregate police budgets can       be skewed by larger cities, we also looked at the median per       capita police budgets for these sets of 25 cities. Once       again, Democrat-run cities had median police budgets 31       percent greater than Republican-run cities, $423.55 to       $323.40 per resident.        Of the ten cities that spent the most on policing per       capita, six of them are Democrat-run and four are Republican-      run. Cities often criticized by Republicans for being ``soft-      on-crime''--New York City, San Francisco, Chicago, Detroit,       Seattle--are all in the top 15 on police funding per person.       Republican strongholds like Bakersfield and Oklahoma City       spend less than half of what New York City and Chicago spend       on their police.   Dem cities saw slightly larger police budget increases than GOP cities                                  in 2022         Defund the police may exist as a slogan, but it does not       exist as a policy--at least in  [[Page H8100]]       the 50 cities that we reviewed. Between FY2021 to FY2022,       Democrat-run cities saw a 4.34 percent increase in police       funding--from $17.89 billion to $18.67 billion, or about 775       million in the aggregate. Republican-run cities saw a 4.11       percent increase--from $3.62 billion to $3.76 billion, $148       million in the aggregate.        Twenty-one of 25 Democratic cities and 21 of 25 Republican       cities showed budget increases in FY2022. Cities like New       York and Los Angeles are often mentioned in defund the police       attacks--both cities increased their police budgets in 2022.       In fact, the ten largest Democrat-run cities increased their       police budgets in 2022, though Philadelphia's held fairly       constant with a 0.28 percent increase. New York City's       increase of 3.75 percent added $196 million. Chicago,       Portland, and Seattle--cities often accused of defunding the       police--all saw increases in their 2022 police budgets.       Paradoxically, Washington DC had the largest budget cut of       3.98 percent but also the largest police budget per resident       at $751.62.                                  Conclusion         Democrats have been accused of defunding the police as a       larger ``soft on crime'' message from Republican       officeholders and conservative media. In a previous report,       we found that homicide rates were significantly higher in the       25 states that voted for Trump compared to the 25 states that       voted for Biden.        In this report, we find that police funding and police       personnel levels are far higher in the 25 largest Democrat-      run cities compared to the 25 largest Republican-run cities.       In the most recent funding cycle, these same Democratic       cities increased their police budgets to a greater degree       than cities with Republican mayors.        Our conclusion is that the defund the police charge against       Democrats may be politically damaging, but it is factually       inaccurate. If anything, Republican mayors have a defund       problem.     Mr. Speaker, as we stand here today, there are women  approaching doctors and nurses with a medical condition. Through no  fault of their own, they need OB/GYN services.   In the State of Texas, with horrific and antiquated and really  vicious legislation, the doctors and nurses and medical professionals  are made criminals.   I have introduced H.R. 8838, the SHIELD Act, to protect doctors and  nurses and medical personnel from frivolous and dangerous litigation so  the medical industry can do their job. They can do a procedure that a  woman may need. They can help if a woman is in the midst of aborting  because of the issue of health. They can help women who, to save their  life, have to have a medical procedure if they are pregnant.  [[Page H8106]]  They can do their job and the oath they have taken.   I am sad to stand on the floor today in 2022 to note we live in a  Nation that would condemn the healers of our land, the ones who helped  us in the pandemic.   Support H.R. 8838. Sign on, cosponsor it, and let's protect the  medical professionals.                            ____________________
