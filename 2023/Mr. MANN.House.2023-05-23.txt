 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to deliver the 20th installment  of my farm bill impact series and celebrate this week's ribbon cutting  at USDA's National Bio and Agro-Defense Facility in Manhattan, Kansas,  in the heart of my district.   It has been 8 years since the facility's groundbreaking in 2015, and  now this state-of-the-art, 700,000-square-foot research center is a  national asset that will help protect animal agriculture against the  threat and potential impact of serious animal diseases.   NBAF will be home to the only maximum biocontainment space in the  country where USDA will conduct comprehensive research, develop animal  vaccines and antivirals, and explore enhanced diagnostic and training  capabilities. This facility isn't just about animal health. It is about  public health, as well.   NBAF will replace the 60-year-old Plum Island Animal Disease Center  in New York, create 400 new jobs for Kansans, generate more than $100  million in total economic benefit for our State, and make Kansas the  home of internationally recognized animal disease experts.   By bringing healthy animals into the facility, world-renowned  research will happen here. I am proud to have this facility in my  district and right down the street from K-State's College of Veterinary  Medicine and the Biosecurity Research Institute, creating a scientific  hub that will lead the world in agriculture research and health.   Last month, I chaired my first hearing of the House Agriculture  Subcommittee on Livestock, Dairy, and Poultry on animal health with  USDA Under Secretary Moffitt. Animal health is at the forefront of  livestock producers' minds, and so it is at the forefront of my mind on  their behalf.   This year's farm bill is an opportunity to lead in the areas of  innovation and research. We must get animal health right for our food  security, economic security, and national security.   The 2018 farm bill contained special authorization for biosecurity  planning and response, which helped make NBAF possible. NBAF is a  concrete example of the impact that we can have when we reauthorize the  farm bill in careful and creative ways.   Last year, I hosted House Agriculture Committee Chairman G.T.  Thompson on an ag tour of Kansas, where I was proud to show him NBAF.  Last month, I hosted House Agriculture Committee staff and  congressional staff from agriculture districts around the country for a  tour of NBAF. The technology, scale, and international significance of  the facility are truly second to none.    Once fully operational, NBAF won't just support and protect  agriculture. It will protect our country and the world.   I will be back on the floor soon to deliver another installment of my  farm bill impact series and highlight more programs and titles within  the farm bill that I believe Congress must understand and support to  ensure that agriculture thrives right here in America.                     Opposing a National Abortion Hotline     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to use my voice in defense of the  voiceless.   Abortion has desensitized our Nation and resulted in the deaths of  nearly 64 million unborn American citizens, which is basically the  entire population of the Midwest.   Last year, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, rectifying  a wrong that has plagued our country for decades. While that is a huge  triumph for the right to life, there is still a lot of work to be done.   Last month, the Biden administration announced that it plans to use  $1.5 billion of taxpayer money to establish a national abortion hotline  to counsel individuals on how to obtain an abortion and certain other  family planning services.   According to the administration, the project will operate as a  supplement to the existing Title X Family Planning services grant. The  grant information states that one of the hotline's purposes will be to  offer information, counseling, and referral for pregnancy termination.   The Public Health Services Act of 1970 established Title X funds to  help low-income and uninsured women access healthcare and family  planning services. From the beginning, Title X funds were never  intended to support abortion services, and the underlying statute  explicitly prohibits it.   In October 2021, however, the Biden administration finalized a rule  that  [[Page H2507]]  violated the spirit of this law by actively supporting abortion. It  provided Title X funding to clinics that perform elective abortions by  requiring grantees to make abortion referrals.   This new abortion hotline goes one step further.   Taxpayer dollars should never go toward funding abortions, but  President Biden and his administration are continually attempting to  use Title X funds to promote abortion services.   This week, I am leading a letter to President Biden to push back on  this gross violation of the law, and I will be doing everything within  my power to prevent this hotline from going live, including a piece of  legislation that I plan to introduce soon.   I firmly believe that life begins at conception, and I will fight to  protect the lives of all Americans, born and unborn. I will also  continue to protect pregnancy resource centers and pro-life  organizations from domestic terrorism.   As a proud father and member of the Values Action Team, I will  strongly oppose any legislation that would endanger the lives of the  unborn, and I will support legislation that protects the rights of the  defenseless.                            ____________________
