 Mr. Speaker, I, along with all of our American citizens,  recoil today at the senseless and evil mayhem and killing that went on  in Las Vegas. We pray for the families of those whose lives were lost,  as well as those who are injured and suffering right now.   I, along with, I am sure, many Americans, recoil at senseless abuse  of innocent animals that we love and we enjoy. But I wonder how many of  us also recoil at the senseless abuse and murder of innocent babies in  the womb.   I stand here today to support the Pain-Capable Unborn Child  Protection Act, H.R. 36. I support it because it is backed by science.  It protects the unborn from suffering. It saves innocent lives. It  promotes American values, values that made this country great, that  understand the sanctity of life and the beauty of our creator's  evidence in this world today in human beings.   I ask my colleagues to join with me and many others this week as we  support H.R. 36, and we say to our creator and our God: Thank you for  innocent life itself, and may it be preserved and protected.                            ____________________
