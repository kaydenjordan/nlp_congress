 Madam President, last week, the Senate voted on an  overwhelmingly bipartisan basis to advance the Iran sanctions bill  currently before us, and we will take another vote today to proceed to  that bill. I want to thank the chairs and ranking members of the  Foreign Relations and Banking Committees--Chairman Corker, Chairman  Crapo--for their efforts to craft additional, much-needed sanctions on  Russia as well. I would encourage Members of both parties to keep  working together so we can pass the critical Iran sanctions legislation  very soon.                            ____________________     Madam President, 7 years ago, Senate Democrats and the  Obama administration forced ObamaCare on the American people, but  ObamaCare never actually lived up to what Democrats had promised. From  rising costs to shrinking choices and collapsing markets, the problems  associated with ObamaCare grew across the country as the years passed,  leaving the American people to literally pick up the pieces.   ObamaCare's years-long legacy of failure will only get worse unless  we act. Consider the latest examples of how it is threatening to hurt  more Americans. In Washington State, people in two counties just  learned they could have zero insurance options under ObamaCare plans  next year. Thousands of Ohioans across 18 counties just found out they  could also be left with absolutely zero choices under ObamaCare. Iowans  could be left without a single major insurance option to choose from  statewide as well. And in Nebraska, nearly 100,000 residents learned  they could be left with just one insurance option on the ObamaCare  exchanges next year or potentially none at all.   At the rate things are going, Americans living in nearly half of all  counties could be left with just one or even zero insurance options  under ObamaCare next year. Think about that. Millions of people in  nearly half of all the counties across America are at risk of having no  options or a single option of insurance plans because of ObamaCare.   Worse still, as choices continue to drop, premiums keep rising, often  by double digits, meaning those lucky enough to have a choice under  ObamaCare may not even be able to afford the plan they select. It is a  fact underlined by reports released just this afternoon by the Centers  for Medicare and Medicare Services, or CMS. These reports show that  hundreds of thousands of Americans who selected an ObamaCare plan ended  up canceling their coverage after just a few weeks, and the most common  reason they cited for doing so was because it was too expensive. Is it  any wonder? As another groundbreaking report revealed last month,  premiums have on average doubled--and in some cases even tripled--in  the vast majority of States on the Federal exchange since ObamaCare's  full enactment in 2013.   You would think the Democrats would want to work with us now to clean  up the years-long mess they created. Instead, they are defending the  status quo or trying to shift the blame for the failures of their own  law--a law Democrats designed, a law Democrats forced on our country, a  law Democrats defended year after year as it hurt Americans over and  over. There is just no serious way to try to spin these years of  ObamaCare failures at this late date.   It is also clear that the status quo is simply unsustainable and  demands action. That is why Republican Senators have been working hard  on solutions that could help rescue American families who have been  hurt by this law's failures. Members will keep working this week  because bringing relief from ObamaCare may not be easy, but it is  necessary. We are going to keep working hard to get this done.   Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that morning  business be closed.    Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 232.    I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the  amendment be dispensed with.    I ask for the yeas and nays on the amendment.    Mr. President, I have a cloture motion at the desk.    I ask unanimous consent that the mandatory quorum call  be waived.    Mr. President, I have a second-degree amendment at the  desk.    I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the  amendment be dispensed with.    Mr. President, as in executive session, I ask  unanimous consent that the nomination of Elizabeth Erin Walsh, of the  District of Columbia, to be Assistant Secretary of Commerce and  Director General of the United States and Foreign Commercial Service,  sent to the Senate by the President, be referred jointly to the  Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs and the Committee on  Commerce, Science, and Transportation.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following  leader remarks on Tuesday, June 13, Senator Paul or his designee be  recognized to make a motion to discharge S.J. Res. 42; that debate on  the motion be equally divided between the proponents and opponents  until 12:30 p.m.; that the Senate recess from 12:30 p.m. until 2:15  p.m. for the weekly conference meetings, and at 2:15 p.m. there be 10  minutes of debate remaining on the motion to discharge the resolution,  equally divided between Senator Paul or his designee and the opponents;  and that following the use or yielding back of time, the Senate vote in  relation to the motion to discharge.    Mr. President, today I wish to remember Pamela Todd  May, a dedicated attorney, a compassionate servant, and a respected  community member. With her passing on May 14 of this year, Kentucky has  lost an extraordinary woman.   Pam employed her talents to serve others. As the legal counsel for  Pikeville Medical Center, PMC, for over 30 years, she strived to  improve the quality of life for many in her community. Through her  service as a trustee for the University of Kentucky, Pam guided an  institution to prepare thousands of students for a lifetime of success.  Her career also included service as an assistant Pike County attorney.   To her loyal staff and colleagues, Pam will be remembered not only  for her skills, but also for her warmth. Although her family and  community have lost an incredible woman, I hope their memories of her  love will help to ease their grief. Elaine and I join with so many in  eastern Kentucky and around the Commonwealth in expressing our  heartfelt condolences to her husband, Walter, her children, Andrea and  Philip, and all of her family and friends.
