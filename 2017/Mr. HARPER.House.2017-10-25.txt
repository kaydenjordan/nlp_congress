 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to take from the  Speaker's table the concurrent resolution (S. Con. Res. 26) authorizing  the use of Emancipation Hall in the Capitol Visitor Center for the  unveiling of the American Prisoners of War/Missing in Action (POW/MIA)  Chair of Honor, and ask for its immediate consideration in the House.   The Clerk read the title of the concurrent resolution.
