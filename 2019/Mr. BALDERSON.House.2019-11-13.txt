 Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak in support of a bill I  cosponsored, H.R. 3537, the Veteran Entrepreneurship Training Act.   This bill would authorize the Boots to Business Program, which helps  our Nation's veterans who are transitioning back into the workforce  launch and grow their small businesses.   Our Nation just celebrated Veterans Day, and while it is a wonderful  way for us to show our appreciation for those who have served the  United States honorably, it is also important we honor those veterans  year-round.   We must never forget our highest commitment, which is to support our  servicemembers, veterans, and their families.   The Boots to Business Program is one such way we can do that for our  veterans, by providing them with the tools and resources they need to  be successful entrepreneurs in our modern world.   The Boots to Business Program is an important way for our country to  support two fundamentally American values: small business and military  service.    Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support H.R. 3537.
