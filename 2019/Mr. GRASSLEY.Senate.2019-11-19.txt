 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to address the  Senate for 1 minute as in morning business.    Madam President, a whole bunch of us Midwest biofuel  Senators sent a cover letter with our comments to President Trump.  Those comments were in regard to the biofuel rules that are out for  public comment.   The President has been a supporter of biofuels and the EPA shouldn't  undercut President Trump's support of RFS. I urge the EPA and  Administrator Wheeler to adjust the proposed supplemental rule to  account for actual waived gallons, using hard data from past practices,  to send an unambiguous signal to the marketplace.   I am glad to have the opportunity to comment, and I encourage all  farmers, biofuel producers, and anybody else interested in supporting  the RFS to make their comments. Those comments should be along the  lines of what was agreed to in the Oval Office on September 12, which  the EPA regulations don't reflect properly.   So tell the EPA that you want the September 12 agreement agreed to.  Go to regulations.gov or to the Iowa Farm Bureau or Iowa Corn websites  before the deadline on November 27 to tell the EPA to stand behind the  President's Oval Office agreement.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
