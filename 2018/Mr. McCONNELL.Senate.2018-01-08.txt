 Mr. President, 1 million Americans and counting will  be starting 2018 with more money in their pockets, thanks to tax  reform.   Special bonuses are on the way for employees across a wide range of  industries. Businesses throughout America are taking advantage of more  competitive tax rates and passing the savings along to their workers.  As a result, employees at companies from Visa and AT&T to Turning Point  Brands in Louisville, KY, are seeing results. For working parents in  Kentucky and all across the Nation, these bonuses and other permanent  changes will make a big difference in family budgets.   Of course, in just weeks, families will see the benefits of tax  reform hit their paychecks. Lower tax rates will mean less money  withheld for the IRS and more take-home pay for more hard-working  Americans.   I am particularly proud of the way this tax reform will benefit  America's farmers and ranchers. Later today, President Trump is  delivering the good news at the annual conference of the American Farm  Bureau Federation.   Like so many States, Kentucky is home to a vibrant farming community.  Throughout the legislative process, I heard family farmers loud and  clear. They said: We need tax relief. That is what Congress delivered.   Thanks to our once-in-a-generation tax reform law, it will be easier  for farm families around Kentucky and around the country to invest in  new capital equipment and recover their costs. According to the Farm  Bureau Federation, 93 percent of U.S. farms file taxes through the  individual code. They will benefit from the major tax relief we secured  for passthrough businesses.   Especially important for farmers, this tax bill doubled the exemption  from the death tax. It is the government's final insult to make  grieving families visit both the undertaker and the IRS at the same  time. Now this burden will fall on fewer American farmers and ranchers.   Thanks to the work of Senator Roberts, Senator Hatch, and many  others, we passed a tax reform bill that both the American Farm Bureau  Federation and the Kentucky Farm Bureau enthusiastically endorse, and  now farming families throughout America will reap the benefits.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on another matter, later today the  Senate will vote to advance the nomination of William L. Campbell, Jr.,  to serve as a U.S. district judge for the Middle District of Tennessee.   Mr. Campbell's nomination is not controversial. Like the other three  district court nominees before the Senate this week, he is well  qualified. They are the kinds of nominees who, until recently, would  have sailed quickly and smoothly right through the Senate.   So why will their four nominations consume a week of the Senate's  attention? Why do we need to file cloture on each, and then exhaust the  full 30 hours of debate? The reason is that Senate Democrats are  choosing, for partisan reasons, to make these nominations take as long  as possible. Their goal is to waste the Senate's time and prevent the  President from promptly filling judicial vacancies.  [[Page S50]]    Mr. President, 2017 was a historic year of partisan obstruction by  our Democratic colleagues, even for uncontroversial judges who went on  to unanimous or near-unanimous confirmation votes. Our colleagues  across the aisle used every possible procedural roadblock to delay and  drag their heels.   Now 2018 is, unfortunately, starting off the same way.   Mr. Campbell is a Marine Corps veteran and a well-respected lawyer.  His record is not partisan. His nomination was reported out of the  Judiciary Committee on a voice vote. I look forward to the Senate  confirming him, albeit after our Democratic colleagues waste more of  the Senate's time.   I implore our Democratic friends to turn the page on the needless  obstruction and permit the Senate to function smoothly so that we can  attend to more of the people's business.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on a final matter, in the next 11 days  Congress needs to reach an agreement to fund the government.   It is imperative that this agreement provide adequate resources for  our men and women in uniform. Last week, leadership on both sides of  the aisle expressed hopes of working seriously and collaboratively on a  solution that enables our Armed Forces to advance critical missions at  home and abroad.   At the same time, our Democratic colleagues persist in the notion  that we should increase defense spending only if we increase nondefense  spending by the same amount. As we lay the facts on the table, this  political talking point simply doesn't hold up.   By now, we all know that the Budget Control Act hit defense spending  much harder than it hit domestic spending. Since fiscal year 2013, to  be precise, discretionary defense spending has been cut by $85 billion  more than discretionary nondefense spending. This might sound like an  abstract distinction, but it has very real, tangible consequences for  our national security. These disproportionate cuts have reduced the  readiness of American forces to meet and address emerging threats.   Our military leaders have explained this over and over and over  again. Just months ago, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,  General Dunford, told our colleagues on the Armed Services Committee  that over the last decade, ``The U.S. military's competitive advantage  against potential adversaries is eroding.'' He cited budgetary  instability as a key reason.   At the same hearing, Secretary of Defense Mattis added: ``No enemy in  the field has done more to harm the readiness of our military than  sequestration.''   ``No enemy,'' Secretary Mattis said, ``in the field has done more to  harm the readiness of our military than sequestration.''   The men and women we trust to lead our military have made it  abundantly clear that the status quo in defense funding, let alone the  further instability that would result from our failure to reach an  agreement, is handicapping our servicemembers.   In the next week and a half, let's put aside partisan rhetoric and  start heeding the warnings of our nonpartisan military leaders. Let's  give those who keep us safe the resources they need to do the job.                            ____________________     I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at 2:15  p.m. tomorrow, all postcloture time on the Campbell nomination be  considered expired and the Senate vote on confirmation of the Campbell  nomination with no intervening action or debate; finally, that if  confirmed, the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon  the table and the President be immediately notified of the Senate's  action.
