 Madam Speaker, I thank the Representative and my  colleague on the Rules Committee from Massachusetts for yielding me the  customary 30 minutes, and I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, this morning we are here to debate a rule providing  for a series of bills that have been noticed multiple times going back  as far as July. But we in the Rules Committee were given 1 hour to  consider the changes that have been negotiated--negotiated internally-- within the majority conference with no minority input. Presumably, the  changes were made at the behest of the leftwing defund-the-police  activists who, unfortunately, have become the loudest voice in their  party.    It seems to me that these bills are a very transparent response to  the negative reaction Democrats have experienced as a result of these  continued calls while crime is understandably skyrocketing.   The VICTIM Act creates a new Federal grant program to help local  governments cut down on homicide and nonfatal shooting backlogs. The  funds can be used for hiring and training detectives and processing  personnel, upgrading or replacing investigative or evidence-processing  technology, and improving resources for victims and their families.   First of all, these programs largely replicate existing programs  managed by the Department of Justice. This, again, reminds us of why we  have been called to this debate. It is not to solve a problem. It is so  that my Democrat colleagues can look like they are solving problems.  Furthermore, programs like this would not be needed if the left had not  prioritized defunding the police over keeping our country's citizens  safe.   This bill effectively bails out governments like Austin,  Philadelphia, and Rochester, New York, that decreased police budgets  over the years.   The Invest to Protect Act expands COPS grant programs to include  police departments with fewer than 125 law enforcement officers. Funds  may be used for training, body cameras, signing and retention bonuses,  and providing access to mental health services.   Just to point out, there is a clause in this bill that explicitly  says that the Attorney General can give preference to activities that  have nothing to do with recruitment or retention.   Madam Speaker, the left has been actively fighting against law  enforcement, and, as a result, the American people are angry. They are  angry about the increases in violent crimes across the country, and  they are angry about repeat offenders being released to commit even  more serious crimes.                                time  0915    They are angry that even after making these concerns clear, Democrats  have been ignoring them in favor of an extreme anti-police agenda. This  is a last-ditch effort for them to act like they are not deeply out of  touch with the country, coming just in time to see the results from  election polling.   This is an effort to sweep under the rug that my colleagues in the  majority will seek private security while simultaneously seeking cuts  to police budgets. My colleagues in the majority want to distract from  the statements of their Members that apparently defunding the police is  only one step toward fully dismantling police departments.   My colleagues want to distract from the fact that even some of the  most senior officials of the Biden administration are echoing or  applauding efforts to reduce budgets of law enforcement. Despite this  hollow effort, I am confident the American people see  [[Page H8071]]  right through this charade and view this for what it is, a political  exercise.   Madam Speaker, I oppose the rule, I ask Members to do the same, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I believe it is two bills that are different, but we  can check on that just to make sure that we understand what is going  on.   To further illustrate the political charade, my colleagues in the  majority have blocked any effort to include thoughtful policy solutions  proposed by House Republicans.   In the Rules Committee, I even offered a motion to consider a bill I  proposed earlier this year to support our law enforcement's efforts to  train our next generation of peace officers. H.R. 7421, the Law  Enforcement Education Grant Program Act of 2022, was a product of  discussions with Minnesota State patrol officers and other members of  the local community regarding the difficulty of not only hiring new  officers but even finding potential recruits.   Police departments across the country are experiencing a serious  shortage of officers. This lack of qualified officers has led to a  drastic increase in crime. We need to invest in recruiting a number of  well-trained and highly educated police officers to help keep our  communities safe.   This bill provides education grants of up to $4,000 per year, not  exceeding $16,000 total, to a student who is pursuing their first  degree in a law enforcement or criminal justice-related field. As a  requirement of receiving the grant, the applicant must commit to  serving as a full-time law enforcement officer for 4 years within an 8- year period of completing their studies.   In order to instill integrity of the program and prevent abuse, if an  applicant fails to complete their service requirements, the grants will  be converted back into a loan and the applicant will be required to pay  it back.   In order to ensure flexibility over what education program best fits  the student, the grants are distributed directly to candidates, not  educational institutions. In addition, the curriculum at an institution  must have been approved by the State's Police Officer Standard and  Training Board, or the related State agency.   Finally, there are exemptions from the clawback bill for officers who  are injured in the line of duty and cannot serve out their 4-year  requirement. These are the types of solutions that the majority refuses  to even debate or bring forward under this rule. It further supports my  argument that this is  [[Page H8072]]  simply political theatre, covering up for years of dangerous and  irresponsible rhetoric that has put law enforcement in harm's way time  and time again.   I would just like to add that there are many, many good and positive  Republican proposals out there that the majority refuses to even  consider in committee, and this is just one example of those.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, my colleague from Massachusetts says, oh, these were  available; these were available for over a month.   Then my question would be: Then why the emergency meeting yesterday?  Why, with an hour's notice, the Rules Committee is called together to  push these bills through, other than some kind of political charade to  get these bills to the floor today at 9 o'clock in the morning with  very little notice?   It seems to me that as much as he says there are no changes, and that  they have been available, still, an emergency meeting with an hour's  notice at 3:25 in the afternoon yesterday, it seems like they are  pushing things through without the notice that the American people and  the Members of Congress deserve.   Our Nation's law enforcement officers put on a badge every day and  bravely put themselves in harm's way to keep our communities safe. The  past few years have been especially dangerous for America's police as a  direct result of the Democrat-led defund the police movement, and their  soft-on-crime policies.   Cities across the country have suffered a dramatic increase in crime.  Carjacking and smash-and-grab robberies are now common. Last year,  major cities broke their annual homicide records. The national rise in  crime has devastating costs for the communities and, also, for local  police.   In California, Kern County Deputy Sheriff Phillip Campas was killed  in the line of duty after his SWAT team responded to a domestic  violence call. He was a marine veteran and a dedicated father whose  legacy of heroism will never be forgotten.   In New York, New York City Police Officer Vogel was seen running  through Times Square toward an ambulance after saving a 4-year-old girl  who had been struck by a stray bullet. The officer's bravery and quick  thinking made all the difference in getting the girl to safety.   In Alabama, Wilcox County Constable Madison Nicholson, who had  protected his community for over 40 years, was shot and killed in the  line of duty when he and a sheriff's deputy were responding to a  domestic disturbance.   Our police are under attack like never before. According to the FBI,  more police officers were murdered in the line of duty during President  Biden's first year in office than in any year since 1995. Many of them  were killed in ambush-style or unprovoked attacks.  [[Page H8074]]    Not only have calls to defund, dismantle, or abolish the police that  come from the activists, or even within the Halls of Congress, have  created a more treacherous climate for officers, but it has also  negatively impacted morale among the police.   Nationwide, law enforcement agencies are short 7 percent of filling  budgeted positions, and retirements are up 45 percent. Law enforcement  is our essential line of defense in maintaining law and order. They  deserve America's and Congress' full support.   House Republicans are grateful to our law enforcement officers for  their service to our communities and understand the incredible  commitment they make in choosing to wear the uniform. We will always  stand with our men and women in blue and their families.   House Democrats would like to use these bills to convince the  American people of the same, but Americans know and understand.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, for years now, progressives in the media have  disparaged law enforcement at every opportunity, from the defund the  police movement to agenda-driven liberal district attorneys in cities  like San Francisco, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, and New York. There is a  clear strategic effort on the part of Democrats to demean police  officers nationwide at the expense of law and order.   In 2021, according to the Fraternal Order of Police, 346 officers  were shot, 63 fatally. Additionally, there were 103 ambush-style  attacks on law enforcement, a 115 percent increase from 2020.   Even as members of the Democratic Party are victims of increasing  crimes, they are unwavering in their aggression on those in uniform who  stand on the front lines and every day protect and serve our  communities. Rather than acknowledging and thanking these brave men and  women, Democrats have repeatedly gone out of their way to put the blame  on those in uniform.   They may claim otherwise, but here are the words straight from their  mouths. If we need to make sure that we are quoting people today, I am  more than willing to do that.   `` . . . Police in our country are more concerned with protecting  white supremacy than serving the communities that pay their  salaries.''--Representative Bowman.   ``Defunding the police isn't radical. It is real.''--Representative  Cori Bush.   ``The truth is that abolishing ICE isn't that radical. We reorganize  government all the time, creating some agencies and eliminating others.  Nevertheless, it is a bold proposal. It is time to be bold. It is time  to abolish ICE.''--Representative Mark Pocan.   ``The defund the police movement is one of reimagining the current  police system to build an entity that does not violate us, while  relocating funds to invest in community services.''--Representative  Ilhan Omar.   ``Defunding police means defunding police.''--Representative  Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.   ``We are spending too much money on the police. There should be  substantial cuts to the police budget and a reallocation of those  funds.''--Representative Jerry Nadler.   Now, they expect us to believe they support our law enforcement. They  think that putting these bills forward will make the American people  believe they care about law enforcement. It seems that it has taken  them until now to see how out of touch they are with the American  people.   Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr.  Rutherford).    Madam Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to  the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Rutherford).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, with all due respect, potentially, my colleague from  Massachusetts didn't hear some of the quotes that I read earlier, many  of them talking about ``defunding police means defunding police,''  Representative Ocasio-Cortez.   I can go back through them, or I certainly am more than happy to  provide them in writing to my colleague, but I just wanted to remind  him that, yes, there were many quotes that I read regarding Democrats  and defunding the police.   Madam Speaker, I include in the Record two articles, one titled  ``Even Democrats are now admitting `Defund the Police' was a massive  mistake,'' and another titled ``'Defund the Police' still haunts  Democrats.''                     [From CNN Politics, Nov. 5, 2021]    Even Democrats Are Now Admitting `Defund the Police' Was a Massive                                  Mistake                            (By Chris Cillizza)         (CNN).--On Tuesday, a proposal to fundamentally restructure       the Minneapolis police department in the wake of George       Floyd's death in 2020 was soundly defeated, a setback that       even many Democrats acknowledged could be laid at the feet of       the ``defund the police'' movement that some within the party       embraced last summer.        ``I think allowing this moniker, `Defund the police,' to       ever get out there, was not a good thing,'' Minnesota       Attorney General Keith Ellison (D) told The Washington Post's       Dave Weigel on Thursday.        That's a remarkable turnaround from how politicians--in and       out of Minnesota--acted in the immediate aftermath of Floyd's       death and the summer of nationwide protests that followed.        Nine members of the Minneapolis City Council appeared at an       event in June 2020 in which they pledged that they would work       to dismantle the police force in the city. They did so on a       stage that featured large cutout letters spelling out       ``Defund Police.''        ``We committed to dismantling policing as we know it in the       city of Minneapolis and to rebuild with our community a new       model of public safety that actually keeps our community       safe,'' City, Council President Lisa Bender told CNN at the       time.        That message was picked up by some of the most liberal       members of Congress--from Minnesota's Ilhan Omar to       Michigan's Rashida Tlaib.        New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, perhaps the best       known progressive in Congress, warned that dismissing calls       to defund the police--or, at the very least, to reconsider       the way police interact with a community--was a mistake. ``It       is not crazy for Black and brown communities to want what       White people have already given themselves and that is       funding your schools more than you fund criminalizing your       own kids,' she said.        Even as liberal members (and the activist community) were       pushing for the party to embrace the ``defund the police''       movement, others within the party were warning of the       political dangers inherent in the slogan.        ``This movement today, some people tried to hijack it,''       House Majority Whip Jim Clyburn (D-South Carolina), the       highest ranking African American in Congress, warned his       party, according to reporting in Politico. ``Don't let       yourselves be drawn into the debate about defunding police       forces.''        Clyburn's warning proved prophetic. Then-President Donald       Trump seized on the issue during the 2020 campaign, casting       it as evidence that Democrats were out of touch with the       average person. ``LAW & ORDER, NOT DEFUND AND ABOLISH THE       POLICE.,'' Trump tweeted in June 2020. ``The Radical Left       Democrats have gone Crazy!'' And then this the following       month: ``Corrupt Joe Biden wants to defund our police. He may       use different words, but when you look at his pact with Crazy       Bernie, and other things, that's what he wants to do. It       would destroy America!''        Even as Trump and Republicans were working to make ``defund       the police'' a national issue (Joe Biden had made clear he       did not favor defunding), the Minnesota politicians who were       at the forefront of the ``defund'' movement were beginning to       back off in the face of rising crime in the city. As       Minnesota Public Radio reported in September 2020:        ``Just months after leading an effort that would have       defunded the police department, City Council members at       Tuesday's work session pushed chief Medaria Arradondo to tell       them how the department is responding to the violence.        ``The number of reported violent crimes, like assaults,       robberies and homicides are up compared to 2019, according to       MPD crime data. More people have been killed in the city in       the first nine months of 2020 than were slain in all of last       year. Property crimes, like burglaries and auto thefts, are       also up. Incidents of arson have increased 55 percent over       the total at this point in 2019.''        (The City Council had, months before, moved $1.1 million       from the police department to the health department.)        After several fits and starts, Question 2 was added to the       2021 ballot. Among its Provisions was replacing the Minnesota       police  [[Page H8077]]       department with a department of public safety, getting rid of       language that requires a minimum number of police officers to       be employed by the city and forcing the mayor to win the city       council's support for someone to run the new department.        While the vote was expected to be quite close, it was, in       fact, not. As CNN wrote of the results:        ``The status quo-affirming result is a setback to both       citywide and national efforts to fundamentally reduce or       eliminate the role of police in America. Opponents of calls       to ``defund the police'' will point to the vote as fresh       evidence that the backlash to police abuse that fueled last       year's protests, which followed the killing of Floyd by then       Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin. Talk of curbing       police departments by cutting or limiting their resources has       run into a countervailing wall of concern over public safety       and waning support from early allies--including leading       Democrats who largely view it as political poison.''        The question now for Democrats is whether they totally       abandon efforts to remake policing in this country. (A       bipartisan police reform attempt failed in Congress earlier       this year.) Or if they continue on while doing their best to       leave the ``defund the police'' slogan behind them.                      [From Roll Call, Apr. 27, 2022]                 `Defund the Police' Still Haunts Democrats                             (By David Winston)         It's becoming increasingly clear that after the economy,       crime is a hot-button issue driving voter sentiment in the       lead-up to the November elections. But despite voter-concern,       Democrats continue to be divided over the controversial       ``defund the police'' mantra that has grabbed headlines for       the past two years, and it's beginning to hurt their       prospects for the fall elections.        The mixed messaging of party leaders versus the call to       defund by progressives, especially extreme comments by       members of the Squad, has become a costly roadblock to       retaining the House as voters lose confidence in Democrats'       ability to address rising violence across the country.        Even a cursory look at statements by Democratic leaders and       radical backbenchers opposed to increased funding of police       explains the party's dilemma.        On Feb. 13, George Stephanopoulos raised the issue of Rep.       Cori Bush's statements calling for defunding the police       during an interview with Speaker Nancy Pelosi. ``With all due       respect in the world to Cori Bush,'' she replied, ``that is       not the position of the Democratic Party.''        Pelosi then declared, ``Defund the police is dead.''        Two weeks later, in his State of the Union address,       President Biden called for increased funding for police: ``We       should all agree: The answer is not to defund the police. The       answer is to fund the police. Fund them. Fund them.''        Apparently, Squad member Bush didn't get the message. In a       tweet after the speech, she said, ``With all due respect, Mr.       President, you didn't mention saving Black lives once in this       speech. All our country has done is given more funding to       police. The result? 2021 set a record for fatal police       shootings. Defund the police. Invest in our communities.''        A month later, a gunman shot up a New York subway train,       and an inconvenient 2019 letter from Alexandria Ocasio-      Cortez, Jerrold Nadler and other liberal New York House       members resurfaced. The letter to then-Gov. Andrew Cuomo       opposed a plan to put 500 new Metropolitan Transportation       Authority officers in the subways to reduce crime.        But AOC was having none of it. She and her fellow members       wrote that the MTA funding for increased police presence in       the subways would be better spent on ``desperately needed       resources'' like ``subway, bus, maintenance, and service       improvements,'' telling Cuomo, ``The subway system is now       safer than before.''        Last week, Rep. Abigail Spanberger called defunding the       police ``a terrible idea,'' while a Politico story said, ``As       the midterm elections pick up, Democrats are calling for more       police funding and attempting to co-opt traditionally       Republican talking points on crime.''        ``Defund the police'' may no longer be the position of the       Democratic Party, but when Cori Bush, AOC or any member of       the Squad weighs in on any issue, the Twittersphere lights up       like a cop car in hot pursuit. It seems the media can't get       enough of the Squad, and polling shows that this intraparty       fight over the issue of policing and crime has not only       become a major headache for Pelosi but is also taking a toll       on the Democrats' credibility.        When the electorate was asked in the Winning the Issues       (WTI) February survey if they believed that we need to defund       the police, only 21 percent believed the statement, while 64       percent did not. Independents were even more adamant that       defunding the police was a bad idea, coming in at an       overwhelming 12 percent for and 70 percent against.        Despite Biden and Pelosi's efforts to stem the bleeding by       offering up more funding to stop gun violence and invest in       community policing, the WTI research shows that Democrats are       losing the issue, with more voters believing that the       Democratic Party supports defunding the police than not by a       margin of 48 percent to 34 percent.        There are three main reasons for the Democrats' troubles on       this issue. First, there is widespread recognition of just       how serious rising crime is becoming, with 7 out of 10 voters       believing that across America, violent crime is escalating.        Six out of 10 voters agree with the statement that       ``families, communities and small business are being       endangered and experiencing the devastating effects of       rhetoric about defunding the police and police department       budget cuts at the hands of politicians.''        These views extend across party, ideology, age and region,       making a concept like defunding the police totally out of       tune with most voters who oppose it by a 3-to-1 margin.        There's a second reason for the Democrats' weakness on the       crime issue. The president and other Democrats have tried to       have it both ways--trying to pose as supporters of the police       while only reluctantly, if at all, acknowledging that crime       is a major problem.        On the White House website list of priorities, crime       doesn't even make the list. The White House's lack of       acknowledgment and often dismissive rhetoric about crime,       particularly in cities with progressive mayors and       prosecutors, has led directly to its weak standing on the       issue.        As a result, when voters were asked in the March survey       whether they believed Democrats would focus on law       enforcement efforts to deal with violent offenders, they were       split, with 44 percent believing they would and 43 percent       believing they wouldn't. Independents were even more       skeptical, with 36 percent believing and 46 percent not       believing.        In contrast, voters by a 61 percent to 27 percent margin       believed that Republicans would stand with law enforcement in       their efforts to ensure the safety of our communities and the       protection of America's families and children.        Not surprisingly, Democrats trail on the handling of the       crime and safety issue by 12 points (48 percent favoring       Republicans, 36 percent favoring Democrats) and among       independents by 13 points (42 percent-29 percent, with 29       percent undecided). The Democratic Party's silence about       threats to safety has left Democrats supporting a policy       position that voters find alienating.        Finally, with police officers, Democrats have chosen the       wrong group to vilify. The police have a very favorable brand       image (72 percent favorable, 20 percent unfavorable in the       March WTI survey). Congressional Democrats have a negative       brand at 44 percent favorable, 49 percent unfavorable. By       affiliating themselves with the defund the police movement,       they are seen by voters as opposing a very positive group of       public servants who are well liked and supported by the       electorate.        By trying to straddle the fence on crime and safety, Biden,       Pelosi and Democratic members fearing primaries have been       unwilling to take on their anti-police progressives. If the       trend continues, this issue will haunt Democrats this       November and for a long time to come.     Madam Speaker, Democrats have long respected and  supported our law enforcement. As Representatives Guest and Letlow so  eloquently stated in their resolution to express support for  recognizing National Police Week, they serve with valor, dignity, and  integrity.   They are charged with pursuing justice for all individuals and  performing the duties of a law enforcement officer with fidelity to the  constitutional rights and civil rights of the public that the officers  serve.   They swear an oath to uphold the public trust, even though through  the performance of their duties of law enforcement officers, the  officers may become targets of senseless acts of violence.   They have bravely continued to meet the call of duty to ensure the  security of their neighborhoods and communities at the risk of their  own personal safety in the time of a viral pandemic.   There were 619 officers killed in the line of duty in 2021.  Republicans honor all of them and prioritize protecting and supporting  today's officers.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I point out that my good friend and colleague from  Minnesota, Congressman Stauber, who is former law enforcement, has  twice now released the JUSTICE Act, a commonsense police reform bill,  that would rebuild trust between law enforcement and communities they  serve.                                time  0945    Why is it that that has not come to the floor yet? And why is that  not part of the package that we are looking at?   Congressman Stauber was a police officer for 20 years. He knows law  enforcement exists to serve America's communities, and he knows what is  needed to rebuild the damaged relationship between officers and  civilians.   The Just and Unifying Solutions to Invigorate Communities Everywhere,  or the JUSTICE Act, would fund better training for police officers,  increase the number of body cameras, and provide important grants to  police departments to help implement community policing best practices.  Sound familiar?   He introduced this bill this Congress and last Congress and, yet,  despite its past bipartisan support, Democrats continuously blocked  efforts to bring this to the floor.   Why would Democrats block such a commonsense bill for years and now  decide it is necessary to pass these bills?   Let's just take a look at what they spent time promoting instead. For  example, the Democrats so-called George Floyd Justice in Policing Act  is a divisive bill being pushed through by the majority without any  Republican input. Disguised as accountability, the bill would make  communities less safe, hinder law enforcement's ability to do their  job, limit the readiness of law enforcement, and demonizes an entire  profession for the actions of a few.   It eliminates qualified immunity protections for Federal, State, and  local law enforcement officers which protect officers who have to  operate in high-pressure, quick-decision environments.   It lowers the mental standard for Federal civil rights lawsuits. It  allows officer convictions, even if the officer has no specific intent  to deprive a person of a Federal right.   I have given a couple of examples of good, strong Republican  legislation that was not considered as even part of the Democrats' so- called police or law  [[Page H8079]]  enforcement support grouping of bills that they have put together today  in an emergency meeting yesterday.   If there was truly support for law enforcement, they would have come  together in a bipartisan manner, discussed it with law enforcement,  discussed it with the minority, and really come together and created  legislation that would truly do what we need it to do, and that is  support and help our law enforcement.   Madam Speaker, today's debate is nothing more than a political stunt,  as I have mentioned. The Democrats have put forward these bills at the  last minute so they can go home this weekend and pretend they have done  something to help police in this country.   I mentioned it before. If the majority was sincere about supporting  law enforcement, they would have involved the minority. They would have  had discussion about the bills, good solid bills that the minority has  put forward, and they would have had discussions with law enforcement  across the country to find real solutions.   Our police do need our help. There is a war on police in this  country, thanks to the efforts of those on the far left. They know it;  I know it; and the American people know it.   But these bills are just one more insincere attempt. One mostly  recreates programs that already exist within the DOJ. The other  includes a section that still gives preference to efforts that do not  include recruitment and retainment.   Honestly, Madam Speaker, my colleagues should be embarrassed and  ashamed of this political stunt, especially when it comes to something  that affects everyone's safety and the American people's safety.   Madam Speaker, I oppose the rule, and I encourage Members to do the  same.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
