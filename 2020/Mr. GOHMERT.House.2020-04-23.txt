 Madam Speaker, I thank my friend, the gentleman from  Oklahoma (Mr. Cole), for yielding, and I am greatly sorry for the  losses yesterday, as well as down in Brian Babin's district.   I heard the Speaker say we need to move in a bipartisan manner, and I  believe she meant that. But then I can't forget that she said the same  thing about impeachment a year ago: we can't move forward with  impeachment unless it is bipartisan.   So what are we doing first? We are going to have a vote to create  another oversight committee. So apparently the answer the Democrats  have is if you have got eight committees that aren't doing their job,  we have the answer: another committee.   For heaven's sake, we have got people losing their businesses, they  are isolated.   Humans are social animals; we like to be around other people.   There are suicides, like in Knox County, Tennessee: they have lost  more people to suicide than the coronavirus.   We have got to be careful about spreading fear. We can be concerned,  but we shouldn't be afraid.   But another committee? For heaven's sake, that is not what we need.   It is interesting that the answer the Democrats have to potential  waste, fraud, and abuse is to create another wasteful committee.   Just make the committees we have do their job of oversight, and then  we will be all right. There needs to be oversight.   We apparently need a committee to give oversight to the oversight  committees, because they are not doing their job, and that is why we  need a new one.
