 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from  Florida for organizing this very important Special Order hour, and I  thank you, Mr. Speaker, for giving us the time to do this.   Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight to shine a light on the Metzger family  from Kibbutz Nir Oz, which suffered the unimaginable loss of 38 members  of the kibbutz, and from where a shocking 75 innocent people were taken  captive by Hamas. That is almost one-third of the innocent hostages who  were abducted by Hamas on October 7.   Two of those abducted were Tamar Metzger, age 78, and her husband  Yoram, age 80. They are grandparents.   Mrs. Metzger was released 2 days ago, after 52 days in captivity.   My family had an opportunity to spend some time with the Metzger's  son, Nir, and his two children, Ran and Omer, this week in New York.   According to Nir, the Hamas terrorists, teenagers, dragged his mom  out of her bathroom, bashed her face in with a rifle, and severely  injured her knees and legs as they violently took a 78-year-old woman  to the tunnels of Gaza.                                time  1900    In Gaza, both Metzgers were kept in a tiny, dark, and moist room in  an underground tunnel, where there were 12 mattresses on the floor for  the 2 of them and 10 other hostages from Kibbutz Nir Oz.   There was essentially nowhere for them to walk or move. They were not  allowed to speak. If they did speak, the terrorists would beat them.  This happened to a number of them, including 78-year-old Mrs. Metzger  at least one time.   Yoram remains held captive in that dank darkness underground, unable  to move, unable to speak, under constant fear of being beaten by Hamas  terrorists.   We cannot allow another day to go by before these innocent civilians  are released back to their homes in Israel. We cannot stop pushing and  pressing Hamas to release them and putting pressure on allies and other  countries in the Middle East--in Qatar, in Egypt--to put pressure on  Hamas to release the illegally abducted civilians who are kept captive  in the tunnels of Gaza without any light, without food, and without any  ability to move around.   It is time to bring them home. It is time to bring them all home.
