 Mr. Speaker, as a professional registered nurse  in Congress, I must say how crucial it is for essential medications to  be affordable and accessible.   In 2017, 42 percent of Texas residents stopped taking medications as  prescribed simply due to cost according to AARP. Over 2.6 million  Texans have diabetes, and they must have daily access to affordable and  quality insulin.   Mr. Speaker, huge investments from taxpayers go into the development  of quality medications, yet just in the first days of 2020 multiple  pharmaceutical companies have increased prices on over 400 drugs by 5  percent of the taxpayers' money.   We must do more to protect the vulnerable members of our communities,  especially our seniors and the uninsured. With support of this House  and Senate, we must continue to work together to lower the cost of  prescription drugs for our constituents.                            ____________________
