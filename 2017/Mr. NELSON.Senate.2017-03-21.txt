 Mr. President, we have seen TV clips about various  Members and Senators around the country having townhall meetings. For  example, three of our colleagues this past weekend--Indiana was one of  them--had tremendous townhall meetings with a good exchange of  information.   With this looming House of Representatives healthcare bill, which I  refer to as TrumpCare, since the President has endorsed it, I wanted to  see a particular group in our society who is extremely vulnerable and  those are the older Americans who are not 65--not old enough to be  eligible for Medicare. Now, be careful because there are people lurking  in these halls and the administration who would like to raise Medicare  eligibility from age 65 to 67. But that is not what is confronting the  House of Representatives; it is what is going to happen to those people  below the age of 65 for their healthcare. Under current law, once they  hit 65, they are eligible for Medicare.   I reached out to a particular group of Floridians. These are folks  whom I did not know that our offices in Florida had become aware of  because they had written about the healthcare debate that is going on  and, in many cases, had described their circumstances.   Yesterday, the group of 8 or 10 whom we had in my Orlando office were  all in the age range of 50 to 64. I want to tell the Senate about this  group of people because, if approved in its current form, the House  healthcare bill, TrumpCare, would dramatically increase healthcare  costs for folks in that age group, 50 to 64. Those are folks who either  get their healthcare through expanded Medicaid or they get their health  insurance through healthcare.gov, which is the exchange, whether it be  on the State exchange or the Federal exchange because the State does  not participate. According to the Congressional Budget Office, a 64- year-old making $26,500 could see their  [[Page S1873]]  healthcare costs go from $1,700 a year, which they pay now under the  Affordable Care Act, all the way up to $14,600 a year under the House  plan, TrumpCare. That is a dramatic jump, obviously. Do we think that  is really too much of an extreme example?   I want to tell you what these people said. If you look at what the  House is proposing, the dramatic rise in cost is due in large part to  two provisions contained in the House bill, one that would allow  insurers to charge older Americans up to five times as much as younger  people; the second one caps the Federal tax credits meant to help  seniors pay for the rising cost of health insurance. Federal tax  credits is a fancy way of saying ``subsidy.'' So if you are a senior  and you are above 138 percent of poverty, which for a single individual  is approximately $16,000 a year--by the way, who making $16,000 a year  can afford health insurance? That is why we need the remaining 19  States, my State of Florida included, to expand Medicaid up to that 138  percent of poverty. But if someone is between that level and all the  way up to 400 percent of the poverty level, which for a single  individual is about $46,000, $47,000 a year--in that zone of 138  percent of poverty up to 400 percent of poverty, there are these tax  credits or subsidies. The one with the lower income gets more of a  subsidy in order to buy private health insurance on the private  marketplace through the exchange. As they get up to 400 percent, a  person making $46,000 or $47,000 a year--can they really afford health  insurance? Not the real cost, unless it is some huge deductible plan  that doesn't give them much. That is why these folks need some  assistance. That is in place. That is the law. That is the Affordable  Care Act, which has been so maligned over the last several years.   Aside from health insurance, there is the expansion of Medicaid that  has helped a lot of people. There are still 4 million people in this  country who would benefit if those 19 remaining States would expand  Medicaid up to 138 percent. They are left in the cold. They are not  getting health insurance; they are not getting healthcare. They are  eligible to have it, and the Federal money is there to draw down to  enable them to have that Medicaid, but 19 States, including my State of  Florida, have decided not to expand it.   With all of that as background, I asked these folks to come in.  According to the AARP, there are millions of Floridians in that age  group of 50 to 64 who currently receive Medicaid or tax credits to help  them pay for the insurance through healthcare.gov; there are millions  who are eligible. So the group came in, and here's what I learned. I am  going to give you some personal vignettes.   Marshall Stern is a 61-year-old heart transplant survivor who lives  in Kissimmee, FL. Marshall has had a serious heart condition since he  was a young man. Three years ago, his condition worsened, and it  resulted in several hospitalizations, after which he was told he would  need a heart transplant. Since he is on full disability, he was told  that he had to enroll in Medicaid or he would not be eligible for the  transplant. Just the medication for the posttransplant operation costs  around $100,000 a year, which, obviously, Marshall would not be able to  afford without Medicaid coverage. He also is going to have to take this  medication for the rest of his life if he is going to live. He worries  that the House TrumpCare bill will turn Medicaid into a block grant  program, which is a fancy way of saying: We are going to cut it off,  and you are not going to get any more money, and you are going to have  to finance it from your own State resources. Governors and State  legislatures are going to have to share more of the burden of  healthcare costs. He is worried that if that House bill passes and  Medicaid is threatened as we know it, he is not going to be able to  have the medications he needs to stay alive. This is what Marshall told  me, and it was very dramatic. He said: ``It is as good as saying that I  die.''   For the rest of us who are not facing that, imagine having a fellow  tell you that. This is serious business.   Let me tell you about Susanna Perkins. She is a 62-year-old living in  Altamonte Springs. Susanna's husband lost his job in 2009, and she lost  her employer-provided health plan during the recession. The couple blew  through their IRA, and they ended up selling nearly everything they  had.   They eventually moved out of the country to save money, but in 2014,  they decided to move back. Why? Because the Affordable Care Act passed,  and the ACA made it possible for them to afford health insurance again.  This is what Susanna said:         If they shred [the ACA] like they're [threatening] to,       we're going to be hightailing it out of here, because dealing       with the health care [costs] and insurance makes you sick.       We're getting by, but if the ACA goes away, and if they make       these changes they're talking about, we'll be uninsured       again.    I was going to show you a picture. These are the folks whom I met  with yesterday. I will not point out the individuals, and I am going to  talk about some of the others, but you can see almost everybody. There  is one person who is outside the photograph. But we sat down for an  hour's conversation, and I heard their stories.   I wish every Senator and every Member of Congress would go out and  talk to people who are real people with real problems and understand  how petrified they are. These folks look like our neighbors and our  friends. They look like the people whom we go to church with. They look  like the people who have children or grandchildren whom we play with,  and they are petrified. They are scared to death that they are not  going to have healthcare.   So let me tell you about another one of these ladies. Terri Falbo is  a 59-year-old living in the Orlando area. She moved to Florida back in  2012 to take care of her elderly mother and disabled sister. For 25  years she had good health insurance through her employer where she  lived up north, and she rarely used health insurance. After losing her  job in 2006, as we went into the beginnings of the recession, she  purchased an individual insurance policy that cost her $500 to $650 a  month. Prior to the ACA, she had to make withdrawals from her  retirement account. She had to max out her credit cards to pay for the  premiums. As a result, she depleted all of her reserves and all of her  retirement funds. Since the Affordable Care Act was implemented, she  has had an affordable policy because she qualifies for the monthly  subsidy of over $600, bringing her premium payments to $70 a month with  a zero deductible. She could have gotten a policy with a $5,000  deductible for $3 a month. At her age, she needed assurance that she  would be able to have the healthcare she needed, so she paid $70 a  month because of the subsidy. Yet that is not what is protecting her in  the House TrumpCare bill.    Under that proposed healthcare plan, her maximum subsidy would be  less than $300 a month, which means she would end up paying $4,000 more  per year--an amount that she simply cannot afford. That is what she  told me: ``I cannot afford it.'' She said she would have to go without  health insurance instead. Before the ACA, she was desperately trying to  have health insurance, and she depleted all of her retirement funds.   There is another lady who is sitting around that table in the picture  I showed, Nancy Walker. She is a 51-year-old self-employed actor who is  living in Kissimmee. She is active. She is healthy. She chose to pursue  a career in the arts. The unstable nature of her profession has often  left her unable to afford health insurance. So she has gone without it  most of her adult life as an artist, as a performer.   Since the ACA took effect, however, she has, finally, been able to  afford health insurance, thanks to the subsidies. She told me that it  has been a relief for her to be able to go to the doctor not only for  checkups but, actually, when she has a problem, to fix it.   If Congress passes the House TrumpCare bill, her premiums are going  to go up. She has no doubt that she will, once again, be unable to  afford health insurance and healthcare. She told me that she fears  simple health issues will fester, becoming serious, chronic, and  expensive to treat. Remember, I said they were petrified--that they  were scared to death. There is an example. Finally, she has health  insurance after all of these years of going without because she did not  have an employer who paid for her.   Let's take another one. Marilyn Word is a 63-year-old retiree living  in Orlando. Marilyn lives mainly off of Social Security payments but is  not  [[Page S1874]]  old enough to qualify for Medicare. She is under that magic year of age  65, at which one is eligible.   After retiring, Marilyn enrolled in an insurance plan through the ACA  exchange, and she is eligible for annual tax credits to help her pay  for her insurance. Marilyn told me that she was extremely worried about  the increased premiums that she would likely have to pay under the  House TrumpCare plan.   I will give you another example of a lady who is sitting around that  table. Sharon Brown is a 58-year-old widow. She lives in the Orlando  area. Since her husband's death, Sharon has been dealing with several  medical issues and pulling money out of her retirement account to pay  for her current plan. She has a nest egg from her husband's life  insurance money, but due to her health condition, she will likely need  long-term medical care. This is what she told me:         My premium's pretty high because I've got multiple medical       conditions that make it so I cannot work. I've done a lot of       reading on this . . . and the cost of my healthcare [under       the TrumpCare plan] will amount to double what I make right       now in income.    She looked at me with this pained expression on her face and said:  ``It's very scary, and the anxiety that goes along with this happening  right now is making it worse.''   Sharon told me that she is a lifelong registered Republican--she  volunteered this--and she said that the bill being considered now is  forcing her to reconsider her party. She said:         I'm changing my political affiliation to independent. I       want to vote my conscience.    When one puts faces to these stories--to these people about whom I  have just talked and about whom we just talked yesterday--the House  TrumpCare plan ends Medicaid as we know it because it cuts off the  amount going to the States.   I understand that in the House, in trying to fix up some things just  last night, they filed an amendment in an attempt to address some of  the problems. One of the things they were trying to fix would allow  States to choose between capping or block-granting the Medicaid  Program. Under either proposal, the Federal Government is going to be  contributing less to the States, and that means more money will have to  be picked up--the tab--by the States. Just ask the Governors how much  more they can pick up.   I urge our House and Senate colleagues to join all of these people  whom I have talked about and vote as Sharon said--with their  consciences on what they are going to do to folks like them. Gutting  Medicaid and forcing struggling, older Americans to pay more for health  insurance is simply not the right thing to do. For a change, we ought  to be trying to do the right thing.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, will the Senator yield since he has  invoked my name?    Mr. President, I do not intend for the Senator to yield  the floor, and he is my friend.   The Senator started out by saying he was missing something. Yes, he  missed the first part of my speech, during which I talked about these  folks in the age category of 50 to 64, who are not eligible for  Medicare.    Mr. President, I am about to ask the question.   I want to introduce the Senator to these people in that age group of  50 to 64. In fact, they told me stories that had them scared to death.   Would the Senator believe that they believe that they are going to  lose coverage?    Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from  Texas, and he knows my affection for him.   The Senator has stated that he would like, in a bipartisan way, to  fix the current law. Would the Senator believe, if there were a  genuine, bipartisan attempt to fix what needs fixing instead of  repealing and replacing it with something that has people petrified,  that he could find that bipartisan consensus?
