 Mr. Speaker, a handful of issues have  always transcended politics. Our troops, the guardians of our freedom,  have always been one of them, but in the MAGA Republican Party, nothing  is off the table. Nothing takes priority over their goal of a  nationwide abortion ban.   Military promotions, troops' paychecks, our national defense bill:  all held hostage because extremists want to tear away the reproductive  freedom of the very people fighting for our freedom.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues: Put our country first and instruct  the conferees to deliver a defense bill that puts freedom over fascism.                            ____________________
