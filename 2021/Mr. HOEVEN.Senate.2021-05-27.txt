 Mr. President, I rise to mark Military Appreciation Month  and to pay tribute to the many military members and veterans who have  sacrificed in service to our Nation.   This month provides an opportunity to show our immense gratitude to  all those who have donned a uniform in our Armed Forces. The freedoms  and blessings we enjoy as a nation have been secured by their hard work  and determination. Military Appreciation Month culminates in Memorial  Day--the date set aside to honor the men and women who have given the  ultimate sacrifice in defense of our Nation.   While we honor their memory on Memorial Day, we remember their loss  every day and extend our gratitude to their loved ones, as well as to  those who continue to serve.   We also recognize that those who serve do not serve alone. The  friends and families of those in the service of our country also serve,  and those who have lost loved ones know too well the cost of our  freedoms. I believe that we best honor and pay tribute to our military  members by thanking them, both past and present, and by ensuring they  have the resources and support they have so richly earned.   As a member of the Senate Defense and Veterans' Affairs  Appropriations Subcommittees, I have worked with my colleagues to  ensure that our veterans and military members are properly trained and  equipped and receive the care, benefits, and recognition they were  promised. Our servicemembers and their families have given much in  defense of our Nation, and the State of North Dakota, especially, has a  rich tradition of military service.   My State is home to some of the country's most premier Air Force  installations, including the Minot and Grand Forks Air Force Bases and  Cavalier Air Station. We have more than 7,300 Active-Duty  servicemembers who are currently serving in North Dakota and performing  missions that are essential to our national security. In addition, more  than 4,400 men and women serve in the North Dakota National Guard.  Currently, more than 53,000 veterans call North Dakota home.   We are grateful for the many servicemembers and veterans who have  served our country, and we honor their service every day but especially  during Military Appreciation Month. We will never forget the sacrifices  of those who gave their lives so we can enjoy the freedoms that we are  so blessed to have today and every day                      Tribute to Lynn Aas and John Sinn    Mr. President, there is no better example of service and sacrifice  than that of our ``greatest generation.'' I would like to honor two  World War II veterans, as well as the Kiwanis Club of Minot, ND, of  which they have both been lifelong members. This year marks the 100th  anniversary of the Minot Kiwanis Club, as well as the 100-year  birthdays of two Kiwanis members, Mr. Lynn Aas and Mr. John Sinn.   Since its founding on May 27, 1921, the Kiwanis Club of Minot has  helped to make my home town, where I grew up, a better place to live.  As a former member myself of this organization, I deeply appreciate its  continued dedication and contributions to the community and the  surrounding area. Some examples of its work include donating books to  schools, supporting the arts, and raising money for local service  organizations like the Boy Scouts, the Juvenile Drug Court, and the  Domestic Violence Crisis Center. In these ways, Minot's local Kiwanis  chapter helps realize the mission of this international organization  and makes a real difference to families and children in the region.   For two individuals who have been lifelong members of that group, in  the very same year the organization turns 100, it is their 100th  birthdays as well. As part of the ``greatest generation'' and as World  War II veterans, Lynn Aas and John Sinn have both been important parts  of the Minot community in so many ways and have set a great example not  only in their service but  [[Page S3849]]  in the service they have delivered throughout their lives even after  World War II.   A native of McLean County, ND, Lynn Aas fought as a rifleman in the  historic Battle of the Bulge. He served with the 17th Airborne Division  of the 193rd Airborne Infantry and received the Bronze Star, the Purple  Heart, and the French Legion of Honour medal. Following the war, he  returned to his home State, where he earned his law degree from the  University of North Dakota.   In addition to being a lifelong Kiwanis member, he served in our  State's legislature for four sessions. He was the president of the  Minot Chamber of Commerce; served on the board for the United Way; and  has been a longtime supporter of Minot State University and of so many,  many other worthwhile things. His family and my family have been  friends for as long as I can remember--truly, a great American.   Also, John Sinn--another veteran of World War II--has his 100th  birthday as well. As a member of the 386th Infantry Regiment, John Sinn  served in the European theater, where he earned the Bronze Star. He  returned home to farm with family members in Ryder, ND, eventually  going to work for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in 1957.   He retired in 1989, more than 30 years ago. However, rather than  taking a well-earned rest, he has continued to serve the community as a  volunteer. Included among his volunteer efforts, he is best known for  his work to improve and maintain the Scandinavian Heritage Park--a  beautiful Scandinavian park in the community. It is truly an iconic  outdoor museum. It is central to the community's identity and is home  to the annual Norsk Hostfest, the largest celebration of Scandinavian  culture and history in North America.   The Presiding Officer is invited any time he would like to come join  us. It is a wonderful festival with wonderful food, and the best view  of the park can be found at John Sinn Outlook, which is a testament to  his many contributions.   We recognize the hard work, dedication, and service of Lynn Aas, John  Sinn, and the entire Minot Kiwanis Club as they celebrate their 100th  birthdays this year. It is therefore appropriate to take this time to  recognize their hard work, their dedication, and their service, and I  have submitted a statement honoring that today.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I rise today to honor the 100th  anniversary of the Kiwanis Club of Minot, ND, as well as the 100-year  birthdays of two Kiwanis members, ND, constituents, Mr. Lynn Aas and  Mr. John Sinn.   Since its founding on May 27, 1921, the Kiwanis Club of Minot has  helped make my home town a better place to live. As a former member of  this organization, I deeply appreciate their continued dedication and  contributions to the community and surrounding area. Some examples of  their work include donating books to schools, supporting the arts, and  raising money for local service organizations, like the Boy Scouts and  the Juvenile Drug Court and Domestic Violence Crisis Center. In these  ways, Minot's local Kiwanis  [[Page S3889]]  chapter helps realize the mission of this international organization  and makes a real difference to families and children in the region.   At the same time, two notable Kiwanis members, Mr. Lynn Aas and Mr.  John Sinn, are celebrating their 100th birthdays this year. As part of  the ``greatest generation'' and as World War II veterans, Lynn and John  have both been an important part of the Minot community and set a great  example for their fellow Kiwanis members.   A native of McLean County, ND, Lynn Aas fought as a rifleman in the  historic Battle of the Bulge. He served with the 17th Airborne Division  of the 193rd Airborne Infantry and received the Bronze Star, the Purple  Heart, and the French Legion of Honor medal.

However, rather than  taking a well-earned rest, he has been hard at work serving the Minot  community. Among his efforts as a volunteer, he is best known for his  work to improve and maintain the Scandinavian Heritage Park.   This is an iconic outdoor museum that is central to the community's  identity and home to the annual Norsk Hostfest, the largest celebration  of Scandinavian culture and history in North America. The best view of  the park can be found at John Sinn Outlook, a testament to his many  contributions.   It is therefore appropriate to take this time to recognize the hard  work, dedication, and service of Lynn Aas, John Sinn, and the entire  Kiwanis Club of Minot as they all celebrate their 100th birthdays this  year.                            ____________________
