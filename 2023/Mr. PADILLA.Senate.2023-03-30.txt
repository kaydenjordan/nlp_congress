 Mr. President, I rise today to celebrate the  Sacramento Regional Transit District on 50 years of service, helping  Californians commute to work, visit loved ones, and explore the  beautiful county of Sacramento.   Since first providing service in 1973, Sacramento Regional Transit,  or SacRT, has grown to include over 97 electric light rail vehicles and  over 230 buses, traversing 440 square miles to include the cities of  Sacramento, Elk Grove, Folsom, Citrus Heights, and Rancho Cordova.   Throughout that time, SacRT has been committed to finding new ways to  serve Californians, by spearheading an on-demand microtransit service  accessible via mobile app, and by converting 10 buses into WiFi  hotspots during the height of the pandemic when internet access was a  necessity for school, work, and public health.   By providing free fares for K-12 students, SacRT has helped countless  students pursue their education without having to worry about affording  a ride to school. During a time of unprecedented weather events in  California, SacRT also partnered with the city of Sacramento to provide  free bus rides to warming centers for individuals experiencing  homelessness.   SacRT has fought to reduce air pollution and greenhouse gases. Their  leadership in renewable energy, accessibility, and service have been  rightly recognized by both State and Federal agencies.   In the capital of the fourth largest economy in the world, SacRT is  an integral part of the community, constantly finding ways to better  serve the people of Sacramento who rely on it for affordable transit.  After 50 years of service, Californians know SacRT can get you ``where  you want to go, when you want to go.'' And we are excited to see where  the next 50 years will take us.                            ____________________     Madam President, I rise to reintroduce the Cesar E.  Chavez and the Farmworker Movement National Historical Park Act.   This Friday, March 31, we celebrate Cesar Chavez Day to honor and  celebrate the life and legacy of the civil rights and labor leader  whose impact reverberated throughout California and across the world.  For Cesar Chavez, it did not matter where you came from or what your  job was, he believed in your fundamental right to dignity and respect.   Ahead of Cesar Chavez Day, I introduce this legislation, which would  establish the Cesar E. Chavez and the Farmworker Movement National  Historical Park in California and Arizona to preserve the nationally  significant sites associated with Cesar Chavez and the farmworker  movement.   In 2008, with strong bipartisan support, Congress enacted legislation  directing the National Park Service to conduct a special resource study  of sites that are significant to the life of Cesar Chavez and the farm  labor movement in the Western United States. The National Park Service  evaluated over 100 sites and found that five sites were ``nationally  significant.'' Importantly, the Park Service wrote that these  nationally significant sites depict a distinct and important aspect of  American history associated with civil rights and labor movements that  are not adequately represented or protected elsewhere. While the Park  Service provided five management alternatives to protect these special  places, they ultimately recommended that Congress establish a national  historic park that would include several nationally significant sites.   In 2012, President Obama established the Cesar E. Chavez National  Monument. The property is in Keene, CA, and is known as Nuestra Senora  Reina de la Paz. In his Presidential Proclamation, President Obama  said: ``This site marks the extraordinary achievements and  contributions to the history of the United States made by Cesar Chavez  and the farm worker movement that he led with great vision and  fortitude. La Paz reflects his conviction that ordinary people can do  extraordinary things.''   While this was a critical step forward, the National Monument leaves  out many nationally significant sites and leaves many important stories  untold. The creation of a national historical park, as originally  recommended by the Park Service, would allow the National Park Service  to tell the full story of Cesar Chavez and the farm labor movement for  the benefit of all Americans.   In addition to the inclusion of the existing Cesar E. Chavez National  Monument, which includes La Nuestra Senora Reina de la Paz, in Keene,  CA, the National Park Service would be able to add additional sites to  the park upon written agreement from site owners. These sites include  the Forty Acres in Delano, CA, the Santa Rita Center in Phoenix, AZ;  and McDonnell Hall, in San Jose, CA. These sites contain nationally  significant resources associated with Cesar Chavez and the farmworker  movement and would be preserved and protected as part of the National  Park System.   This legislation would also require the National Park Service to  complete a national historic trail study to determine the feasibility  of creating the Farmworker Peregrinacion National Historic Trail. This  trail would commemorate the 1966 Delano to Sacramento March, a major  milestone event in the farm labor movement. According to the Special  Resource Study, ``More than one hundred men and women set out from  Delano on March 17, 1966, and thousands of farm workers and their  families joined in for short stretches along the way. By the time the  marchers entered Sacramento on Easter Sunday, April 10, 1966, the farm  worker movement had secured a contract and attracted new waves of  support from across the country.''   We must honor and celebrate the life and legacy of Cesar Chavez, the  inspirational civil rights advocate and leader of the farm labor  movement whose impact reverberated in California and across the world.  His list of accomplishments is long, from creating the Nation's first  permanent agricultural labor union to helping secure passage of the  first American law that recognized farmworkers' rights to organize.   While widely respected as the most important Latino leader in the  United States in the 20th century, Cesar Chavez was not just a leader  for the Latino community. Following the principles of Mahatma Gandhi  and Martin Luther King, Jr., Cesar Chavez led a nonviolent movement of  protests and boycotts to secure a union, better pay, and better working  conditions for farmworkers of all ethnicities. He also played a leading  role in the broader labor movement, the Chicano movement, and the  environmental movement.   But this park will not just focus on Chavez's legacy; it will also  preserve  [[Page S1094]]  the thousands of stories of people who played a role in the broader  farm labor movement. According to the special resource study, ``During  the 1960s, the farm labor movement attracted support from a wide array  of individuals, including members of other unions, religious leaders,  civil rights activists, high school students and college students  (including young Chicanos and Filipinos), environmentalists, and  justice-minded consumers across the country and abroad.''   As the son of immigrants from Mexico and the first Latino to  represent California in the U.S. Senate, I believe the movement Cesar  Chavez created is just as important today as it ever has been. The  National Park System--which preserves our natural, historical, and  cultural heritage while offering vital spaces for teaching, learning,  and outdoor recreation-must paint the full mosaic of America. Through  the sites preserved by this bill, we can ensure that the National Park  System preserves the diverse history of our Nation that is too often  overlooked. As a farmworker himself, Cesar Chavez maintained a strong  connection to the natural environment. This bill uplifts his story and  those of others whose contributions helped build the farmworker and  civil rights movements that are pillars of American history.   I thank the bill's cosponsors in the Senate and House of  Representatives, and I especially want to thank Congressman Ruiz for  spearheading this effort with me to ensure that our national monuments  and historical parks better reflect the diversity of America's  heritage.   Today and every day, let's recommit to the work Cesar Chavez began.  As he would say: La Lucha Sigue. We must not waver as we keep up the  fight for justice and equality for all.   I look forward to working with my colleagues to enact the Cesar E.  Chavez National Historical Park Act as quickly as possible.                                  ______                                         By Mr. THUNE (for himself, Mr. Barrasso, Mrs. Blackburn, Mr.          Boozman, Mr. Braun, Mrs. Britt, Mr. Budd, Mrs. Capito, Mr.          Cornyn, Mr. Cotton, Mr. Cramer, Mr. Crapo, Mr. Cruz, Mr.          Daines, Ms. Ernst, Mrs. Fischer, Mr. Graham, Mr. Grassley, Mr.          Hagerty, Mr. Hawley, Mr. Hoeven, Mrs. Hyde-Smith, Mr. Johnson,          Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Lankford, Mr. Lee, Ms. Lummis, Mr. Marshall,          Mr. McConnell, Mr. Moran, Mr. Mullin, Mr. Ricketts, Mr. Risch,          Mr. Rounds, Mr. Rubio, Mr. Schmitt, Mr. Scott of Florida, Mr.          Scott of South Carolina, Mr. Tillis, Mr. Tuberville, and Mr.          Wicker):   S. 1108.
