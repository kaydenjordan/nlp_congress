 Mr. Chief Justice, I submit a question to the President's  counsel.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you.   The question from Senator Sinema to President's counsel is this:         The administration notified Congress of the hold of the       Northern Triangle countries' funds in 2019, announced its       decision to withhold aid to Afghanistan in September 2019,       and worked with Congress for months in 2018 regarding funds       being withheld due to Pakistan's lack of progress meeting its       counterterrorism responsibilities. In these instances, the       receiving countries knew the funds were being withheld to       change behavior and further publicly-stated American policy.       Why, when the administration withheld the Ukraine security       assistance, did it not notify Congress, or make Ukraine or       partner countries publicly aware of the hold and the steps       needed to resolve the hold?    Mr. Counsel PHILBIN. Mr. Chief Justice, Senator, thank you for the  question.   I think that, in all of those instances that were listed in the  question, it was clear that withholding the aid was meant to send a  signal. It was done publicly, and it was meant to send a signal to the  country. I think that in the testimony before the House here,  Ambassador Volker made clear that he and others hoped that the hold  would not become public because they did not want there to be any  signal to the Ukrainians or to others.   People have talked here--the House managers talked about how, well,  even if the aid, when it was withheld, didn't lead to anything not  being purchased over the summer, it was still dangerous because it sent  a signal to the Russians. The whole point was, it wasn't public. The  Ukrainians didn't know. The Russians didn't know. It wasn't being done  to send a signal; it was to address concerns.   The President had raised concerns, and he wanted time to have those  concerns addressed. He wanted to understand better burden-sharing--the  issue that is reflected in the June 24 email that I referred to  earlier; it is referred to in the July 25 call transcripts--and he  wanted to understand corruption issues. He raised corruption issues.   Over the course of the summer, the testimony of Mr. Morrison in  particular below explained that there were developments on corruption.  President Zelensky had just been elected in April. At that time,  multiple witnesses testified that it was unclear. He had run on a  reform agenda, but it was unclear what he would be able to accomplish  because it was unclear whether or not he would secure a majority in the  Ukrainian Parliament. Those elections didn't occur until July. That is  when the July 25 call occurred.   He won the majority in Parliament, but the Parliament was not  actually going to be seated until later in August. Mr. Morrison  testified that when he and Ambassador Bolton were in Kyiv in August,  around August 27, that the Parliament had just been seated, and  Zelensky and his Ministers were tired because they had been up all  night. They kept the Parliament up late in session to pass the reform  agenda right then, including things like eliminating immunity for  members of the Parliament from corruption, prosecutions, and the  legislature just set up the newly formed corruption court.   So these developments were positive developments, but then Mr.  Morrison testified that President Zelensky, when he spoke to Vice  President Pence in Warsaw, discussed these things, and President  Zelensky went through what he was doing, and then that information was  relayed back to the President.   So the hold had been in place so that the President could, within the  U.S. Government, privately consider this information, not to send a  signal to the outside world.   This plays into some of the ideas that the House manager presented  that somehow this was terrible; it sent a signal to the Russians. Part  of the whole point, Ambassador Volker explained, was that there was  concern that it not become public because it would then not send a  signal. That is what happened until the POLITICO article came out on  August 28. I think that is the best way to understand the difference  and approach there. Thank you.    The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, counsel.
