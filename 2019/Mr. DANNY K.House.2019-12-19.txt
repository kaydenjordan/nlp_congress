 DAVIS of Illinois. Madam Speaker, I have always been  told, if there is righteousness in the heart, then there is beauty in  the character. I think what we have seen this week and what we are  seeing today is the righteousness of the Members of this House who take  the position that  [[Page H12253]]  neither side will get everything that it wants.   I certainly won't get everything that I want for the State of  Illinois, but I have got dairy farmers--not as many as Ron Kind may  have in Wisconsin--I have got corn growers in Illinois and soybean  growers--maybe not as many as there are in Iowa. But the  comprehensiveness of the communities that we represent demand that we  come together.   So I want to commend Chairman Neal, our ranking member, the working  group, and the Speaker of the House because it took all of them to make  this work.   So, Madam Speaker, I am going to vote for it. I admit that I feel a  great deal like Bill Pascrell, but I am going to vote for it because we  need to come together and do what we can for the American people.    DAVIS of Illinois. Madam Speaker, my congressional  district is one of the most affected congressional districts in the  Nation, ranking 38 among districts in highest average SALT deductions.  Over 105,000 households benefited from SALT in my district in 2017,  with an average benefit of $19,400. Then the Republican tax law  increased taxes on millions of Illinoisans and tens of millions of  Americans.   The SALT deduction is a bedrock part of the tax code since its  inception. It has been around since the beginning of time.   If it ain't broke, don't fix it. We need to restore it and make sure  that citizens get the benefit in their communities from their State  government and then be able to use it as a part of their income tax.
