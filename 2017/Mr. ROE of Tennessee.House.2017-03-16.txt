 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 198,  I call up the bill (H.R. 1181) to amend title 38, United States Code,  to clarify the conditions under which certain persons may be treated as  adjudicated mentally incompetent for certain purposes, and ask for its  immediate consideration in the House.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Simpson). Pursuant to House Resolution  198, the bill is considered read.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1181         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Veterans 2nd Amendment       Protection Act''.       SEC. 2. CONDITIONS FOR TREATMENT OF CERTAIN PERSONS AS                     ADJUDICATED MENTALLY INCOMPETENT FOR CERTAIN                     PURPOSES.         (a) In General.--Chapter 55 of title 38, United States       Code, is amended by inserting after section 5501A the       following new section:       ``Sec. 5501B. Conditions for treatment of certain persons as         adjudicated mentally incompetent for certain purposes         ``Notwithstanding any determination made by the Secretary       under section 5501A of this title, in any case arising out of       the administration by the Secretary of laws and benefits       under this title, a person who is mentally incapacitated,       deemed mentally incompetent, or experiencing an extended loss       of consciousness shall not be considered adjudicated as a       mental defective under subsection (d)(4) or (g)(4) of section       922 of title 18 without the order or finding of a judge,       magistrate, or other judicial authority of competent       jurisdiction that such person is a danger to himself or       herself or others.''.        (b) Clerical Amendment.--The table of sections at the       beginning of chapter 55 of such title is amended by inserting       after the  [[Page H2103]]       item relating to section 5501A the following new item:  ``5501B. Conditions for treatment of certain persons as adjudicated                mentally incompetent for certain purposes.''.    The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlemen from Tennessee (Mr. Roe) and  the gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms. Esty) each will control 30  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Tennessee.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and insert extraneous material in the Record on H.R. 1181.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Tennessee?   There was no objection.                   Announcement by the Speaker Pro Tempore    The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to not traffic the well  during debate.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, too often, as Americans, we tend to take our freedom for  granted. We should never forget we owe the freedom to our Nation's  veterans. That is why it is so egregious that many veterans come home  to find that they have to do battle with the VA--the very agency that  is supposed to help and support them--to protect their own  constitutional rights. The problem occurs when VA, for whatever reason,  determines that a veteran needs assistance managing his or her VA  financial benefits and decides to appoint a fiduciary.   Now, there may be many reasons that a veteran might need a fiduciary,  such as a veteran who has TBI may have trouble with math and struggles  to balance his or her checkbook. But it is important to remember that  the decision to appoint a fiduciary is made by a VA bureaucrat, not a  judge or a magistrate after ensuring that veteran's due process rights  are protected.   Unfortunately, there are serious, unintended consequences when VA  appoints a fiduciary. This is because, once VA decides that the  beneficiary needs help with finances, even though there may be no  evidence that the individual may be a danger to himself or others, the  Department sends his or her name to the FBI to be added to the NICS  list.   As you know, anyone whose name is on the NICS list is legally  prohibited from possessing a firearm. This means that the veteran can  no longer participate in sports like hunting or target shooting. The  veteran is also legally obligated to relinquish any firearms he or she  owns, including collector's pieces and family heirlooms.   I am opposed to the VA's existing policy not only because it deprives  veterans of their constitutional rights without due process of law, I  am also concerned that these veterans are not able to participate in  recreational therapy programs like VA's program at the VA Grand  Junction medical center in Colorado that enables veterans with physical  and mental disabilities to go hunting or shooting. I know from personal  experience that these therapy programs are very effective in helping  these heroes recover from injuries that they have received while  serving our country.   It is unfortunate that some of the opponents of this bill are  perpetrating the outdated stereotypes that people who are mentally ill  may be violent and should be feared. I am concerned that these false  characterizations may actually deter people from seeking the health  services they need.   It is hard enough for some people to admit they need help, Mr.  Speaker, but image how much more difficult it is when they fear that  they would be stigmatized and isolated. It is also possible that some  veterans decide to avoid using VA healthcare services all together out  of fear that a VA bureaucrat may decide that they are incompetent and  take away their constitutional rights.   Let's take a look at the people who actually are added to the NICS  list as a result of the Veterans Administration's appointing a  fiduciary.   There are currently more than 1,000 children under the age of 20 here  on the NICS list, likely because VA appointed a fiduciary because they  are too young to handle their own money.   VA has also added the names of 107,000 people over 80 years old to  the NICS list. These individuals probably just need help with their  finances due to their advanced age.   But should VA really take away the Second Amendment rights from our  Nation's seniors, particularly those who fought for the country? It is  outrageous that the only group of people that can have their  constitutional rights taken away without a hearing before a judge or  magistrate are the very people who fought for those rights and their  dependents. Even criminals must be convicted in a court of law before  their names are added to that list, Mr. Speaker.   H.R. 1181 would simply prohibit VA from sending veterans' names to  the NICS list unless there is an order from a judge or a magistrate  that says the person may harm themselves or others.   This proposal has enjoyed bipartisan support in the past. In 2011,  the House passed H.R. 2349, which included similar provisions, by voice  vote. And just last month, both the House and Senate passed H.J. Res.  40, which prevented the Social Security Administration from  implementing a similar policy to report the names of some people who  have received disability insurance benefits to NICS.   H.R. 1181 also has wide support among the veterans community,  including the American Legion, the VFW, and AMVETS. H.R. 1181 is also  supported by the National Disability Rights Network and the National  Rifle Association. Additionally, H.R. 1181 has a positive statement of  the administration's support.   Mr. Speaker, veterans who fought to defend the Constitution should  also be allowed the rights it protects. I urge all Members to support  H.R. 1181. It is the right thing to do, and I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   In America, the last time I looked, you are presumed innocent until  proven guilty. What we have done with these veterans who have served  this country, many of them injured in combat, is we have said you are  guilty and you have to prove you are innocent to be able to own a  firearm in your own home.   By the way, Mr. Speaker, people who are in a fiduciary status  actually statistically have a slightly lower incarceration rate than  veterans who are not. So to say that they are a danger to themselves or  a danger to others is erroneous.   The other thing I would like to say is that the 21st Century Cures  Act, Mr. Speaker, has codified basically the VA policy is what it did.  It did not change the policy. What we are saying to veterans is that if  you are an honorably discharged veteran who needs a fiduciary for  whatever reason, you automatically lose a constitutionally guaranteed  right.   I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Bost), an  active member of the Veterans Affairs' Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from Colorado (Mr. Lamborn).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from Colorado (Mr. Lamborn).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from Colorado (Mr. Lamborn).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from Colorado (Mr. Lamborn).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from Colorado (Mr. Lamborn).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from Colorado (Mr. Lamborn).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   The text of this bill does not remove the names of anyone who is  currently on the NICS list. It simply prohibits the VA Secretary from  continuing to send the names of beneficiaries who utilize a fiduciary  to the NICS list. And there is nothing in the bill that would require  the VA Secretary to take any action with respect to those already on  the list.   Just one other thing, Mr. Speaker, to show you how the VA's policy is  not consistent: just as an example, a veteran who is rated at 100  percent disabled for PTSD is not automatically given a fiduciary, even  though the symptoms required for that rating may include suicidal or  homicidal ideation. So they are very inconsistent about how they do  this. And of the 915,744 veterans who have a service-connected PTSD  condition, only 1.7 percent of them have a fiduciary. Remember, they  lose their constitutionally guaranteed right.   I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Farenthold),  a hardworking member of this conference.                                time  1445     Mr. Speaker, once again, let me state this for  the record. The text of this bill does not remove the names of anyone  who is currently on the NICS list, except it prohibits the VA Secretary  from continuing to send the names of the beneficiaries who utilize a  fiduciary to the NICS list.   I don't want guns in the hands of anybody who should not own a gun  who is mentally unstable, but what we are saying is that a VA rater  should be a judge or a magistrate, where you can argue both sides of  this in front of them. It shouldn't be a VA bureaucrat that is doing  this.   I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Conaway), the  chairman of the Agriculture Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I guess by listening to the debate that is going on, one would assume  that someone who has a fiduciary would be a danger to themselves and  others, and I think that is completely erroneous to assume that.   Let me read you excerpts of a floor statement that Senator Burr made  in 2009 to show you how this can get off track. And we are going to put  sort of a human face on this, just an excerpt from a letter that  Jennifer wrote as the wife of Corey.   ``Corey served in Iraq. He was a paramedic. He was severely injured  by an IED explosion in 2004, which caused severe burns, damage to his  lungs, and severe traumatic brain injury after shrapnel entered his  skull. Corey spent . . . 5 years recovering from his injuries. Jennifer  reports that he is walking, talking, and enjoying life at home with his  two children.   ``Now it gets really sad. Because of his head injury, Corey still  requires help with certain things. The VA said he needed help managing  his disability compensation payments, and they named Jennifer, his  spouse, as his fiduciary''--his wife. ``That is where I would like to  read you her letter. Again, I quote from the letter:   `` `On May 19, 2009, we had our annual fiduciary meeting with the VA  field examiner. At the end of the meeting, our field examiner said he  needed to read a statement to us. He read the Brady Bill statement and  then stated that Corey can't own, possess, use, be around, et cetera,  any firearms. He then went on to say that anyone in our household can't  own a gun while living in this household.   `` `I asked him about Corey going on adaptive hunting trips and he  said he couldn't. Corey stated that he had a gun that was handed down  from his grandfather and that Corey was going to hand it down to his  son, and the field examiner told him that he couldn't have it. He  stated to Corey that if he did own a gun or be around a gun that he  would be threatened with imprisonment.   `` `The way that that field examiner talked to Corey about this issue  was not appropriate. The field examiner said that I could challenge it  and handed me a blank sheet of paper with a VA heading. I asked the  field examiner for the statement that he read to me, but he said that  he had to ask his boss if he could actually provide a copy of that  statement. After 2 weeks of me emailing him, I finally got the attached  papers in the mail. I think the VA is taking this way out of concept,  and I would greatly appreciate your support.'   ``Well, in case any of my colleagues think the government would never  prosecute someone like Corey for possession of a firearm, being around  a firearm, I wish to read to my colleagues excerpts from the VA  directive that went out to all VA regional offices on September 29,  2009, on this very issue.   ``The directive is meant to inform fiduciary field examiners of their  obligation if they were to witness a violation of the Brady Act. I am  going to quote from this VA memorandum to the field examiners.   `` `Field examiners or other VA employees who encounter beneficiaries  believed to be in violation of the Brady Act are required to notify the  fiduciary activity manager as soon as safely possible. At no time  should the employee place him/herself in danger. The fiduciary activity  manager at the VA regional office of jurisdiction must immediately  report the alleged violation to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and  Firearms,' '' and here is the number.   And that is straight out of their memorandum, Mr. Speaker.   We don't want weapons, no one in this room, and none of my colleagues  on the VA Committee, Republican or Democrat, want weapons in the hands  of someone that is considered dangerous. But we have American heroes  that are being denied their Second Amendment right to even keep their  grandfather's gun. I feel that, if you want to go and have your due  process rights in front of a court of law or magistrate, that is  perfectly okay. That is the way our system works. But not a VA rater.  They don't get to do that. And I think, by passing this bill, we will  guarantee those rights to our American heroes.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I include in the Record two documents from the VFW and The American  Legion supporting this legislation.                                            Veterans of Foreign Wars                                            of the United States,                                                      March 8, 2017.      Hon. David P. Roe,      Chairman, House Veterans' Affairs Committee, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Roe: On behalf of the men and women of the       Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States (VFW) and our       Auxiliary, I am pleased to offer the VFW's support for H.R.       1181, the Veterans 2nd Amendment Protection Act.        It is unconscionable to require veterans to choose between       the care they have earned and deserve and their       constitutional rights. Your legislation would ensure veterans       who suffer from mental health conditions no longer have to       worry about losing their 2nd amendment rights when seeking       potentially lifesaving mental health care. By elevating the       threshold for inclusion in the National Instant Criminal       Background Check System, this important legislation would       help destigmatize mental health and protect veterans'       constitutional rights.        The VFW commends your leadership on this issue and your       commitment to our nation's veterans. We look forward to       working with you to ensure the passage of this important       legislation.            Sincerely,                                              Carlos U. Fuentes,                                                           Director,      VFW National Legislative Service.                                   ____                                              The American Legion,                                      Washington, DC, March 2, 2017.      Hon. Phil Roe,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative Roe: On behalf of our more than 2.2       million members, The American Legion expresses support for HR       1181, the Veterans 2nd Amendment Protection Act. This       measure, as currently written, would prohibit the Department       of Veterans Affairs (VA) from considering any beneficiary       assisted by a fiduciary as ``mentally  [[Page H2112]]       defective'' without a magistrate or judicial authority ruling       that the beneficiary is a public danger for the purpose of       reporting their names to the National Instant Criminal       Background Check System (NICS), or any other database       intended to identify persons who would be excluded from       keeping, possessing, or purchasing firearms.        Veterans are not required to give up their weapons for the       purpose of receiving VA health care for mental health       conditions. However, there are concerns that the threat of       being placed on a list that might deny veterans their Second       Amendment rights could act as a deterrent for those who might       otherwise seek treatment for their mental health conditions.       The American Legion's concern is that stigmas associated with       mental illnesses may force veterans to lose their Second       Amendment rights.        The American Legion reaffirms its recognition that the       Second Amendment of the United States Constitution guarantees       each law-abiding American citizen the right to keep and bear       arms and encourages our nation's lawmakers to recognize the       same. The men and women who have fought to protect the       Constitution deserve to live under both its laws and rights.        In conclusion, The American Legion applauds your leadership       in addressing issues that are important to America's       servicemembers, veterans and their families.            Sincerely,                                                Charles E. Schmidt,                                                National Commander.     Mr. Speaker, I, too, served in the military as  a military doctor in the 2nd United States Infantry Division in  Southeast Asia many years ago, so I have seen patients who were  mentally ill. One of the things that has bothered me is that we are  perpetuating an outdated stereotype that mentally ill people are prone  to violence. Most are not, and perpetuating this stereotype that they  are may result in their being isolated or not seeking treatment. This  is unfortunate for people who suffer from mental illness and need  support and understanding.   I think we do them a great disservice. My bill would require a court  of law rather than a VA rating specialist--that is all we are saying  here--to determine whether an individual actually poses a danger to  themselves or others before their name gets sent to the FBI and added  to the NICS list. A VA employee should not be able to add a veteran's  name to a NICS list before that veteran has been afforded due process.   Let me explain how bad it really is. It is outrageous that a criminal  has more rights than a veteran when it comes to being placed on the  NICS list--at least they aren't added to the list until they have been  convicted by a judge or a jury, Mr. Speaker. We should at least treat  our American heroes that well.   Here is another point I would like to make: a veteran that has been  rated--listening to the debate to show you how the VA system is not a  standard for everyone. A VA veteran rated 100 percent for PTSD does not  automatically get a fiduciary because they are 100 percent service- connected disabled because of their service even though the symptoms  require that, for that rating, it may include suicidal or homicidal  ideation.   All we are saying--and I think, hopefully, everyone would agree--is  that you deserve as an American citizen--and especially an American  citizen, Mr. Speaker, who has served this country whether in combat or  not, who has served his country in the military--your day in court and  at least be heard by a judge and jury.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    How much time do I have remaining, Mr. Speaker?   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman has 10 minutes remaining.    How much time do I have remaining, Mr. Speaker?   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman has 10 minutes remaining.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, this proposal is not new. It has been passed out of  committee in 2010, 2011, 2013, and this year. It passed the full House,  H.R. 2349, in the 112th Congress, which is included in this proposal,  by a voice vote.   On February 2, the House approved H.J. Res. 40, which nullified the  Social Security Administration rule that would have similarly  restricted the Second Amendment rights to certain disabled people who  require help managing their finances. There is no reason that veterans  who have fiduciaries should be treated any differently than Social  Security beneficiaries who need help managing their finances.   Next, Mr. Speaker, veterans who need fiduciaries are not necessarily  mentally ill. A veteran may not be able to handle his or her finances  due to conditions such as traumatic brain injury. Furthermore, The  American Legion testified in 2015 about a case in which the VA declared  a veteran incompetent because he told his doctor he didn't pay his  bills. But, in reality, the veteran didn't pay his bills because, like  a lot of us, of the division of household responsibilities. His wife  paid the bills, and he got caught up in that. Then to get out of it is  a chore.    I wanted to say, once again, I really feel strongly about this  because we worked on the 21st Century Cures bill on removing the stigma  of mentally ill people that because someone is mentally ill, they are a  danger to themselves or others. Perpetuating this stereotype, I think,  is dangerous. I think it keeps people from coming in and seeking the  help that they need.   Also, and I have participated in this, Mr. Speaker, at home where we  have used hunting trips or fishing trips to help veterans with PTSD get  back on their feet and assume--instead of treating it as a disability  and saying: We are going to get you well and back on your feet and be a  productive member of society.   I am afraid if we stereotype this, we will prevent people from coming  in for the very needed help that they so richly have earned and need.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  [[Page H2113]]         Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, as all of us in this incredible place that we are in,  the House of Representatives in the Capitol of the U.S., our hearts go  out to everyone, especially the families, of all those touched by that  horrible tragedy that was just described. I am willing to work with  anyone on the committee or otherwise in a reasonable way to keep  firearms out of the hands of criminals and people who are dangerous.  There is no question we are all willing to do that. But that case did  not involve a veteran who had a fiduciary.   I am a strong supporter of the Second Amendment even if others  aren't. I think we can all agree that veterans should not be denied the  same due process rights that all other Americans receive. What this  bill does is ensure that veterans do not lose their constitutional  rights without a judicial hearing.   The freedoms granted under the Constitution of this great country  should apply to all Americans, especially those who have been willing  to put their lives at risk to protect those same freedoms. It is wrong  for veterans and beneficiaries who use a fiduciary to lose their Second  Amendment right without due process.   This commonsense bill would ensure that no veteran or beneficiary is  declared mentally defective simply because a VA rater appoints someone  to assist with the management of that person's financial affairs.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my  time.   Mr. Speaker, as all of us in this room are, I am personally  devastated that our Nation loses 20 of our finest citizens to suicide  every day. Ending this tragedy is one of the top priorities we have on  the Veteran Affairs' Committee and as a nation. We have and will  continue to work with the VA to develop programs that will effectively  help identify and treat veterans who may be considering ending their  own lives.   But denying veterans who have fiduciaries their constitutional rights  will not end veteran suicide. It is unfair to paint all veterans who  may need a fiduciary with the same broad stroke and to assume that just  because someone needs assistance with their financial affairs, that  they may also be violent and a danger or they are contemplating  suicide. That is just plain wrong.                                time  1515    It is unfortunate that the arguments advanced by some of the  opponents of this bill reinforce the false impression that people who  suffer from mental health challenges--and veterans, in particular--are  dangerous. There is no evidence that people who suffer from mental  illness are more likely to be more violent than people in the general  population--just none. I am convinced that perpetuating this outdated  and incorrect stereotype makes the situation worse, deterring people  from seeking the very health services that they need.   It is difficult for some folks to admit they need help. I saw  patients like that for years who finally broke down in my office and  explained that they were depressed or whatever the situation may be.  Imagine how much harder it is when people feel that they will be  stigmatized or isolated because other people may fear them?   By passing this bill, Congress will send a strong message that people  who suffer from mental illness are owed the same respect and have the  same constitutional rights as every other American citizen.   Once again, Mr. Speaker, I encourage all of our Members to support  H.R. 1181, and I yield back the balance of my time.   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Speaker, I stand in strong opposition to  H.R. 1181, the ``so-called'' Veterans 2nd Amendment Protection Act.   Mr. Speaker, twenty veterans a day tragically take their own lives.   Just ONE veteran taking his or her own life is one too many.   But twenty every day is an epidemic. It is unconscionable, and  unacceptable.   With two-thirds of veteran suicides being carried out with firearms,  this bill practically pulls the trigger for veterans at risk.   H.R. 1181 threatens the safety of our nation's veterans and  potentially others; by providing those veterans suffering from mental  illness with greater ease in obtaining a firearm.   The National Instant Criminal Background Check System is a critical  tool in stopping those who want to do harm to themselves or others.   If passed, this bill would dangerously alter the protocols for  including a veteran in the database when he or she has been assigned a  fiduciary.   In addition, over one hundred-seventy thousand mentally ill veterans  would be removed from the National Instant Criminal Background Check  System.   Instead of wasting time and energy on senseless budget cuts and  harmful bills like H.R. 1181, this Congress should be focused on  strengthening protocols so that no veteran struggling with mental  illness ever falls through the cracks.   Just two months ago, a veteran, Esteban Santiago, suffering from  mental illness fell through the cracks and killed five people at my  home airport in Fort Lauderdale.   The current protocols failed him. We failed him and we should be  doing all that we can to make the system strong for those suffering-- not making the situation worse, as this bill does.   This bill does a grave disservice to those men and women who have  served us valiantly.   Moreover, it is opposed by military leaders including General Stanley  McChrystal and General David Petraeus, who led our troops in Iraq and  Afghanistan.   It is our obligation to ensure every veteran has the physical and  mental health care they both deserve and need, We owe them better than  this. Instead, this bill prioritizes putting firearms in the hands of  mentally ill veterans who are already at serious risk.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for debate has expired.   Pursuant to House Resolution 198, the previous question is ordered on  the bill.   The question is on the engrossment and third reading of the bill.   The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, and was  read the third time.  [[Page H2114]]    The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the passage of the bill.   The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that  the ayes appeared to have it.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and  nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further  proceedings on this question will be postponed.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend  their remarks and to insert extraneous material in the Record on H.R.  1259.   The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Banks of Indiana). Is there objection to  the request of the gentleman from Tennessee?   There was no objection.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 198 and rule  XVIII, the Chair declares the House in the Committee of the Whole House  on the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill, H.R. 1259.   The Chair appoints the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Rogers) to  preside over the Committee of the Whole.                                time  1518                        In the Committee of the Whole    Accordingly, the House resolved itself into the Committee of the  Whole House on the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill  (H.R. 1259) to amend title 38, United States Code, to provide for the  removal or demotion of employees of the Department of Veterans Affairs  based on performance or misconduct, and for other purposes, with Mr.  Rogers of Kentucky in the chair.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The CHAIR. Pursuant to the rule, the bill is considered read the  first time.   The gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Roe) and the gentleman from  Minnesota (Mr. Walz) each will control 30 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Tennessee.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Chair, I rise today in support of my bill, H.R. 1259, the VA  Accountability First Act of 2017.   Mr. Chair, you and many other Members of this body are well aware  that providing true accountability at the Department of Veterans  Affairs has been a goal of mine and many of my colleagues for years.  The House has remained committed to this goal and has already passed  several iterations of the legislation before us today, yet the  challenges remain, which is why we are here once again trying in this  Congress to effect real change and reform.   To bring real reform, we need to provide Secretary Shulkin with the  tools he needs to swiftly and effectively discipline employees who  don't meet the standards our veterans deserve or who fail in their  sacred mission to provide world-class health care and benefits to the  men and women who have served.   My bill would provide a singular expedited procedure for all VA  employees to respond and appeal to proposed removals, demotions, and  suspensions for performance or misconduct or, in the case of title 38  employees, who are healthcare providers, for a question involving  direct patient care or clinical competence.   The prenotification and response process would be required to be  completed within 15 business days, and the employee would be entitled  to an expedited appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board, where the  first step at the administrative judge would be limited to 45 days.  Additionally, either party would be able to appeal the administrative  judge's decision to the full MSPB and would be provided the opportunity  for limited judicial review.   H.R. 1259 would also ensure that the disciplinary procedures and  avenues to appeal set up by this bill are the only avenues in place for  title 5 and hybrid title 38 employees to dispute proposed removals,  demotions, and suspensions for longer than 14 days. Pure title 38  employees, mainly VA's physicians and registered nurses, would retain  their current internal process, but the timelines for disciplinary  action and the appeals process would also be aligned to the timelines  for all other VA employees as set up by this bill.   This bill would also provide improved protections for whistleblowers;  would allow the Secretary to reduce an employee's Federal pension if  they are convicted of a felony that influenced their job at VA; would  provide the Secretary with the authority to recoup a bonus provided to  an employee who engaged in misconduct or poor performance prior to  receiving the bonus; and would allow the Secretary to recoup any  relocation expenses that were authorized for a VA employee only through  the employee's ill-gotten means, such as waste, fraud, and malfeasance.   Lastly, it would also provide the Secretary with the direct hiring  authority that he desperately needs and has been asking for so that we  can hire medical center directors and VISN directors in a more  expedited manner and fill leadership vacancies across VA.   Mr. Chair, as I have said, I agree with all of my colleagues that the  vast majority of VA employees are hardworking public servants who are  dedicated to providing quality health care and benefits for veterans.  But it is beyond comprehension that, with as much outright malfeasance  that Congress, the American public, the media, and our courageous  whistleblowers have uncovered at the VA, which has led to the increased  scrutiny of the Department over the past few years, that we still see  far too many instances of VA employees not living up to the standards  America expects and not living up to the standards that our men and  women who have served this country deserve.    Knowing many of the instances that have happened at the VA are a slap  in the face to our veterans, it is unbelievable to me that anyone would  oppose the bill before us here today.   The committee has discovered an instance of an employee showing up  drunk to work to scrub in for a surgery on a veteran; a VA employee  taking a recovering addict to a crack house and buying him drugs and a  prostitute; a VA employee participating in an armed robbery; and senior  managers retaliating against whistleblowers, at which point VA then has  to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars to the whistleblower in  restitution.   Not only are all of these acts egregious and not only are all of  these instances factual, they are just the tip of the iceberg; but what  causes me to stand before you today is that, in none of these  instances, did the VA hold these employees accountable in any  reasonable timeframe, if at all.   I blame many factors for this, but mainly I blame an antiquated civil  service system and a grievance process set up by the union-negotiated  collective bargaining agreements that have left VA unwilling to jump  through the many hoops to do what is right.   Mr. Chair, it is well past time that we not allow the current system  to continue, and it is certainly our duty to finally take action and  enact meaningful changes at VA that put veterans and their families  first and foremost. Everything else should come second. That includes  the power of the public sector unions.   Everyone in government knows that the civil service laws that were  once meant to promote the efficiency of government are now obsolete and  make it almost impossible to remove a poor-performing employee. Last  year, VA's then-Deputy Secretary Sloan Gibson, under President Obama,  sat before the Veterans Affairs' Committee and admitted it was too  difficult to fire a substandard VA employee.   The Government Accountability Office studies the government's ability  to hold low-performing employees accountable and found that it took 6  months to a year, on average, and sometimes significantly longer, to  fire poor-performing government employees.   I have heard the concerns that this bill will hurt the Department's  ability to recruit and retain good employees. I don't buy this  argument, as every VA employee I speak to tells me exactly the  opposite. Good employees want to work in an environment where they know  everyone can be held accountable for their actions.   I believe the current status quo of allowing bad employees to  continue at  [[Page H2115]]  their jobs while receiving a paycheck actually hurts the moral of other  employees who are doing the right thing 24 hours a day.   This is the same for employees of the Department who are veterans. I  know that some have said that this would hurt veterans who are employed  at a VA, since they make up a large percentage of VA employees, as it  should be. As a veteran myself, and as my fellow veterans here today  would agree--we don't sign up to serve, whether in uniform or civilian  clothes, because we put our individual employee protections ahead of  the mission--the mission always comes first, Mr. Chair; and at the VA,  the mission is our veterans. Veterans want to work alongside colleagues  they know are working hard for their fellow men and women they served  alongside.   I also want to note that, from day one, I have worked with Secretary  Shulkin and his team in the drafting of this bill that is before us  today. He has endorsed this legislation not because he wants to punish  employees or make it harder to recruit quality employees, but because  he sees this type of change as desperately needed if he is going to  truly reform the Department, as both sides of the aisle want.   Secretary Shulkin is someone who garnered the trust and respect of  two Presidents of two different parties to serve our veterans, and he  was confirmed by a vote in the Senate of 100-0. Mr. Chair, I hope that  my colleagues would understand that his support and assistance in  crafting this bill before us today is because real accountability at  the Department of Veterans Affairs is a veteran issue, not a political  issue.   It is time that we align ourselves with our Nation's veterans and the  organizations that represent them. Fifteen veterans service  organizations support the bill before us today: the American Legion,  Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States, Paralyzed Veterans of  America, Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, the Military Order  of the Purple Heart, Concerned Veterans for America, Student Veterans  for America, Reserve Officers Association, Fleet Reserve Association,  Association of the United States Navy, the Enlisted Association of the  National Guard of the United States, VetsFirst, AMVETS, the Military  Officers Association of America, and the United States Army Warrant  Officers Association. These are 15 groups that represent millions of  veterans and their families.   While I am in no way trying to make this a political argument or say  that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle do not care about  veterans--they do--but when it comes to this particular issue,  accountability at the VA, I do not believe we can avoid the facts:   The facts are, when we talk about accountability at VA during our VSO  hearings with the Senate, Members get an ovation.   The facts are that veterans, not just from the headquarters in D.C.,  but across this country, come up and thank Members for putting  veterans' rights before all else.   The facts are the only groups that have staunchly come out and  opposed the reform we are trying to make in this bill are the public  sector unions.   As I said, this should not be a political discussion and this should  not be one side of the aisle trying to out-veteran the other side of  the aisle. We don't want to do that. But when you look at the facts, it  is clear what our veterans and what the American public want us to do  here in this Congress.                                time  1530    We have a package that makes meaningful changes to VA's civil service  system while maintaining due process rights, as we should. Today we  have the opportunity to make real and lasting changes to a broken  system. Today we can decide to stand with our veterans or we can stand  with the status quo and the unions that perpetuate the status quo,  which I believe has failed them and the American public for far too  long.   I hope you all will join me and the 15 veteran organizations that  support this legislation and do what is right for veterans and pass  H.R. 1259. Let's put accountability first so that transformative  reforms can succeed.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.           House of Representatives, Committee on Oversight and             Government Reform,                                    Washington, DC, March 10, 2017.      Hon. David P. Roe,      Chairman, Committee on Veterans' Affairs, Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Chairman: I write concerning H.R. 1259, ``VA       Accountability First Act of 2017.'' As you know, the       Committee on Veterans' Affairs received an original referral       and the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform a       secondary referral when the bill was introduced on February       28, 2017. I recognize and appreciate your desire to bring       this legislation before the House of Representatives in an       expeditious manner, and accordingly, the Committee on       Oversight and Government Reform will forego action on the       bill.        The Committee takes this action with our mutual       understanding that by foregoing consideration of H.R. 1259 at       this time we do not waive any jurisdiction over the subject       matter contained in this or similar legislation. Further, I       request your support for the appointment of conferees from       the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform during any       House-Senate conference convened on this or related       legislation.        Finally, I would ask that a copy of our exchange of letters       on this matter be included in the bill report filed by the       Committee on Veterans' Affairs, as well as in the       Congressional Record during floor consideration, to       memorialize our understanding.        Sincerely,                                                    Jason Chaffetz,      Chairman.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                  Committee on Veterans' Affairs,                                     Washington, DC, March 10, 2017.      Hon. Jason Chaffetz,      Chairman, House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform,           Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Chaffetz: In reference to your letter on       March 10, 2017 I write to confirm our mutual understanding       regarding H.R. 1259, the ``VA Accountability First Act of       2017.''        I appreciate the House Committee on Oversight and       Government Reform's waiver of consideration of provisions       under its jurisdiction and its subject matter as specified in       your letter. I acknowledge that the waiver was granted only       to expedite floor consideration of H.R. 1259, and does not in       any way waive or diminish the House Committee on Oversight       and Government Reform's jurisdictional interests over this       legislation or similar legislation. Iwill support a request       from the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform       for appointment to any House-Senate conference on H.R. 1259.       Finally, I will also support your request to include a copy       of our exchange of letters on this matter in the       Congressional Record during floor consideration.        Again, thank you for your assistance with these matters.            Sincerely,                                                 David P. Roe M.D.,                                                          Chairman.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   With that impassioned plea, I was asked yesterday on a Facebook page  who I might, from the other side of the aisle, like to ride across the  country with, and it was my friend Tim Walz who I would like to ride  with. He very passionately represents veterans very well, and it has  been an absolute pleasure to work on the committee with him for the  last 8 years.   Mr. Chair, just a couple things. The bill subjects all career  employees to this new formal removal authority, and this would include  frontline employees, middle management, even Senior Executive Service  employees. Just a couple more things. It provides a unified process,  not a bunch of different ones, for employees to appeal major adverse  actions and other actions for title 38 when it pertains to a question  involving direct patient care or clinical competence.   The current grievance procedures can allow an appeal to drag on for  almost 350 days, and the House is the only legislative body that has  passed a true accountability bill. I know, having spoken with Secretary  Shulkin yesterday, he very much wants this piece of legislation in his  toolbox to help reform the VA, which is desperately needed.   Mr. Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Washington (Mrs.  McMorris Rodgers), our Conference chair.   Mrs. McMORRIS RODGERS. Mr. Chair, I thank our chairman for his  leadership on this important issue.   The way that a grateful nation shows its appreciation to those who  have served is to make sure that they get the care that they need when  the time comes. Every day, veterans contact my office seeking help to  address their concerns and help them navigate the VA.                                time  1545    Mrs. McMORRIS RODGERS. Mr. Chairman, the VA has one job. Its sole  mission is to serve our veterans--our heroes. But it is clear that too  often this agency has become disconnected from its mission. When a  veteran contacts the VA, they should have the red carpet rolled out for  them and treated like heroes. Instead, they feel like they are a  burden.   The VA Accountability First Act is one of many needed reforms. And it  is common sense, if you are involved in misconduct, you should be  demoted, suspended, or fired. You shouldn't get a pay raise or a bonus.  If you are a whistleblower, you should be protected. And the Secretary  of the VA should have the flexibility to hold staff accountable.   I thank the chairman and the committee for their work to create a  culture of accountability at the VA. With his leadership and with our  partners, I am confident that we will see some positive disruption that  puts our veterans first.    Mr. Chairman, also during that live Facebook  page, I mentioned another person I wouldn't mind riding across the  country with, and it was Mr. Hoyer, just to clarify the Record.   Mr. Chairman, just a couple of clarification things.   All we have done with this bill is--we haven't removed due process  rights--we have just shortened the time. And to show the concern that I  had, I was afraid that if we used 14 or 15 calendar days--let's say,  President's Day would be on a Monday, which would be a holiday--that  would take a day away. So I said let's make this first part of this 15  business days. So that is 3 weeks. And then the accelerated review can  go on 45 business days, which is 9 weeks. So this is 3 months of time,  not a full year. But it simply compresses that time into a 3-month  timeframe that this could last. So I think that people have their due  process rights protected.   Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr.  Bilirakis), my good friend, vice chair of our committee.    Mr. Chairman, I thank my friend, Mr. Takano.   ``If you engage in an unethical practice, if you cover up a serious  problem, you should be fired. Period. It shouldn't be that difficult.''  President Barack Obama, at the Choice Act's signing in 2014.   Dr. Shulkin is not a hard-line person. He received 100 votes, Mr.  Chairman, in the Senate. I don't know that anybody else in this  confirmation process has come close to that, but he has had unanimous  support. He has asked for this. We worked with his office. He has  personally asked that this be passed. That is why we are bringing this  bill down here in this form.   Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Colorado (Mr.  Coffman), one of my great friends here in Congress, a fellow classmate.  We came in together. We, too, have traveled to Afghanistan together to  visit our Active Duty military in combat. He, too, is a combat veteran.                                time  1600     Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Chair, I think my good friend, Mr. Walz, helps make the point  that this person who was aggrieved, it doesn't have to last so long.  You can actually compress this time. As I mentioned, it is not short; 3  months to get this resolved. But this process we are putting together  actually helps that person that has been aggrieved by the supervisor, I  would argue.   Mr. Chair, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr.  Dunn), a new member of our committee, a veteran and physician from  Florida.    Mr. Chair, I will just point out that I don't  think the VA has a reputation of firing too many people.   Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Florida (Mr.  Rutherford), a new Member, and a very active member of our committee.    Mr. Chair, I would like to inquire as to the  balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman has 9 minutes remaining.    Mr. Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman  from Utah (Mr. Chaffetz), the chairman of the Oversight and Government  Reform Committee, a fellow classmate.                                time  1615     Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman  from Indiana (Mr. Banks), a new member of our committee who is also in  the Reserves serving our Nation in the military.    Mr. Chair, I yield an additional 30 seconds to  the gentleman.    Mr. Chair, I yield an additional 30 seconds to  the gentleman.    Mr. Chair, I yield an additional 30 seconds to  the gentleman.    Mr. Chair, I yield an additional 30 seconds to  the gentleman.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Lamborn), a good friend and long-term  member of the Veterans' Affairs Committee.     Mr. Chairman, to go along with what Sergeant  Major Walz said, it is truly a privilege to work with him on these  issues. His heart is in the right place. He truly cares about veterans.   I believe this bill, though, does do what needs to be done. Secretary  Shulkin--approved 100-0 in the Senate--believes that he needs this tool  to be able to reform the VA. I think it is imperative that we, as  legislators, provide him the tools when we say we demand accountability  at the VA.   Once again, I encourage all Members to support H.R. 1259.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. All time for general debate has expired.   Pursuant to the rule, the bill shall be considered for amendment  under the 5-minute rule.

The Acting CHAIR. No amendment to that amendment in the nature of a  substitute shall be in order except those printed in part A of House  Report 115-39. Each such amendment may be offered only in the order  printed in the report, by a Member designated in the report, shall be  considered read, shall be debatable for the time specified in the  report, equally divided and controlled by the proponent and an  opponent, shall not be subject to amendment, and shall not be subject  to a demand for division of the question.               Amendment No. 1 Offered by Mr. Roe of Tennessee    The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 1  printed in part A of House Report 115-39.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         Page 20, line 15, insert ``to or'' after ``paid''.    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 198, the gentleman  from Tennessee (Mr. Roe) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Tennessee.    Mr. Chairman, this manager's amendment would  provide technical changes to the bill, while not changing the overall  substance of the bill. The amendment is noncontroversial and no cost.  It does not change any underlying policy in the bill.   I urge adoption of the amendment.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I urge approval of the amendment,  and I yield back the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Roe).   The amendment was agreed to.                     Amendment No. 2 Offered by Mr. Walz    The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 2  printed in part A of House Report 115-39.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to  the amendment.  [[Page H2127]]    The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to  the amendment.  [[Page H2127]]    The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I appreciate the spirit in which this amendment is proposed by the  gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Walz), but I must oppose it at this time.   The amendment would dramatically weaken the current accountability  language for non-SES employees to the point that it would not be a  meaningful improvement to or departure from current law. Just as a  point of clarification, the Senate never did move the Veterans First  Act.                                time  1630    The amendment includes many of the archaic and unnecessary civil  service rules that currently hamper true reform and accountability at  the Department. And unlike H.R. 1259, which would require the entire  internal and first level of external appeals process to be completed  within 67 days, the Walz amendment would allow for the process to take  at least 120 days, and this period could expand indefinitely.   Additionally, the standard used in this agreement for removing or  demoting employees for performance is not a meaningful departure from  current law, and I fear it won't make any true changes that are  desperately needed at VA.   On the collective bargaining piece, I understand the ranking member's  concern, but the last thing I want to do is create a giant loophole  that makes it harder to discipline bad employees. Just looking at one  of VA's master contracts with employee unions, AFGE, which is the  largest union at VA, one can see that the grievance procedures that he  wishes to keep in place to dispute discipline can extend to almost 350  days, and this timeline can be easily extended.   With the Walz amendment, we would be creating a giant loophole where  the Secretary would have one expedited process in place, while the long  and administratively burdensome grievance process remains in place for  nearly 285,000 employees at the Department, or 76 percent of the VA's  workforce.   Clearly, covering only 24 percent of the VA workforce under an  expedited authority is not what I want to do, nor do I expect veterans  and taxpayers or the Secretary want to do.   Additionally, when the committee first began working on  accountability issues at VA, they were told by the largest Federal  Government union, AFGE general counsel, that the union would never  support any legislation that changes the status quo.   Based on AFGE's strong support for language identical to the Walz  amendment last Congress, I think the message is clear. If Congress  adopts this language, we would not be protecting taxpayers or veterans,  and we would be supporting the corrupt status quo that fails VA  employees and veterans daily.   In the end, the question is very clear: Do we want to stand with  veterans and taxpayers to provide the Secretary with the appropriate  tools he has asked for to hold these employees accountable? Or do we  want to give in to special interests groups to support the status quo?   Once again, I urge all Members to oppose the Walz amendment and  support the underlying bill.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I am just looking at the AFGE  website, and it does have support for the Veterans First Act here on  the website; so that is true.    I yield to the gentleman from Minnesota.    Mr. Chairman, reclaiming my time.   Basically, the accountability provisions are the same. I, once again,  urge all Members to oppose the Walz amendment and support the  underlying bill.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Walz).   The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes  appeared to have it.    Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent to rise  in opposition, although I am not opposed.   The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman?   There was no objection.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Chairman, the amendment would allow a whistleblower who is  alleging prohibited personnel practices, as defined in title 38, from  being disciplined under the bill until the whistleblower complaint is  resolved.   The committee has always favored strengthening protections for  whistleblowers. My bill already protects whistleblowers, but I am not  opposed to Ms. Kuster's amendment and suggested changes, and I  appreciate her offering it. The bill has my full support.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.   Ms. KUSTER of New Hampshire. Mr. Chairman, I have learned one thing  in 4 years: quit while I am ahead.   Mr. Chairman, I have nothing further to add, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my  time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentlewoman from New Hampshire (Ms. Kuster).   The amendment was agreed to.   The Acting CHAIR. The Chair understands that amendment No. 5 will not  be offered.                    Amendment No. 6 Offered by Mr. Taylor    The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 6  printed in part A of House Report 115-39.    Mr. Chairman, I want to thank Mr. Taylor for  his service to our country and to our Nation. I am appreciative of him  and his staff for working with us on the amendment. The amendment has,  as chair, my full support.    Mr. Chairman, this would require the Secretary  to report to Congress each year any performance awards or bonuses  provided to Senior Executive Service employees at the VA. This is an  excellent amendment from the gentlewoman from New York and will provide  additional needed transparency at the Department where taxpayer money  is being spent, especially when being spent on bonuses for the most  senior individuals at VA. This amendment has my full support.    Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent to claim  the time in opposition, although I am not opposed.   The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman  from Tennessee?   There was no objection.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Chairman, Ms. Kuster's amendment would require VA supervisors to  develop performance plans for employees which would, as a part of the  plan, measure steps taken to address poor performance but also improve  training for VA supervisors--an excellent suggestion.   I agree that all VA employees, especially our managers, should be  held to high standards and should have as much training provided them  as is available. Ms. Kuster's amendment has my full support.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.   Ms. KUSTER of New Hampshire. Mr. Chairman, I have no further comment  other than to thank Dr. Roe for his support.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, this is an excellent amendment,  and I urge support.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentlewoman from New Hampshire (Ms. Kuster).   The amendment was agreed to.                    Amendment No. 9 Offered by Mr. Takano    The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 9  printed in part A of House Report 115-39.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to  the amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to  the amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.   I appreciate Mr. Takano's--who is a very hardworking member of the  committee--attempt to insert what he thinks is an appropriate balance  of due process and accountability, but the substitute language misses  the bar of what we are trying to accomplish.   It would strike the entire bill and insert new language only allowing  the Secretary to remove someone if they present a threat to health or  safety. This is a nearly unobtainable, if not an immeasurable, bar to  reach. This undefined standard makes it almost impossible for the  Secretary to remove any employee. It would create a confusing process  that only allows someone to be removed after they are suspended first  and the Secretary conducts an investigation into the individual.   It would allow for employees to be on indefinite suspension for  months, if not years, awaiting the Secretary's final decision, which is  not fair to veterans and the employee or good-performing employees and  taxpayers. The employee deserves a quick opportunity to present their  case, and, if exonerated, get back to doing their job.   Unlike my bill, this would only provide backpay to someone if their  removal is overturned on appeal if they are a whistleblower. My bill  would require any individual whose disciplinary action is overturned on  appeal to receive any backpay for that period.                                time  1700    This amendment does nothing to provide the Secretary with the  authority to recoup bonuses or relocation expenses from individuals who  receive taxpayer-funded money through ill-gotten means such as fraud,  waste, or abuse, nor does it allow the Secretary to recoup a portion of  a Federal pension of someone convicted of a felony that influenced  their VA job.   It would ensure that the current ineffective civil service rules  would continue to hamper any change to the corrosive and unaccountable  culture at the VA, and would also, more than likely, not apply to some  of the employees associated with the VA's egregious scandals, including  the bloated Denver, Colorado, construction project; data management at  the Philadelphia regional office; FY 2015 $2.5 billion shortfall cost  overruns at the Orlando VA Medical Center; allegations of inappropriate  use of government purchase cards to the tune of $6 billion; and many  others.   These are the types of employees that our constituents and veterans  expect to be held accountable, but this amendment would not cover.   In the end, the facts are clear: our veterans and the American  taxpayer support the reform in H.R. 1259, and not the status quo, which  is supported by public sector unions.   I encourage all Members to oppose the Takano amendment and support  the underlying bill.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I agree with my friend on the other  side of the aisle that you cannot fire your way to excellence, nor can  you grieve your way to excellence. You have to perform your way to  excellence.   I certainly appreciate his passion for the committee and the hard  work that he has done on numerous bills, but, in this particular case,  I will urge all Members to oppose the Takano amendment and support the  underlying bill in which the Secretary has asked for the authority.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentleman from California (Mr. Takano).   The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes  appeared to have it.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the motion  to recommit.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the motion  to recommit.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.    Mr. Speaker: ``If you engage in an unethical  practice, if you cover up a serious problem, you should be fired.  Period. It shouldn't be that difficult''--Barack Obama at the Veterans  Choice Act signing in August of 2014. That is who said that.   Yesterday, I had breakfast with the Secretary of the VA. We know that  accountability and the VA needs reform. The first thing he said to me  when he was there was he needs this accountability act to better manage  the VA.   What does this bill do, in a nutshell, very quickly? It simply  shortens the process instead of taking as much as a year or longer to  terminate someone. And we have had people in egregious things they have  done. The Phoenix VA issue was mentioned. It took 2 years to get rid of  anybody out there.   The Secretary says he needs these authorities. It maintains the due  process rights of the employees, which is important. It simply shortens  the length of time for as much as a year for some people. The VA said  it would take 6 months to a year to fire a government employee--or  longer.   It also has accentuated whistleblower protections, allows the  Secretary to recoup bonuses from people who have gotten them illegally.   It allows the Secretary to hire people. We have many VA facilities  out there that do not have CEOs at this time.   Mr. Speaker, I would recommend that we oppose the MTR, and I would  strongly encourage my colleagues from both sides of the aisle, in a  bipartisan way, to support the underlying bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, the previous question is  ordered on the motion to recommit.   There was no objection.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion to recommit.   The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that  the noes appeared to have it.
