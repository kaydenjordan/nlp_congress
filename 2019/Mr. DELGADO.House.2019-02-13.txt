 Madam Speaker, pursuant to clause 1, rule I, I demand a  vote on agreeing to the Speaker's approval of the Journal.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Madam Speaker, today I rise to honor Sojourner Truth.  Born a slave in Ulster County in 1797, she ran away to freedom with her  infant daughter in 1827. She then challenged the illegal sale of her  son to a slave owner and was the first Black woman to win such a case  against a White man. She spent the rest of her life as a national  leader in the abolitionist movement, challenging the norms of her time  by advocating for gender and racial equality and for the right to vote.   Her bust is displayed here in the Capitol in Emancipation Hall, the  first sculpture here to honor an African American woman.   It is an unbelievable honor as well as incredibly humbling to stand  here during this Black History Month, as the first African American  Congressman from Upstate New York, to recognize the life of a true  American hero.   I hope and pray that we as a nation continue to honor her legacy and  so many others who have committed their lives to ensuring America live  up to the promise of true equality for all.                            ____________________
