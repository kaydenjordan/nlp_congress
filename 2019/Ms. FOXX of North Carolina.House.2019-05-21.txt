 Madam Speaker, I rise to recognize the  centennial of the passage of the 19th Amendment in the House of  Representatives.   Women's right to vote was won by the brave work of suffragettes, many  of whom were from North Carolina.   In 1917, the National American Women Suffrage Association held a 4- day suffrage school in Raleigh to advance the movement in our State.  Instructor Halsey Wilson said, ``We have a government of men, by men,  and for the people, instead of a realization of the hopes of Abraham  Lincoln of a government of the people, by the people, for the people.''   Today, I am grateful to be serving among the largest group of women  ever elected in this body. When the 19th Amendment was ratified, 10  million women joined the electorate, but the suffragettes' work also  laid the foundation for women in public offices and the House of  Representatives we have today.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I rise to congratulate  Samaritan's Purse, an international Christian relief organization  headquartered in Boone, North Carolina, on its expansion in North  Wilkesboro.   This inspiring organization has been providing spiritual and physical  aid to impoverished victims of war, disease, famine, and natural  disaster since 1970.   The new North Wilkesboro Ministry Center will serve as a lifeline to  remote missions in developing countries. It will house inventory from  World Medical Mission, including lifesaving medical supplies and an  emergency field hospital.   This expansion and the wide-reaching vision of Samaritan's Purse  would not be possible without the hardworking and dedicated staff  behind it. These great humanitarians are an honor to represent, and I  know that they are wonderful ambassadors of North Carolina's Fifth  District around the world.        Congratulating North Wilkes and West Wilkes Middle Schools on                          Lighthouse Certification     Madam Speaker, I rise to recognize North  Wilkes Middle School and West Wilkes Middle School in North Carolina's  Fifth District on their recent achievement of Lighthouse certification  for implementing the Leader in Me program. Lighthouse certification is  the highest recognition awarded by the FranklinCovey institute, and  these are the first schools to receive this distinction in our State.   I commend the schools' administration, staff, and students for  embracing new paradigms of leadership and undertaking the comprehensive  school improvement model put forth by the Leadership in Me program. The  program aims to provide a holistic education that encompasses  leadership, a culture of student empowerment, and academic achievement.   Congratulations to North Wilkes Middle School and West Wilkes Middle  School for their demonstrated success. The high-achieving students are  evidence of how effectively local leaders in Wilkes County foster  positive results with innovation in education.
