 Mr. Speaker, it is past time for Congress to reassert its  role in the war powers discussion.   I proudly joined many of my colleagues from both sides of the aisle  last week in voting to repeal the 2002 AUMF. This AUMF provided for  military operations in Iraq, an Iraq that is far different from the one  we know today.   The goal was to defend the United States against the threat posed by  an Iraq of 20 years ago, specifically, that of Saddam Hussein. Saddam  Hussein was captured in December of 2003 and executed 3 years later.   Despite ousting Saddam Hussein, the 2002 AUMF has remained on the  books. Less than one-fifth of the current Members of the House of  Representatives were present on that original AUMF vote. As you can  imagine, many Members have entered Congress and left the Halls of  Congress without ever taking a vote on the 2001 or 2002 AUMFs.   Repealing the existing AUMFs, like the one from 2002, can be a step  in the right direction in Congress reasserting its Article I powers,  but we should not stop there. We need to rethink how we approach  military authorizations.   A few weeks ago, I introduced the Preventing Endless Armed Conflict  and Engagement Act, or the PEACE Act for short. The goal of this bill  is to ensure regular oversight is being conducted on future military  authorizations.   First, this bill would require each military authorization, or AUMF,  to terminate after 2 years. This is because the Constitution stipulates  that military funding should not extend past 2 years. This would also  ensure that every Member of Congress has the opportunity to weigh in on  current military operations.   The PEACE Act would also set standards for drafting military  authorizations. For instance, each authorization would need to set a  geographic scope on where the military force can be used. A clear  objective would need to be established for each authorization, and the  countries and groups that the U.S. troops are authorized to fight must  be listed.   Additionally, the Department of Defense and the State Department  would be charged with publishing an annual, unclassified report on  existing military operations. This report will include information such  as whether the military is meeting their objective, the number of  casualties, and total cost. This will assist Congress in making the  needed decisions that we have to make regarding AUMF reauthorizations.  Finally, the DOD and State Department will be required to brief Members  of Congress on the contents of this report once every 6 months.   It is critical that new Members of Congress, with new constituencies,  have their chance at providing input into military operations. Many  Members came to the floor last week to reiterate the importance of  updating these existing AUMFs instead of repealing them. While I  supported the repeal, I do hope that any updated or future AUMF  incorporates elements from the PEACE Act.   Future AUMFs should be more concise and relied on for only a few  years, not for a couple decades.   I look forward to working with Members from both sides of the aisle  on future reforms to Congress' war powers authority.                            ____________________
