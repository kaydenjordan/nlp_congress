 Mr. President, I would like to begin by recognizing  the brave fire and rescue personnel who are working around the clock to  stop the spread of fires in California. I know all of our colleagues  join me in remembering the more than 40 people who have lost their  lives to the blaze, in sympathy for their families and in prayer for  all of those whose homes, lives, and livelihoods have been thrown into  chaos by this disaster.   As these communities begin the task of rebuilding, Americans  everywhere will stand with them.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on an entirely different matter, this  is an exciting week for the Senate. For one thing, we are beginning to  welcome several new Members to our ranks. They may not be sworn in  until January, but these new Senators-elect are already arriving in  town for orientation events and to vote in their party's leadership  elections.   I know I speak for all of my colleagues in issuing each of our future  colleagues, on both sides of the aisle, our hearty congratulations and  a warm welcome. We are looking forward to working with all of these new  colleagues.                            ____________________     Mr. President, even as we begin looking ahead to  January and the 116th Congress, the reality is, we still have a series  of important outstanding subjects to tackle between now and the end of  the year. First on the list is legislation that will reauthorize  funding for our Coast Guard and implement a number of important  reforms.   Our Nation calls on the Coast Guard to protect America's ports and to  maintain shipping lanes to interdict illegal drugs before they reach  the border and to risk their lives to save others in the midst of  fierce storms and natural disasters. In each case, they embody their  motto: ``Semper Paratus''--``Always Ready.''   So in passing these measures this week, the Senate will be fulfilling  an important promise to some of the brave men and women who have taken  an oath to keep us safe.   Aspects of this legislation are particularly important to States like  my own State of Kentucky--the heart of our Nation's inland waterways  system. For too long, vessel owners and barge operators have struggled  under a complex system of overlapping and duplicative regulations. They  make normal shipping functions needlessly difficult, including the  incidental discharge of ballast water. A confusing web of rules from  States, the Coast Guard, and the EPA leave owners and operators to face  constant uncertainty and lead to higher costs.   The Vessel Incidental Discharge Act, or VIDA, replaces the existing  system with a uniform, cost-effective, and national standard enforced  by the Coast Guard.   For the 13,000 Kentuckians whose jobs depend on our State's inland  waterways, this provision can help cut costs, promote efficiency, and  protect our natural waters. For the countless farmers, miners, and  manufacturers who depend on these waters to get their goods to market,  VIDA ends the headache and delivers relief.   VIDA passed out of the Senate Commerce Committee on a voice vote. In  fact, it has been reported out of committee numerous times in recent  years, including when our Democratic colleagues were in the majority.  So it is time to pass this bipartisan bill; it is time to help the  Coast Guard continue its important work; and it is time to deliver much  needed predictability to the mariners who rely on it. I urge  [[Page S6904]]  every one of our colleagues to join me in voting to advance it later  this afternoon.   After that legislation, we will turn to another qualified nominee,  Michelle Bowman, to serve as a member of the Board of Governors for the  Federal Reserve. Ms. Bowman currently serves as a banking commissioner  for the State of Kansas. I look forward to confirming her this week as  well.                            ____________________     I suggest the absence of a quorum.
