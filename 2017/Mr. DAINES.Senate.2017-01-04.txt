 Mr. President, I wish to recognize Arlene Mathews  of Helena, MT, for her 63 years of volunteer service at St. Peter's  Hospital.   In a basement in 1953, Arlene began the ``Sock Sew,'' which makes  socks for newborn babies who are born in December at St. Peter's  Hospital to take home.   This year, Arlene and volunteers sitting at 20 sewing machines cut,  sewed, and glued 100 large stockings for the newborns and another 100  smaller stockings for patients at St. Peter's whose Christmas Eve is  spent in the hospital. This is a wonderful gesture that made their  Christmas in the hospital just a little bit better. Thank you, Arlene,  for thinking of those in the hospital, especially during the Christmas  season.   I am thrilled to honor our unsung hero, Arlene Mathews, for her 63- year service to her community.                            ____________________
