 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, yesterday, a bipartisan majority of  Senators rejected the Democratic leader's efforts to shut down debate  on the National Defense Authorization Act and block new measures to get  tougher on Russia.   The Democratic leader wants to block the Senate from fully and  robustly debating a number of important issues--from how to manage the  fallout from the reckless Afghanistan retreat to how to respond to  China's dramatic and destabilizing military modernization, to how to  restore deterrence against an emboldened Iran.   The NDAA is supposed to be the bipartisan forum for debating and  acting on these kinds of issues. Months ago, the Armed Services  Committee moved this process forward--listen to this--23 to 3, but the  Democratic leader has botched the floor process.   It is especially bizarre to see the Democratic leader so focused, so  intent, on blocking the Senate from dealing seriously with the growing  aggression from Putin's Russia. He seems downright desperate to block  new bipartisan action on Nord Stream 2. It is really quite strange to  see. Senators Risch and Cruz have proposed language concerning this  Putin pipeline that the House was able to pass almost unanimously.  Unlike the House provision, the Risch-Cruz amendment includes a waiver  provision that would give the President more flexibility, which makes  the Democratic leader's effort to shut the process down and block their  amendment all the more baffling.   If there is opposition to the amendment--if it can be improved with  modifications--then, by all means, let's have a public debate.   Likewise, Senator Portman has been a leading voice for bolstering our  European partners and delivering more meaningful support to Ukraine's  military. As Putin amasses forces on Ukraine's border, the Senate  should debate how to help the Ukrainians defend themselves. The  Democratic leader is trying to shut that down as well.   So the NDAA is not finished yet. So the Senate cannot be finished yet  either. We need the same kind of normal, robust, bipartisan amendment  process that always characterizes this bill, and we need the Democratic  leader to stop trying to block the Senate from sanctioning Putin's  cronies.                                  Inflation    Now, Mr. President, on an entirely different matter, 88 percent of  Americans are concerned about inflation--most of them are very  concerned--and 77 percent of Americans say inflation has affected them  personally. We have a big and diverse country. It is hard to get that  many Americans to agree on anything. But President Biden did promise he  would unite the country, and on the Democrats' watch, under the  Democrats' policies, the American people are united in their fear and  frustration at runaway prices, falling purchasing power, and all the  consequences of inflation. The men and women of this country are  spending 20 percent more than last year for beef at the grocery store,  50 percent more to fill up the gas tank, 26 percent more for less  choice in used cars.   One recent article in the New York Times suggested that perhaps  Americans should forget about trying to buy their family members normal  gifts and settle for exchanging handwritten promises to tackle  household chores, such as ``washing out the reusable plastic bags.'' I  guess the Grinch is doing some ghostwriting in his spare time.   Some weeks back, the White House Press Secretary tried to laugh off  reporters' questions about the supply chain and inflation crises. She  literally laughed at the idea that anybody would be worried about the  ``tragedy of the treadmill that's delayed.''   Well, the President's staff are yukking it up, but working parents  aren't laughing. Middle-class families aren't laughing.   A Kentuckian named Mike Halligan isn't laughing either. He runs a big  food bank in Lexington called God's Pantry. They distribute more than  40 million pounds of food every year at the local pantries all across  my State.   Here is what he says:         We've seen the cost of our ``sharing Thanksgiving basket''       go up this year by 14.5 percent. . . . We've seen our costs       go up by about 50 percent. The transportation component of       that is literally doubled.    And he also explained that, since inflation is also hammering his  contributors, charities and nonprofits may face ``donor fatigue'' at  precisely the time they cannot afford a fall-off. The Democrats'  inflation is hitting, literally, every part of our society.   A famous economist once said that inflation is the only form of tax  that can be levied without any legislation, but what is remarkable  about 2021 is that Democrats did directly legislate a big chunk of this  inflation into existence. It is unusually traceable to deliberate  policy decisions they have made.   One of the most famous Democratic economists in the country, Larry  Summers, tried to warn them. On February 4, he wrote that the  Democrats' stimulus could ``set off inflationary pressures of a kind we  have not seen in a generation.'' He said the same thing all springtime  long.   So did President Obama's CEA chair:         Jason Furman . . . said that the American Rescue Plan is       definitely ``too big for the moment,'' stating, ``I don't       know of any economist that was recommending something the       size of what was done.''    But Washington Democrats had already decided months ago they would  try to use the temporary pandemic as a Trojan horse for permanent  socialism.   Remember last spring, when one of the senior-most House Democrats  called it a ``tremendous opportunity to restructure things to fit our  vision'' or, earlier this fall, when President Biden himself said the  pandemic ``does present us with an opportunity.''   For Democrats, this go-around, it has never been about what families  need; it has only been about what activists want.   So we got the first massive spending bill in the springtime, and now  a majority of Americans ``worry they won't be able to afford what they  need during the holidays due to inflation.''   President Biden inherited an economy that was primed and ready for a  historic comeback--a fantastic inheritance. Since then, they have had  less than a year at the controls, and we have got more than half the  country actively worried their checking accounts might not even get  them through the holidays.   But Democrats aren't offering the country any contrition, any  apology, or, more importantly, any course correction. Amazingly enough,  they want to come back around for an even bigger bite at the apple.  They want to try to inflate their way out of inflation.   Our colleagues have spent months huddled behind closed doors,  neglecting the most basic governing duties, writing another reckless  taxing-and-spending spree that even the most conservative estimates say  would add about $800 billion to deficits over the next 5  [[Page S8809]]  years alone. They want to take the inflationary fire they helped start  and pour jet fuel on it. Even the CBO, which has to swallow most of the  Democrats' gimmicky math, estimates this bill would spend nearly $2  trillion and pile almost hundreds of billions more onto deficits over  the next decade.   Perhaps more realistic are the outside, nonpartisan estimates that  actually account for what we all know: Democrats would never let the  new entitlements in their bill expire. Those more realistic estimates  put the total cost--listen to this--just short of $5 trillion, at a  time when Chairman Powell, who has been willing to let the country run  hot, is now warning that current uncertainties could keep inflation  elevated to a troubling level.   Now, I could talk all day about how the actual contents of this bill  would hurt American families even more, about how it would take another  big step toward socialized medicine and pour cold water on the  innovations and cures that save lives, how it would incinerate huge  chunks of our energy sector and the jobs it supports in order to keep  pace with green preferences of California liberals, how it would  wrestle authority over intimate decisions about childcare away from  American families and put it in the hands of Washington bureaucrats,  but the overall picture is impossible to mistake: Inflation is hurting  the American people, and Democrats want to print, borrow, and spend  trillions more--the most out-of-touch agenda you could possibly  imagine.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
