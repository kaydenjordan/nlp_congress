 Mr. Speaker, as a doctor and public health expert, I know  we don't defeat this virus until we have a safe and effective vaccine.  It is time for the United States to work with the rest of world to  develop that vaccine and inoculate the world.   This bill allows U.S. global leadership to reemerge. The President  may not want to lead, but let the world know the United States Congress  is ready to lead and work with CEPI and the rest of the world to defeat  this virus.
