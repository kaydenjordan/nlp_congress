 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the following  Senators be permitted to speak prior to the scheduled rollcall vote:  myself for up to 15 minutes, Senator Blackburn for up to 10 minutes,  and Senator Tester for up to 5 minutes.    Mr. President, coming to the floor and listening to some  of my colleagues talk about their concern for lack of access to  contraception--and some have said we need to pass a bill codifying  same-sex marriage when that is currently the law of the land by virtue  of a Supreme Court decision, the Obergefell case--reminds me of the old  story about the little boy who cried wolf. He cried wolf when there  wasn't any danger; and then, once there was danger, people didn't come  to his aid because they thought it was another phony crying wolf.   I can understand our colleagues--given inflation, given crime, given  the broken borders--wanting to change the subject to something else,  but that is all this is. This is mere posturing pre-November, pre- midterm elections. This isn't about changing the law because the law  already permits ready access to contraceptives. The law already permits  same-sex marriage.   So this idea that we ought to spend scarce time here in the Congress,  which we have in limited supply, reaffirming rights that already exist,  is a clear political narrative designed to divert the American people's  attention from things that really are at risk--that is, the paychecks  of every American family because of inflation, because of failed energy  policies.   We know that the price of gasoline and diesel and fuel to fill up  your car so you can go to work or take your child to school or summer  camp has increased. We know that our cities are on fire due to spiking  crime waves connected to drugs that are coming across the southern  border. And, of course, we know that the southern border is completely  open with a big red carpet and a welcome mat out for anybody who wants  to come to the United States illegally.   And the cartels that are rich and getting richer because of the flow  of their human traffic are also getting rich because of the flow of  illegal drugs that took the lives of 108,000 Americans last year alone.   We know where those drugs are coming from and that the Biden  administration is doing absolutely nothing to stop them. I would want  to change the topic too.                              CHIPS Act of 2022    Mr. President, on a more positive note, the Senate approved funding  earlier this morning to bolster domestic semiconductor manufacturing by  a vote of 64 to 33. This funding will help kick-start the development  of these  [[Page S3729]]  microprocessors, these chips that go into everything from your cell  phone to the F-35, to Javelin and Stinger missiles that we send to  Ukraine to defend their country from Russian aggression. This funding  will help kick-start a domestic production of these semiconductors in a  way that will prevent a vulnerability of our supply chain, since 90  percent of those advanced semiconductors currently come from Asia, with  60 percent coming from Taiwan alone.   One other benefit to this bill is that this bill could create roughly  185,000 jobs every year as these new facilities are constructed. Long  term, it could bring another 280,000 jobs online. And once these  foundries are operational, they will supply ``Made in America''  semiconductors that can be used on everything from smartphones to cars,  to airplanes, to missile defense systems.   Semiconductors are the cornerstone of this legislation, but the bill  also takes a range of other steps to help propel innovation in the  competition we are currently in with the People's Republic of China.  This bill authorizes investments in research that will support  everything from robotics to next-generation wireless technology.   It also authorizes NASA programs that will keep America at the  forefront of space exploration. It extends the authorization for the  International Space Station to 2030. This is very important, especially  now that Russia has said it will end its commitment to the  International Space Station after 2024.   This bill also lays the groundwork for America's continued presence  in space after 2030, including language I championed requiring NASA to  develop a strategy to retire the International Space Station and  transition to a successor platform. It also enhances existing programs  that support future exploration missions. This includes the Moon to  Mars Program, which is leading efforts to get an American astronaut on  the surface of Mars.    Texas is the proud home to the Johnson Space Center, the home of  human space flight, but also a range of other universities and  companies leading the way in human space exploration. Enabling these  partnerships saves money, drives innovation, and gives us a competitive  edge over countries like Russia and China.   The broader bill included in the CHIPS Act will support both our  economic and our national security and strengthen our efforts to lead  the world in scientific innovation. The way we are going to compete  with China and to beat them is to out-innovate them because no country  in the world has better human capital, better brains, and a better  system to encourage innovation, which will keep us ahead of the  People's Republic of China.   They don't play by the rules. They certainly don't observe the rule  of law. They steal all the technology they can get. But it is important  for the United States to be in the game and not be left behind.   I want to thank Mr. Warner, the senior Senator from Virginia, for  launching this effort with me 2 years ago. We introduced the CHIPS for  America Act in June of 2020, which demonstrates how long it takes to  get important legislation passed here in the U.S. Congress. Since the  time we introduced it, I have worked with our colleagues on both sides  of the aisle to secure the necessary funding so we could deliver the  benefits for our country.   Countless colleagues have been part of the process over these last  few weeks, particularly Senator Young, Senator Portman, Senator Wicker,  Senator Sinema, and countless others; and Senator Cantwell and  certainly Senator Schumer as well and numerous others have led the  charge on this legislation. Their hard work and their willingness to  work cooperatively together and to find common ground is the reason for  our success.   This has been a long, winding road with a lot of twists and turns  along the way, but the end is finally in sight. Speaker Pelosi has  promised to bring this legislation up for a vote in the House, and I  hope our colleagues across the Capitol do not dally and get this bill  voted out of the House and to the President's desk.   Chip manufacturers are watching Congress and waiting to see if this  bill passes before they decide where to build new fab manufacturing  facilities. And we have been told that, unless this bill passes, these  hoped-for manufacturing jobs and these semiconductor manufacturing fabs  will not be built here in America but will be built in Europe and other  places around the world.   Secretary Raimondo, the Secretary of Commerce, has assured our  colleagues that the United States will miss out on big benefits in  terms of jobs, national security, and our economy if Congress doesn't  pass this bill by the start of the August recess.   Once this bipartisan legislation passes the Senate, our Democratic  colleagues are reportedly planning a dramatic pivot from bipartisanship  to an ultrapartisan reconciliation process. Apparently, they are  willing to work together when it is convenient, but they are also  willing to abandon the notion of working together and are preparing to  go on another reckless, partisan spending spree.   This isn't the first time. At the start of last year, Democrats spent  nearly $2 trillion in unnecessary spending on a party-line basis.  People wonder why we have 9 percent inflation. Part of it is our  Democratic colleagues are willing to shovel money out the door and  chase limited goods with supply chain problems, which means that prices  get driven higher and higher--as well as, as I mentioned, flawed energy  policies that look for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to increase  production rather than to produce more American oil and gas here at  home.   Well, our Democratic colleagues succeeded in that $2 trillion bill,  and they tried to pass another partisan bill at the end of the year  which would have cost the American people nearly $5 trillion. But,  thankfully, that entire effort failed.   Now, some of our colleagues are committed--this is their last chance  before the August recess--to take advantage of the rules of the Senate  and to go on a partisan spending bonanza, and certainly they don't want  to miss this opportunity.   We are hearing that our colleagues are frantically piecing together a  bill that has not yet even been written and completed and passed the  so-called Byrd bath test with the Senate Parliamentarian. So we are  waiting to see whether they can meet the time deadline of the end of  next week or not.   As I said, the bill is still reportedly being written, so we don't  even have a good picture of everything that is in it. But we do have an  understanding of the general framework, and it is not looking good for  the American people. For example, our colleagues have said their  proposal will implement government price controls on lifesaving drugs,  a move that will stifle innovation and end up with scarcity. That is  what price controls always do.   Then we have heard that they plan to expand and extend the ObamaCare  tax subsidies. This all started with a partisan spending bill that  became law last year. It expanded the amount of taxpayer assistance  people receive, which, in short, gave more money to more people,  including lifting the cap on individuals who could receive those  subsidies above $400,000.   Of course, at the time, the camel's nose under the tent was that it  was designed as a temporary provision. But here we are a year and a  half later, and they are already trying to extend it, indicating that  there was nothing temporary intended by it.   They claim it is not a permanent extension and that it will only last  2 or 3 years, but I have no reason to believe that Democrats will give  up on extending those provisions when they expire. In the words of  Ronald Reagan, the closest thing to eternal life on Earth is a  government program. Once created, they will not die, even if they are  no longer necessary. And of course, a permanent extension will cost the  American people a lot of money.   Last week, the Congressional Budget Office and the Joint Committee on  Taxation released a report of the true cost of a permanent expansion,  and it is pretty shocking for a number of reasons. First is the  financial cost. By expanding the ObamaCare premium tax credits and  making them permanent, Democrats will add $248 billion to the Federal  deficit over the next decade.    Mr. President, my age and your age--we are not going to be the ones  who have to pay that money back. But these young people sitting down  here are going to have to pay the price for the profligate spending  today, and all Americans will pay the price by adding fuel to the fire  of inflation.  [[Page S3730]]    For whatever reason--reasons I really can't fathom--the Federal debt  and the national debt are of no concern to our Democratic colleagues.  They simply don't seem to care. They act as though we are playing with  Monopoly money, that we can print and borrow like there is no tomorrow  because none of this really matters. But we know that is not true.  Every dollar we spend is paid for by taxpayers, and every ounce of debt  we accrue will be carried and repaid by our children and our  grandchildren. But none of this seems to matter to our friends across  the aisle. They are still plowing ahead with this legislation.   Unfortunately, the irresponsible spending isn't even the worst part.  Our colleagues claim this extension will allow more Americans to afford  healthcare, but the Congressional Budget Office and the Joint Committee  on Taxation told us that under this plan, some 2.3 million Americans  will lose their current coverage provided by their employer. Some 2.3  million Americans will lose their coverage provided currently by their  employer. Hard-working Americans whose health insurance is currently  covered by their employers would be told: You are on your own now. And  no matter what you negotiated when you negotiated your salary with your  employer, presumably if you are a union member and subject to a  collective bargaining agreement where your union negotiated a generous  healthcare plan, all of that will be in jeopardy by this reckless  expansion of the ObamaCare subsidies.   Our Democrat friends want to continue subsidizing healthcare for six- figure earners. People earning 750 percent of the Federal poverty level  would be eligible for taxpayer-funded subsidies--750 percent of the  poverty level, you would get cash from Uncle Sam. Our country would be  essentially paying wealthy people to lose their current employer- provided healthcare so they can end up on the government subsidy.   This is simply crazy policy: driving up the deficit, kicking people  off of their employer-provided health plans, and forcing taxpayers to  subsidize health insurance for the rich. This isn't about helping the  uninsured; it is a backdoor way to implement Medicare for All. Yes, Joe  Biden may be President, but it is the Bernie Sanders agenda at work  here.   Of course, Democrats couldn't get enough support for this radical  plan, so they are trying to jam it through on party-line votes. Instead  of attempting to pass a massive, unpopular bill all at once, they are  trying to serve it to the American people in spoonfuls. Bit by bit,  they are trying to push America closer to a single-payer health system.   American people do not want Medicare for All. People who have their  employer-provided coverage want to keep it. And the American people  don't want the Federal Government subsidizing wealthy people who can  afford to pay for their own healthcare.   This is a bad idea whose time I hope has not come, and I hope our  friends on the other side of the aisle will simply give up on this  massive, partisan tax-and-spending spree bill that will do no good and  will do a lot of harm.
