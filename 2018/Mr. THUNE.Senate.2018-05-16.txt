 Madam President, I rise today in support of net  neutrality. Let me say that again. I rise in support of net neutrality.   Contrary to the assertions that some of our colleagues on the left  have made, there are many of us who believe that codifying net  neutrality principles makes sense if we really want to solve this  problem. What doesn't make sense is this misguided resolution.   All of us value the internet. It connects us to commerce, friends,  family, news, learning opportunities, and entertainment. Most Americans  expect their internet experience to remain free from meddling by  anyone. It doesn't matter if it is a cable company or an unelected  bureaucrat, Americans appreciate online freedom.   If this resolution offered these protections and simply implemented  widely supported net neutrality principles, I would support it.  Unfortunately, this isn't the case.   The resolution offered by Senator Markey would impose partisan,  onerous, and heavyhanded regulations on the internet.   Some of these regulations lack a fundamental connection to net  neutrality principles and harm consumer freedom. Net neutrality, for  example, isn't about regulating mobile phone plan offerings to meet a  government internet standard. But the Markey resolution would restore  rules that the Obama Federal Communications Commission used to  scrutinize such popular and affordable plans.   Net neutrality principles don't necessitate government rate  regulation on companies working to connect Americans in rural areas-- places like my State of South Dakota--or on upgrading existing  networks. But, again, the Chairman of the Obama FCC nonetheless  defended the need for broad authority to threaten rate regulation, and  that is exactly what the Markey resolution seeks to restore. The  implicit threat of such government intervention and statements can have  a profound impact on innovation and the 21st century internet.   The internet has certainly thrived under a model that rejects data  discrimination. Needless to say, before 2015, it had never before faced  such a threat of increased government control. Net neutrality--the idea  that legal internet traffic should operate transparently and without  discrimination--doesn't represent the heavy hand of government. The  heavy hand of government is, however, plain to see in the plan that  Democrats first passed in 2015 and are now seeking to reimpose.   The Democrats' plan relies on a legal framework passed by Congress in  the 1930s to regulate telephone monopolies. This framework existed for  an era and technology that lacked competition and the entrepreneurship  of today's internet-based economy.   Last year, the new leadership at the Federal Communications  Commission widely discarded these rules. Net neutrality wasn't the  problem. The Commission's concern was that onerous, depression-era  rules were having an adverse effect on efforts to connect more  Americans to the internet and upgrade service. For Congress, the path  to restore net neutrality protections while avoiding these unnecessary  side effects is straightforward legislation.   This is what the Los Angeles Times had to say about this in their  editorial. Last week, the editorial board of California's largest  newspaper wrote an important analysis in an editorial entitled ``Senate  Democrats move to revive net neutrality rules--the wrong way.'' The  Times wrote:         Rather than jousting over a resolution of disapproval,       Congress needs to put this issue to bed once and for all by       crafting a bipartisan deal giving the commission limited but       clear authority to regulate broadband providers and preserve       net neutrality.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the editorial be  printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                 [From the Los Angeles Times, May 10, 2018]    Senate Democrats Move To Revive Net Neutrality Rules--the Wrong Way                       (By the Times Editorial Board)         Senate Democrats opened up a new front Wednesday in the       fight to preserve the internet from interference by the       broadband providers that control its on-ramps. But as good as       it was to see them push back against the wrongheaded approach       taken by the new Republican majority on the Federal       Communications Commission, the maneuver is likely to be more       of a distraction than a solution.        At issue is how to preserve net neutrality. Broadband       providers that serve home internet users face little real       competition, and they are uniquely positioned to distort       competition online by, for example, favoring particular       websites and services for a fee.        After several earlier net-neutrality efforts ran into legal       trouble, the FCC's Democratic majority in 2015 classified       broadband access service as a utility and imposed a set of       strict neutrality rules. Last year, however, the commission's       new Republican majority voted not just to rescind those       rules, but effectively to drop all efforts by the FCC to       preserve net neutrality.        On Wednesday, Senate Democrats moved to force a vote on a       resolution to restore the 2015 rules, and they have 50       Senators lined up in support. Yet the resolution faces next-      to-insurmountable odds in the House, where top Republicans       have praised the FCC's deregulatory approach, and with like-      minded President Trump. The most meaningful fights will take       place in the courts and in state legislatures, where net       neutrality supporters are seeking to restore the 2015 rules       or impose similar ones at the state level.        Even opponents of the strict 2015 rules recognize that the       continual legal and regulatory gyrations are a problem.       Rather than jousting over a resolution of disapproval,       Congress needs to put this issue to bed once and for all by       crafting a bipartisan deal giving the commission limited but       clear authority to regulate broadband providers and preserve       net neutrality.     Madam President, in my hand, I hold the 2015 draft text of  legislation I released with my colleagues in the House of  Representatives, Congressman Fred Upton and Congressman  Greg Walden.  Since 2015, I have publicly and consistently been ready to work with my  colleagues across the aisle on bipartisan net neutrality legislation.  Specifically, my draft proposed giving Federal regulators new authority  to ban blocking, throttling, and paid prioritization of legal internet  content. It did this without relying on the heavyhanded use of law  written to police phone monopolies, which is what we are talking about  here. We are talking about a 1934 law governing the 21st-century  internet. Think about that. That is precisely what this resolution  would do.   I recognize that this draft legislation I came up with isn't perfect.  My draft obviously did not anticipate all the concerns my colleagues  raised, and of course there is always room for compromise. That is what  legislative discussion and legislative negotiation are all about. But I  need a partner from the other side of the aisle who shares my  commitment to crafting a bipartisan solution that puts net neutrality  first.   Some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have certainly  expressed a view about the need for legislation. Some of them come up  to me privately, offline, and say: You are right. We need to do this  legislatively. We need to put clear rules of the road in place. This is  not the way to solve this problem.   But very few of them are willing to say that publicly. My colleague  and the distinguished ranking member of the Commerce Committee's  Subcommittee on Communications and Technology told the publication  TechCrunch only 6 months ago: ``My point of view--and by the way, I had  this point of view when it was President Obama and Tom Wheeler [at the  FCC at the time], to the chagrin of my progressive friends--is that we  should legislate.''   This statement was made with knowledge and virtually on the eve of  the FCC's final vote to disassemble the 2015 rule. So what changed? Why  aren't we debating a bipartisan bill instead of  [[Page S2700]]  this partisan resolution? Some on the other side of the aisle reached  the cynical conclusion that exploiting concern about the internet  outweighed the value of working with Republicans to pass net neutrality  protections. For others who had a genuine desire to work with me, the  forces of a highly politicized campaign to impose a Democrat-only  solution can overwhelm the best of intentions.   Make no mistake--the campaign behind this Congressional Review Act  resolution has been primarily driven by fearmongering hypotheticals,  misdirection, and outright false claims. To make that point, this  March, the Washington Post Fact Checker took Senate Democrats to task  for a particularly egregious claim that failure to pass the Markey  resolution would lead to a slower internet. The fact check concluded  that the examined claim--made through the Democratic caucus's official  Twitter account--conveyed the false impression that a slowdown is  imminent. Fact Checker wrote that ``there's scant evidence that  Internet users should brace for a slowdown.'' What that meant is that  statement by the Democratic caucus on this particular subject got not  one, not two, but three Pinocchios from the Washington Post for being a  false claim--from the Washington Post Fact Checker.   Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the March 5, 2018, Fact  Checker be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                  [From the Washington Post, Mar. 5, 2018]     Will the FCC's Net Neutrality Repeal Grind the Internet to a Halt?                            (By Salvador Rizzo)  ``If we don't save net neutrality, you'll get the Internet one word at        a time.''--U.S. Senate Democrats, in a tweet, Feb. 27, 2018                              The Pinocchio Test         The debate over net neutrality is reshaping the Internet       and raising big-picture questions about modern life. But we       can't help but feel that we've spilled a lot of pixels here       analyzing something that simply hasn't happened.        Senate Democrats, industry leaders and net neutrality       activists say the FCC's move to toss out the Obama-era rules       will bog down and end the Internet as we know it. The biggest       broadband providers forcefully reject this claim, saying they       have no plans to block or throttle content or offer paid       prioritization.        That could change in time. As the D.C. Circuit said,       broadband companies could make more money from paid       prioritization, and it's ``common sense'' to think they might       try it. These providers have the ability and the incentive to       slow down or speed up Internet traffic, and they've engaged       in these practices in the past.        For now, though, there's scant evidence that Internet users       should brace for a slowdown. Yet the Democrats' tweet conveys       the false impression that a slowdown is imminent unless net       neutrality rules are restored. This transmission error merits       Three Pinocchios, but we will monitor the situation and       update our ruling depending on whether the fears were       overstated or came true.        Three Pinocchios        (Senate Commerce Committee note: the submission to the       Senate Record includes only the conclusion of the Washington       Post's fact check story.)     In reality, all major cable and phone providers have said  they will continue net neutrality policies. Under the new rules being  put in place, Federal agencies can still take action against privacy  violations and unfair business practices by internet companies.   In stark contrast, one unavoidable irony of the Markey resolution, as  observed by an editorial in today's Wall Street Journal, is that it  would actually weaken online consumer privacy protections by taking the  only agency enforcing them off the beat. If this resolution were  ultimately to be enacted--which it won't, but if it were, it would take  the Federal Trade Commission, which currently regulates and polices  privacy issues, completely out of the equation.   To be sure, Congress still needs to set long-term protections for the  internet, and it shouldn't delay. But the significant harm uncertainty  inflicts on the internet will manifest itself through stifled  investment and innovation over time rather than on consumers in a  sudden wave of net neutrality violations. That is just a simple fact.   After all, the new rules, approved under the Trump administration,  closely follow those that long regulated the internet before 2015 and  are largely, although not completely, in effect now.   One thing I want to continue to hammer is that what we are talking  about here are the rules that were in place for the first two decades  of the internet. For the first two decades of the internet, we operated  under what was called a light-touch approach to regulation. Under that  regime of light touch, the internet prospered, flourished, grew,  expanded, and innovated to the point where it has become a huge  economic engine in our economy. So what was the 2015 FCC ruling  designed to solve? That, frankly, is a very good question. But the fact  is, what the FCC is proposing to do and will do on June 11 of this year  is to go back to the 2015 rules--the rules that were in place for the  first two decades of the internet.   I would tell you that on June 12, after these rules go into effect,  no consumer in this country is going to see any change from what they  see today. They are still going to be able to watch the internet--they  are still going to be to go to all their favorite social media  platforms. There isn't going to be any change from what we have seen up  to this point because that is what we are going back to--our rules that  were in place for two decades, under a light-touch regulatory approach,  that allowed the internet to explode and prosper and grow.   The Markey resolution is offered to this body without opportunity for  amendment or any bipartisan input about what the rules governing the  internet should say. A vote against the Markey resolution is a vote for  ending this cynical exploitation of the internet. A vote against the  Markey resolution is a vote for the Senate to get to work on bipartisan  net neutrality legislation. That is what the L.A. Times said: Pass  legislation. That is the best way to solve this, not coming up with  this bizarre exercise, which we all know isn't going anywhere but will  give the activists and the donors out there on the far left an  opportunity to take this campaign to the House of Representatives,  where it isn't going anywhere. Of course it would be vetoed by the  President even if it did. So all we are doing is stalling, delaying,  making it more difficult to get to a solution on this because what it  will do is prevent those who are truly interested in a bipartisan  solution and answer on net neutrality from coming to the table in order  to make that happen.   As I have said, we have been working on this for a long time, and I  have been looking for a Democratic partner. All we need are a few  courageous Democrats who are willing to acknowledge what this is--which  is a political, partisan charade--and get serious about bipartisan  legislation, because there isn't going to be a single amendment that  can be offered to this. This is not going anywhere.   If we really, truly want to solve the problem, there are fairminded  people who are serious about this who would like to sit down across the  table and work on a draft of legislation that would put internet  principles in place and would put consumer protections in place but  would use a light-touch regulatory approach--not the 1930s approach  this resolution would turn to--to regulate the 21st-century internet.  Frankly, I am at a loss to understand why any rational, reasonable  person could come to the conclusion that using a 1934 law and  regulating the internet like a public utility--a Ma Bell telephone  company--would be the right approach in the age in which we live where  the internet is thriving and prosperous under a light-touch regulatory  regime.                      Unanimous Consent Request--S. 2853    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that S.J. Res. 52 be returned  to the calendar and the Senate proceed to the immediate consideration  of S. 2853. I further ask that it be in order for 10 amendments,  equally divided, between the managers or their designees and relative  to the bill to be made pending; further, that there be 10 hours of  debate, equally divided between the managers or their designees, and  that upon the use or yielding back of that time, the Senate vote on any  pending amendments; finally, that upon disposition of the amendments,  the bill, as amended, if amended, be considered read a third time and  the Senate vote on passage of the bill.    Mr. President, what you just heard is an objection to  having a reasonable debate.   To the point that the Senator from Massachusetts made, clearly the  unanimous consent request asks for--calls for--an opportunity to have  amendments considered by both sides of this discussion. What that tells  me is that what this is about isn't serious legislating; it is about,  again, the political theater associated with this congressional  resolution of disapproval, which has absolutely no future, is going  nowhere, and does nothing to address the fundamental underlying problem  that colleagues on both sides acknowledge needs to be address.   For the record, I will point out that we did attempt to bring up a  serious piece of legislation, one that provides consumer protection,  that bans blocking lawful content, that bans the throttling of lawful  content, that bans paid prioritization--the very things most of my  colleagues on the other side want addressed.   Frankly, no piece of legislation is perfect, and I would say to my  colleague from Massachusetts that we would be more than willing to  enter into a discussion and a debate, with an opportunity to offer  amendments, in order to perfect this piece of legislation. But,  frankly, if we continue down this path with the CRA, all we are going  to do is waste more time--valuable time, I might add--and continue to  live in a cloud of uncertainty where one FCC to the next continues to  change the rules and where companies spend millions of dollars in  litigation in courtrooms on lawsuits rather than ploughing it into  infrastructure, investment, and new and innovative technologies that  literally could deliver higher speed, faster internet services and  higher quality services to people around this country, including those  in rural areas who desperately need those types of services made  available to them.   Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.    Mr. President, we are about to vote on this Congressional  Review Act resolution of disapproval dealing with this issue of net  neutrality.   Let me say again what I said at the beginning of this discussion  earlier today; that is, I support principles of net neutrality that can  be enshrined in law, that actually do address the issues people on the  other side are concerned about, whether that is a ban on blocking of  lawful content, a ban on throttling of internet speeds, a ban on paid  prioritization that would create fast lanes, slow lanes, and that sort  of thing. Those are things on which I think there is pretty broad  agreement.   Frankly, it seems to me, at least, there is bipartisan support for  pursuing a legislative solution to this--to put into law, to codify  once and for all those principles of an open internet. Instead, we are  having this fake argument over a Congressional Review Act resolution of  disapproval, which is going nowhere, and my colleagues on the other  side know that. All it does is prolong the period of uncertainty in  which we have been operating for some time, where internet service  providers are not investing in new technologies, innovation, and  infrastructure and instead are investing in lawyers and litigation as  this cloud of uncertainty hangs over the regulation of the internet.   What our colleagues on the other side are proposing is simply this:  Regulate the internet like a public utility in the same way that Ma  Bell was regulated back in the 1930s, because the law they would use to  regulate the internet is title II of the 1934 Communications Act-- basically saying: We want to take  [[Page S2709]]  a law that is 80 years old and use it to regulate a 21st-century  innovation like the internet--the internet that exploded under the  light-touch regime that was in place up until 2015.   In 2015, the FCC decided they wanted to use the heavy hand of  government regulation as opposed to a light touch. What this FCC has  said, simply, is that we are going to go back to the light-touch  regulation that was in place for the first two decades of its  existence, two decades that led to explosive growth, dramatic increases  in productivity, and economic opportunity for Americans all over the  country. Here we are today talking about a Congressional Review Act  resolution of disapproval that would roll back that FCC's decision in  an attempt to restore and put back in place the heavyhanded regulation  of title II under the 1934 Communications Act.   I think, frankly, that we can solve this issue quite simply; that is,  to sit down in a bipartisan way and figure out a way to enshrine into  law those principles of an open internet that would ban the things I  just talked about--ban blocking, ban throttling, ban pay  prioritization, but do it in a way that does not draw on the title II  authority that essentially gives the FCC the authority, if they want  to, to regulate rates.   This is a heavyhanded government approach to regulating the most  powerful economic engine we have seen literally in generations. I think  the clear vote here today is in favor of legislation that would put  those rules into effect and against a Congressional Review Act  resolution of disapproval, which is simply an attempt to, I guess, gain  partisan advantage with an issue that people seem to think will be  useful in the upcoming elections.   Honestly, it is not going anywhere. We all know that. I think the  sooner we conclude that and the sooner we get serious about sitting  down together across from each other and actually putting into law  these principles of an open internet, the better off we will all be. I  mentioned this earlier today. There are a number of our colleagues who  have made statements publicly, as recently as yesterday at a Commerce  Subcommittee hearing, where they supported that approach of bipartisan  legislation. I had colleagues on the other side who have made public  statements--and I quoted some of them today--in support of a  legislative solution along the lines of what I am proposing here. Of  course, we have had multiple examples of misstatements and hyped-up  statements that aren't grounded in any sense of reality, so much so  that even a Washington Post Fact Checker came out and said that the  statements that were being made by the Democrats warranted three  Pinocchios. The L.A. Times just this last week editorialized: ``Rather  than jousting over a resolution of disapproval, Congress needs to put  this issue to bed once and for all by crafting a bipartisan deal giving  the commission limited but clear authority to regulate broadband  providers and preserve net neutrality.''   That is the way to do this. It is not to have an FCC that bounces  back and forth from administration to administration at the whim of  whatever the political wins of the day are or, perhaps even worse yet,  spends a lot of time in court litigating this issue--millions and  millions of dollars that could be spent investing in innovation and new  technology and new infrastructure that could deliver higher, faster  speeds, higher quality of services to people across this country,  including those in rural areas who have missed out on a lot of this.  You are not going to get broadband providers to deliver services or  invest in rural areas if they are operating under a cloud of  uncertainty, which is what this CRA, if it were successful, would  ultimately lead to.   I simply ask our colleagues on both sides of the aisle to reject this  ill-fated, frankly, charade of an exercise that we are going through in  exchange for a true discussion of bipartisan legislation. I mentioned  earlier that I had a draft from 2015 that we put together. I have had  numerous opportunities to discuss that draft with Members on the other  side. We have socialized some of these issues. We shopped them around.  It certainly is not the end-all product, but that is what legislation  is about. It is about the opportunity to sit down, take input from both  sides, and come up with a bipartisan solution. I think that is  certainly within our reach here if we are willing to do it, but this is  not the way to do it.   This is a dead-end canyon, which does nothing to solve the issue. All  it does is perhaps whip up some people who are perhaps interested in  trying to use this as a political wedge issue, but it is not going to  do anything to solve the problem. I urge my colleagues to reject and  vote no on this resolution of disapproval, and let's get serious about  legislating.   I yield back the remainder of our time.
