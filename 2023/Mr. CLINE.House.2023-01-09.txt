 Mr. Speaker, it is a bright, new day. Today, we begin to  deliver real results for the American people by passing legislation to  block the Biden administration from unleashing 87,000 new bureaucrats  and agents at the IRS on families and small businesses.   Last Congress, Democrats voted to supercharge the IRS with $80  billion of taxpayer money focused on IRS enforcement and hiring more  auditors to squeeze taxpayers.   It is not just wealthy Americans. With that expanded audit capacity,  the IRS can squeeze more money out of middle- and lower-income families  and small businesses, as well.   The Democrats' American Rescue Plan called for the IRS to require  payment apps like Venmo and PayPal to report Americans who made over  $600 in transactions.   Imagine what 87,000 new agents will do.   Republicans want an IRS that works for taxpayers, not targets them.  That is why this bill leaves in place the IRS funding for improvements  to customer service and technology.   Because Americans demand and deserve a government that is  accountable, not to the powerful but to the people, repealing funding  for Biden's army of auditors is a great first step in the right  direction.
