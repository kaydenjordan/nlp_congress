 Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to this  amendment.    Mr. Chair, the Republicans' Interior  Appropriations bill attacks our environment and the opportunity for our  prosperity in communities that have historically been left behind. This  bill stands in stark contrast to Democratic values and priorities.   Last Congress, the Democratic House, Senate, and President recognized  that for too long rural communities have lost jobs, people, and  economic vibrancy.   As someone from and representing rural communities, changing this  trajectory is my purpose and my passion in Congress. It is also my duty  to bring rural voices to this Chamber, especially at times when  Republicans' extreme bills will hurt our precious rural communities.   I know many of my colleagues in this room are also concerned about  the rural communities where they live, yet rather than investing in  places of promise, Republicans are using their appropriation bills to  undermine that promise.   Indeed, their Interior-Environment bill cuts programs from the  Inflation Reduction Act, our landmark law that we passed last year that  marked the largest climate investment in U.S. history. They want to cut  that Act by $9.4 billion. This includes slashing the EPA's Greenhouse  Gas Reduction Fund by $7.8 billion.   That fund allows us to address the climate crisis while investing in  jobs and capital improvements in rural America and other communities  across the country that have been left behind. This program is an  opportunity to remedy decades of underinvestment and to protect our  beautiful lands, our beautiful environment, for generations.   I hear my Republican colleagues talk a lot about energy independence,  yet they attack the programs that would actually help us achieve energy  independence, true energy independence, not relying on foreign oil and  Russia and others who would control the prices that we pay at home. We  also know that pollution especially hurts the same communities that we  fail to invest in, communities that are often places where Latinos and  other people of color live.   This bill does not attack that pollution. Instead, it cuts $1.4  billion needed to address environmental health impacts. It tells those  communities that they are not a priority. It tells them that we are not  going to make things right for their health or for the environment.  What is worse is that this bill cuts funding for the environmental  agencies and council that work to protect our environment and public  health, because health is directly tied to environmental pollution.   Last Congress, Democrats made historic investments in rural America's  infrastructure, the most investments since the New Deal and the rural  electrification program. In contrast, in the extreme Interior bill,  Republicans would roll back all that progress. We can't face the  climate crisis on a 1991 EPA budget, which is what this bill would do.   For these reasons, at the appropriate time, I will offer a motion to  recommit this bill back to committee. If the House rules permitted, I  would have offered the motion with an important amendment to this bill.   My amendment would strike the four provisions of the bill that cut  programs for the Inflation Reduction Act, including the $7.8 billion  cuts from EPA's Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund. It would also cut $1.4  billion to the Environmental and Climate Justice Grants--I would make  sure that those were not cut; all remaining funding from the Council on  Environmental Quality for environmental and climate data collection and  ``efficient and effective;'' and all remaining funding for the National  Park System for deferred maintenance.   We know our parks need the care that they deserve. They are America's  promise, and we are ignoring them and letting them deteriorate.   Mr. Chairman, I include in the Record the text of my amendment.         Ms. Leger Fernandez moves to recommit the bill H.R. 4821 to       the Committee on Appropriations with the following amendment:        Strike sections 438, 439, 474, and 475.    I urge my colleagues to join me in voting for  the motion to recommit.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I, too, rise in opposition to  amendment No. 86.   As noted, this amendment would roll back protections for Federal  lands and Federal lands only within a 10-mile area around the World  Heritage Site, Chaco Culture National Historical Park, in New Mexico,  in my district, and only from new oil and gas drilling.   I stand here on the second day of Native American Heritage Month, and  what we are doing on the second day of Native American Heritage Month  is not recognizing, honoring, and protecting Native American heritage.  Instead, what this amendment is doing is destroying Native American  heritage. It is destroying the ability of Native Americans who hold  these lands and these sites sacred to continue to practice their  spiritual and religious beliefs.   Let's remember that what you are doing is undermining the ability of  people to practice their historic spiritual and religious beliefs  because not only is Chaco County a World Heritage Site, but it remains  to this day a place of cultural and religious significance to the  descendants of the Greater Chaco region.   We need to remember that Chaco Canyon is unique. Between A.D. 900 and  1150, Chaco was the heart of ceremonial, trade, and political activity  for the Ancestral Puebloans. The sweeping ceremonial center you need to  go visit is unlike anything constructed before or since.   However, for the Native Americans who come from this area, Chaco is  not an old place. The sacred nature of Chaco continues unbroken in its  importance to them today.   Given its history, you can imagine the importance of protecting this  land and its people's ability to truly practice their faith.   It is true that there are different points of view within the Navajo  Nation, but let's remember how this bill and how these protections that  have been put into place came to be.   It was the former Navajo Nation president who first approached the  Pueblos in an effort to protect these lands. The advocacy for these  protections began in 2013 when the Eastern Navajo Agency Council passed  a resolution calling for a moratorium on new fracking activities within  their agency.   Navajo Nation's advocacy continued, and in 2017, Navajo Nation  President Russell Begaye, Vice President Jonathan Nez, and the All  Pueblo Council of Governors joined together in a statement opposing new  fracking in the Greater Chaco region.   Protecting Chaco then became a collaborative process. It resulted  eventually in the Chaco Cultural Heritage Area Protection Act, which  passed this body in the 116th Congress with the support of every  Democrat and 17 Republicans.    The secretarial withdrawal this amendment attacks only happened after  an extensive process of public engagement that included consultation  with all the Tribal nations, including the Navajo Nation, the Pueblos,  and those people who live in Arizona as well who are actually  constituents of the sponsor of this amendment.   Mr. Chair, 100,000 public comments is not ignoring the people. That  is listening to them. It was years of Tribal collaboration that made  these protections possible.   Mr. Chair, let me correct the record. This does not affect in any way  Navajo allottees' land. It does not affect in any way Navajo Tribal  lands. It does not affect in any way rights-of-way or any  infrastructure that is needed.   The existing oil and gas activity can continue, and new oil and gas  activity can continue, but just not on Federal lands.   The existing royalties that are presently going to the Navajo  allottees will continue in force, but we must admit that these  withdrawals and protections are difficult. You must weigh the cultural  and spiritual significance of an area that could be lost forever  against the value of mineral development.   One molecule of gas is the same wherever it is extracted, but once  you destroy a sacred site, you will never get it back.   I believe, even though I recognize the importance of the economic  value of withdrawal, that we must err on the side of protection.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.
