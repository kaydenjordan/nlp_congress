 Mr. President, I am on the floor of the U.S. Senate today  to congratulate and to commend the University of Kansas men's  basketball team on its national championship victory. This is KU's  fourth NCAA national championship title, the second under the tenure of  Hall of Fame Head Coach Bill Self.   The University of Kansas's men's basketball program boasts a storied  history and track record of excellence and success, and the inventor of  the game of basketball, Dr. James Naismith, served as the program's  first coach.   KU can also now boast having the most NCAA victories of any Division  I basketball program in the country in addition to now four--four--NCAA  championships.   It is moments like this that Kansans remember forever. Whether you  are watching the game from your living room, on the jumbotron at Allen  Fieldhouse, or from your favorite hangout on Mass Street, 10, 20, 30  years from now, Kansans from across the country will remember where  they were on April 4, 2022, when KU clinched the national title in a  nail-biting game against North Carolina's Tar Heels.   It was the KU men's basketball team that inspired me to go to the  University of Kansas when I was in high school. I am a first-generation  college graduate, and the University of Kansas was probably not the  place that most of my peers and friends from my small town in Northwest  Kansas went to. But, no, it wasn't because I was recruited to play  basketball for the basketball team; it was that I had the opportunity  to attend on my first visit to the University of Kansas a basketball  game in Allen Fieldhouse. From that one game, I knew this was where I  wanted to go to college. The energy and excitement of KU basketball  inspired me, encouraged me, caused me to wonder--and I think it is true  of countless others, to decide they wanted to be a Jayhawk.   On Monday night, KU rallied to overcome a deficit of 15 points at  halftime to beat North Carolina 72 to 69--the largest comeback in an  NCAA basketball national championship game. I am not sure what Coach  Bill Self--but I am going to ask him--I am not sure what Coach Self  said to his players in the locker room during that halftime, but in  true Kansas fashion, the KU Jayhawks came back and beat the odds to  clinch the championship. The team showed tremendous heart,  determination, and resolve in that comeback victory.   KU's Ochai Agbaji scored 12 points and was named ``Most Outstanding  Player'' of the Final Four.   Kansas forward David McCormack scored 15 points and had 10 rebounds  and made 2 critical baskets late in the game.   Kansas forward Jalen Wilson scored 15 points and had 4 rebounds.   Kansas guard Remy Martin contributed 14 points to help the Jayhawks  secure the title.   Kansas guard Christian Braun of Burlington, KS--a smalltown, middle- of-the-State native--scored 12 points and had 12 rebounds,  demonstrating to other smalltown athletes like him that they, too,  could be a star in the Nation's biggest tournament in college  basketball.   Jordan Juenemann, a former walk-on for the Jayhawks men's basketball  team from my hometown of Hays, noted that this 2022 championship team  might not be the best according to the stats, but they played like a  team. They care about the game, and they care about each other. Only a  team that sees the glass half full could come back after being down 16  points and clinch the victory. This speaks to the team's perseverance  and belief in themselves.   Coach Keith Riley, a basketball coach from Hill City, KS, in the  western part of our State--I visited with him the other day, and he  pointed out to me the lesson that kids around the State will take away  from Monday night: You may not always have all of the best players on  the court at the same time, and you may not have all the talent that is  out there on that court, but you can still find ways to be successful  because of how hard you work.   My guess is that kids, ever since Monday, back home in Kansas and  maybe across the country, are in their driveway, they are at the school  basketball court, and they are shooting free throws or 3-point shots  one after another. It inspires us to know that we can do more, and the  University of Kansas basketball team is inspiring kids today to go out  and work harder.   I commend these players and the entire Kansas Jayhawks men's  basketball team, as well as the coaches and staff, for their hard work  which culminated in this victory.   While these young men on the team may be known for their talent on  the court, many should be recognized for the adversity they faced off  court. Dajuan Harris, KU's point guard, has overcome tremendous loss in  his 21 years. He lost both his father and his brother just a few years  apart, and Sunday night, he came out and he played for them.   These young men came to college to play some great basketball, but  along the way, they are learning how to give back to their community.  At Christmastime, this team goes to the local Walmart and purchases  Christmas presents for families who might be facing financial hardship.  They learn the important lesson of giving back to their community.   Finally, to Coach Bill Self, I know you are probably still feeling  that very deep loss--and maybe even more so on Monday night--of your  father, who died just recently--Bill Self, Sr.--but you can be sure he  is smiling down with pride on you and your whole team. You took his  advice. He advised you:         Don't worry about the mules, just load the wagon.    As a graduate of the University of Kansas, as a Kansan, I share the  excitement of Jayhawks fans across the world in Sunday night's stunning  achievement, and I am pleased to introduce this resolution with Senator  Marshall to honor this achievement.   To my fellow Jayhawks, ``Rock Chalk.''   Mr. President, I am pleased that on such a bipartisan basis, in  cooperation between Republicans and Democrats--something I know Kansans  and Americans don't see enough of--this resolution normally would take  a few more days than it has taken to get to the U.S. Senate this week.  I am pleased that both the Republican and Democrat leadership and their  staff worked with us in cooperation to be able to commend the Jayhawks  this early this week.   So, Mr. President, as if in legislative session, I ask unanimous  consent that the Senate proceed to consideration of S. Res. 578, which  is at the desk.    With a neighboring Coloradan in the chair and a former  part of the Big 12 Conference, Mr. President, I now ask unanimous  consent that the resolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to,  and that the motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the  table with no intervening action or debate.    Thank you.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
