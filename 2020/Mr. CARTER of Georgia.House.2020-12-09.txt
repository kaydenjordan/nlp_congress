 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate  Savannah native, Robert E. James, II, of  [[Page H7062]]  Carver State Bank on his election as chair of the National Bankers  Association.   The National Bankers Association is based in Washington, D.C., and  has represented minority-owned and women-owned banks in the U.S. since  1927.   Mr. James wears many hats. He serves Carver State Bank as its  director of Strategic Initiatives and is a member of its board of  directors; is a partner at the law firm, Golden Holley James, LLP; and  is president of Coastal Legacy Group, LLC, which is a real estate  development and consulting firm he founded in 2004.   When he was earning his law degree at Harvard, he received a legal  training scholarship and was elected president of Harvard Black Law  Students Association, as well. By stepping up to the plate to lead the  National Bankers Association, he has demonstrated his dedication to  serving his community and contributing to the success of the American  banking industry as a whole.   Congratulations, again, on this great accomplishment. Mr. Speaker, I  wish Mr. James the very best.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1426, the Timely Review  of Infrastructure Act. Simply put, this is a commonsense bill to  address how employees are commended for their work at the Federal  Energy Regulatory Commission, or FERC.   It is well known that there is a backlog of work at FERC due to a  shortage of qualified personnel to handle the requirements. When energy  developers need to submit applications for approval at FERC, they are  often delayed due to a lack of available personnel to review the  project.   The United States has finally reached a level of energy independence  that we could never have dreamed of during the OPEC oil embargo.  However, that development is often subject  [[Page H7074]]  to the timeliness and availability of approvals at FERC. This bill will  ensure that the retention and recruiting of people at FERC will remain  highly competitive, bringing in the people they need to do the job.   One area of serious concern was the number of pending LNG  applications waiting at FERC. Thankfully, we have a bipartisan bill  that can turn things around.   I thank my good friend from Texas 22, Pete Olson, who is,  unfortunately, leaving this body after years of distinguished service.  But this is a good way to reflect on all of his great work. We will  miss my friend from Texas, and I do wish him well.   Also, I thank my colleagues on the Energy and Commerce Committee for  their work on this important legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support this legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 5758, the Ceiling Fan  Improvement Act. This legislation will update the energy efficiency  standards for ceiling fans manufactured after January 21 of this year.   We are here today because the existing energy and efficiency  standards for ceiling fans was insufficient to meet the characteristics  of ceiling fans being manufactured.   Specifically, the energy conservation standards finalized in January  2017 didn't properly account for the different types of air flow of  large ceiling fans. Therefore, the result of not changing this law  could be the removal of large ceiling fans from the market because they  won't be in compliance.   This issue is a great example of how now nuanced and challenging some  of these issues and topics can be here in Congress. Thanks to the  leadership of my good friend, Congressman Guthrie, and that of  Chairwoman Schakowsky, we are now one step closer to getting this fix  across the finish line.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues on the Committee on Energy and  Commerce for their work on this legislation and for the bipartisan  efforts to get it here, and I urge all of my colleagues to support this  legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Medical  Marijuana Research Act.   Cannabis has been known by humans for thousands of years, yet we  still don't truly know if the plant is medically beneficial. Some  preliminary findings have given cause to believe that there may be some  medicinal benefits. In fact, the FDA has authorized use of medical- grade CBD products for rare forms of epilepsy, but large-scale research  has not occurred.   Despite this, more than half of the States have legalized cannabis  for medical purposes. Even Georgia, my home State, has acted to expand  cannabis laws.   As the legal status of cannabis evolves, we must prioritize making  the plant available for medicinal research.   In 2017, the National Academy of Medicine found that there are  several challenges and barriers in conducting cannabis and cannabinoid  research, including the classification of cannabis  [[Page H7082]]  as a schedule I substance and the difficulty for researchers to gain  access to the quality and quantity of product necessary for research.   I do not believe that the Federal Government should be standing in  the way of medical research for cannabis products. Cannabis could be a  lifesaving product. It may also not be, but we owe it to the patients  to do the due diligence, research, and testing so that they may make  the best medical decisions for themselves.   While we may all have differing opinions on the decriminalization of  recreational marijuana--and my stance on that is well-known and well- documented that I am adamantly opposed to the recreational use of  marijuana--I think we can all agree that we should facilitate better  research on the plant's medicinal benefits.   Mr. Speaker, I am glad to see this legislation come to the floor for  a vote. I thank my colleague, Mr. Blumenauer, for working on this  legislation with me. I urge passage of this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, before I leave, I want to pay homage, if you will, to  Mr. Walden, who will be leaving us, you have heard other speakers  indicate before.   I came on this committee 4 years ago. Being the only pharmacist in  Congress, I wanted to be on the Health Subcommittee, and I wanted to  work in that arena. That is where Energy and Commerce was.   I will have to be quite honest with you. I really didn't understand  just what a great committee--the best committee in Congress--Energy and  Commerce is, and I truly believe that. I understand that now.   But I want to thank   Greg Walden, because when I came in 4 years  ago, he was the chairman of this committee, and he was very encouraging  to me. In fact, he was my mentor on this committee. He led me and gave  me opportunities, and I appreciate that very, very much.   His diversity, his intelligence, his fairness has been outstanding.  His leadership has been outstanding, and it is only surpassed by his  impeccable character.   Mr. Speaker, as he leaves, I want him to know how much I personally  am appreciative of all of his help and all of his leadership.   Our committee, our Congress, our country is better off because of  your work. Thank you and Godspeed.
