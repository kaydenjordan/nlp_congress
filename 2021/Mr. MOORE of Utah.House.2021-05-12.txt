 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to make a simple point  in support of the women and men serving in uniform across America. We  must reject the myopic narrative that the actions of a dishonorable  very few should dominate how we view, appreciate, and honor our police  force.   Prior to Congress, I worked as a consultant with professionals in  many industries. I never met anyone in any field who wasn't interested  in improving their performance, and our police force is no different.  However, if we continue to criticize and demonize our officers as a  whole, we may find ourselves in a position where good, honorable men  and women, professionals like fallen Officer Nathan Lyday from Ogden,  Utah, who was killed almost one year ago in the line of duty, are no  longer willing to wear the badge.   I am so grateful for our Nation's police force. They need our backing  now, more than ever, and it is our duty to support them as we learn and  move forward from recent tragic events.
