 MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, this merciless  bill, ironically called a healthcare bill, would be disastrous for this  country's health, and especially harmful to the people in my home State  of New York.   It will not expand access to health care, as promised. It will,  instead, rip away healthcare insurance from 24 million people,  including 2.7 million in New York City, people who already have health  care. And it will not make premiums more affordable, as promised. It  will, instead, raise premiums across this Nation. Premiums in New York  would go up an estimated $1,000 next year alone.   It cuts all Federal funding for a year for Planned Parenthood  clinics, which serve women in need across this country. And to make an  already bad bill even worse, this bill cuts nearly $5 billion in  funding for New York's hospitals that serve some of our most vulnerable  people.   Voting for this bill is voting to cause sure and certain harm to  millions of Americans. I urge a ``no'' vote.
