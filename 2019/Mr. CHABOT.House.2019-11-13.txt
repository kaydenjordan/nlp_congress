 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I  want to thank the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Raskin) for his  leadership on this particular piece of legislation that I am going to  discuss now.   I rise in support of my bill, H.R. 1663. Put simply, this bill helps  to support those Federal attorneys who prosecute major drug  traffickers, white-collar criminals, and others who commit Federal  crimes and those Federal judges who preside over cases heard in their  courtrooms.   In a few short months, the Federal Bar Association will celebrate the  centennial anniversary of its founding. It was founded with a mission  to promote and support legal research and education, to advance the  science of jurisprudence, to facilitate the administration of justice,  and to foster improvements in the practice of Federal law.   Back in 1954, Congress chartered the Federal Bar Association, but in  the decades since receiving its charter, it has neither been updated  nor amended.   As a former educator and attorney and current senior member of the  Judiciary Committee myself, I recognize, as many of my colleagues do,  the important work that the Federal Bar Association does to bring  civics education to classrooms in my State of Ohio and throughout the  country.   Without legislation like this, H.R. 1663, it would take, literally,  an act of Congress to allow the Federal Bar Association to make simple  changes to its bylaws.   More specifically, this legislation gives the association the ability  to choose the location of its principal office, restricts its officers  from engaging in political activity, and makes other technical changes  to conform to commonly used language used by other congressionally  chartered groups.   This legislation being considered today serves to provide the Federal  Bar Association with the ability to continue its important work and  scholarship in communities throughout the country.   Finally, I want to again thank the gentleman from Maryland (Mr.  Raskin) for his support of H.R. 1663, and I want to thank both Chairman  Nadler and Ranking Member Collins for bringing it to the floor today  for consideration. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to  support it.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I  rise in support of H.R. 3537, the Veteran Entrepreneurship Training Act  of 2019.   Mr. Speaker, before I speak on the bill, I want to again thank  Chairwoman Velazquez, who is unable to be with us, so then the  gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Schneider), for running our committee in  such a bipartisan fashion.   Today we have yet another strong package of five bills that are fully  bipartisan. So, again, I want to make sure that we recognize that we  all have a seat at the table on that committee.   Today's five bills focus on our Nation's heroes, our veterans,  service-disabled veterans, reservists, National Guard members, and  their spouses.   Last month, four veterans testified before our committee and reminded  us of the incredible contributions those who have served our country  make. They have made extraordinary sacrifices, put their lives on the  line, and kept our country safe.   Their service to our Nation doesn't always stop when they separate  from the military. Increasingly, veterans are choosing to open their  own small businesses.   Research has shown that servicemembers are especially qualified to  start running their own firms. While serving in the military, they  learn to make good decisions in chaotic circumstances, and are  confident, driven, and natural leaders.   There are a myriad of programs and services across the Federal  Government that assist veterans who start businesses after leaving the  military.   At the Small Business Committee, we have the unique opportunity to  support our Nation's veterans as they embark on their next adventure:  business ownership. The SBA offers funding, training, and Federal  contracting resources tailored to meet the needs of our veterans. We  are committed to making the SBA's programs and services more accessible  to our Nation's veteran entrepreneurs.   At the hearing from earlier this year titled, ``Continuing to Serve:  From  [[Page H8799]]  Military to Entrepreneur,'' we heard firsthand from veteran small  business owners that entrepreneurship has empowered current and former  servicemembers and their spouses. The Boots to Business Program is a  first step in their journey.   Originally launched in 2012, the Boots to Business Program offers  transitioning servicemembers and military spouses information about  self-employment and business ownership. Participants complete a 2-day,  in-person entrepreneurship program and can access additional training  through online courses.   H.R. 3537, the Veteran Entrepreneurship Training Act of 2019,  codifies the Boots to Business Program, solidifying a crucial piece of  veteran entrepreneurs' support network. Through this program,  participants are introduced to the SBA and its resource partners, who  will have their back as they experience new challenges of business  ownership.   The program's success is a statement to interagency collaboration,  and we can give veterans the holistic support they deserve.   Mr. Speaker, this bill is another product of our committee's  bipartisan cooperation, as I mentioned before, and I would like to  thank the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Schneider) and the gentleman  from Florida (Mr. Spano) for working together to increase business  opportunities for our Nation's heroes.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Florida (Mr. Spano), and I want to thank him for his  leadership on this legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Balderson), and I want to commend him for his  leadership on this as well.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further Members seeking time. If  the gentleman is prepared to close, we will close now.   Mr. Speaker, I want to commend, again, the gentleman from Illinois  (Mr. Schneider) and the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Spano) and Mr.  Balderson for their leadership on this bill, which works to increase  business opportunities for our Nation's veterans.   As Mr. Balderson just mentioned, many of us attended various Veterans  Day events earlier this week, and I think he is absolutely right: this  is something where we can continue every day of the year to help those  who really do seek to start a business, to grow a business, and create  more jobs for veterans and for other members of American society.   Mr. Speaker, I urge its support. It is bipartisan legislation. It  supports our Nation's veterans.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3661, the Patriotic Employer  Protection Act of 2019.   Mr. Speaker, nearly half of all employees in the United States work  for a small business. These employees come from every State and  territory, and every congressional district. Many of them also serve  our Nation proudly.   When these men and women are called up for military duty, the small  business that they work for may be at a disadvantage due to their  absence. If a small business experiences an economic loss due to the  essential employee being called up to duty, the small business has the  ability to apply for a Military Reservist Economic Injury Disaster Loan  through the SBA.   To modernize this loan program, H.R. 3661, this bill, adds employees  who are also on full-time National Guard duty to the eligibility list.  This reform further aligns this SBA program with the way today's  military operates.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Burchett) and  the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Kim) for working in a bipartisan  manner on behalf of the Nation's military servicemembers. Additionally,  I thank the chairwoman, as usual, for moving this legislation forward  in a bipartisan manner.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the bill, which was  favorably reported out of committee via voice vote, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Burchett), the Republican leader on this  particular bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, a small business should not be disadvantaged if the men  and women who they employ are called to military duty.   H.R. 3661 updates the SBA's Military Reservist Economic Injury  Disaster Loan program to ensure it aligns with today's military.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan  legislation. I thank Mr. Burchett and Mr. Kim for their leadership on  this, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 499, the Service-Disabled  Veteran Small Business Continuation Act.   First, I would like to thank Chairman Takano and Ranking Member Roe  of the House Veterans' Affairs Committee for their leadership and  collaboration on this issue. I would also like to thank the gentleman  from New York, a member of our Small Business Committee, Mr. Delgado,  for his willingness to work with me and be a leader on this  legislation.   I, like all Members of this body, hear from many constituents on a  wide range of issues. One issue that is particularly important to me  and the folks in my district is to ensure that veterans and their  families are treated fairly by the government that they have served so  bravely.   Many of our men and women in uniform come home after serving and  decide to use their considerable talents to become small business  owners. Unfortunately, the laws and regulations around starting a  business can be difficult to navigate--almost prohibitive--when they  shouldn't be. Further exacerbating the problem is when one part of the  law says one thing, yet another part of the law says something entirely  different.   How can we expect our veterans to come home and become successful  entrepreneurs when our laws are often unclear? That is why this bill,  H.R. 499, is so important. While Congress has already codified in title  38 a commonsense policy allowing the surviving spouse of the service- disabled veteran small business owner to retain the company's SDVOSB  status for a certain length of time, the Small Business Act has no such  policy and this lack of parity creates legal uncertainty in the  application of the law and confusion for veterans and their families.   H.R. 499 provides clarity in the law by ensuring continuity across  the government in the way we treat our veteran entrepreneurs and their  families. The bill amends the Small Business Act to align with title  38, guaranteeing that the surviving spouses of service-disabled veteran  small business owners can keep the valuable SDVOSB small business  designation for their companies for a certain period of time, even  after the veteran owner passes away.   Correcting this misalignment in the law is the least we can do to  provide our Nation's heroes and their families with some measure of  comfort and peace of mind, especially when dealing with this type of  family tragedy.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, this commonsense bill fixes an oversight by Congress to  align the way the Federal Government treats the surviving spouse of a  service-disabled veteran-owned small business. The bill simply aligns  title 15, the Small Business Act, with title 38, ensuring continuity  across the government for this important policy.   This bill will provide our Nation's heroes and their families with  peace of mind. I urge this bill's adoption, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3734, the Successful  Entrepreneurship for Reservists and Veterans Act or the SERV Act.   Veteran-owned small businesses are some of the Nation's most  innovative companies. They are nimble and move quickly as markets  change directions. The resources that are available to our veteran- owned small businesses should be as effective and as efficient as the  owners themselves.   The SERV Act requires the SBA to outline the agency's veteran  outreach plans and veteran promotion plans to Congress. Additionally,  H.R. 3734, requires the Government Accountability Office to evaluate  credit availability of veteran, service-disabled veteran, and  reservist-owned small businesses.   I want to thank the gentlewoman from Kansas (Ms. Davids) for working  with me in a bipartisan manner on this legislation. I also want to  thank Chairwoman Velazquez for advancing this commonsense legislation  that will assist veterans as they work to launch and build strong small  businesses.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the SERV Act which was  favorably reported out of committee by voice vote, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, veteran-owned small businesses deserve the  resources that will prepare them for future growth.   In order to improve our capital access programs for our Nation's  veteran-owned businesses, we must fully understand what they are facing  when seeking access to affordable and reliable capital. This bipartisan  bill will provide future Congresses with a better picture of what is  available to them and what is not and where we can plug the gaps for  them.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume,  and I rise in support of H.R. 1615.   Before I speak on the bill, I want to thank the gentleman from  Mississippi (General Kelly) and the gentleman from Colorado (Mr.  Crow)--both veterans, by the way--for their leadership on this  important legislation and for their service to our country. We  appreciate it greatly.   So many of our Nation's heroes come home to become entrepreneurs, and  many choose to continue with their service to the country by entering  the Federal contracting space.   Federal contracting can be a confusing minefield of red tape and  bureaucracy, and it is up to us to make the process as easy as  possible.  [[Page H8808]]    Unfortunately, the process is complicated and rife with disparities.  In fact, there currently exists an unnecessary duplication of small  business programs at the SBA and the VA. Both operate under separate  and conflicting standards.   Veterans attempting to make sense of these two programs often feel  overwhelmed and frustrated, sometimes to the point where they decline  to join the Federal marketplace altogether.   This should not be the case. We need to encourage veteran  entrepreneurship by reducing barriers to entry, not creating more  confusion.   It is well past time that these two programs consolidate under a  single agency, the SBA, and that all rules and regulations governing  the Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business program are unified  for the benefit of our veteran entrepreneurs. H.R. 1615 takes that  critical step in the right direction.   Mr. Speaker, I thank both of these gentlemen for their leadership on  this. I urge my colleagues to support the bill, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. Kelly), General Trent Kelly.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to the  gentlewoman from Puerto Rico (Miss Gonzalez-Colon).   Miss GONZALEZ-COLON of Puerto Rico. Mr. Speaker, today I rise in full  support of H.R. 1615, known as the VA-SBA Act of 2019, introduced by my  dear friend, General Kelly from Mississippi.   Why this bill is important for me: in Puerto Rico, we do have more  than 100,000 veterans registered by the VA system.   Our men and women in uniform are an invaluable asset during their  time of service and upon separating from the Armed Forces as well. One  of the main challenges upon retiring and adjusting to life as a  civilian is actually securing employment.   Many decide to open and operate their own business, employing the  community and generating robust gains for our economy. According to the  Small Business Administration, close to 2.5 million businesses in the  United States are minority-owned by veterans, with a total annual  revenue of over $1 trillion--and Puerto Rico is not a part of these  statistics.   Yet, there are additional issues to consider, and that is the reason  this bill is presented today. Both the Department of Veterans Affairs  and the Small Business Administration are involved in the process of  certifying American service-disabled veteran-owned businesses.   These businesses have the option to self-certify with the SBA for  contracting purposes with the Federal Government, but, additionally,  the Veterans Affairs Administration has its own process for certifying  these same businesses through a more rigorous evaluation for Federal  contracts within the VA.   This is another hardship for many of those veterans. Having two paths  for what is essentially the same outcome can be confusing for service- disabled veteran business owners and creates an opportunity for fraud,  waste, and abuse.   This bill will help rectify this problem by streamlining the process  and making clear certification requirements for service-disabled  veteran-owned small businesses and shifting this responsibility to the  Small Business Administration, which has the technical expertise to  administer small business programs and properly work with these cases.   By releasing the VA from this task, we help eliminate inconsistencies  in the certification process and previous loopholes that impact Federal  contracting and also allow the VA to focus on their main mission. We  also help focus the VA's attention to its core mission of administering  the healthcare services for our veterans.   Mr. Speaker, I am a proud original cosponsor of this bill, and I  think we should all vote for it.    Mr. Speaker, it is vitally important to reduce the red  tape and bureaucracy our Nation's heroes endure just to try to contract  with the Federal Government.   There currently exists an unnecessary duplication of programs at the  SBA and the VA which operate under separate and conflicting standards.  This bill is a step in the right direction to eliminate some of that  red tape for our Nation's veterans.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.  [[Page H8809]]                                     time  1345
