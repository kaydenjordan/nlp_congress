 Mr. Chairman, I thank the chairman for  yielding.   Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of H.R. 205, the Protecting and  Securing Florida's Coastline Act, which makes the existing moratorium  in the eastern Gulf of Mexico permanent.   Mr. Chairman, I thank Representative Castor, our colead, for  coleading this effort with me and our bipartisan Florida delegation for  their support.   I have talked repeatedly about the existential threat offshore  drilling poses to us on the west coast of Florida. It jeopardizes our  tourist and recreational economy.   Last year, 70 percent of Floridians voted to ban offshore drilling  because tourism accounts for $37.4 billion of GDP, including $17.5  billion right there on the Gulf Coast, and supports over 600,000 jobs.   Following the Deepwater Horizon disaster, the west coast of Florida  faced lost economic value for commercial and recreational fishing and  many canceled tourist trips, despite the fact that there was no impact  to our coastline. Perception became reality.   A 2018 study by the Gulf Restoration Network describes the continual  spills in the Gulf. The Taylor Energy leak, for example, has released  approximately 1 million gallons of oil over the last 14 years. Even  Shell, which is a good operator, had a spill from a jumper pipeline in  2016 that dumped 1,900 barrels of oil into the Gulf. The following  year, LLOG had a similar leak that dumped as much as 9,350 barrels into  the Gulf.   As long as humans and complex pipeline and well bore connections are  involved, there will be significant environmental risk. These undersea  connections are difficult to maintain and examine.   Additionally, as documented in a study by the Pew Research Center,  large quantities of bentonite and other chemicals are released in the  water while drilling.   My colleagues have raised concerns about energy security and energy  independence. That is an important thing. As this export-import chart  shows, we are energy independent and have become net energy exporters.  It was radically different. Ten years ago, these big lines were coming  that way, now they are coming that way.   The exploitation of shale deposits via horizontal drilling coupled  with hydraulic fracking has revolutionized the energy industry. Once  again, our American free enterprise system has brought competitive  innovation to energy to change the game.    In the Permian Basin of west Texas, for example, there are three  shale zones. One of them, the Wolfcamp, is said to contain 20 billion  barrels of oil and natural gas liquids--yes, billion. We have more  reserves in the United States now than Russia or Saudi Arabia have in  conventional reserves. A radical shift in the import and export flows  of oil and gas has taken place due to American innovation.   In addition to the compelling economic case for making the moratorium  in the eastern Gulf permanent, the eastern Gulf is the home of the Gulf  Test Range, a 120,000-square-mile range that stretches from the Florida  Panhandle to the Keys. This unimpeded training and testing area is a  crucial national security asset. It cannot be replicated anywhere else  in the United States--or possibly the world. Its large scale supports  testing of hypersonic weapons, combat maneuvers, drone testing, and  evolving weapons technology that need space for testing and  restrictions for classified work.   In May 2018, the DOD published a report, ``Preserving Military  Readiness in the Eastern Gulf of Mexico.'' This report examines the  ongoing operations of the Gulf Test Range, its inability to coexist  with oil and gas operations, and its projected usage of the range.                                time  1500    What this chart shows here is that the projected use of the range-- here is the line right here, south of Eglin Air Force Base. Alabama is  way over here. It is not Alabama. It is Destin, Florida. It shows that  the most intensive projected use in the foreseeable future for this  testing range is right out here, smack dab next to the military mission  line. We can't let this thing move an inch east.   This is why we need to ban drilling east of the line. In 2006, this  moratorium was enacted by a bipartisan Congress, President George W.  Bush, and aided and abetted by Governor Jeb Bush, and I might say, Bill  Nelson and Mel Martinez teamed up on this.   As we look forward to extending this moratorium now, we are a unified  team in the Florida House delegation, working with Senator Rubio and  Governor DeSantis. We have been doing that for some time on a combined  strategy.   All of them agree that we must protect this national security asset  in Florida's coastline. As we move forward, we will work together to  convince President Trump of the critical importance of this moratorium  to Florida.   Speaker Pelosi, Majority Leader Hoyer, and Natural Resources  Committee Chairman Grijalva have all stepped up and committed to  protect Florida. Now we need the Senate and the administration to do  the same thing.   Mr. Chairman, I urge all of my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this  bill.
