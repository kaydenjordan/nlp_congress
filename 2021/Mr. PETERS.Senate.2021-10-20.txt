 Madam President, I reserve the right to object. My friend  from Oklahoma serves as the ranking member of the Government Operations  Subcommittee of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs  Committee. I sincerely appreciate that he brings a thoughtful approach  to Federal workforce issues and that we frequently have an opportunity  to work together to make government work more efficiently and more  effectively.   Unfortunately, I strongly disagree with the legislation being put  forward today. This proposal would roll back policies put in place to  make sure that Federal workers and Federal contractors who are paid  with taxpayer dollars are vaccinated against COVID-19. These Executive  orders protect not just the Federal workforce all across our country,  but they help protect their families and their communities. There are  also commonsense exceptions for people with disabilities, with medical  conditions, or with sincerely held religious beliefs. These policies  were put in place both carefully and fairly.   The American people are literally sick and tired of this pandemic--a  pandemic that has already claimed over 725,000 lives, including the  lives of our friends, our neighbors, and our family members. They want  this pandemic to end, and vaccines is how we get there.   From the beginning of this pandemic, I and many of my colleagues have  been dedicated to bringing safe and effective vaccines to the people  who live in our States by investing in science and research and by  strengthening our domestic supply chains.   COVID-19 vaccines are now widely available, but we know from trusted  scientists and public health experts that we need higher rates of  vaccination to get this pandemic under control. The politicization of  safe, effective, public health measures is making it harder to end this  horrible pandemic. The legislation before us today would without  question move us in the wrong direction. I object.
