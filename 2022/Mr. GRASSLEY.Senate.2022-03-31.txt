 Today, I come to the Senate floor to discuss the  Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act. This has been  introduced in the House and now introduced in the Senate by this  Senator and by my colleague and friend, Senator Feinstein.   This bill is a product of bipartisan work and much collaboration. I  also want to thank Senators Cornyn and Klobuchar, who are true leaders  in this area and also introduced their trafficking legislation this  week. I look forward to continuing to work with those two Senators, as  well, on this issue.   Many Americans tend to view human slavery as a thing of the past. We  read about it in our history books and collectively cringe at the  concept of such injustice. Unfortunately, however, the reality is that  human slavery is alive and well, even today, in the form of sex and  labor trafficking. According to the State Department's annual  Trafficking in Persons Report, human trafficking is a $150 billion  business worldwide. Through deception, through threats, through  violence, the perpetrators of these crimes will do whatever--whatever-- it takes to turn a profit at their victims' expense.   With the introduction of this bill, we are acting as a voice for  those human trafficking victims in the United States who cannot speak  for themselves. To combat this crime within our borders, we have  addressed the scourge on multiple fronts. The bill we have championed  would extend several key victims' services programs that were  established under the Trafficking Victims Protection Act. It would  promote screening of human trafficking victims, enhance training for  Federal investigators, and start a pilot program for young people at  high risk of being trafficked.   Our bill also includes the Survivor's Bill of Rights, a bill I  developed with survivors and an advocate named Amanda Nguyen, which  encourages States to ensure that survivors have, at minimum, the rights  guaranteed to survivors under Federal law.   Fighting for victims has been one of my top priorities as chairman  and now ranking member of Senate Judiciary. I consider it a privilege  to shape the law to ensure that trafficking victims receive necessary  services. I also take pride in helping law enforcement and prosecutors  hold the perpetrators accountable for these selfish acts.   Lastly, this bill has the support of the National District Attorneys  Association, Rights4Girls, Shared Hope International, Covenant House,  the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, the Rape, Abuse  & Incest National Network, and the National Center on Sexual  Exploitation. I am grateful for all of these groups and the important  work that they do.   This bipartisan bill is a strong start, and, of course, the work  doesn't stop with a single piece of legislation. I look forward to  marking this bill up in the Judiciary Committee and getting it signed  into law.                           Prescription Drug Costs    Mr. President, on another relatively short matter, as well, something  I come to the floor frequently to speak about and something I waited  throughout last year to see if the Democrats' approach to prescription  drugs was going to become law--and it doesn't look to me like that  route is going to be successful.   So I continually bring up another piece of legislation that I am  working on with Senator Wyden. It is a bill that says very clearly that  this Senator--and I think I speak for many, many Senators--that we want  lower prescription drugs now. I said that in the Finance Committee  hearing 2 weeks ago, and I say it again: I want lower prescription  drugs now.   What are we waiting for? We have a bipartisan prescription drug  package called Wyden-Grassley that will save seniors $72 billion and  the taxpayers $95 billion.   Senator Wyden said during the Finance Committee's most recent drug  pricing hearing that ``there is no question that the committee came''  forward--I am going to start this quote over again:         There is no question that the committee came together in       the last Congress and came up with a number of constructive       bipartisan reforms. Period. Full stop.    Why aren't we then advancing this bipartisan bill? What is the  majority waiting for?   One of my colleagues on the other side tweeted this:         POTUS has the authority to lower drug prices all on his       own--he should use it.    The Congressional Progressive Caucus is calling for this same thing,  as well.   And then in the Washington Post, I read this headline:         Advocates seek other pathways to lower drug prices.    Far-left groups are pushing President Biden to bypass Congress and  exert executive authority. Is that some sort of statement that we are  giving up on the legislative path? Why would we, in Congress, not move  ahead? It is not like all options for legislation have been exhausted.   The majority has spent 15 months attempting to pass their partisan  prescription drug bill. It has gone nowhere. It doesn't have 60 votes.  But that is not the only option. Has the Democratic majority given up  on lowering prescription drug prices and is counting on doing it only  by Executive order? Are they saying they have to do it in a way where  only Democrats get credit or not do anything at all? Do Democrats  really want to help seniors or would they rather have a campaign issue?   The longer we wait, patients and taxpayers are going to continue to  pay those high prices, and for some families, that is a suffering  position to be in.   Let's work to advance a bipartisan prescription drug bill that can  pass with 60-plus votes. We can do it today. It is already negotiated  and ready to go. I will work with anyone who wants to pass the  bipartisan Wyden-Grassley bill. Just give me a call.  [[Page S1884]]    I said something about last year, that you had to sit around and wait  for the Democrats to get something done on a totally partisan basis. I  don't say that they didn't work hard to get a bill passed that would  have reduced prescription drug prices.   But I just didn't sit around all of 2021. In the past 15 months, I  want to give you some of the things that I have been doing to try to  sell a bipartisan bill. I spoke with President Biden's White House  staff--although I did have a short conversation with President Biden  himself. I met with Speaker Pelosi. I met with Leader McCarthy. I had a  phone call with HHS Secretary Becerra. I met with the 10 Democrats who  were wise to this issue that you can't pass a bipartisan prescription  drug bill.   These 10 House Democrats wrote to the Speaker, way last summer,  wanting a bipartisan prescription drug pricing bill. I met with not all  10 of them, but I will bet I met with at least 5 of them, and they were  receptive to doing what I am doing. It doesn't mean they were receptive  to doing it exactly the way I wanted to do it, but they were receptive  to working in a bipartisan way.   Then I met with the Republican and Democrat group that is called the  Problem Solvers Caucus Healthcare Working Group.   Peter Welch, a Democrat from Vermont, has been on top of this issue  for years and years. I had breakfast with him.   I met with Congresswoman McMorris Rodgers because she is the top  Republican in the House dealing with this issue.   I met with Senators Sinema and Carper and other rank-and-file Members  of Congress.   While Democrats talk about lowering drug costs, they haven't made any  progress. The only bipartisan progress that has been made on drug  pricing has been under Republican leadership. If Republicans take  control of the Senate next Congress, Republicans will be lowering  prescription drug prices. We shouldn't have to wait another 8, 9  months. And who knows who will control the next Congress in the first  place. We don't have to wait a whole year. Let's lower prescription  drug prices today.   I yield the floor.
