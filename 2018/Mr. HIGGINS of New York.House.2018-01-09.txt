 Madam Speaker, each year we are reminded of  the day that Continental Flight 3407 crashed in western New York. This  tragedy forever changed our community and stole the lives of husbands,  wives, sons, daughters, sisters, and brothers.   In their grief, the families of Flight 3407 bravely turned their loss  into a powerful force for change. With their leadership, Congress  enacted strong and landmark aviation safety reform legislation. That  reform exactly aligned with what the National Transportation Safety  Board concluded: that the crash was avoidable, and that pilot error and  failed training procedures were the causes.   We have new leadership at the Federal Aviation Administration, and I  strongly urge him to swiftly enforce the flight safety law. We, the  members of the western New York delegation and the families of Flight  3407, will be watching closely.                            ____________________
