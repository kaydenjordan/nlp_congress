 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to share the inspiring story of  a World War II veteran from my district. At 102 years young, Beverly  Hurd is a unique personification of what heroism is about.   In 1944, Bev put her teaching career on hold and enlisted in the U.S.  Navy. While stationed at Corry Field in Pensacola, Florida, she was  able to apply her teaching skills as a ground school instructor. During  her time there, she developed critical classified reconnaissance films  that were used in troop training.   Once discharged, Bev used her GI Bill to earn her teaching degree and  return to the classroom. She went from serving in uniform to serving at  home and, for nearly 40 years, educated generations of great minds.   Beverly Hurd modeled selflessness and sacrifice at a time when the  doors were barely open for females to do so, and she played a critical  role, both in protecting democracy and in expanding the role of women  in our military service.   I thank Bev for her service, her sacrifice, and for being a great  role model for generations of younger American women.                            ____________________
