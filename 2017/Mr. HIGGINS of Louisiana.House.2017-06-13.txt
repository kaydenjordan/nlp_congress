 Mr. Speaker, I wanted to report my absence  on the vote of the H. Res. 378, the combined rule providing for  consideration of H.R. 2581 and S. 1094, as well as the vote on the  previous question. Had I been present, I would have voted ``yea'' on  rollcall No. 302 (Previous Question on H. Res. 378), and ``yea'' on  rollcall No. 303 (Adoption of H. Res. 378).                            ____________________
