 Madam Speaker, as a proud cosponsor, I rise  today in support of H.R. 36, the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection  Act.   Before coming to Congress, I worked as an OB/GYN physician for over  30 years, where I had the tremendous privilege to see life at all  stages of development. Today's technology, like 3-D and 4-D ultrasound,  has given us a window into that miracle that shows the unborn child is  a living, feeling human being.   Due to medical achievements, premature babies are surviving and  thriving after being born earlier and earlier, including babies born at  or before 20 weeks, the 20-week cutoff by this bill. I can give you  case after case. I have watched these children grow up in my hometown.   As a physician who has delivered almost 5,000 babies, it is  unconscionable to me that our government allows innocent lives capable  of feeling pain and enjoying life to be terminated. It is our  responsibility as legislators to stand up and protect these lives who  do not have a voice. This bill is an important step toward that goal,  and I vote for life.    Mr. Speaker, I am honored to recognize Jim  Powell, of Johnson City, Tennessee, for his 80th birthday.   In addition to being a successful businessman, Jim has devoted his  life to many worthy endeavors, such as helping students achieve their  dreams of attending college.   Growing up, Jim never dreamed of going to college until a teacher  helped him apply for a scholarship to the University of Tennessee.  Eleven years later, Jim and his wife, Sandy, opened Powell Construction  Company, which has been successfully operating for the past 48 years  and employs more than 500 people.   All of this wouldn't have been possible without the kind  encouragement of Jim's teacher. In an effort to pay that kindness  forward, Jim created the Powell Foundation, which has provided over  4,000 scholarships to the University of Tennessee and to East Tennessee  State University.   Our community is a better place to live and work because of Jim and  Sandy Powell. Jim exemplifies the Volunteer spirit. I commend him for  his selfless contributions to east Tennessee, and wish him nothing but  the best on his 80th birthday.   Happy birthday, Jim.                            ____________________
