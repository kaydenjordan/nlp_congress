 Mr. President, on the issue of avoiding default,  yesterday, Speaker McCarthy made it clear how unprepared Republicans in  the House are to resolve our Nation's default crisis.   With a default approaching, Speaker McCarthy yesterday capitulated to  the MAGA right and rolled out a partisan wish list masquerading as  legislation. This MAGA wish list has no chance of moving forward in the  Senate, and it doesn't move us any closer than we were yesterday to  avoiding default.   To quote one hard-right conservative House Republican:         The leadership just picked up the House Freedom Caucus plan       and helped us convert it into the legislative text.    That shows you how hard right this wish list truly is.   Again, let me quote one of the most well-known hard-right  conservatives in the House:         The leadership just picked up the House Freedom Caucus plan       and helped us convert it into the legislative text.    Wow. That is what Leader McCarthy is doing--maybe not as a surprise  after what happened with the many votes he needed to get elected.   Americans who look at this package will overwhelmingly agree: The  biggest losers in Speaker McCarthy's agenda are parents, kids, law  enforcement, small businesses, and countless others who work hard every  single day to make ends meet.   Do you want to talk about reducing debt? Wall Street billionaires are  not asked to pay even a nickel under McCarthy's bill. Hurt the parents.  Hurt the kids. Hurt law enforcement. Hurt small businesses, but leave  the billionaires alone. That is what McCarthy is doing over there in  the House.   Let me say that again. The biggest losers in Speaker McCarthy's  blueprint are parents, kids, law enforcement, small businesses, and  countless others who work hard every single day to make ends meet. Wall  Street billionaires are not being asked to pay a nickel. Americans will  not accept this transparently unfair and draconian package.   If these MAGA cuts become law, it will decimate everything ranging  from food nutrition programs to funding for mental health, opioid  addiction, and childcare. Parents who need help buying groceries and  baby formulas will see their out-of-pocket costs go up. It is so cruel  and heartless that parents who get $6 a person a day to feed their  families would see it disappear. Can you imagine? Can you imagine?   If this MAGA wish list becomes law, untold thousands of clean energy  and advanced manufacturing jobs could leave our shores and go to China.   This MAGA wish list will also make Americans less safe by slashing  funding for the Department of Justice by billions of dollars and  eliminating tens of thousands of law enforcement positions nationwide.  We hear a lot of talk from the other side about helping the police.  [[Page S1276]]  This helps defund them, this legislation.   Donald Trump called for Republicans to defund law enforcement, and  now Republicans seem to be following through. The wish list will  further punish middle-class taxpayers and reward tax cheats by slashing  funding necessary to go after ultrarich tax cheats while raising taxes  on the middle class by depriving them of many of the new tax credits  aimed at the middle class that we passed--we Democrats passed--during  the last Congress.   You heard me right. This MAGA wish list punishes middle-class  taxpayers while rewarding ultrarich tax cheats.   It is clear what is going on here: Speaker McCarthy cobbled together  all sorts of extraneous measures in order to try and pass something,  anything, no matter how extreme. But these extraneous measures--and  they are truly extreme--have no place in a debate about avoiding  default.   If Republicans truly wish to sell their extreme agenda to the  American people, they should not do so in the middle of discussions to  avoid default. There is a time and place to debate that, not during  this debate, because what they are doing is dangerous to the country.   In the meantime, the solution to resolving the debt limit crisis has  not changed. If Republicans want to avoid causing a first-ever default,  they should do what we did three times under Donald Trump and twice  under President Biden: work with Democrats to avoid default without  brinksmanship, without blackmail, without hostage-taking, and without  extraneous demands that nobody in America would want to accept, hardly  anybody at all.   Speaker McCarthy's wish list is an extreme step in the wrong  direction. It heads us in the direction of default, and time is running  out.                            ____________________     Mr. President, next on women's rights and veterans'  rights, for weeks, the senior Senator from Alabama has threatened  American security by blocking over 180 routine military promotions  because he objects to women in the military accessing reproductive  care.   Yesterday, the Senator from Alabama's objections came before the  Senate for consideration through a resolution that would have  eliminated reproductive care for our veterans and their families.  Senator Tuberville lost the vote. Senator Tuberville lost, while our  women veterans won.   Yesterday's vote made two things very clear: First, MAGA Republicans  are so hellbent on eliminating reproductive choice that not even  veterans and our generals are safe. Americans have made abundantly  clear that they reject the hard right's anti-choice agenda, but MAGA  Republicans still double down.   Second, the Senate has now spoken on Senator Tuberville's anti-choice  proposal and said no--one of the few instances where a CRA has been  voted down in the Senate and, in this case, with bipartisan votes  against it.   The Senate has spoken. Senator Tuberville has zero excuse for  blocking 180 military promotions. His objection has been presented,  considered, and rejected on a bipartisan basis. He should drop his  holds against our military personnel and move on.   I urge my Republican colleagues who care about our national defense  and about our veterans to talk some sense into our colleague from  Alabama so he can drop his dangerous holds.                            ____________________     Mr. President, next on the FBI, a few weeks ago, former  President Donald Trump called on Republicans in Congress to defund the  Department of Justice and FBI because of personal grievances. Instead  of standing up to President Trump, Speaker McCarthy and Republican  leaders have been silent, and some Members of their party even echo the  former President's call.   That is why today I am introducing a resolution denouncing President  Trump's call to defund the DOJ and the FBI. The Senate will act on this  measure as soon as next week.   The resolution is simple. It expresses our support for Federal law  enforcement, and it condemns Donald Trump's call to defund the DOJ and  FBI and any other partisan attempts to undermine their authority.   When the resolution comes to the floor, every Member of this Chamber  will have a chance to do the right thing: stand up for the brave law  enforcement who keep us safe and reject the former President's  dangerous call to strip away their funding.   I hope the resolution passes unanimously. It certainly should.   The DOJ and FBI do critical work to protect our communities from  threats at home and abroad, including drug trafficking, gun violence,  terrorism, and so much more. Do Republicans really want to cut their  funding, the funding of these Agencies, making it harder for them to do  their jobs?   Again, where will Republicans stand? Will they stand with the Federal  law enforcement who keep us safe or stand with the former President and  his dangerous call to defund Federal law enforcement? The American  people deserve to know how radical the hard right has become, and this  resolution will give them answers.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on the Fire Grants and Safety Act, later  today, the Senate will pass a much needed lifeline for our  firefighters, the Fire Grants and Safety Act.   I thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for their good work  on this overwhelmingly bipartisan legislation.   Passing the Fire Grants and Safety Act will extend two important  Federal grant programs that support our paid and volunteer  firefighters--SAFER and AFG.   As we approach the fire season, extending SAFER and AFG is crucial to  ensuring that firefighters have lifesaving equipment and personnel  necessary to do their jobs. This is particularly true in smaller, more  rural, more suburban areas where volunteer firefighters staff the  firehouses, but the equipment is hard to purchase for smaller and less  wealthy communities.   Our firefighters are brave. They risk their lives for us. They run  toward danger, not away from it. They work tirelessly around the clock,  often in dangerous and unpredictable conditions, putting their lives on  the line to keep us safe. Firefighters have had our backs, and passing  the Fire Grants and Safety Act today will show we have their backs too.   I was proud, in my early days in the Senate, to work with Senator  Dodd to pass this legislation.   Again, I thank my colleagues. This has been an example, again, just  like we did a few weeks back on the AUMF, of how the Senate should  work--bipartisan. We worked with our Republican colleagues and the  ranking member of the relevant committees to allow Republican  amendments, and, in turn, our Republican colleagues are supporting us  moving forward on this important legislation. It is a good thing, and I  hope this model continues. As leader, that is one of the things that I  am trying to do.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    I announce that the Senator from Illinois (Mr. Durbin),  the Senator from California (Mrs. Feinstein), and the Senator from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Fetterman) are necessarily absent.   The result was announced--yeas 46, nays 51, as follows:                        [Rollcall Vote No. 92 Leg.]                                  YEAS--46       Baldwin      Bennet      Blumenthal      Booker      Brown      Cantwell      Cardin      Casey      Coons      Cortez Masto      Duckworth      Gillibrand      Hassan      Heinrich      Hickenlooper      Hirono      Kaine      Kelly      King      Klobuchar      Lujan      Markey      Menendez      Merkley      Murkowski      Murphy      Murray      Ossoff      Padilla      Reed      Rosen      Sanders      Schatz      Schumer      Shaheen      Sinema      Smith      Stabenow      Tester      Van Hollen      Warner      Warnock      Warren      Welch      Whitehouse      Wyden                                  NAYS--51       Barrasso      Blackburn      Boozman      Braun      Britt      Budd      Capito      Carper      Cassidy      Collins      Cornyn      Cotton      Cramer      Crapo      Cruz      Daines      Ernst      Fischer      Graham      Grassley      Hagerty      Hawley      Hoeven      Hyde-Smith      Johnson      Kennedy      Lankford      Lee      Lummis      Manchin      Marshall      McConnell      Moran      Mullin      Paul      Peters      Ricketts      Risch      Romney      Rounds      Rubio      Schmitt      Scott (FL)      Scott (SC)      Sullivan      Thune      Tillis      Tuberville      Vance      Wicker      Young                               NOT VOTING--3       Durbin      Feinstein      Fetterman    Mr. President, it is a great moment--or a few moments  ago it was a great moment, but it continues to be. Our dear friend  Senator Patty Murray reached an amazing milestone--10,000 votes over  the course of her career in the Senate, the first woman Senator in  American history to do so.   (Applause.)   We are not supposed to clap, but every once in a while, breaking  protocol is appropriate, as it is now.   It is a remarkable accomplishment for a truly remarkable public  servant. Her accomplishments--if she had just cast 10,000 votes, that  would be pretty good, but her accomplishments go way beyond that and  often dwarf it. She was also the first woman to serve in several Senate  leadership positions: chair of the Veterans' Affairs Committee; chair  of the Budget Committee; and, of course, at the beginning of this  Congress, she made history as the first woman ever to serve as  President pro tempore of the Senate.   She is a voice the Senate and the country rely on, on some of the  biggest issues we face. When she speaks, everyone listens--Democrats,  Republicans, liberals, conservatives, Independents--because they know  that she has studied it carefully and it comes right from the heart; it  is not political calculation in any way. In issues like healthcare,  environment, labor rights, pension, childcare, there is Patty Murray as  a beacon--not just a speaker, not just a legislator, but a beacon--to  all of us.   And, let me tell you, she has been such a valued member of my  leadership team through the years, where she did so, so much, and I  relied on her for advice. I know her phone number by heart because I  call her so much.   Let's take a moment to recognize and congratulate this great person,  this great woman, this great Senator, this great friend, this great  Member of the U.S. Senate, Senator Patty Murray.   (Applause.)    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that I be  permitted to speak for 2 minutes following Senator Peters, who will  speak up to 3 minutes, prior to the scheduled rollcall vote.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there an objection?   Without objection, it is so ordered.   The Senator from Michigan.    Madam President, I would like to make two points. The  first is on this great legislation. I thank Senator Peters and the  entire HSGAC Committee--Democrats and Republicans--for moving forward.   Our firefighters are the people who protect us. We need to protect  them. Equipment has gotten more and more expensive to save their lives  and save the lives of the people they are protecting. Yet for many  smaller communities--rural, smalltown, even suburban--there is not the  money to afford  [[Page S1285]]  this equipment. So we have stepped up to the plate.   I helped author this legislation with Senator Dodd back in 2002 to  help them. We desperately need this legislation. We need it for  firefighters--both paid and volunteer--around the country. But,  particularly, as I said, in the smaller areas and the smaller  communities where they desperately need the equipment, we have to get  it done.   The second point is this: This is the second bill we have done in a  very strong bipartisan way. Our colleagues came to us with a list of  amendments. It wasn't dilatory. Some of them were difficult for us, but  we agreed to the amendments, and in turn, our colleagues voted to move  forward. This, again, is how we can run the Senate in a very good and  productive way. I hope to do that in every opportunity, where we can  come to agreement on amendments, move forward, and pass good  legislation.   This is good and needed legislation. I hope we get an overwhelming  vote for it.                                Vote on S. 870    The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading and was read  the third time.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The bill having been read the third time,  the question is, Shall the bill pass?    I ask for the yeas and nays.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there a sufficient second?   There appears to be a sufficient second.   The clerk will call the roll.   The bill clerk called the roll.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to legislative session.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to executive session to  consider Calendar No. 64.    Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to legislative session.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to consider Calendar  No. 32, S. 326.  [[Page S1286]]     Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.    I ask unanimous consent that the mandatory quorum calls  for the cloture motions filed today, April 20, be waived.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to recognize the  30th anniversary of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, and  then I will say a few words about it.    I ask unanimous consent the Senate proceed to  consideration of S. Res. 167, submitted earlier today.    I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed  to, the preamble be agreed to, and that the motions to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or  debate.    First, I want to thank Senators Cardin, Rubio, and many  others for introducing this legislation, this recognition.   The Holocaust Museum is an amazing place. I hope every American and  every citizen in the world gets to visit it. It reminds us of one of  the greatest, if not the greatest, harms ever inflicted on man, the  horrible Shoah, the Holocaust, where 6 million people, 1 million  children, died, were exterminated, were murdered.   Every time I go to the Holocaust Museum, something new strikes me.  There is so much, so many people lost. You see the faces and the  families and why they were killed--just because they were Jews. It  reminds us of two things--one, to always remember. The Hebrew word is  ``zakar,'' remember. If we remember those who died, we keep their flame  alive, and by remembering, we will also prevent future holocausts from  occurring because if we realize the horror that can occur, it will  importune men and women throughout the world and throughout this  country to prevent any occurrence like this and make sure it is  stopped.   Second, there is an increase in anti-Semitism in America and in the  world today. We must do everything we can to fight that, as we must  fight all forms of bigotry. This memorial will remind us that we can  never sweep things like this under the rug, that we must remember and  we must fight as hard as we can to snuff out anti-Semitism and all  other forms of bigotry and prevent the kind of evilness that occurred  in the Holocaust from ever occurring again.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, I have seven requests for committees to  meet during today's session of the Senate.
