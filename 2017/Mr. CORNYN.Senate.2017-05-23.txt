 Mr. President, it was quite edifying to be sitting here  listening to the Democratic leader speak this morning during the  morning remarks, expressing his concern for healthcare, rural  hospitals, and talking about his concerns about delivering healthcare  to the poor. It is indeed ironic because at a time when ObamaCare, the  Affordable Care Act, is literally in meltdown with unaffordable  premiums and deductibles, we are not seeing any help whatsoever from  our Democratic colleagues. I would suggest, rather than rail against  the President's budget, they ought to be engaged in a more constructive  process of working with us to make sure we can deliver on the promise  of affordable healthcare to all Americans.   Of course, there is the matter of the President's budget itself. I  remember that President Obama's last budget got voted on here in the  U.S. Senate. It got one vote--one vote. A President's budget is not  binding on the Congress. The Congress passes a budget resolution, both  houses, and we anticipate doing that again.   The President's budget is really a statement of the President's  priorities. Frankly, there are some things in the President's proposed  budget that I think are worthwhile--things like securing our border. At  the end of the day, it is the job of Congress, though, to pass a budget  that reflects the priorities of our country.   I think it is worth pointing out that several aspects of the  President's budget are encouraging and a welcome change from the  previous administration. For one, it balances in 10 years. I would love  to have our Democratic colleagues express some concern for the fact  that we continue to spend money we don't have and impose the burden of  repaying that money someday on future generations. To me, that is one  of the most immoral things we do in this country; we spend the money  today, and we leave the debt to our children and grandchildren to pay  that back, which they must at some point. So when the President  proposes a budget that actually balances in 10 years, I think that is a  good thing. What a welcome relief from a White House budget anchored  around overspending and growing the size of government, which we have  seen for the last 8 years.   The other thing the President's budget does is reverse the defense  sequester. This is the artificial cap we put on defense spending.   Of all the things the Federal Government does, national security is  the No. 1 job. You can't outsource that to anyone. It is our No. 1  responsibility to keep the country safe and to keep America strong.  Under the Obama administration, there was a cap put in place that  prevented increased military spending, and indeed we saw cuts to the  military of about 20 percent during the Obama years.   One thing that President Trump has done, which I find a welcome sign,  is to properly resource our military so we can better defend against  increasing threats around the world. It is simply irresponsible for us  to allow our men and women in the military to operate on slashed  budgets and outdated equipment. They can't even train and be ready for  the next fight. The best deterrent to war and the best assurance of  peace is a strong America. The President's budget reflects a better  understanding of the threat environment ahead, and for that I am  grateful.   So rather than railing against the President's budget, which he knows  will not be passed into law--because no President's budget ever becomes  law; it is a proposal of the President's priorities. As I said, there  is much to like among the President's priorities--balancing the budget,  emphasizing national security spending, and the like. Ultimately, we  will have to come up with a budget ourselves. So I find the Democratic  leader's railing against the President's budget, which he knows will  not become law as written, somewhat ironic.
