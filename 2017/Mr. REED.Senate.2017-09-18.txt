 Thank you, Mr. President. As we approach the final vote on  [[Page S5786]]  the fiscal year 2018 national defense authorization bill, I would like  to make a few closing comments.   When we began considering this bill last week, Senator McCain and I  were interested in returning to regular order and having debate and  votes on any amendment that needed a vote. We actually started off very  well.   While I disagreed with Senator Paul's amendment to sunset the current  authorization for the use of military force, I am pleased we were able  to follow regular order on his amendment and have a debate. It is my  hope that we can use this as a step to restore regular order going  forward and work together, along with Senator Paul, in drafting a new  AUMF that more precisely addresses the threats we face and resolves the  issue, which is very critical, that Senator Paul has raised; that is,  updating the AUMF.   After the Paul amendment, however, we were unable to come to an  agreement on further votes. As a result, several issues that are  important to both sides were not fully considered. On the Democratic  side, Senators Baldwin, Stabenow, and Donnelly had very important  amendments that would have ensured important protection for American  workers and that our servicemembers receive high-quality, domestically  produced equipment.   In addition, Senator Durbin had an important amendment that supports  the world-class medical research DOD conducts and has a profound impact  on the health of our servicemembers and citizens alike. Senator Warren  would have liked a discussion on the INF Treaty, and Senator Gillibrand  was interested in a full debate on protections for military personnel  who are transgender.   As I indicated, I also know there are Members on the other side of  the aisle who also had important issues they wanted to debate. I regret  we were not able to have those debates and votes.   I am pleased, however, that we are able to include several dozen  agreed-upon amendments in this bill from both Democrats and Republicans  which will strengthen the legislation. In the end, this bill represents  a strong bipartisan effort to provide the military with the resources  they need and the support they deserve.   Moving forward, more work needs to be done. It is clear we need to  find a sustainable, equitable path forward that will end sequestration  and provide the additional resources needed for our current readiness  shortfalls. I look forward to working together to continue to address  the needs of the Department and our servicemembers.   I would like to close by thanking Senator McCain in my remarks about  the NDAA for his leadership in guiding this bill through our committee  markup process and the floor. I believe this bill truly exemplifies  Senator McCain's unrivaled dedication to the men and women of our Armed  Forces. His firm hand and unwavering resolve for a bipartisan approach  were invaluable in achieving a bill that reflects the priorities of  many Members on both sides of the aisle.   Additionally, I would like to thank the committee staff who worked  tirelessly over many weeks to make this bill a reality. I thank the  majority staff director, Chris Brose, and his staff for their hard work  and commitment to a bipartisan process. I would also like to thank my  staff for their expertise and dedication to creating the best bill  possible--Jody Bennett, Carolyn Chuhta, Jon Clark, Jonathan Epstein,  Jorie Feldman, Jon Green, Creighton Greene, Ozge Guzelsu, Gary Leeling,  Kirk McConnell, Maggie McNamara, Bill Monahan, Mike Noblet, John Quirk,  Arun Seraphin, and Elizabeth King. Finally, I would like to thank the  floor staff, without whom none of this could be accomplished.   I must say, having completed a truly bipartisan process using regular  order, I am disappointed to hear that my colleagues on the other side  of the aisle would like to bring back the partisan efforts to repeal  the Affordable Care Act and its protections for people with preexisting  conditions and decimate Medicare as we know it.   We have already spent so much time this year having this fight--time  we could have spent working on a bipartisan basis to improve our health  care system and lower costs. We voted decisively in July to reject the  partisan bill. With these votes, Senators on both sides of the aisle  decided we would return to regular order and work toward bipartisan  health care solutions that could get at least 60 votes in this body.   As I have highlighted, this kind of bipartisan approach is why we  have been successful in bringing the NDAA to the floor each year, and  Senators Alexander and Murray have been doing just that with respect to  the HELP Committee. They have had four hearings over the last two  weeks, with witnesses from both parties, from Governors to health  insurance commissioners, to leaders in the industry. I have great  confidence in my colleagues and their ability to craft a bipartisan  bill to improve the ACA that a majority of Senators could support. This  is a bipartisan, inclusive process, and I should note, it is undertaken  by one of the two committees that have jurisdiction for health care.   So for my Republican colleagues to now decide, after this critical  work is already underway, that we are going to scratch those efforts  and return instead to a partisan process, in which not even Republican  Senators have had the opportunity to fully review the bill, make  changes or even get analysis of the bill, I think that process is  wrong. Let's not be fooled by the new effort. The legislation would  have the same effects as the other versions of TrumpCare we saw  rejected.   We have heard the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs  Committee will hold a hearing on the latest version of TrumpCare. This  is not the right process. It is not representative of the legislative  process.   I would urge my colleagues to reject this approach and, rather,  follow the example I think we have tried to set in NDAA--a bipartisan,  regular process, in which amendments are offered by both sides, in  which debate is undertaken, in which we come to a conclusion based on  60 votes and move forward to improve the country, particularly to  protect the men and women in the armed services.   With that, I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lankford). The Senator from Arizona.   Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, today the Senate will vote on final  passage of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018.  This is the culmination of months of bipartisan work, and it is a  product in which all Senators and all Americans can take great pride. I  want to thank, once again, my friend and colleague the Senator from  Rhode Island. His partnership on this legislation has been invaluable.   The fundamental purpose of this legislation, which has united  Senators from both sides of the aisle, is to provide our Armed Forces  what they need to do the jobs we ask of them. We, in this body, have no  higher duty than to do everything we can to support our fellow  Americans who serve and sacrifice every day to keep us safe.   This legislation does that. It keeps faith with our men and women in  uniform. It supports a national defense budget of $700 billion for  fiscal year 2018, which exceeds the administration's request by $37  billion and the defense spending caps in the Budget Control Act by $91  billion. The decision of the Committee on Armed Services to authorize  these additional resources was unanimous and bipartisan, and it is a  significant statement on the troubling state of our military today.   My friends, for too long, our Nation has asked our men and women in  uniform to do too much with far too little. Much of the blame lies with  the last administration, but we in Congress cannot escape  responsibility. Our military's job is hard enough, but we are making it  harder through continuing resolutions, unpredictable funding, and  arbitrary spending caps that we put into law 6 years ago before the  rise of ISIS, before the current crisis with North Korea, before  Russia's return to aggression on the world stage, and before so many  other dangerous developments.   We have been warned--we have been warned, my friends--that we can't  go on like this. We have been warned. Earlier this year, the Chairman  of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Joseph Dunford, warned us: ``In just  a few years if we don't change the trajectory, we will lose our  qualitative and our quantitative competitive edge, [and] the  consequences will be profound.'' The Secretary of Defense, Jim Mattis,  [[Page S5787]]  also warned us, saying: ``We are no longer managing risk; we are now  gambling.''   We are gambling, my friends. We are gambling with the lives of the  best among us, and we are now seeing the cost--the tragic but  foreseeable cost--of an overworked, strained force, with aging  equipment and not enough of it.   On June 17, seven sailors were killed when the USS Fitzgerald  collided with a container ship off the coast of Japan. On July 10, a  Marine KC-130 crash in Mississippi killed all 16 troops on board. On  August 5, an Osprey helicopter crash off the coast of Australia  resulted in the deaths of three Marines. On August 15, an Army  helicopter crashed off the coast of Hawaii, with five soldiers presumed  dead. On August 21, 10 sailors perished when the USS McCain collided  with a tanker near Singapore. On August 25, an Army Black Hawk  helicopter went down during a training mission off the coast of Yemen,  and one soldier died. Earlier this month in Nevada, two Air Force A-10  aircraft crashed into each other. Thank God the pilots safely ejected,  but the planes were lost, at a cost of over $100 million.   Just last week--just last week, as we debated this legislation--there  were additional accidents. Last Tuesday, one soldier died during  helicopter training at Fort Hood. Last Wednesday, an amphibious vehicle  explosion at Camp Pendleton injured 15 marines. Last Thursday, a  demolition accident at Fort Bragg killed another soldier and injured  seven others.   My friends, more of our men and women in uniform are now being killed  in totally avoidable training accidents and routine operations than by  our enemies in combat. Let me repeat that. More of our men and women in  uniform are now being killed in totally avoidable training accidents  and routine operations than by our enemies in combat.   Where is the outrage? Where is our sense of urgency to deal with this  problem? Congress can criticize this administration or the last  administration all we want, and there is plenty of blame to go around,  but the constitutional responsibility is to ``raise and support  Armies'' and ``provide and maintain a Navy.'' That responsibility is  ours. How can we believe that we are meeting our responsibilities when  young Americans in uniform are not receiving the necessary resources  and capabilities to perform their missions? My friends, that blame  rests with us, the Congress.   I know many of my colleagues agree. I have heard them--both  Republicans and Democrats--speak for years about the harmful effects  sequestration is having on our military and many other Federal agencies  with a national security mission. How do we explain our failure to deal  with this problem last week? We had an opportunity. This legislation  was open for amendments under regular order for an entire week. There  was an amendment offered by the Senator from Arkansas to repeal  sequestration. The amendment was written in a bipartisan way and would  have ended sequestration, not only for defense but nondefense spending  as well. We had an opportunity to tell all of our men and women in  uniform that the Senate finally was doing everything it could to  support them. We had an opportunity, and we failed. Worse than that, we  didn't even try. We couldn't even agree to vote.    It makes me so angry, but more than that it makes me sad. It breaks  my heart.   How do we explain our failure to our men and women who are serving?  How do we explain to Americans who are risking their lives for us that  we could not summon the courage to take some hard votes? How can we  explain we couldn't come together and vote together when it mattered  most? How do we explain the signal our inaction sends to all who are  serving that Congress has higher priorities than rebuilding our  military? We should be ashamed of ourselves.   For those of you who will soon vote for this National Defense  Authorization Act, which will authorize the necessary resources to  begin rebuilding our military, let me thank you; let me thank you; let  me thank you. You can be proud that you are voting for a good piece of  legislation, but this legislation is only part of the solution. We  still have no path to actually appropriate the money that we are about  to authorize. That requires a bipartisan agreement to adjust the  spending caps in the Budget Control Act.   For all of you who will join me in voting to authorize these vital  additional resources for our military, I would also urge you to join me  in demanding and passing a bipartisan agreement so that we can  appropriate those resources. This will require some hard work. It will  require some teamwork and some trust in each other. It will require  having the courage of our convictions. But in the end, it will require  much less of us than the service and sacrifice we ask every day from  our men and women in uniform, which they so dutifully provide us.   I do not want to have to call another grieving mother or father or  spouse after their loved one has perished in a mishap that might have  been prevented if Congress had done its job. Let's find a way to  appropriate the resources for our military that we will soon authorize.  Our men and women in uniform deserve no less.   Mr. President, I will suggest a short quorum call while we get these  final agreed-upon amendments on the bill at this time. It shouldn't  take more than 3 or 4 minutes.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.   The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.   Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.

Amendment No. 1032   (Purpose: To prohibit the availability of funds for retirement of E-8                              JSTARS aircraft)         At the end of subtitle D of title I, add the following:       SEC. ___. PROHIBITION ON AVAILABILITY OF FUNDS FOR RETIREMENT                     OF E-8 JSTARS AIRCRAFT.

Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I yield back my remaining time.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. All postcloture time has expired.   The amendments were ordered to be engrossed and the bill to be read a  third time.   The bill was read the third time.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill having been read the third time, the  question is, Shall it pass?    Mr. President, today I am pleased to be joined by Senators  Klobuchar, Brown, King, Franken, and Whitehouse in introducing the  Weekend Voting Act. This bill makes voting in Federal elections easier  and more accessible through one simple change: moving Election Day from  Tuesday to the following Saturday and Sunday in November of an election  year.   We know from surveys and common sense that Tuesday voting stands in  the way of greater voter participation. In 1845, Congress set Tuesday  as Election Day because it was the easiest day for farmers--then  travelling by horse and buggy--to make it to the polls in the course of  their regular Tuesday trips to bring goods to market. Tuesday voting  has no such benefit for farmers, or anyone else, in the 21st Century.  It does, however, force many Americans to choose between their workday  and family responsibilities, and participation in our democratic  process.   According to the Pew Research Center, voter turnout in the United  States regularly lags behind other developed countries, many of which  hold elections on one or more days during the weekend. According to  U.S. Census data, the most consistent reason Americans give for not  voting is that they are too busy to get away from their daily lives to  make it to the polls.   The Weekend Voting Act would give Americans the ability to vote  during times that make better sense for them. Rather than on a Tuesday,  polls would stay open during the first Saturday and Sunday after the  first Friday in November of an election year. States would retain full  autonomy to continue to offer alternatives to Election Day voting, such  as early voting or voting by mail, and States are encouraged to give  special consideration to accommodate weekend religious practices.   Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support the Weekend Voting Act  so that more Americans can take part in our democratic process by  voting at times that work for them.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I am pleased to be joined by Senators  Klobuchar, Brown, King, Franken, and Whitehouse in introducing the  Weekend Voting Act.
