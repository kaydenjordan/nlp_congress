 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be able to  complete my remarks before the start of the vote.    Mr. President, it is another day and another really bad  idea that is coming from the Democrats to fund their reckless tax-and- spending spree. It seems like, to fund this massive amount of spending,  they are trying desperately to come up with new revenue sources, so  much so that, as of yesterday, still under consideration was a tax on  unrealized gains--in other words, on income that people haven't  received yet.   Let's just put that into perspective.   If carried to its full conclusion and it became a precedent as part  of the tax policy in this country--and it never has been before--to put  it in terms for people to understand, a lot of people participate in  the 401(k) or they have some sort of retirement plan from their  employers. If there were a gain in a particular year--say that the  total value of the portfolios of assets in their retirement plans,  those 401(k)s, went up by 20 percent--they could be taxed on that 20  percent even though they haven't received the income yet.   That is what is being talked about here in terms of precedent. Never  before has that been attempted or tried or implemented in American  history, where you would actually have a tax on income before people  actually ever received the income.   Of course, if you carry that to its natural conclusion, as we all  know, markets go up and markets go down. If you had a year wherein your  total value went down by 20 percent, then what? Do you get a refund  from the Federal Government? My understanding is that they would offer  some sort of a tax credit, in a case like that, if you had a year when  you had losses.    Just think about the precedent that would establish, what that could  mean for the American people, if at some point the government literally  could tax you--tax you--on income that you hadn't received yet.   That is the latest really horrible idea which I think is being shot  down by Democrats because they recognize what a horrible idea that is.  But it is a good example of the desperate lengths to which Democrats  are trying to come up with new ways to fund this reckless tax-and- spending spree that they seem to be insistent on trying to force  through Congress. With an evenly divided Senate and evenly divided  House of Representatives, it is hard to imagine that you could do  something that radical, but this entire proposal is that radical, which  is why they are having such a hard time getting even people in their  own caucuses to agree with it.   Two years ago, Democrats introduced their original Green New Deal  resolution. While the guiding principles of the Green New Deal was  climate change and energy, Democrats didn't limit themselves to these  issues. They outlined a radical, comprehensive socialist revamping of  our society with the Federal Government inserting itself into nearly  every aspect of American life. And while Democrats haven't advanced one  all-inclusive bill to implement the Green New Deal--probably because of  the absolutely staggering pricetag for a comprehensive piece of  legislation like that--the Green New  [[Page S7397]]  Deal socialist vision has rapidly become an organizing principle of the  Democratic Party. For proof, look no further than the tax-and-spending  spree Democrats are contemplating with its massive expansion of  government and radical climate agenda.   One major problem with the Democrats is they never fully consider the  cost of their legislation, whether it is the actual dollar amount or  other costs their proposals might impose. And nowhere--nowhere--is that  more true than with the Democrats' tax-and-spending spree.   I have spent a lot of time on the floor talking about things like the  way this bill will further drive up inflation and the dangers it  imposes for economic growth. Today, I want to address some of the costs  of the bill's Green New Deal-esque energy provisions, starting with the  cost to American families.   We know some energy prices are increasing due to the rising demand  from the lows of the pandemic. Yesterday's average price for a gallon  of gas was $3.38. That is compared to an average price of $2.16 1 year  earlier. Meanwhile, natural gas prices recently hit a 7-year high, and  there are mounting concerns about supply.   Americans are paying a lot more to drive their cars, to heat their  homes, and to cook their food. The high cost of gasoline and natural  gas are two more reasons why Americans are finding that their paychecks  don't stretch as far these days.   Given the situation, you would think that finding ways to lower  energy costs would be among Democrats' top priorities right now, but  you would be wrong. Democrats' tax-and-spending spree isn't going to  lower energy prices; it is going to drive them even higher.   The new energy policies that Democrats are considering would drive up  the price of electricity, natural gas, and gasoline and subsidize  Democrats' preferred technologies with Americans' tax dollars. And the  icing on the cake is that Americans are likely to be paying higher  electric costs for possibly worse electric service.   A lot of Americans are familiar with the problems with California's  electric grid--namely, blackouts. Well, if Democrats have their way,  Americans around the country will be able to enjoy California-style  electricity; in other words, expensive and inconsistent electricity  delivery along with higher gas prices.   This is what I mean when I talk about Democrats not fully considering  the costs. Nobody--nobody--questions that clean energy is a good thing.  I have been a strong supporter--a strong supporter--of clean energy  innovation. My State of South Dakota leads the way, whether it is wind  energy, biofuel, or hydropower. Most of the energy generated in the  State of South Dakota comes from renewable sources. In 2020, 83 percent  of the electricity generated in my State of South Dakota came from  renewable sources.   But clean energy policies need to be realistic and practical for each  region of the country. We have to, for example, understand that we are  not yet at the point, innovationwise, where we can rely mostly on  intermittent renewable sources to power electric grids. We need  reliable baseload power from sources like clean natural gas and  nuclear. Additionally, forcing older electric plants to close before  the end of their remaining useful life, especially the most modern and  efficient ones, will strand those assets. Our utilities make long-term  investments, and when they can't recoup those facility investments,  they pass the costs on to consumers.    Overreaching clean energy policies that place heavy burdens on  working families are unacceptable. Wealthy Democratic politicians and  the wealthy donor class that supports them may not have to worry much  if they have to spend more on their electric bill or an extra $20 to  $25 filling up their gas tank. But that is a big deal to a family on a  budget, especially when that family is also dealing with the increased  price of food and other basics.   Thanks to inflation and other pressures on gas prices, Americans are  already having to spend a lot more money to fill their gas tanks, and  with the Democrats' tax-and-spending spree, many working families would  end up unable to fill their gas tank when they need to in a diminished  oil and gas sector. Maybe that is the goal of some of the more extreme  members of the Democratic Party, but it is an unacceptable one.   Working families are likely to have a tough time thanks to the energy  provisions in the Democrats' tax-and-spending spree, but wealthy  families should do a little better. Not only are they more likely to be  able to afford increases in the price of electricity and gas, but they  will also be able to claim a tax credit from the Federal Government if  they want to purchase an expensive electric vehicle.   Democrats' tax-and-spending spree will offer tax credits of up to  $12,500 for the purchase of an electric car or truck with the biggest  credit naturally going to those who purchase union-made vehicles.   That is right. Only electric vehicles produced at facilities under a  union-negotiated collective bargaining agreement would be eligible for  the $4,500 plus-up, which would take the credit up to $12,500. And  anyone making up to $400,000 a year will be able to claim this credit.   That is right.   Under Democrats' legislation, you could be making nearly half a  million dollars a year and still receive a substantial tax break for  the purchase of an electric car.   Meanwhile, more accessible and readily available clean energy  technologies--notably, biofuels--take a backseat in this bill.   Electric vehicles are Democrats' chosen winner in the transportation  sector, no matter how impractical they may still be for a lot of  working Americans.   Speaking of impractical, if you want an electric bike to go along  with your electric car, Democrats will also give you a tax credit for  that as well. Yes, the Democrats' bill contains a tax credit for  electric bicycles--a credit that would go to bicycles that can cost up  to $8,000.   Now, maybe it is just me, but if you can afford an $8,000 electric  bike, I am not sure you need a tax credit for it from the Federal  Government. Also, while electric bicycles may have their appeal in  urban and maybe some suburban communities, they are a completely  impractical option for most individuals in States like South Dakota.  When you live 20 miles away from the nearest grocery store, an electric  bicycle is not going to be your vehicle of choice for getting around.  And I am pretty sure that South Dakota agricultural producers will back  me up when I say that electric bicycles are not going to be much use  for getting out to check the fences in the far corners of their ranch.   However, I have got to say that tax credits for electric bicycles are  far from the most wasteful use of government money in this bill. That  honor may have to go for the new tax credit to higher education  institutions for teaching environmental justice programs. That is  right. I am sure Americans will be relieved to know that Democrats are  planning to create a new tax credit for higher education institutions-- including Ivy league schools and other well-funded universities--so  that they can teach courses on environmental justice, whatever that is.  You would think colleges that charge students tens of thousands, if not  hundreds of thousands, of dollars in tuition could perhaps afford to  fund their own environmental justice programs. But, again, I guess you  would be wrong.   Then there is the $3 billion the bill provides for tree equity--tree  equity.   Now, I support and encourage the planting of trees, and I have  introduced a straightforward bill to rapidly expand tree planting  across the country without any Federal spending. But I am fairly sure  the Federal Government cannot afford to spend $3 billion on tree  equity, especially when Democrats need to save money for their civilian  climate corps--a new government program to provide government jobs and  subsidized housing to climate activists.   There is so much more.   The word is that Democrats will soon be releasing a new version of  their tax-and-spending spree, and I can only hope that it will be less  extreme than the current version because if the bill's current Green  New Deal-esque energy provisions go into effect, Americans are going to  be looking at a future of higher energy costs, diminished energy  resources, and a weakened energy independence, not to mention a lot of  wasted taxpayer dollars.  [[Page S7398]]    Once again, it is abundantly clear that the Green New Deal is a bad  deal for American families.
