 Mr. Chairman, earlier today the House passed a  critical $8 billion disaster relief package that is intended to fund  the immediate needs for Federal disaster relief.   Similar to Hurricane Harvey, a year ago, eastern North Carolina was  devastated by Hurricane Matthew. Our State suffered $4.8 billion in  damage, including 98,000 homes and 19,000 businesses. 82,000 people  have made applications to FEMA.   Mr. Chairman, although the package passed by the House this morning  was for Hurricane Harvey relief, can you please explain how it will be  also helpful for Hurricane Matthew victims?   I would like to be able to assure my constituents that Congress will  continue to support their long-term disaster relief needs.    Mr. Chair, if the gentleman will continue to yield, as  we consider the great plight in Texas of Hurricane Harvey, I also want  to offer my sincere thanks for the outpouring of support that my State  continues to receive, that they need after the devastation of Hurricane  Matthew.   Mr. Chair, I want to thank Chairman Frelinghuysen, who has offered my  State great support, and Chairman Carter.    Mr. Chair, had I been present, I would have voted  ``yea'' on rollcall No. 445.    Mr. Chair, had I been present, I would have voted  ``yea'' on rollcall No. 445.    Mr. Chair, had I been present, I would have voted  ``yea'' on rollcall No. 445.
