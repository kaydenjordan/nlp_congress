 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the Fullerton  College men's basketball team on winning the California Community  College Athletic Association's State championship.   The Hornets beat the City College of San Francisco Rams by a score of  83-73.   The win marks the fifth time the Hornets have brought home the State  title since the school basketball team was founded in 1927.   The game was an exciting one, rounding out the team's season record  to 30-1 and concluding their 25-game win streak.   On behalf of the Fullerton community and the 45th Congressional  District, I extend my warmest congratulations to the Hornets for this  extraordinary accomplishment.   You make us all proud.                            ____________________
