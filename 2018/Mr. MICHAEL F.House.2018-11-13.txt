 DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous  consent that the gentlewoman from Pennsylvania, the Honorable Mary Gay  Scanlon, be permitted to take the oath of office today.   Her certificate of election has not arrived, but there is no contest  and no question has been raised with regard to her election.    DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I would invite all  of my Pennsylvania colleagues to come up and join me if you would like.   Mr. Speaker, as the dean of Pennsylvania's congressional delegation,  it is my great pleasure to welcome our newest colleague.   For the last 35 years, Mary Gay Scanlon has been a public interest  lawyer, working for voting rights, equitable education funding,  immigration, and criminal justice reform. She is an advocate for low- income families, children, women, veterans, and seniors.   She and I worked together on securing asylum in this country for the  internationally recognized Sudanese human rights activist Hawa Saleh,  who was imprisoned and tortured by the Sudanese Government for speaking  out against it. And I am pleased to note that Hawa is here in the House  gallery today.   Mary Gay's career reflects her deep commitment to aiding and giving  back to her community. She has worked tirelessly to help those in need  in Pennsylvania, and she now plans to continue that work at the  national level here in Congress.    Mr. Speaker, I am happy to welcome such a dedicated individual to  this body. I know we all look forward to working with her and our  colleagues in the Pennsylvania delegation to serve the Commonwealth and  this great Nation.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr.  Thompson), the senior Republican member of the delegation, for some  remarks also.    DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the  gentlewoman from Pennsylvania (Ms. Scanlon).    DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, reserving the  right to object, although I don't object, I rise today with a heavy  heart.   A few short weeks after a gunman entered the Tree of Life synagogue  building in Pittsburgh, my hometown, and took the lives of 11 innocent  people and injured 6 others, I ask the House to pause now to remember  those who were taken from us: Joyce Fienberg, Richard Gottfried, Rose  Malinger, Jerry Rabinowitz, Cecil and David Rosenthal, Bernice Simon,  Sylvan Simon, Daniel Stein, Melvin Wax, and Irving Younger. If we could  pause for a moment of silence for these people.                                time  1930    I would also like to honor the law enforcement officers, the first  responders, and the medical professionals who heroically responded to  the attack. And I continue to wish a full and speedy recovery for those  who are wounded.   The attack happened because one man had a dark hatred in his heart  for the Jewish people. But the Jewish community in Pittsburgh and the  city as a whole have proven to be stronger than hate.   I want to thank the Bipartisan Taskforce to Combat Anti-Semitism for  their support and all of the American people who have reached out with  their comforting words and support.   We all must do more to combat this hate in our neighborhoods and stop  these tragedies from happening. This resolution is just a step in the  healing process for our city and our country.   Mr. Speaker, I withdraw my reservation of objection.
