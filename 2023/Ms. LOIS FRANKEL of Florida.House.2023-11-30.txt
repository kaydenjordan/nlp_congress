 Mr. Speaker, on October 7, the deadliest  day for the Jewish people since the Holocaust, Hamas terrorists took  over 200 hostages from Israel--men, women, children, the elderly, and  the young, including dozens of IDF soldiers who Hamas has refused to  release. I want to tell you about one of them.   That beautiful young lady is Naama Levy. She is the second of four  children. She is an athlete, loves soccer, the triathlon. During her  summer in high school, she was a participant in the Hands of Peace  project in the  [[Page H6040]]  United States working toward peace between Israelis and Palestinians.   After she graduated high school, like other Israeli youth, she  completed her coursework to be an observation soldier, and she began  her military service on October 5 at the Nahal Oz base. It was 2 days  later, on October 7 at 6:32 a.m., she woke to red alerts and went into  a safe room with her friends. She then texted her mom. There is the  text:   Mom, we are in the safe room. I have never heard anything like this.   Her mother says:   What is happening, my darling?   What her mother then saw on a video loop over and over was her  daughter being dragged off by her hair by Hamas into the back of a  truck.   Her mom lives the same nightmare as the other families of the  hostages. She thinks about her every day. Where is her daughter now?  What kind of life is she living? Where does she sleep? Does she have  water? Does she have air? Is she being treated well?   Mr. Speaker, look at this young lady, just starting her life with  hopes and dreams. Let's bring her back.
