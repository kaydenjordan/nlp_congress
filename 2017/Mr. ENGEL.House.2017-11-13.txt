 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I commend Mr. Khanna for his leadership. I think it is  important that our new Members come here and really make a difference  for these important events all around the world, so I thank him.                                time  1745    Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this measure that shines a light on  the carnage and suffering that has defined the conflict in Yemen.   Mr. Speaker, I want to again thank Mr. Khanna, who has shown real  leadership on this issue. He understands the critical role Congress has  to play in our foreign policy and why it is so important that this body  take the time to talk about the civil war in Yemen and America's  involvement. The United States wields tremendous power, diplomatic,  military, and developmental, and we have an obligation to debate how  those tools are used.   We have heard about Saudi and Iranian involvement in the civil war in  Yemen. Sadly, Yemenis are caught in the crossfire. The devastation of  Yemen's infrastructure has led to 900,000 cholera cases. At least one  Yemeni child dies every 10 minutes, on average, from malnutrition,  diarrhea, or respiratory tract infections.   Last week, the Saudis intercepted a missile targeting Riyadh. In  response, the Saudi-led coalition closed all Yemeni ports of entry.  Since last week, no humanitarian assistance has been allowed to enter  Yemen. Fuel shortages are limiting access for USAID partners at a time  when more than 75 percent of Yemenis require some level of assistance,  including 6.8 million people entirely reliant on food aid. The people  of Yemen are facing a very dire situation.   Let's be clear, neither military action nor food aid will solve the  conflict in Yemen. A political solution is essential for moving Yemen  towards stability. That will require some compromise, an exit strategy  for the Yemeni Government's Gulf partners, and a real commitment by the  international community to prevent Iranian weapons from getting into  Yemen.   So what does all this mean for America's role?   As this resolution notes, the United States provides midair refueling  for the Saudi-led coalition and participates in intelligence  cooperation.   Today's debate reminds us that the United States is engaged with  partners around the world under a range of authorities. Some of these  activities are covered by a current Authorization for Use of Military  Force--AUMF--some are not.   In my view, we should have more clarity about the way we use American  military might not just in Yemen, but around the world. After all, it  is Congress' responsibility to declare war or to limit a President's  authority to wage war when necessary.   I have said for years that we should sunset the 2001 AUMF. We voted  then to give the President authorization to go after the people and  groups that attacked on 9/11. We never intended it to be a blank check.  Today, we face new threats, threats unrelated to the terrorists who  attacked my hometown, New York City, on September 11.   We owe it to our men and women in uniform to have a thorough and  honest debate before we send them into harm's way, to stand in this  body and say ``yes'' or ``no'' before we ask them to put their lives on  the line.   This measure helps to move that debate forward. I am glad to support  it, and I urge all Members to do the same.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Khanna for his leadership.
