 Mr. Speaker, my husband and I have raised  three hungry boys. I know how difficult and expensive it can be. Our  government should not be making it any harder.   Yet, Republicans in this Chamber are working overtime to make it  harder for families to receive SNAP benefits, putting more than 14  million children at risk of hunger.   Republicans talk about trusting parents and protecting our kids only  when it fits their agenda, because when it comes to trusting parents to  use programs like SNAP to feed their children, this Republican majority  pushes for more regulation, less trust. We have seen this play out  firsthand.   Under the last Congress, Democrats, our majority, expanded the child  tax credit and cut child poverty in half. When it tragically ended, and  every Republican refused to restore it, children plunged back into  poverty.   As the Speaker's self-inflicted chaos inches us closer to a Federal  budget deadline, it is clear: Our children are suffering because of the  antics and extremism of the Republican majority.   Mr. Speaker, I urge this House majority to rethink their chaos,  protect SNAP benefits, and lift all of our children out of poverty.                            ____________________
