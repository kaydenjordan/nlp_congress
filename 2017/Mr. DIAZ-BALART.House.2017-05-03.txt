 Mr. Speaker, before I speak about the specifics of  this portion of the bill, I thank Chairman Frelinghuysen. He has put  countless hours to put this remarkable legislation together. I think he  must be commended. I also thank Ranking Member Lowey as well as the  ranking member of the subcommittee, Mr. Price.   The American people expect us to get our job done, to fulfill our  constitutional responsibility. That is precisely what we are doing  today. The THUD portion of this agreement provides $57.7 billion in  budget authority, which, by the way, is $5.5 billion below the budget  request.   The transportation and housing programs in this bill support critical  infrastructure, technologies, and housing opportunities that make a  positive difference in the day-to-day lives of so many of our  constituents.   This bill makes critical investments in our air traffic control  system to make sure that continues to be the world leader in safety in  the entire world.                                time  1530    We fund surface transportation investments authorized by the FAST Act  to ensure that we improve and expand highways and bridges that are so  vital to our national economy. And this bill also provides permanent  regulatory relief from two overly burdensome additions to the hours-of- service restart rule made by the previous administration.   Mr. Speaker, this bill also provides $928 million in disaster  assistance for communities devastated by storms and floods. This  includes recovery assistance to Florida following the impact caused by  Hurricane Matthew last October.   Mr. Speaker, we listened to the members of the committee and to the  Members of Congress, and we did our best to address their highest  priorities, while keeping in mind that our job is to protect the  American taxpayer and cut ineffective, redundant programs. We are proud  of this bill.   I thank the chairman for his hard work.
