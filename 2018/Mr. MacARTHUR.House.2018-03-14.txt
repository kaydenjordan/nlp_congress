 Mr. Speaker, I thought we were here to debate a rule  on the Regulation A+ Improvement Act. As much as I also want to do  things regarding the Dreamers, the issue at hand is a bill that is  meant to help those who are creating jobs.   I want to thank my cosponsors, Representatives Sinema and Gottheimer,  for cosponsoring the bill. Any time we can do a bill together on a  bipartisan basis, I think it is a better bill.                                time  1245    The purpose of this bill is pretty simple. Seven out of ten jobs in  this country, new jobs, come from the 28 million small businesses. I  used to run one of those businesses and grew it to be a larger national  business, and I know from experience that you have to have capital to  grow businesses.   If we help companies raise capital, then we help them create jobs.  Biopharmaceutical companies in my State of New Jersey are perfect  examples. These are growing companies. They are capital intensive. They  need help. The government can't do everything, but the Federal  Government can play a role in helping these companies access capital,  and that is what this bill is about.   Regulation A+ of the 1933 Securities Act, the very first securities  law in this country, Federal law, allowed companies to offer shares on  public exchanges. It required that any company that engaged in  interstate commerce had to register with the SEC.   They made two exceptions: Regulation A+, which was for Main Street  investors, but it put a cap on the amount that could be offered; and  Regulation D, which allowed an unlimited offering to companies that  were only selling to accredited investors. It has been really helpful  in creating jobs and giving companies access to capital.   This bill is a modest improvement. Over time, Regulation A+ has gone  from a small limit to, most recently, a $50 million limit under the  JOBS Act of a few years ago, and it is time to raise that limit again.   There is good precedent for this. The JOBS Act actually required that  the SEC raise it within 2 years of 2015, when the JOBS Act took effect,  or they had to explain to Congress why they didn't. Well, they haven't.  They haven't raised it.   We have an interest in making sure that we help our companies in this  country create new jobs, and so this bill would raise that limit from  $50 million to $75 million and allow companies to make offerings to  Main Street investors, everyday people trying to find good companies so  they can build a future for their families.   Mr. Speaker, this bill has been through committee markup. It was open  to amendments. It is a bipartisan bill. It has gone through the Rules  Committee. It is in order for this bill to move to the floor, and I  urge that the rule be passed.
