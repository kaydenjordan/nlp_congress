 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the life of  Wanda Riddle of Irving, Texas, who passed on August 5, 2021. She was a  great friend and faithful supporter of our community for over 35 years.   Wanda was known as the mayor of south Irving and had a heart for  public service. We have been fortunate to hear stories from her family  over the past few weeks, which painted a picture of her life.   Wanda and her late husband, Jim, started a family and raised their  sons Rick, Ron, and Rod in Irving. They left a lasting impact on their  community through the Jim and Wanda Riddle Memorial Scholarship, which  is set to award a student-athlete from Nimitz High School a $1,000  scholarship annually.   Wanda's passing was a great loss for Irving and everyone who had the  pleasure of knowing her. Our community would not be the same without  Wanda's guidance, friendship, and support.   May God continue to bless the community and the Riddle family at this  difficult time.                            ____________________
