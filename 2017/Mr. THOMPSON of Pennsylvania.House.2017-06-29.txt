 Mr. Speaker, yesterday I introduced a  resolution with Congresswoman Niki Tsongas to designate July as Parks  and Recreation Month. It is a fitting time to celebrate our Federal,  State, and local parks and recreation systems as so many start this  summer season by visiting these facilities that are available within  our communities or even a short commute.   Mr. Speaker, H. Res. 406 recognizes the important role that public  parks, recreation facilities, and activities plays in the lives of  Americans and the  [[Page H5300]]  contributions of employees and volunteers who work daily to maintain  public parks across the Nation.   As a lifelong resident of rural Pennsylvania and an avid outdoorsman,  I strongly support our Nation's parks and recreation facilities. Our  parks provide countless recreational and educational opportunities for  individuals and families to engage in the outdoors.   This resolution simply recognizes and supports Parks and Recreation  Month and the many benefits, including health benefits, that a healthy  active lifestyle contributes in our park settings that is provided to  all Americans.    Our parks generate opportunities for people to come together and  experience a sense of community. They pay dividends to communities by  attracting businesses and jobs and increasing housing values.   In the United States, public park operations and capital spending  generates nearly $140 million in economic activity annually.   Ninety percent of people in the United States agree that public park  recreation activities and facilities are important government services,  a figure that displays a base of support that spans across all people  in the country regardless of race, income, gender, or political party  affiliation.   Nearly 75 percent of Americans agree that it is important to ensure  all members of their community have equitable access to public parks  and recreation facilities. The most economically sound communities are  those with ample and healthy public parks and recreation facilities and  activities. In fact, a key factor in business expansion and location  decisions is the quality of life for employees, with a premium placed  on adequate and accessible public parks and open space.   Mr. Speaker, public parks and recreation facilities foster a variety  of activity that also contribute to a healthier society. People who use  public parks and open spaces are three times more likely to achieve  recommended levels of physical activity than nonusers.   Americans living within a 10-minute walk of a park have a higher  level of physical activity and lower rates of obesity.   Recreation programs at public parks provide children with a safe  place to play, access to healthy foods, opportunities to be physically  active, and enrichment facilities that help prevent at-risk behavior  such as drug abuse and gang involvement.   Mr. Speaker, as our Nation celebrates Independence Day next week,  scores of Americans will visit public parks and recreation facilities  to spend time outdoors with family, friends, and neighbors. We are  blessed with beautiful outdoor facilities. I wish everyone a safe and  happy Fourth of July. Get out and enjoy the parks in your area.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, today this House welcomes  the winners of the Congressional Art Competition to the Nation's  Capital. Students from all over the country have traveled to Washington  to proudly display their works of art in the tunnel to the Capitol for  the next year.   The Congressional Institute hosts the nationwide competition each  year to showcase and inspire the artistic talent of high school  students from each congressional district. I am proud of the 37  students from my district who submitted entries.   I am thrilled to welcome our first-place winner, Cassy Lester of  Reynoldsville, for her acrylic painting titled ``Chocolate Lab.'' Cassy  attends Jeff Tech, and it is an honor to recognize a career and  technical education student as our winner this year.   She was honored with her fellow winners from the States across the  Nation at this afternoon's luncheon, and earlier today, I was able to  give Cassy and her family a tour of the Capitol.   Congratulations to Cassy and all of this year's winners. We are  grateful to have your art brighten the walls of the tunnel of this  Capitol for the year ahead.                            ____________________
