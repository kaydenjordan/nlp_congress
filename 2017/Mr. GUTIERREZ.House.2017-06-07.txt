 Mr. Speaker, we waste a lot of time in the House  Judiciary Committee passing bills we have already passed year after  year that go nowhere. But now evidence is growing that our elections  were interfered with by a foreign adversary, evidence that the  President and Attorney General have been less than truthful about their  meetings and relationship with this foreign adversary. And other  committees in this body and the Senate and at the Justice Department  have launched investigations into the behavior and truthfulness of the  President, his subordinates, his family; but from the House Judiciary  Committee, we have heard exactly nothing, not a peep, not a hearing or  a subpoena, nada, zip, nothing. Just crickets.   When I joined the Judiciary Committee, I remember hearing something  about how the committee has jurisdiction over the enforcement of laws,  the courts, the conduct of the executive branch, especially when it  comes to law enforcement agencies like the FBI, Justice Department,  activities that may or may not be criminal.   And guess what. I was right. You need look no further than the  committee's website, where it proudly proclaims: ``The committee's  weighty agenda has frequently placed it in a central role in American  politics, most notably during its consideration of impeachment charges  against Presidents of the United States in both 1974 and 1998.''   So with all due respect to the Intelligence Committee, the Oversight  Committee, and our colleagues in the Senate, it is the Judiciary  Committee in the House where impeachment begins. We are like the grand  jury of the House of Representatives when it comes to impeachment.   Robert Mueller, the former FBI Director investigating the President,  will not be able to indict him while he is President no matter what he  uncovers. Most legal scholars argue a sitting President cannot be  indicted in criminal court.   So it is the Judiciary Committee that will bring charges if there is  evidence of ``Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and  Misdemeanors,'' as provided in Article II, Section 4 of the  Constitution.   But here we are with evidence that the Attorney General lied to a  committee of Congress about his contacts with senior Russian officials  and lied on his security clearance application about contacts with  Russian officials who are suspected by our government of being covert  espionage operatives, with evidence that hacking and other activities,  in fact, took place directed by Russia. And nothing from the Judiciary  Committee.   The Attorney General publicly recused himself from any matters at the  Justice Department related to the investigation of Russia contacts, but  the Attorney General played a role in the firing of FBI Director James  Comey. And we know now, because the President said so, that the firing  of Comey, the FBI Director that was investigating him, was done because  the  [[Page H4653]]  President said he was ``under great pressure'' from the Russia  investigation. And still nothing from the Judiciary Committee.   Now, let's go back to those two dates when the Judiciary Committee  says we played a central role in American politics. In 1974, we had a  criminal conspiracy that involved tampering with elections that went  all the way to the Oval Office. It involved firing senior Justice  Department officials who were part of the investigation. They asked the  intelligence community to discredit those investigations in 1974. And  there were secretly recorded conversations.   Sound familiar?   President Nixon soon resigned because he knew what was coming.   In 1998, the issue of whether the President of the United States had  lied to a grand jury about an extramarital sexual encounter with a  consenting adult who was a subordinate, that is what that was about.  House Judiciary Chairman Henry Hyde of the great State of Illinois,  who, as it turned out, knew a thing or two about extramarital sexual  encounters with consenting adults, passed four Articles of Impeachment,  along an almost exclusively party-line vote. An impeachment trial was  held in the Senate, which became an epic embarrassment to the  Republican Party and to this body. But now, given all of the evidence  of electoral tampering, the apparent efforts to cover it up, the  actions of the President and the Attorney General to deflect and derail  investigations, that, to me and to others, appears to be attempts at or  actual obstruction of justice.   From the committee of jurisdiction that is supposed to be in charge  and taking action, what do we have? Not a peep, not a hearing, not a  subpoena, nada, zip, nothing. Just crickets.   Mr. Speaker, that has got to change, and I suspect it will, because  it has to. The Constitution says it has to.   Judiciary Committee, it is time to act and fulfill your  constitutional responsibilities.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I will not mince words. Anyone who votes  for this bill is voting to support and implement Donald Trump's views  on immigration, his desire to militarize our southern border, and his  fantasy of a mass deportation force. You cannot spin it any other way.    If we want to lower the standards for screening and hiring CBP  officers, eliminate checks that could help weed out candidates with  criminal histories or criminal intentions, and water down the integrity  of this important national security source, this bill is for you.   But if you care about border security and the integrity of the  officers, you should join me in voting against the bill.   To me and a lot of other people watching this debate, this is about  something else. Remember that man descending the golden escalators at  Trump Tower announcing his campaign for President by saying Mexicans  who come to the U.S. are rapists, drug dealers, and murderers? Remember  him? Do you want to buy into his vision of immigrants as a brown horde  intent on doing America harm?   If you are onboard with this, you are also onboard with building a  wall; onboard with billions to be spent on deporting moms and dads who  have lived here for decades; going after DREAMers as the Trump  administration is doing today, deporting DREAMers from the United  States of America. Where do you want to draw the line on the Trump  deportation agenda? I say draw the line right here, right now, and  don't give another inch. There are many ways to secure the Nation, but  watering down the hiring standards of our men and women in uniform  should not be one of them. Let's secure the border. Let's have them  have the same test at the border that you have a DEA agent, FBI agent,  Secret Service agent. What are we going to do? Not have them take  polygraph tests? That is going to make America safe. I doubt it.
