 Mr. Chair, I thank our committee chair,  and I am happy to rise in strong support of the section of this bill  with which I have had the most to do--namely, appropriating for the  Departments of Transportation and Housing and Urban Development for the  next fiscal year. It will make vital investments on behalf of the  American people.   I thank my partner, Mario Diaz-Balart, who formerly was chairman of  this subcommittee, for his continuing cooperation and his collaborative  approach.   Of course, I also want to express appreciation for our full committee  chair, Mrs. Lowey, and for our ranking member, Ms. Granger, for their  cooperative approach to the kind of collaboration that inevitably must  go into these appropriations bills.   I am pleased to report also that, in serving the interests of Members  of this body, we were able to accommodate 90 percent of the Member  requests from both sides of the aisle.   Division E of the measure is what we are talking about, and that is  the so-called T-HUD section. It seriously invests in America's  infrastructure. It makes transportation and housing safer. It  demonstrates our commitment to the most vulnerable among us. It  mitigates and responds to the impacts of climate change.   Our bill includes $75.8 billion in discretionary funding. That is an  increase of $4.7 billion over the 2019-enacted level and a $17.3  billion increase above the President's totally inadequate budget  request.   Mr. Chair, our Nation is in the midst of an affordable housing  crisis. This bill dedicates new resources to address it. Section 8  vouchers, for example, are fully renewed. We increased funding for the  HOME Program by $500 million and provide the Community Development  Block Grant program with $300 million above last year's level. The HOME  funding alone translates into more than 30,000 additional units of  affordable housing.   Our renewed focus on housing and community development does not come  at the expense of vital transportation programs. On the contrary, the  bill includes $1 billion for BUILD grants, formerly called TIGER  grants.   We provide more than $3 billion in additional discretionary resources  above the FAST Act authorization for highways, transit, and aviation  projects. This funding will benefit every State and territory in the  Nation. We also robustly fund Amtrak, competitive rail grant programs,  and port and maritime infrastructure.   Along with these investments, our bill reflects a renewed commitment  to safety. A diverse list of hazards, including rising accident rates  on our Nation's highways, the high-profile MAX 8 airline crashes, and  lead and carbon monoxide hazards in federally assisted housing,  requires us to redouble our efforts. We do that in this bill by  providing new resources at several points to meet these problems head- on.                                time  1600    We also prioritize assistance for vulnerable populations. Nearly $240  million is provided for construction of new housing units for the  elderly and for people with disabilities. Programs serving veterans,  the homeless, people with HIV/AIDS, domestic violence survivors, and  youth aging out of foster care are robustly funded, including resources  for new vouchers.   Critically, the bill prohibits HUD from repealing the equal access  rule that protects LGBTQ people. It also prohibits the department from  moving forward with its particularly heartless proposal regarding  mixed-status families in Federally assisted housing, which would result  in the expulsion of tens of thousands of children whose immigration  status is perfectly legal.   Finally, I am proud that this legislation lays the groundwork to  fully integrate resiliency principles not only in disaster recovery but  in the full range of Federal programs under the bill's jurisdiction.  For example, it requires HUD grantees to consider storm and hazard  mitigation as part of their planning process.   So, in closing, Mr. Chairman, this year's T-HUD bill makes forward  looking investments in our housing and transportation infrastructure  while ensuring concerted attention to safety, to the needs of the most  vulnerable, and to resilience. This bill, I am convinced, will benefit  all American communities, urban and rural, and it lays the foundation  for economic growth and opportunity.   Mr. Chairman, I urge support for the legislation.
