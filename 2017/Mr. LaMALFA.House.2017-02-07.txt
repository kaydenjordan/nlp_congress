 Mr. Speaker, thank you to my colleague from Wyoming for  the time and ability to weigh in on this.   Today, I rise in support of the measure for congressional disapproval  under the Congressional Review Act for disapproving of the BLM's 2.0  rule.   It is another midnight regulation passed in the final days of the  previous administration which undercuts the resource management  planning process on public lands by stripping local community input and  centralizing, again, in Washington, D.C., the decisionmaking.   California holds some of the largest amounts of public land in the  U.S. The Federal Government has approximately 46 percent of the total  land in California, amounting to about 46 million acres. BLM oversees  about 15 million acres of those public lands, or about 15 percent of  the State's total land mass.   The abundance of natural resources and diversity of landscapes within  California creates unique challenges for BLM to even fulfill its  multiple-use mandate. It is essential that development of these  resource management plans include close coordination with local, State,  and tribal governments--the people who actually grew up and know those  lands the best for all of the potential these lands could bring,  whether it is for development of potential energy or timber management.  Whatever those ideas are that they would have, let the locals have the  input on it. These decisions need to be made with that local input so  that everyone's voice is heard.                                time  1415    In strong rural areas like my own, the First District of California,  close coordination between the Federal Government and local groups is  vital to have good decisions be made regarding public land management.  Unfortunately, what we have is nonmanagement, and we suffer for that  each summer and fall with a forestry that is not managed and the  inability to have an economic opportunity for those people in those  areas.   The 2.0 rule does just the opposite with that collaboration. It  strengthens BLM's power once again in Washington, marginalizing Western  counties and districts, eliminating their ability to coordinate or  challenge BLM's proposed plans in an open setting.   Under the pretext of climate change and landscape scale management,  the agency's rule undermines federalism and allows for the  implementation of a previous era environmental agenda. No wonder Modoc  County, in my own district, as well as other counties from Western  States have sued BLM for its failure to properly engage and coordinate  with the public and fulfill what the law requires for the BLM in  managing these lands.    It is time to put an end to the previous  administration's legacy to shut out local input by forcing through a  rule abrogating for public lands decisions based on unelected  bureaucrats in D.C.   Mr. Speaker, again, I thank my colleague for yielding me time, and I  ask for support of this measure.
