 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, yesterday, Democrats continued making  great progress toward finalizing President Biden's Build Back Better  plan.   The challenges American families and workers are facing today are  enormous, and President Biden's agenda is the remedy to much of their  hardships. It is just what the American people want and what they need,  and it is exactly why we need to focus on getting the job done to  finalize and pass this legislation and deliver help for the American  people.   Last night, I held another round of talks going past midnight with a  number of my colleagues as we approach final agreement--talks with the  White House, the Speaker, my Senate colleagues and chairs, and Members  of the House. We continue to make very good progress each day. Passing  such transformative legislation is not easy, but the long hours we are  putting into it will be well worth it for the American people.   Over the last 24 hours, the hard work has yielded important new  development. Yesterday, I announced the Democrats had reached an  agreement to include provisions in Build Back Better that will lower  prescription drug prices for seniors and for American families. This is  a big deal.   For years, skyrocketing costs of prescription drugs have plagued  millions of seniors and American families to the point that Americans  spend far more on prescription drugs per capita than other wealthy  nations. It is one of the largest out-of-pocket medical expenses that  families have and it has gotten worse over the last few years.   For too many Americans, all it takes is a sudden serious illness and  you can find yourself spending hundreds, if not thousands, and several  thousands of dollars per year just to afford things like insulin or  vitally needed cancer treatments. It is profoundly unfair and wholly  un-American.   Imagine the strain you can face if someone--you or a loved one--is  ill and you can't afford the medicine. You see them, their condition  getting worse and worse. I can't think of things that are worse than  that, though I guess there may be a few.   Yesterday, we took a large step forward in helping alleviate that  problem. For the first time ever, Medicare will be empowered to  directly negotiate prices in Part B and Part D. This will directly  reduce out-of-pocket drug spending for millions of patients every time  they visit a pharmacy or a doctor.   Our agreement does other things as well. It will cap out-of-pocket  spending at $2,000 per year, ending the dilemma I just spoke about,  where a life-changing diagnosis could mean thousands upon thousands of  dollars in new expenses that an individual can't afford.   This agreement will lower insulin prices so that Americans with  diabetes don't pay more than $35 per month for their insulin. Let me  repeat that because it is amazing how the cost of insulin used to be so  reasonable, then skyrocketed over the last few years with very little  reasonable, justifiable explanation. This agreement will lower insulin  prices so that Americans with diabetes don't pay more than $35 per  month for their insulin.   And it will reform the pharmaceutical industry to stop price gouging  and make sure our country's drug pricing system benefits patients, not  corporations.   It is not everything all of us wanted, but it is a major, major step  in the right direction as we work to help the American people afford  their better prescription drugs. We are going to keep working to make  it even better, but this is a really good start and a major, major  announcement.   I want to thank all my colleagues who had a hand in putting this  agreement together: Senator Wyden, Senator Klobuchar, Senator Murphy,  Senator Cortez Masto, Senator Bennet, and Senator Kelly. I also want to  sincerely thank Senator Sinema for working with us to reach this  agreement.   We are going to build on this success as we continue making progress  on the rest of Build Back Better. We are close. We are determined. We  are confident that we will succeed in rewarding the trust that the  American people have placed in us.    I vote no.   The VICE PRESIDENT. On this vote, the yeas are 50, the nays are 49.   Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn not having voted  in the affirmative, the motion is not agreed to.   The motion was rejected.                             Motion to Reconsider     Madam President, I enter a motion to reconsider the  failed cloture vote.   The VICE PRESIDENT. The motion is entered.                            ____________________     Madam President, pursuant to S. Res. 27, the Committee  on the Judiciary being tied on the question of reporting, I move to  discharge the Committee on the Judiciary from further consideration of  Jennifer Sung, of Oregon, to be United States Circuit Judge for the  Ninth Circuit.   The VICE PRESIDENT. Under the provisions of S. Res. 27, there will  now be up to 4 hours of debate on the motion, equally divided between  the two leaders, or their designees, with no motions, points of order,  or amendments in order.    I ask for the yeas and nays.   The VICE PRESIDENT. Is there a sufficient second?   There appears to be a sufficient second.   The yeas and nays are ordered.    Madam President, for the information of the Senate, we  expect to vote to discharge the nomination to occur following the votes  that are scheduled to begin at 5:15 tonight. Therefore, Senators should  expect three rollcall votes at 5:15 p.m. These votes will be on the  confirmation of the Prieto and Nayak nominations and on the motion to  discharge the Sung nomination.                   John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act    Madam President, in reference to what just occurred on the floor in  terms of voting rights, this is a low, low point in the history of this  body. A few moments ago, Senate Republicans, for the fourth time this  year, were presented with a simple question: Will they vote in favor of  starting debate--merely a debate--on protecting voting rights in this  country?   In today's case, they would join Democrats in proceeding to the John  Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, which would reinstate longstanding  and widely embraced Federal protections on the right to vote.   With just one exception, Republicans once again obstructed the Senate  from beginning its process. Given the chance to debate in what is  supposed to be the world's greatest deliberative body, Republicans  walked away.   Today's obstruction was only the latest in a series of disturbing  turns for the Republican Party. For over a half a century, the policies  of the Voting Rights Act have commanded bipartisan support in this  Chamber. It has been reauthorized five times, including by Presidents  Nixon, Reagan, and Bush. Many of my Republican colleagues in office  today have worked in the past to improve and approve preclearance  provisions similar to the ones contained in today's proposal.   It was good enough for Republicans back then; it should have been  good enough for them today. But after today's vote, it is clear that  the modern Republican Party has turned its back on protecting voting  rights. The party of Lincoln is becoming the party of the Big Lie.   Democrats have laid out the facts for months: we are witnessing at  the State level the greatest assault on voting rights since the era of  segregation. Before our very eyes, the heirs of Jim Crow are weakening  the foundations of our democracy.   And by blocking debate today, Senate Republicans are implicitly  endorsing these partisan actions to suppress the vote and unravel our  democracy.   We have said all year long that if there is anything worth the  Senate's attention, it is protecting our democracy. We have tried for  months to get Republicans to agree. We have lobbied Republicans  privately. We have gone through regular order. We have attempted to  debate them on the floor.   We have presented reasonable, commonsense proposals in June, August,  October, and now in November. Each  [[Page S7702]]  time, I personally promised my Republican colleagues they would have  ample opportunities to voice their concerns, offer germane amendments,  and make changes to our proposal.   At no point did we ever ask them to vote for our legislation. We have  simply been trying to get our Republican friends to start debating,  just as the Senate was intended to do.   On the floor, off the floor, we held public hearings, group  discussions with Senators and one-on-one meetings with the other side  to try and win some support. Senators Manchin, Kaine, Tester, King,  Durbin, Klobuchar, Leahy, and more have all met with Republicans to  initiate a dialogue. And at every turn, we have been met with  resistance.   The sole exception in 10 months has been our colleague, the Senator  from Alaska, who voted in favor of advancing today's legislation.  Today, I thank her for working with us in good faith on this bill.   But where is the rest of the party of Lincoln? Down to the last  Member, the rest of the Republican conference has refused to engage,  refused to debate, and even refused to acknowledge that our country  faces a serious threat to democracy.   Madam President, the Senate is better than this. A simple look at our  history shows we are better than this. The same institution that passed  civil rights legislation, the New Deal, the Great Society, and the  bills of Reconstruction should be more than capable of defending voting  rights in the modern era.   But, as anyone who has been here more than a few years knows, the  gears of the Senate have ossified over the years. The filibuster is  used far more today than ever before--by some measures, 10 times as  much compared to decades past. Some might wonder if any of the great  accomplishments of the past would have a chance of passage today. Would  the Social Security Act pass the modern Senate? What about the Medicare  and Medicaid acts? What about the Civil Rights Act of 1964? We sure  hope they would, but it is difficult to see with the way this Chamber  works today.   As I said a few weeks ago, I believe the Senate needs to be restored  to its rightful status as the world's greatest deliberative body. It  has earned that title precisely because, yes, debate is the central  feature of this body, but at the end of the day, so is governing, and  so is taking action when needed once the debate has run its due course.   This is an old, old fight in this Chamber. Over 100 years ago, the  great Senator of Massachusetts, Henry Cabot Lodge, said: ``To vote  without debating is perilous, but to debate and never vote is  imbecile.'' Imbecile. ``To vote without debating is perilous, but to  debate and never vote is imbecile.'' We should heed those words today  and explore whatever path we have to restore the Senate so it does what  its Framers intended: debate, deliberate, compromise, and vote.   We can't be satisfied in this Chamber with thinking that democracy  will always win out in the end if we aren't willing to put in the work  to defend it. It will require constant vigilance to keep democracy  alive in the 21st century.   Madam President, just because Republicans will not join us doesn't  mean Democrats will stop fighting. This is too important. We will  continue to fight for voting rights and find an alternative path  forward, even if it means going at it alone, to defend the most  fundamental liberty we have as citizens.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, before we adjourn this evening, in a few  moments, I will move to confirm Mr. Tom Nides as the next Ambassador to  Israel.   I am glad the Republican hold on Mr. Nides has been lifted, and we  will have an Ambassador in Israel to help maintain and strengthen the  U.S.-Israel relationship.   Mr. Nides, as I have known him for many years, is just the right fit.  He is a hard-working man. He is a bright man. He has tremendous  experience, and he cares very much about strengthening the U.S.-Israel  relationship. So this will be a good day for that relationship because  we are going to confirm him very, very shortly.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the  consideration of the following nomination: Calendar No. 452, Thomas R.  Nides, of Minnesota, to be the Ambassador Extraordinary and  Plenipotentiary of the United States of America to the State of Israel,  and that the Senate vote on the nomination without intervening action  or debate.    I ask unanimous consent that the motion to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the  [[Page S7715]]  table, all without intervening action or debate; that no further  motions be in order to the nomination; that any statements related to  the nomination be printed in the Record; and that the President be  immediately notified of the Senate's action.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  consider the following nominations en bloc: Calendar Nos. 428 and 443;  that the Senate vote on the nominations en bloc without intervening  action or debate; that the motions to reconsider be considered made and  laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate; that any  statements related to the nominations be printed in the Record; and  that the President be immediately notified of the Senate's action.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to legislative session and be in a period of morning business,  with Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the consideration of S. Res. 439, submitted earlier today.    I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed  to, the preamble be agreed to, and that the motions to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or  debate.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the immediate consideration of S. Con. Res. 19.    I ask unanimous consent that the concurrent resolution  be agreed to and the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid  upon the table with no intervening action or debate.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 10 a.m.,  Thursday, November 4; that following the prayer and the pledge, the  morning hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved  to date, the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later  in the day, and morning business be closed; that upon the conclusion of  morning business, the Senate proceed to executive session to resume  consideration of the Santos nomination; further, that notwithstanding  rule XXII, at 11 a.m. the Senate proceed to the consideration of  Executive Calendar No. 352, Michael Lee Connor, of Colorado, to be an  Assistant Secretary of the Army, and the Senate vote on the  confirmation of the nomination; that upon disposition of the Connor  nomination, the cloture motion on the Santos nomination ripen, and that  if cloture is invoked, the vote on the confirmation be at 1:45 p.m.;  finally, that if any of the nominations are confirmed during Thursday's  session, the motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the  table and the President be immediately notified of the Senate's action.    Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned  under the previous order.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 8:09 p.m., adjourned until  Thursday, November 4, 2021, at 10 a.m.                            ____________________
