 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that when the House  adjourns today, it adjourn to meet on Monday next, when it shall  convene at noon for morning-hour debate and 2 p.m. for legislative  business.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a landmark event  in our Nation's military history, the 83rd anniversary of the  groundbreaking of Fort Leonard Wood in Pulaski County, Missouri.   Fort Leonard Wood stands as a symbol of American excellence and  dedication. The base's rich history is marked from its early beginnings  where it played a crucial role during World War II, serving as a  training facility for more than 300,000 soldiers.   Today, Fort Leonard Wood continues the level of excellence displayed  in those beginnings as it has become a cornerstone of our military's  infrastructure, training more than 80,000 personnel each year.   This facility's unique capability to train every branch of our  military demonstrates its versatility and importance in our national  defense.   I urge all my colleagues to support this resolution and to recognize  the 83rd anniversary of the groundbreaking of Fort Leonard Wood,  Missouri.                            ____________________
