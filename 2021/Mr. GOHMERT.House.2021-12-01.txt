 Madam Speaker, I appreciate Mrs. Cammack having this  Special Order.   Madam Speaker, we ought to be concerned about the most vulnerable  among us. Most Americans believe in God, a Heavenly Father. Is it hard  to imagine that it would be extremely important to such a Heavenly  Father that we protect the lives that are most vulnerable, most  innocent, particularly? Could there be anybody more innocent, more  vulnerable, than a child that is still in the womb?   I met Ramona Trevino some years back, and she had been a director of  Planned Parenthood, I believe, in Sherman, Texas. She became shocked,  having a teenaged daughter, that they were taught that they should come  between a daughter and her mother.   Earlier, when they had directors' meetings of other Planned  Parenthood facilities, the number they were most interested in is how  many girls you are getting on the pill and how early in age. The  earlier, the better, because they are more likely to forget to take the  pill and get pregnant, and then they would get to destroy the life of  an unborn child. That is something that if there is a Heavenly Father,  as I know there is, he would have to be very upset with us for allowing  that to happen.
