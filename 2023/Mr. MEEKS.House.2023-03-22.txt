 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman and his staff for working  collectively on this bipartisan bill at this very important time.  Clearly, making sure that we are working collectively together with one  voice on this serious issue is of utmost importance to all of us in the  United States of America.   The Biden administration, in coordination with Australia and the  U.K., recently formalized the trilateral security partnership known as  AUKUS, which aims to strengthen shared defense priorities in the Indo- Pacific. This new security framework represents an important step  forward to the United States and the Indo-Pacific, and for  strengthening our shared capabilities in the strategic competition  defining our world today and for years to come.   Within this broader AUKUS agreement, Pillar 2 advances military  capabilities with the intent of developing and enhancing joint  capabilities between Australia, the U.K., and the United States to  improve security and interoperability in the region. One aspect of this  pillar is improving and synchronizing processes related to arms exports  and sharing of sensitive defense technologies between participants.  This includes encouraging and advising our partners on how to  strengthen the regulatory frameworks to enable closer cooperation while  maintaining appropriate safeguards.   H.R. 1093 requires the State Department to report to Congress on its  efforts toward implementation of the advanced capabilities pillar of  AUKUS, including International Traffic in Arms Regulations and  improvements necessary in partner country regulations to enable secure  and successful implementation.   As the United States looks to build on this important shared security  partnership with Australia and the United Kingdom within the AUKUS  framework, I am proud, again, to co-lead this bipartisan initiative  with Chairman McCaul to ensure we move forward in a meaningful way.   As we engage in strategic competition, sharing our defense  technologies and capabilities in a safe, secure, and regulated manner  with our partners is absolutely critical. Therefore, I encourage my  colleagues, all of my colleagues, Democrats and Republicans, to support  this bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Connecticut (Mr. Courtney), my friend from HASC.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentleman from Connecticut.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentleman from Connecticut.  [[Page H1311]]         Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to  close.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1093 is an important bipartisan measure which  requires the State Department to report to Congress on its efforts  toward implementation of the advanced capabilities pillar of AUKUS and  improvements necessary in partner country regulations to enable secure  and successful implementation.   As we look to build on and implement our shared security partnerships  with Australia and the United Kingdom encapsulated within the AUKUS  framework, I am proud to co-lead this bipartisan framework with  Chairman McCaul.   In this strategic competition, the most important of our era, sharing  our defense technologies and capabilities in a safe, secure, and  regulated manner will only make us all stronger and more united.   Mr. Speaker, I hope that all of my colleagues will join me in support  of this very important bipartisan bill. I yield back the balance of my  time.     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume,  and I rise in strong support of H.R. 1159.   This legislation introduced by Mrs. Wagner, the vice chair of the  House Foreign Affairs Committee, and Messrs. Connolly and Lawler, House  Foreign Affairs Committee members, showcases this body's steadfast,  bipartisan commitment to Taiwan.   As a vibrant democracy and reliable partner of the United States of  America, Taiwan has long been a force for good in promoting prosperity  and development in the Indo-Pacific and beyond.   Our robust and longstanding friendship is built on our shared values  of democracy and good governance, strong people-to-people ties, and  ever-expanding commercial and economic engagement.   When I visited Taiwan with Speaker Pelosi last year, the reception we  received from the people was nothing short of incredible. We were  welcomed with open arms. Thousands of people greeted us as the plane  landed. More than that viewed us as our trip took its way to Taiwan.   Our trip demonstrated that Members of Congress will not be dictated  to by Beijing and that we will not sit idly by as Beijing attempts to  intimidate and coerce our friend.   The people of Taiwan showed us tremendous respect and affection, so  much so it was in a way that I believe demonstrates their confidence  that the United States Congress will continue to stand up for them.   In acknowledgment of our deep and lasting friendship, the Biden  administration took concrete steps to encourage greater engagement with  Taiwan. In April 2021, the State Department revised its guidelines to  liberalize executive branch interactions with Taiwan counterparts in a  way that is consistent with our One China policy and honors our  longstanding ties to Taiwan as enshrined in the Taiwan Relations Act.   This legislation amends the Taiwan Assurance Act of 2020 to  reauthorize regular reporting on the State Department's Taiwan contact  guidelines. This bill sends a strong message that Congress stands with  our friends in Taiwan, supports greater engagement, and wants to have  an active part in strengthening the United States-Taiwan relationship.   As the United States and Taiwan look to further enhance our  cooperation, facilitating ways to bolster our ongoing people-to-people  ties is vital. Not only have our two sides benefited tremendously from  our close engagement, but the world stands to benefit, as well.   Again, I congratulate Representative Wagner, the vice chair of the  committee; Mr. Connolly; and Mr. Lawler for coming up with this  bipartisan bill, and I encourage all of my colleagues to support this  bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. Connolly), my friend.    Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1159 is an important bipartisan measure  that reauthorizes regular reporting on the State Department's Taiwan  contact guidelines to Congress and encourages greater engagement with  our friends in Taiwan, consistent with our One China policy.   As a vibrant democracy, a force of good will, and a model for the  world, Taiwan is, indeed, a key part of the Indo-Pacific region. It is  vital that we find concrete ways to expand and deepen interactions at  every level and work together to advance our mutual priorities based on  our shared values, strong people-to-people ties, and common vision for  the region.   Again, I thank Vice Chair Wagner, Mr. Connolly, and Mr. Lawler for  coming together with this strong bipartisan bill, and I urge all of my  colleagues to join us and support this very important bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 406, the PARTNER with  ASEAN Act, introduced by Mr. Castro and Mrs. Kim.   Of course, I join with Mrs. Wagner in wishing Mr. Castro a speedy  recovery and return to this body very soon.   This legislation will solidify this body's strong bipartisan  commitment to deepening our longstanding cooperation with Southeast  Asia and facilitate stronger people-to-people ties with this vast,  diverse region.   Southeast Asia is vital to the United States national interests and  strategic priorities. The 10 Southeast Asian nations that comprise the  important regional body of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations,  or ASEAN, have an outsized role in shaping crucial political, economic,  and security developments in the Indo-Pacific region and beyond.   The United States has long recognized ASEAN's central role in  promoting peace, security, and stability in the region. This bill would  allow us to deepen our collaboration and partnership on shared  challenges.   H.R. 406 underscores the importance of the United States and ASEAN's  partnership by authorizing that ASEAN be designated as an international  organization with diplomatic privileges and immunities consistent with  the International Organizations Immunities Act.   The IOIA, which was enacted in 1945, is how the United States extends  the rights and treatment generally accorded to embassies of countries  that have diplomatic relations with the United States to international  organizations.   This is a long-overdue change that our partners in ASEAN and the  Biden administration strongly support. With the passage of this  legislation, the United States would affirm our longstanding  relationship and upgrade our capacity to collaborate with ASEAN. Robust  and consistent engagement with Southeast Asia is critical to realizing  our Indo-Pacific strategy. This measure ensures that America remains a  Pacific power and a critical player in Southeast Asia as we address the  challenge of China.   We need to work collectively with ASEAN so that we can tackle shared  challenges such as economic resiliency, global health, climate change,  and attacks against the rules-based international order. Our  partnership with ASEAN will be essential in delivering sustainable  solutions to our combined 1 billion people.   Mr. Speaker, again, I urge all of my colleagues to support this  strong, bipartisan bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume for  the purpose of closing.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 406 is a very important, bipartisan measure that  affirms the importance of the United States and ASEAN's partnership by  extending privileges and immunities under the International  Organizations Immunities Act to ASEAN.   In fact, Mr. Speaker, I recall myself going to Cambodia to attend the  session with ASEAN where they extended the opportunity for us to be  official observers at their annual meetings and conferences.   This just emphasizes how the United States has long recognized and-- ASEAN also--appreciates our engagement with this diverse regional body  and demonstrated strong support for ASEAN centrality. This measure  demonstrates our commitment to this organization and pivotal region.   Mr. Speaker, there is no better way to honor over 45 years of the  United States-ASEAN's relations and build upon our partnership than  passing this important bipartisan legislation so they know that jointly  the United States Congress recognizes the significance and importance  of our partnership.                                time  1745    Again, I thank Mr. Castro--we want him back here soon--and  Representative Young Kim for their hard work on this bill to send the  appropriate message. I hope that all of my colleagues will join us in  support of this very important bipartisan bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
