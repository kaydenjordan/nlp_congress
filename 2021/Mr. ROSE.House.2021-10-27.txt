 Mr. Speaker, this fall along with the cooler temperatures  that autumn always brings, Tennesseans and Americans all across the  country will be subjected to record-breaking prices to heat our homes.   Under the Biden administration, costs for natural gas, the most  common resource for heating our homes, has skyrocketed.   With inflation at a 30-year high, families are already stretched thin  as they pay more at the grocery store and at the gas pump, but it  doesn't stop there.   Families are now expected to pay more in energy costs to heat their  homes; as much as 54 percent for some households for the fall and  winter months.   Rather than confronting this burgeoning energy crisis before it is  too late, President Biden and Democrats are proposing disastrous energy  policies that are bad for the economy, bad for the national security,  and bad for Americans.   Included in their more than $5 trillion social spending agenda is a  natural gas tax and bans on domestic energy and mineral production,  which will cause us to obtain these vital resources from OPEC, Russia,  and even China.    As Democrats continued to push their tax-and-spend agenda, it is  middle- and low-income families who will be hit the hardest by far left  energy policies.   President Biden must act now to avert this impending energy crisis.                            ____________________
