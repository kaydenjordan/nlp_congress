 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a legend in Arkansas  high school basketball.   Charles Berry, one of the State's most successful coaches, is  retiring this year after 57 years on the court. He is an Arkansas  native, grew up in Huntsville, served in the United States Air Force,  and returned home to begin a remarkable career as a teacher and coach,  the last 50 years at his alma mater, Huntsville High School, in the  gymnasium that now bears his name.   The numbers speak for themselves: 1,367 career wins; 14 conference  championships; six regional championships; two State titles, two times  as a runner-up. He is a six-time Arkansas All-Star coach, and in 2007  was named the National Coach of the Year in girls basketball. His 2016  induction into the Arkansas High School Coaches Association Hall of  Fame was automatic.   His legacy as a coach is understood, but he is more than a coach.  Charlie is a respected and dedicated mentor, educator, and person. He  is simply one of the best.   Thank you, Charlie, for your many years of service to your community,  and happy retirement, my friend.                            ____________________
