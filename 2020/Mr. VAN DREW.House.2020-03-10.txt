 Madam Speaker, I would like to honor the 10th annual  Women Build event held by the Salem County Habitat for Humanity. The  event and the building took place in Penns Grove, south Jersey. The  three homes that were built in Penns Grove will be dedicated on March  30 of this year.   Across the country and around the world, about 6,000 women will unite  in more than 235 communities to build and improve 540 homes. The Women  Build event also raises awareness about housing issues facing women and  facing their families.   Madam Speaker, I thank all of the volunteers who helped at the event.  They are changing lives for the better and making our community thrive.  I thank them for what they do.   I would specifically like to recognize Stephanie Williams. Stephanie  has put her tools to great use to help families in her community.   It inspires me to see such great work happening in our own backyard,  and I thank them for all of their dedicated service, their kind hearts,  and their hard work in changing the lives of those who are very much in  need.                            ____________________
