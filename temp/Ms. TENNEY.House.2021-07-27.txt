 Mr. Speaker, in 1994, a senior U.S. Senator was asked by  a constituent how he felt about taxpayer-funded abortion. The Senator  responded, ``I will continue to abide by the same principle that has  guided me throughout my 21 years in the Senate: Those of us who are  opposed to abortion should not be compelled to pay for them.''   That Senator is now the President of the United States. Yes, those  were the words of President Joe Biden on April 7, 1994.   Only 2 years ago, in 2019, then-candidate Biden reaffirmed his  support of the Hyde amendment. A campaign statement reiterated that  ``his position on the Hyde amendment has been consistent.''   Since 1976, Congress' position on the Hyde amendment has also been  consistent. The bipartisan Hyde amendment has prevented taxpayer  funding for abortion.   But, for the first time in decades, House Democrats have stripped  this provision from the Federal spending bills we are considering this  week. Years of bipartisan consensus have been thrown out the door.   The Hyde amendment is a commonsense provision that most Americans  support. In a recent poll, nearly 60 percent of Americans expressed  their support for the Hyde amendment, while only 38 percent voiced  support for taxpayer-funded abortions.   But this issue is not about the polling or the politics; it is about  life. It is estimated that the Hyde amendment has saved more than 2.4  million lives. For over 40 years, these very precious lives have been  respected, valued, and saved because of this bipartisan provision.   The survival of millions more precious lives is at stake. That is why  I implore my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to reconsider  their decision to strip the Hyde amendment from the spending bills we  are considering this week. As a society, we must value the unborn and  protect the sanctity of life.   Congressman Henry Hyde fought to ban taxpayer-funded abortions, he  said, because he believed firmly in the sanctity of life. As he said,  the ``little, almost-born infant struggling to live is a member of the  human family,'' and ``abortion is a lethal assault against the very  idea of human rights and destroys, along with a defenseless little  baby, the moral foundation of our democracy.''    The late Congressman Hyde was right. This is a moral question. That  is why I agree with President Biden's statement when he was in the  Senate many years ago: Those who disagree with abortion should not now  be forced to pay for it.   I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to come together,  just as we have for nearly five decades, to support the Hyde amendment  and stand up and defend life.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I am here today with the support of seven of  my House colleagues to introduce an amendment to section B of H.R.  4502.    This amendment will restore the principle of good governance,  preventing precious, hard-earned taxpayer dollars from going to the  Civilian Climate Corps, which is an unauthorized program.   As Members of the people's House, we have an obligation to ensure  taxpayer dollars are spent effectively and that spending is held to the  highest standards of accountability.   Yet, tucked away in the House Democrats' spending bill is funding for  the so-called Civilian Climate Corps. The Democrats transferred $5  million, initially set aside for invasive species management, and  directed it to this new program to fund bureaucrats.   But there is a problem. The Biden administration and Members of  Congress have admitted they don't know how the program will function.  From what we know about this program, it will be a new massive Federal  slush fund focused not on sound climate policy but on advancing the  partisan Green New Deal agenda.   Mr. Speaker, it is bad enough for government to fund a program that  Congress hasn't authorized and can't effectively oversee.    Mr. Speaker, there are plenty of programs that are  covered by this bill, including the 2018 farm bill with the mission and  expertise to manage invasive species. The Civilian Climate Corps should  be debated and considered in the House before it is funded; otherwise,  this is just another bureaucratic slush fund.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues in the House to support my  commonsense amendment.
