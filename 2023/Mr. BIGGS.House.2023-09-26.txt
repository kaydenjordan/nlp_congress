 Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of my amendment to restore  funding for the USDA Office of Chief Economist to fiscal year 2016  levels, which will save us more than $11 million in 2024.   Now, what is interesting, I have been listening to my colleagues  across the aisle saying that it is going to 2001 levels. They don't  want 2000 levels. This goes to 2016 levels, so I am hoping that they  will support this because our annual discretionary spending has  exploded over the course of the COVID-19 response.   No one thought our government was too small before COVID. We are  currently spending $400 billion more in fiscal 2023 for the same  government we had before, and deficits for this year are expected to  exceed $2 trillion.   That is why we have a $33 trillion national debt, and that does not  even include the $600-$700 billion in interest that we pay.   Revenue in fiscal year 2022 levels far exceeded our Federal spending  in fiscal year 2016, meaning that if we were to shrink the Federal  behemoth back to those pre-COVID levels, we might be able to avoid  adding to our national debt for the next 12 months.   This is the first of many amendments that I will be offering to  appropriations bills this week intended to reduce spending. My staff  and I spent countless hours earlier this year reviewing the prior  year's appropriations bills and making recommendations to the Committee  on Appropriations. I even filed 521 separate bills to cut spending  across the discretionary budget totaling $100 billion in spending  reductions for fiscal year 2024.   I am not singling any one office or department out here. We need to  tighten our belts across the Federal Government in order to get  spending under control.   I will just ask you: How bad is the national debt crisis? The 12  regional Federal Reserve Banks that compose the largest central bank in  the world have a monopoly on printing paper dollars. It is the world's  reserve currency. Yet, its ability to print money and invest it in  bonds, the Federal Reserve is now on pace to lose over $100 billion  this year.   They lost $53 billion in the last two quarters. They are going to  lose over $100 billion.   Why is that? Because Federal spending is out of control. If we are  not going to fix it, who is going to fix it? Who is going to start  fixing it? It is our job.   Mr. Chair, I urge the adoption of my amendment, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Harris).    Mr. Chairman, for the last while I have heard my  colleagues across the aisle, they were talking about costs, that  Republicans want to cut costs, and that we always talk about costs.   Here is my question: What could they do? They are the ones who  fostered this massive inflation on us that is imposing terrible,  terrible costs on the American people.   The first thing they could do is they could unleash American energy.  When you unleash American energy, you reduce the price of the fuels  that are necessary for the farmers to produce our food. You reduce the  cost of the transports to bring that food to market, and you make our  cost structure go down.   That is not necessarily inflation, because the other thing you have  to do to bring inflation under control is to bring Federal spending  under control.   Mr. Chairman, I urge the adoption of my amendment, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, I rise in support of my amendment, which  restores funding for the National Agricultural Statistics Service to  the fiscal year 2019 level. That would result in nearly $13 million to  deficit reduction in fiscal year 2024.   Annual discretionary spending, I won't go through that again, what I  said last time.   Revenue in fiscal year 2022 levels actually exceeded our Federal  spending in fiscal year 2019, meaning that if we were to shrink the  Federal behemoth back to those pre-COVID levels, we might be able to  avoid adding to our national debt for the next 12 months.   Now, I want to continue on why this is so doggone important that we  take care of this. The proposed funding level for the National  Agricultural Statistics Service is a 7.6 percent increase over the  fiscal year 2019 level. So we are actually bumping it slightly above  the 2019 level, but we are getting right back to the pre-COVID levels.   Now, let's talk about this for a second. My colleagues across the  aisle--I actually heard one of them say in talking about the underlying  bill, the main bill, that the Federal Government needed to ``meet the  needs of every American.'' I want you to think about what that says.  The Federal Government meets the needs of every American.   Who determines what that need is and who pays for that need? Well,  our grandchildren must be the ones that they think are going to pay for  the current needs because we are borrowing $2 trillion this year; and  it will be more than that next year. We are paying interest about $700  billion in 2023. It will be more than that next year.   Let's talk about the Fed again. I mention the Fed just so people can  understand that the Fed has now put itself in a precarious position. We  always used the Fed. We counted on it--those who wanted to grow  government did. They believed in modern monetary theory, that the Fed  could just keep printing money, no inflation would result, just money  grows on trees, and that we could supply every American with every need  that they might have.   So you use the central bank to keep interest rates really low. That  made private borrowers really happy because they could service  government debt inexpensively.   But what happened? COVID happened, right? And trillions of dollars  flooded our economy, and when those trillions of dollars flooded our  economy, it devalued our currency and caused inflation to go up because  those were nonproductive dollars.   What did the Democrats do last year--because they didn't get their  act together on budgeting--they passed a couple of CRs, which led  ultimately to the omnibus bill, and that flooded money in there--after  COVID was long gone. They added to the inflationary pressures.   I am going to continue this, but for now, Mr. Chair, I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, let's talk some more about the Fed and why we  are in a world of hurt and why we have to start reducing spending and  funding.   We can't fund every project, everything around the world and even in  our own country. We send hundreds of billions of dollars out of this  country.   Guess what, when the Fed bought $4.7 trillion in additional assets,  $2.5 trillion of that was in mortgage-backed securities, and they  invested in long-term loans. Then, as inflation pressures up, they kept  increasing the prime rate. They are now expecting another increase in  the interest rate within the next 2 months. We will have to pay that  debt service. That will contribute to the inflationary pressure that we  have.   When you screw up your energy policy and you screw up your Federal  funding policy, the American people suffer, and they suffer through  higher costs due to inflation. That is a hidden tax.   That is why I keep trying to find ways, line items where we can  actually provide services but we can reduce the Federal spending to at  least make some rational nod toward bringing us back to some sound  funding policy, something we haven't seen here in ages.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, I rise in support of my amendment to restore  funding to the National Institute of Food and Agriculture to fiscal  year 2019 levels.   This amendment would direct $157 million to deficit reduction in  fiscal year 2024.   Let's talk about this. I have been talking all night about the  precarious position our economy is in. I am often baffled by this. I  view it as an existential threat, and you know what, bipartisan we have  seen national security leaders of this country say our biggest threat  is our national debt.   Every year we have a structural deficit. This year we thought it was  going to be about $1.7 trillion. CBO revised it to north of $2  trillion, and that is what it is going to be next year.   The National Institute of Food and Agriculture has made a habit of  disseminating grant funding to organizations intent on perpetuating  societal  [[Page H4530]]  division in the United States. These include things like a $350,000  funding grant to a Soros-funded nonprofit promoting ``equity'' in  community food development projects, another $1.4 million in funds for  organizations to advance ``food justice'' in California, and funding to  colleges seeking to ``enhance diversity'' in food economics.   The proposed funding level that is made for the National Institute of  Food and Agriculture is a 17 percent increase over the fiscal year 2019  level.   This reduction I propose in my amendment would ensure that taxpayer  dollars are properly focused on activities related to food and crop  development. That is what this agency is supposed to be doing, not  wokeifying the money that we give to it.   Well, I want everyone to support this amendment, and I am going  continue my talk about our precarious position, which is an existential  crisis to the United States.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, over the course of this evening during the  debate of the underlying bill it was referred to as being heartless and  disrespectful. This amendment was referred to as being disrespectful,  as a matter of fact.   This is what I would tell you: You know what is heartless? Heartless  is putting our Nation and wrapping it up with flax and cords that we  will not soon be able to get out of with constant perpetual debt.   You see inflation, inflation is going to keep going. Inflation is  going to keep going because we don't have a great energy policy and we  have a terrible Federal spending problem.   We heard on the underlying bill, hey, you know what, we should just  raise more taxes. That is what we should be doing. But you know what,  we had record revenue, record revenue, and guess what, we continued to  increase our structural deficit, which leads to a greater national debt  problem.                                time  2200    It isn't that Americans aren't paying enough in taxes. It is a  fundamental spending problem. It gets back to what I have been talking  about, this modern monetary theory. You heard it just a minute ago. We  need to take care of the needs of everybody. Who pays for that? It is  obviously not going to be the American people who are living right now.  Maybe it is going to be some who are living right now.   We can't fundamentally afford the government my leftist colleagues  across the aisle continue to promote. That is what they want. They want  massive government. They want government that controls every aspect of  everybody's life. Then, they say, that will meet the needs of  everybody.   That is not enough. They have to open the southern border, as well.  By the time the Biden administration leaves, you will have 10 million  encounters at the border. That won't include the got-aways, both known  and unknown, which already, under the Biden administration, exceed 2\1/ 2\ million people.   How are you going to pay for that? They never want to tell you how  they are going to pay for it because they have no concept of what is  facing this country.   Mr. Chair, I urge the adoption of my amendment, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, I rise in support of my amendment to restore  funding to the Farm Production Conservation Business Center to fiscal  2019 levels. That is right: Take it back to pre-COVID levels.   This amendment would direct nearly $15 million to deficit reduction  in fiscal year 2024. My staff and I, earlier in the year, introduced  many bills trying to take a line-item approach to the budget to try to  reduce spending, to try to bring us back into some rationality, and  this is one of the places we found.   The proposed funding level for the Farm Production Conservation  Business Center is a nearly 7 percent increase over fiscal year 2019  levels.   The Farm Production Conservation Business Center is a fairly new  office within the Department of Agriculture and is intended to support  the agency's farmer-facing components. Under the Biden administration,  the agency is pushing out taxpayer-funded climate alarmism and  messaging to outline how USDA is advancing equity by providing  increased financial assistance to historically underserved groups.   The spending reduction in this amendment would ensure that the  business center is not abusing its farmer-facing role to promote  divisive ideology, as the Biden regime is trying to do, but instead  focuses its resources on serving agriculture producers.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I have to say, I am actually baffled a little  bit because it is like we are on the other side of an ocean, an ocean  separates us. I never hear my colleagues say that they want to reduce  spending on any program. I never hear it. Instead, they  [[Page H4531]]  want to continually propose big spending programs that we simply don't  have money for, and then they want to do something that is actually  self-defeating by increasing taxes.   We have significant revenue. We just outspend the revenue. We  outspend it every time.   What happened after COVID? Well, I am proposing we go back to pre- COVID levels. What happened during COVID is that the Federal Reserve  had to auction so many treasuries it really had to begin offering  higher rates. What did that do? That fueled higher rates.   Now, with rates so much higher, the bank is now forced to borrow  against all its prior lending, all its prior investments, which they  did at like 1 percent. Now, we are sitting at 5.3 percent.   When you are doing bonds, Mr. Chair, and you know this as well as  anybody, your value of your asset has decreased. That is what has  happened, and it puts us in massive economic jeopardy. We have to  acknowledge that.   That is the reason that the Fed has incurred a net loss of $53.5  billion on interest expense, a trend that is going to continue in this  quarter.   Mr. Chair, I include in the Record an article by Daniel Horowitz from  September 26, 2023.       [From Blaze Media/Opinion & Analysis/Opinion, Sept. 26, 2023]          Horowitz: When Money Printers Can No Longer Print Money                            (By Daniel Horowitz)         Just how bad is the national debt crisis? The 12 regional       Federal Reserve Banks that compose the largest central bank       in the world have a monopoly on printing paper dollars, the       world's reserve currency. Yet despite its ability to print       paper and then invest it in bonds, the Federal Reserve is now       on pace to lose money on its own scheme to the tune of over       $100 billion this year.        Thus, the great bailout institution of last resort has now       itself become a further drain on the federal treasury.        Until recently, the Federal Reserve was the ace in the hole       for the governing elites who wanted to grow weaponized       government on the cheap. The central bank was able to keep       interest rates extremely low, which made private borrowers       happy but also serviced government debt inexpensively. And by       using maturity transformation to borrow short and lend long,       the central bank could turn a profit by lending at higher       rates of interest than it borrowed. The net profit was always       deposited into the rapacious accounts of the Treasury       Department to offset a portion of its ballooning debt.        Then came COVID.        COVID ended the Ponzi scheme. In its attempt to permanently       control our lives, the Federal Reserve was forced to pay for       the lockdowns and ultimately lost control of the money       laundering operation. In order to service the debt, the Fed       in less than a year purchased $4.7 trillion in additional       assets, including $2.5 trillion in mortgage-backed       securities. Central bankers invested this money in the form       of long-term loans locked in at very low rates.        Then came the inevitable inflation driven by this very       COVID spending.        The Federal Reserve was forced to auction so many       Treasuries on the market that it had to begin offering higher       rates. Many would also argue that Federal Reserve Chairman       Jerome Powell raised the federal funds rate too quickly under       the false premise that it would stem the tide of the       inflation it created.        Well, now with interest rates so much higher, the bank is       forced to borrow high against all of its prior lending       (investments), which was at a much lower rate. We now have       the ultimate inversion, which is causing severe deficits. In       just the first two quarters of 2023, the Fed has incurred a       net loss of $53.5 billion on interest expense, a trend that       will only be exacerbated with higher rates, a slowing       economy, and a tightening credit market.        The $53 billion loss for the first half of 2023 is on top       of the $15.8 billion net loss in the final quarter of 2022.        This is a big deal. For the first time in its more than 100       years of existence, the money god itself can't print its way       out of insolvency.        To print even more money now will take an already tapped-      out consumer and small business and crush them further with       even higher inflation, tightening of credit, and crushing an       already insolvent housing market.        On top of the Fed's capital deficit is more than $1       trillion in unrealized losses on its $7.6 trillion balance       sheet of Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities it       purchased in its System Open Market Account. All those assets       the bank purchased at 1 percent interest are now worth much       less if the bank were to sell them off at 5.3 percent.       Ironically, this is the same insolvency other banks that come       to the Fed for bailouts are facing today.        Yet the Fed simply writes off the loss as it unloads a       small portion of its balance sheet (about 9 percent from its       high in 2022) without using mark-to-market accounting, as       other banks are required to do under the Dodd-Frank law.       Mark-to-market uses the actual market price of the bonds, not       the irrelevant face value. The Fed ignores the market price       of bonds and assumes they are face value.        If the Fed is incurring this much of a deficit, which will       engender more bailouts from the Treasury--rather than the Fed       bailing out the debt-ridden Treasury--imagine how the economy       will look in the coming years. The majority of FOMC members       announced at a Wednesday meeting that they expect another       interest rate hike before the end of the year. Then they       envision the elevated rates to remain at least for a few       years. The capital deficit and unrealized losses on the       balance sheet are going to explode exponentially because of       the yield inversions, which will further exacerbate the debt       tsunami.        Also, even if the Fed itself doesn't raise the funds rate,       the yields on Treasuries must continue to climb just from the       sheer volume of issuance the Fed will offload on the market       to service biblical levels of interest on the debt, now       slated to top $1 trillion every year. There is already a       problem attracting enough buyers--with many foreign       countries, including China and Japan, dumping U.S.       Treasuries. Just wait until these other countries continue       with their plan to move away from the U.S. dollar as the       reserve currency. Yields will need to increase, further       perpetuating and exacerbating the cost of servicing the debt       and the Fed's own fiscal deficit in doing so.        Yields on the two-year Treasury are at the highest level       since 2006. However, 17 years ago, the gross debt was $8.5       trillion, not $33 trillion. Also, we were running $200-$400       billion annual deficits, not $2 trillion deficits. Not to       mention the fact that we didn't have nearly this much debt       and credit crush in the private sector and among households       that are straining banks and individuals to the point of       insolvency. Oh, and we are officially not in a recession and       have relatively low unemployment. Wait until the fun begins       in 2024 and the cost of social programs skyrockets. Even       without any new debt, $7.6 trillion of existing debt will       mature within the next year at much higher interest rates.        In other words, the Fed, which has been the government's       lifeguard for several generations, is now drowning in the       very pool it, along with corrupt politicians in Congress and       the Treasury Department, has created. Who will bail out the       money printer then?    Mr. Chair, let's talk some more about what should be done.  We have a structural deficit of $2 trillion. We are spending $700  billion in interest. The Fed is losing money. Our economy is slowing  down to boot.   The question is: What could we do? How about we rein in our Federal  spending so that the value of our currency doesn't keep dropping like a  stone? How about we unleash American energy so that we have pressure to  reduce costs on the energy side and have traditional currency  protection on the inflation side? That would do it. That would help,  but we don't see anything from the Hill from which my colleagues across  the way speak. We don't hear from the White House, either.   Mr. Chair, I am urging adoption of this amendment. It is a small  measure to reduce a small program in a small way, but it moves us in  that direction.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of my amendment to strike  funding for the Food for Peace Title II grant program, which would  direct $1.74 billion to deficit reduction.   I will repeat again what has been said so often here: Annual  discretionary spending exploded over the course of the COVID-19  response. No one thought our government was too small before COVID, and  we are currently spending $400 billion more in fiscal year 2023 for the  same government we had before. Deficits exceed $2 trillion.   Let me just make this clear: In 2019, we spent about $4.9 trillion,  $4.7- to $4.9 trillion, depends on who is telling you, and our revenue  is going to be about $5.2 trillion. Wouldn't it be great to get back to  those 2019 levels? Wouldn't it be great to get to the 2019 spending  levels with our current revenue levels? Then you would not be  increasing your deficit, your structural deficit.   The spending deficits that we have are out of control. They are  leading to this massive national debt, which is fueling inflation and  is going to be generational theft.   Let's talk about the Food for Peace Title II grant programs. Since  the program was established in the 1950s, funding for the program has  exploded. The Trump administration's fiscal year 2020 budget request  recommended eliminating this program, which is duplicative of other  foreign aid programs.   What is interesting, I say ``Trump,'' and you know that is going to  set off, oh, no, the Trump derangement syndrome folks, the far left of  this body are going to say: Oh, that is crazy.   However, Trump wasn't the first to do it. The Obama administration's  2014 budget request recommended shifting all Food for Peace Title II  funds into accounts funded through the State and Foreign Operations  appropriations bill. They cited potential improvements to flexibility,  timeliness, and efficiency.   I am urging us to wipe out $1.74 billion in wasteful, duplicative  spending and put it into deficit reduction.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, previously, some of my counterparts in  debate have said we should supply every need, the Federal Government  should supply every need to every American, and now they want to  persist in trying to satisfy the needs and wants of people offshore, as  well.   We can't afford to take care of every need of every American today.  That is why we have a $2 trillion structural deficit. That does not  include the $700 billion that we are spending in interest. We simply  cannot afford to keep giving our future away, and that is what we are  doing here.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I am encouraging everyone to support this  important amendment. I think it is important, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of my amendment to strike  funding for the McGovern-Dole International Food for Education and  Child Nutrition Program.   I appreciate that the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Ogles) offered an  amendment reducing it, and I appreciate that that is now going to be  part of the underlying bill since it just passed on voice vote.   My amendment would direct the entire $240 million supporting that  program would be used to reduce our deficit in 2024.   When you think about it, Mr. Ogles certainly made a strong case as to  why that should be so, but I am going to add just a couple points to  it. I am not going to belabor the fact that we continue to spend  ourselves into oblivion at the Federal level. That is causing  tremendous inflationary pressures, bringing stress to every American  family.   What I am going to talk about instead is what happens in any Federal  bureaucracy, what we see government do constantly. Mr. Ogles talked  about the negative policy aspects of it, but I will just cover briefly  what happens in the Federal bureaucracy on the spending side of it.   This particular program, the McGovern-Dole International Food for  Education and Child Nutrition Program first received appropriations in  fiscal year 2004, just 20 years ago, 20 short years ago. The bill set  aside $50 million to carry out the program. That was the program, $50  million. Help around the world ostensibly, right?   However, what happens to Federal bureaucracies? They grow like Topsy.  This one has grown to $240 million annually.   The Trump administration's 2018 budget, pre-COVID budget, request  recommended that the program be eliminated as it ``lacks evidence that  the program is being effectively implemented to reduce food  insecurity.''                                time  2300    Additionally, the program primarily works by donating food produced  in the United States to communities in need around the world, but we  have already heard the seven nations identified. It is a great deal for  U.S. agricultural producers whose surplus is purchased by the Federal  Government for use in the program, but the provision of free food, as  Mr. Ogles so eloquently pointed out, is required to be delivered, and  that causes native, local production to decline in those States.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, why else might we want to eliminate this  program? The provision of free food to these seven nations on this  list, which is required to be delivered in a not-so-timely manner on  U.S.-flagged ships, distorts food production markets in those nations  receiving aid, and it actually increases the cost.   It is a classic ``give a man a fish, feed him for a day'' problem.  The program isn't eliminating food insecurity. It is slow. It is  costly. It is growing. It pushes out local production. Quite frankly,  we simply can't afford it anymore.   At some point, we are going to have to say we are having trouble  funding everything in our own country, and now we are going to send it  abroad. That is something I don't think the American people stand for.   Mr. Chair, I urge the adoption of this amendment, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, I rise in support of my amendment to restore  funding for the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to fiscal year  2019 pre-COVID levels.   This amendment would direct $77 million to deficit reduction in  fiscal year 2024. Annual discretionary spending exploded over the  course of the COVID-19 response. No one thought our government was too  small before COVID. We are currently spending hundreds of billions of  dollars more in fiscal year 2023 for the same government functions that  we had before.   Deficits are now projected to exceed $2 trillion for this fiscal  year. Recently, the U.S. eclipsed $33 trillion in debt, accounting for  nearly $100,000 per U.S. citizen.   Earlier in the debates today, we were told that if we go down this  road, we are going to see a threatened credit rating reduction. We have  already seen that. Fitch already did it. Moody's is threatening to do  it again, and why are they doing it again? It is because, as they said  the last time they downgraded us, we don't have an effective plan to  handle and reduce our Federal deficit.   We just don't have a plan anymore. The plan is to actually increase  our deficit, and my bill attempts to take one small bite at trying to  shrink that deficit, that structural deficit, that leads to the gross  national debt problem we have every year.   Revenue in fiscal year 2022 levels actually exceeded our Federal  spending in fiscal year 2019. What that means is if we were to shrink  the Federal spending behemoth back to those pre-COVID levels, we might  just be able to avoid adding to our national debt for the next 12  months. That is all I am asking.   I am begging us, can we do it for a month, 2 months, 3 months? You  will see that this country will not fall apart. Instead, it will  prosper and grow, and we would be better off.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I appreciate my friend, the Agriculture  Committee chairman, and his opposition, but I must respectfully  disagree. The proposed funding level for the Commodity Futures Trading  Commission is a nearly 30 percent increase over the fiscal year 2019  levels.   The CFTC is following in the footsteps of the SEC under the Biden  administration with efforts to mandate, without statutory authority, an  onerous climate disclosure regime on the private sector.   Last year, the CFTC solicited comments on climate-related financial  risk. Conservative attorneys general, led by West Virginia Attorney  General Patrick Morrisey, forcefully pushed back, stating that attempts  to mandate disclosure through rulemaking or through another regulatory  framework would clearly implicate the major questions doctrine, raised  First Amendment concerns related to compelled speech, and stated that  courts would find climate-related action to be arbitrary and  capricious.                                time  2310    Other reporting suggests that the CFTC is aggressively pursuing  enforcement action and hefty fines over minor technical reporting  requirements. That is typical of the bureaucratic regime established  under the Biden administration.   Adoption of my amendment would ensure that the CFTC is properly  utilizing its resources to fulfill its mission of fostering open,  competitive, and financially sound futures and option markets, not  becoming the Biden administration's ESG enforcer.   Mr. Chair, I urge adoption of my amendment, and I yield back the  balance of my time.
