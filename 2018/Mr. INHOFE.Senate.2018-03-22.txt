 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be  recognized for such time as I may consume.    Mr. President, this is going to be kind of a strange  statement to make. I have great regret that I am going to have to vote  for this bill when it comes up--and I am talking about the spending  bill--and I don't like it.   I went through a lot of years as being--in fact, since I have been  here, I have been ranked with the three most conservative Members every  year--more times than anybody else has. I am looking at this right now,  and I was listening to some of my colleagues who are concerned about  the spending, and no one is more concerned than I am about the  spending. We have a problem, though, that a lot of people don't  understand.   I have been on the Senate Armed Services Committee for 24 years in  the Senate, and I was on the same committee in the House before that,  and I have never seen anything like this. We went through things back  in the Carter administration where we had a hollow force, and then  Ronald Reagan came along in 1980, and we rebuilt our military.  Everybody knows that. They knew what was happening. A hollow force is  not good. A hollow force means we can't really fight a war. Certainly  we can't do two contingencies simultaneously, as has been our policy  for a long period of time. And that is what we got into back then. Now,  this hasn't happened since 1980.   I chair one of the subcommittees, and we had the vices in--this was  at the end of the Obama administration--and the four vices of the  services all said the same thing: We are in a position now where we  have a hollow force like we had back in the late seventies.   The public doesn't know this, and our press doesn't talk very much  about this. They talk about all the problems that ring the bells and  sell the newspapers and all of that, but they don't want to talk about  the military. This is the reality of what we are faced with right now.   General Dunford is the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. He said  that we are losing our qualitative and quantitative edge in America.  That means we have two great forces out there--one Russia and one  China--and they are passing us up. Right now, both China and Russia,  with the artillery pieces they have on tanks, can fire eight rounds a  minute. Do you know how many rounds we can fire with ours? Four rounds  a minute.   We got ourselves into a position where we had our ground brigades of  the U.S. Army--this was at the end of the last administration--of our  ground brigades, only 30 percent of them could be deployed.   I don't like to sound like I am being partisan when I talk about  Barack Obama. I respect him in one area, and that is, he was admittedly  a very proud  [[Page S1927]]  liberal, and proud liberals don't care that much about a defense  system. They think that if all countries will stand in a circle and  hold hands and unilaterally disarm, all threats will go away. So we  went through that, and people didn't seem to care.   There is this myth out there that somehow we are stronger than  everybody else, that the equipment we have is better than anybody  else's. During that same timeframe, our air brigades--only 30 percent  of those were working. The marines who use the F-18s--62 percent of the  F-18s couldn't fly. One of the things that happen when the military  goes down--the first thing that goes down is maintenance, and then, of  course, you have modernization, and that is where we got way down  behind.   Don't take my word for it. Right now, we have 27 Members on the  Senate Armed Services Committee, and they understand this. They know  where we are on this, but a lot of the other people don't. They have  their interests. If they had a strong interest, they would probably be  on the committee, and they are not.   Secretary Mattis said:         Our competitive edge has eroded in every domain of       warfare--air, land, sea, space, cyberspace--and is       continually eroding. America has no pre-ordained right to       victory in the battlefield.    That is Secretary Mattis, who is the Secretary of Defense.   Army General Allyn said:         We've had most of our modernization programs on life       support for the last several years. Currently, our       modernization is 50 percent of what it was in 2009.    This is a good quote, too. This is from Navy Admiral Moran. So this  is not just me saying this; this is where I got the information about  the Hornet fleet. The Hornet is the F-18. He said:         For our entire Hornet fleet . . . we have 62 percent that       are not flyable. More than half. We're double where we should       be in non-flyable aircraft.    General Walters said:         I can tell you today we cannot [fight two conflicts]       simultaneously.    That is supposed to be our policy, that at a minimum--ever since  World War II--we would be able to and have the capability of fighting  on two fronts simultaneously. We can't do it.   General Wilson:         We're at about 50 percent readiness today, across the Air       Force. We [were] . . . the smallest Air Force ever in 2016,       when we bottomed out at 310,000.    I could go on and spend a lot of time talking about this, but I can't  find anyone in the military who disagrees. That should be a foregone  conclusion if our own military--they are the ones who are responsible  for protecting my 20 kids and grandkids from enemies.   I just got back from the South China Sea. We have a lot of really  good allies there. We have the Philippines, South Korea, Guam, Japan,  and Taiwan. They have been our top allies, but do you know what is  happening in the South China Sea? China is out there doing something  totally illegal. They say that they are reclaiming land. They are not  reclaiming it because they don't have it to start with. They are  creating land that is out there in the seaways that we need to defend  America and to keep our commerce going, and they are building islands.  Right now they are up to over 3,000 acres of islands. This is China we  are talking about. What are they doing over there? They have runways.  They have rockets. They have military equipment. There is nothing there  except military equipment. It is almost as if they are preparing for  world war III.   So where are our allies? We talked to our allies. They are  embarrassed because they are not sure whose side they are going to be  on. In fact, it is almost as if they put this in on purpose, where you  would have the Secretary of Defense or the Minister of Defense, in  whichever of these countries I mentioned, on one side saying ``Well,  you know, the threat is not all that great,'' and the other one is  saying ``Yes, you have to do something because the world is coming to  end.'' Well, they are on both sides of this issue.   It is fascinating. It is almost as if they got together, and they are  doing it by design. Has this ever happened since World War II in our  country? No, it hasn't. That is where we are right now.   We have problems that are facing our military; they are very real.  This is something that has to be fixed. This bill corrects a lot of  these things. We have defense now up to $700 billion. I am going from  memory here, but I think the last request that came from President  Obama was $548 billion. This is $700 billion. We are rebuilding. We are  trying to address the threats from both Russia and China.   By the way, I want to mention that there is one other threat in that  same area where we were, in North Korea. I am sure everyone knows who  Kim Jong Un is. He is the head guy of North Korea. Something happened  on November 28. On November 28, he fired a rocket that had a range that  could reach the United States of America. It could certainly reach  where we are today. Some people say that can't be true. All they can  say is--they fall into two areas of disagreement. They say: Yes, he has  the range to reach us, but he couldn't carry a payload. We have no idea  what payload was on this rocket that he sent. Let's assume there is no  payload at all. It would be a matter of days before they make that up.  Then they said that he couldn't reenter. Reentry is always a problem  because to reenter you have to come in and have some level of accuracy.  So you can't reenter there without accuracy.   Well, what difference does it make if they have a weapon that could  take out a city the size of St. Louis? It doesn't really matter where  it lands, so that is a hollow argument. The power is right there.   I have to compliment our President. I hesitate doing it this way  because a lot of people don't understand. Remember when Kim Jong Un  made the statement in which he said: Ah-ha, on November 28 I showed  that I could reach the United States of America, and therefore I have a  button I can press, and I could take out an American city--or words to  that effect.   Instead of the policy of appeasement that we had for 8 years prior to  this President coming in, this President said: Yes, and I have a  button. It is bigger than yours. Ours works, yours doesn't, and we will  blow you off the face of this Earth. That doesn't sound diplomatic does  it? It is not. That is what is good about this President. He is not  afraid to stand up and be strong. The policy of appeasement hasn't  worked. It has never worked.   So what happened? Hours after he made that statement to Kim Jong Un,  Un called South Korea and said: You know, we have changed our mind. We  are going to send people to the Winter Olympics.   Wow, that is a major change. I can remember saying that in one of our  own committee hearings, and even our own Intelligence Committee said:  Well, he didn't really mean it. It was just a matter of days after that  when he called and said: We want to negotiate, sit down and talk to  President Trump, and we will even put things on the table, like  denuclearizing. This is going to happen.    That is another threat. What I am trying to get across is that those  threats are there. In my opinion, that is something that is actually  working.   In this bill, we have $700 billion. We have $61 billion over the  enacted levels of fiscal year 2017. We have a 2.4-percent pay raise for  our kids out there. We have $11.5 billion for missile defense.   One of the areas where I was most critical of the last budget that  was put together by President Obama was missile defense. If there is  ever any time in the history of this country where we have to have  missile defense, this is it. They are out there right now. They have  the capability; they have missiles that will reach us. We need missile  defense.   We have ground-based interceptors. I was just in Alaska the other  day. They now have 44 ground-based interceptors up there. What is  really interesting about that is we had 44, and then the last President  came in, and he knocked that down to 32, I think it was. Then, as soon  as this President came in and looked at it, he went back to 44. Now we  are looking at 20 more.   Is that going to give us the redundancy to protect my 20 kids and  grandkids from somebody coming in? Well, it is a lot better than it  was, and we are getting all kinds of new equipment in order to try to  knock down--the big mistake we made in this country was when we were  planning to put ground-based interceptors in Poland, in  [[Page S1928]]  the Czech Republic, and a radar there that would protect the eastern  half of the United States and Western Europe. That was already started  when Obama came into office. In his first year, he pulled that program  down.   One of the persons whom I have always liked over there is Vaclav  Klaus. He was the President. When I was over there, I could remember so  well saying: We have to have your cooperation, the Czech Republic, to  protect America.   He said: Are you sure? If I do this and I outrage Russia, they are  going to be angry and take every step against us they can. You will not  pull the rug out from under us?   I said: Absolutely, we are not going to pull the rug out from under  you.   That is the first thing Obama did when he got into office. That is a  problem we shouldn't have.   The threat is there. We are trying to meet the threat. This bill  meets that threat. It gets us back to the amount of money that should  have been left in missile defense. It is in there right now.   We have another $11.5 billion for missile defense, and it is a 44- percent increase from 2017. The O&M budget right now is increased. The  total budget is going to be $238 billion. That is to offset the losses  today that the O&M budget has created.   This budget that we are going to be voting on is a big budget. Those  of us who are going to be voting for it are getting criticized. I will  say this: The liberals all like it. They like to spend money.  Conservatives don't. I don't like to do it.   That is all in this bill--57,100 troops over Obama's 2017 cut. We  were not going to have--anyway, this is why we absolutely have to do  this.   I look and I see that it would be nice if we had the comfort of  believing that America is still the strongest out there, that we have  everything we need, but we don't.   So let's look at what we are going to be doing. The Army, from a high  point of 566,000 soldiers during the surge in 2007--Obama reduced it to  just over 460,000. Thirty-three percent of the brigade combat teams  didn't work. The aviation combat teams didn't work. We are on the road  to recovery on this because we did a supplemental. We all remember  that. But it is this budget that is going to bring us back, and we will  end up having our military in the position that the American people  think it is in right now.   I was on a TV show just a few minutes ago, and they said: Well, you  know, with all this debt that is coming with this, and you are talking  about the military--isn't that a good tradeoff?   I said: You can't trade off something when you see the threat that is  out there, which is unprecedented in the history of this country, and  you have 20 kids and grandkids to protect. No, that is not a good  tradeoff.   I am hoping that those individuals who are conservatives--and I can't  imagine that anyone on the Senate Armed Services Committee who deals  with these issues on a daily basis would not want to get in there and  make America strong again. We can do it, but if you don't vote for  this, it is not going to be done. That is the great fear that I have.   I hope the conservatives out there--I know for a lot of us, ratings  always happen. You cast a vote, and they say: Ah, that is spending a  lot of money. We are going to rate against you. Again, it is a  tradeoff. It is defending America. That is the one thing we should be  doing.   I would give anything if we could just pull that element--all that we  are doing for the military--out of this budget and do it individually.  Let me stand up here and read the riot act about what is happening in  this country, the debt that is accumulating, but, unfortunately, I  don't have that option today.   We have one vote where we can do it. That is going to be the vote  that we do, hopefully, tonight. I am not sure when it is going to be. I  just ask my colleagues to understand the threat facing our country--in  my opinion, the greatest threat we have ever had.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
