 Madam Speaker, North Carolina is a hub of innovation and  diversity. People with roots from all over the world have come together  to build a prosperous and growing community in our State.   My district is stronger because of its diversity, and we need an  immigration system that reflects North Carolina's needs and values.   I believe it is possible to have a fair and efficient immigration  system while also protecting our national security and ensuring the  safety of American citizens.   That is why I was discouraged that, with title 42 set to expire, the  majority chose to advance partisan legislation rather than bipartisan  solutions that can pass the House, Senate, and get signed into law.   Likewise, while the administration announced several short-term steps  leading up to the expiration of title 42, it was too little too late,  and now Congress must act.   It is unfortunate that addressing the situation at the southern  border has become a political issue. Border security is not a Democrat  or Republican issue. It is an American issue that we must address.   I was proud to join a bipartisan coalition of Members to introduce  legislation that will secure the southern border while giving us more  time to enact meaningful, long-term reforms to our overburdened  immigration system.   The legislation is the House companion to the one introduced by North  Carolina's own Senator Thom Tillis and Arizona Senator Kyrsten Sinema.  I am proud to join this effort with Congressmen Golden, Ciscomani, Don  Davis from North Carolina, Fitzpatrick, Valadao, and Nunn.   This legislation grants the Biden administration a 2-year temporary  expulsion authority for migrants who enter the U.S. illegally and  serves as a proactive measure to tackle the expected surge of migrants  at the southern border.   Importantly, this legislation also ensures that migrants facing  persecution or torture due to their membership in social, political, or  religious groups will not be subject to expulsion. Furthermore, border  agents will have the discretion to exempt migrants on a case-by-case  basis.   The urgency of decisive action at our southern border cannot be  overstated, and this legislation will help in both the short term and  the long term.   In the short term, it would effectively extend title 42 restrictions.  It would equip the U.S. Customs and Border Protection with the tools  and resources to secure our borders and keep Americans safe.   In the long term, this legislation grants more time for Congress to  take up and address our overburdened immigration system.   Right now, there is strong bipartisan support for this, and we can  work together to find commonsense solutions that can pass into law.   I believe in strong border security and improving technology at our  ports of entry. I also believe people who wish to come to our country  seeking a better life deserve a pathway to visas or citizenship that  doesn't take decades to complete.   North Carolina's economy relies on immigrants to come here on skilled  work visas, and I will work to find solutions to address the visa  backlog and expand processing. We should address the root causes of  migration with a comprehensive approach that includes not only  immigration policy but also economic development, humanitarian aid, and  diplomatic engagement.   As a member of the Problem Solvers Caucus and member of the New  Democrat Coalition's Immigration and Border Security Task Force, I  remain focused and committed to working across the aisle to secure our  border and advance comprehensive immigration reform.   A solution to our broken immigration system is long overdue, Madam  Speaker. Let's work together to secure our borders and ports, create a  pathway to legal status for undocumented immigrants already in the  country, and reform our visa system so we can strengthen economic  development.                            ____________________
