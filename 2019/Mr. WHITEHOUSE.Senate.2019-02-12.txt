 Madam President, I guess I am here to follow my  friend Senator Graham and bring the opposing view regarding Mr. Barr.   I offer my appreciation to the chairman, as he leaves, for the way  that he conducted the hearing. I know that he offered his appreciation  to the ranking member, but the hearing, I thought, was well handled.  Everybody had a chance to ask their questions and say their things, and  I think the comments that the chairman made afterward about trying to  bring the committee together were well received on my side.   There are a number of problems, however, that I have with this  nominee. Many of them relate to continuing problems in the Department.  One, in particular, I warned Mr. Barr about in a letter that I sent to  him beforehand in order to make sure that he wasn't surprised by the  question and so that I could get a proper, thoughtful answer. The  problem is that the Department, for purposes of recusal analysis and  for purposes of conflict analysis, takes a look at what people's  different financial entanglements are and who they worked for  before. It is a fairly standard process, but there is a big gaping hole  in it. The big gaping hole in the process is that when it was set up  originally at the beginning of the Obama administration, the Supreme  Court hadn't yet decided Citizens United, so the flood of unlimited  special interest money that poured into our politics, which quickly  became unlimited, special interest dark money, was not then a problem.    Also, you didn't see a lot of Democrats who had a lot of engagement  with dark money coming to high office, but with the Trump  administration that all changed, and we now have an Acting Attorney  General, Mr. Whitaker, who was paid $1.2 million through a group called  FACT. Basically, FACT is a front group. It does no business. It has no  product. It provides no service. It basically just pays Mr. Whitaker to  go on talk shows and criticize Democrats. There are very few employees.  The only employee I am aware of, other than, perhaps, clerical people,  was actually Whitaker himself, so one would like to know why he was  paid that money and who paid him in order to do proper recusal and  conflict checks.   But here is what is interesting: The money that came in to pay him  through FACT, before it got to FACT, had been laundered through another  group called Donors Trust. Donors Trust is another group that does no  business, has no service, creates no product, manufactures nothing. Its  purpose for existence is to strip the identities off of big donors-- ordinarily it seems big Republican special interest donors--so that the  money they then give goes anonymously to groups that pretend they are  not fossil fuel funded, for instance, because the identity of the  fossil fuel donor has been stripped clean, or they are not the tool of  the Koch brothers because the Koch brothers' identity has been stripped  clean. It is a device for misleading and confusing people. When you  consider how much of that $1 million went through to Mr. Whitaker in  salary, the idea that he doesn't know who was paying him when so much  of FACT's money came through that one donation is really improbable.   He was questioned on this in the House the other day. I don't think  he was truthful. I think he does know, and I hope--hope--that the House  will pursue with subpoenas finding out who the donor was so that we  actually know, because I think he does. Obviously, the donor does.   So what we have now is a situation where the Acting Attorney General  of the United States potentially has a $1 million conflict of interest  that I believe the Acting Attorney General knows about, that the donor  with whom he has a conflict of interest obviously knows about, that has  been hidden from the rest of us through laundering through Donors  Trust, and that is not an environment that is conducive to proper  recusal and proper conflict-of-interest assessment.   It is very poor practice, and if it weren't for the fact that dark  money is so important to big Republican donor interests, I think people  would readily clear this up. If the shoe were on the other foot, my  colleagues on the other side would have steam coming out of their ears  to get to the bottom of this. But because what is likely to be revealed  is a big Republican donor, suddenly there is this massive disinterest.   Mr. Barr proposed himself as the person who is going to come to this  office to defend the Department of Justice, to put the institutional  interests of the  [[Page S1268]]  Department of Justice first, to protect it from the vagaries of the  Trump administration. Yet when he was asked about this, he completely  fell down. He offered no sensible or reasonable assurances, so that  concerned me a little bit.   I then went on to ask him, since the Department of Justice has a  National Security Division, which oversees counterintelligence work,  and since the Department of Justice contains the FBI, which does the  counterintelligence investigations to protect our country, I asked him  this: In a counterintelligence investigation, in operating to protect  our country in this counterintelligence function, what should the  Department of Justice know about business or other entanglements of  senior officials with foreign interests and powers?   The very heart of counterintelligence is to look at American  officials and see what their vulnerabilities might be to influence or  control or manipulation by foreign interests and powers. That is the  goal of doing counterintelligence in the first place.   So what evidence do you need to be able to do that? Obviously, it  would be helpful to know what business or other interests with foreign  powers senior officials have so that you can make that assessment, so  you can follow whatever leads that might produce, that may give you  understanding of things that otherwise seem inexplicable. It is obvious  evidence to support the FBI's counterintelligence function.   Rather than give a straight answer and say ``Yes, this is obvious  evidence, and obviously we will do our counterintelligence function  better when we know when senior officials have foreign business  entanglements,'' again he completely fell down in his answer and  started quarrelling about what Senators have to declare and wouldn't  give a straight answer. Well, there is an obvious reason he wouldn't  give a straight answer. The obvious reason he would not give a straight  answer is that the President who appointed him has significant-- although we don't understand them well yet--significant business  entanglements that we don't know about. We need to find out what his  business entanglements are, and it is really hard to assess some of his  behavior without knowing who is on the other side of his foreign  business relationships and how much money is involved and how much is  at risk for him. That is pretty elementary stuff.   If you are the person who is telling yourself, as the Attorney  General, who is going to come in and be the institutionalist and defend  the prerogatives of the Department, defend the procedures and protocols  of the Department against a President who respects none of that and who  has those very entanglements, to then come in and say ``You know what,  I am not going to be interested in any of that; I am, instead, going to  ask counterquestions back to you about other different officials''--the  inability to get a straight answer to that question signals a great  deal to me about when, in a pinch, he has to choose between defending  the Department and protecting the political interests of the President,  which way he is going to go. I gave him that choice in that question. I  gave him that choice in that question, and he very clearly came down on  the side of protecting the political interests of the President.   If you can't get through a hearing question without flipping away  from the interests of the Department and protecting the President, good  luck when the pressure is really on. He lost enormous credibility with  me in his inability to answer those questions.   It is really hard to determine recusal for conflict of interest if  you don't know who paid $1 million to a senior Department official, and  it is really hard to determine counterintelligence issues if you don't  know what foreign entanglements senior officials have. Those are  statements I would hope would be so obvious as to be indisputable. Yet  this candidate foundered on both of them.   The other issue is the question of Executive power. Again, you would  think that the Senate would be interested in standing up for the  prerogatives of the legislative body since we are the legislative body  and we have a very long and proud tradition.   From that perspective, as a Senator and legislator, I look ahead, and  I see constitutional battles. There are a lot of constitutional battles  that I see coming. The first is going to be, if the President, when he  gets or after he gets the budget measure that we have agreed to here-- hopefully, we have agreed to here; I think it is done--if he decides  that he is going to declare a national emergency and start moving money  around between accounts in order to build his, as I affectionately  refer to it, ``big dumb wall,'' that is a constitutional problem, and  article I of the Constitution says it is the legislature that has the  power to appropriate and spend funds.   So if a President is going to use his own unilateral declaration of a  national emergency to say to Congress ``Sorry, your power of the purse  is not actually all that real; it is the power of advice to me, and as  soon as I declare a national emergency, I can spend your money where I  want,'' that violates the separation of powers. That is a  constitutional battle, and one can see it coming.   Executive privilege is a constant constitutional battle between  Congress and the executive branch. Congress wants information; Congress  seeks information; Congress needs information to perform its  constitutional oversight function. But certain narrow communications  within the executive branch are protected from Congress's right to do  that in order to protect certain conversations and freedoms directly  around the President of the United States as he has conversations. That  is the general understanding of how executive privilege works.   Well, this administration has a very different understanding of how  executive privilege works. They think that you get to come into a  Senate hearing and not answer a question because some day maybe  somebody else might exert executive privilege as to what you have said.  But there is no deadline ever; there is no check ever; there is no day  of reckoning ever. They just assert it, and because we have not  enforced our powers here, they have gotten away with it. So executive  privilege has grown into a swamp of executive obstruction of  congressional oversight. We have to bring executive privilege back to  its true base and its true roots, and as we try to do that, guess what.  That is going to be another battle between the legislative and  executive branches--another constitutional battle.   The question of whether or not the President can be indicted by a  grand jury is another constitutional battle we have coming, very  likely. We will have to see what the special counsel and the other  Department of Justice investigations into this President and the people  around him reveal, but they could very well reveal sufficient evidence  to justify an indictment of anyone else who is not the President.   Within the Department of Justice there is a group called the Office  of Legal Counsel, which is kind of the legal advisor to the Department  of Justice. The Office of Legal Counsel has decided that a Department  of Justice cannot indict a sitting President. Here is the problem with  that. The Office of Legal Counsel isn't elected by anybody. They are  career people. They tend to be hypersmart, but their purpose in life in  opining on the separation-of-powers questions is to describe the  maximum possible credible scope of Executive power. They represent the  executive branch, and when they are making these separation-of-powers  decisions, they always veer to the maximum greatest Executive power  that they can justify. That does not mean that a court would agree with  them. That does not mean that a court would agree with them.   Ever since Marbury v. Madison, it has been the constitutional power  of the courts, particularly the Supreme Court, to say what the law is.  The question of whether a President can be indicted is a question of  what the law is regarding the indictment of a President. So that  question ought to be decided in a court, but as the Office of Legal  Counsel is never going to let a case go forward, then how is the  Department ever going to get that opinion that it has tested in court  to get a real answer under the constitutional system? Well, they  probably will not. It is going to be difficult. We are going to have to  try to find a way, if they do assert that, to get that proposition  tested in a court instead of relying on  [[Page S1269]]  the opinion of a group of lawyers within an executive branch Agency as  to the relative powers of the courts and the executive branch.   The question of interference with these investigations by the  President and the independence of those investigations also raises a  variety of constitutional questions.   I have to say the top line of Mr. Barr on all of these issues was  fantastic. I was kind of mentally cheering when he said some of the  things he said about how he was going to keep his hands off, how he  respected Mueller, how this was no witch hunt, how he was going to make  sure it had full scope, how he was going to try to get the maximum  transparency about the final report that he could--all of which was  fine--and then we went into the weeds a little bit.   As the old saying goes, the devil is in the details. The question was  serious enough that I raised it in the committee after the hearing  because I was unsatisfied with his responses. Chairman Graham was kind  enough to acknowledge that those were pretty darn good questions, and I  should get an answer to them. He said he would try to get an answer for  me, and maybe we would get on the phone together to get Barr those  answers. That did not come to pass.   Instead, I wrote Mr. Barr a letter, asking him to clarify his  answers. I got back a letter that provided no clarification at all. So  I have given him quite a few chances to try to answer these questions.  I haven't gotten a straight answer back, which makes me a little bit  worried.   Here is the problem--there are actually two problems. At the end of  the day, whenever the Mueller report is concluded, that report can be  provided to Congress, but there is considerable flexibility and  considerable discretion within the Department of Justice and the  Attorney General's office as to how much to give.   I will interrupt because I see the distinguished majority leader  here.   I yield the floor to the distinguished majority leader.    Thank you, Leader.   Madam President, as I was wrapping up, I was pointing out that at  some point there is likely to be a report that comes out of the special  counsel's investigation, and there will be some material in that report  that is properly stripped out of it before it is provided to the  public.   The two things I concede are proper to strip out of it are classified  national security information that could reveal sources and methods of  our intelligence operations, and the second is private and personal  information, particularly related to witnesses, that is not necessary  to the public's understanding of the report--people's phone numbers, or  email addresses, or other private information. Those are very clearly  appropriate to redact from the report.   There are two other ways in which the Department of Justice could go  into the Mueller report and just gouge great tranches of material out.  One would be if an assertion by the President was made of executive  privilege and if, without any contest or without any formative review  or court review, the Attorney General simply agreed with the assertion  of executive privilege by the President.   We have seen these extreme, almost wild, unlimited assertions of  executive privilege by members of the Trump administration. There has  never been any discipline or proper process about it. There has never  been any enforcement. So it is a wide-open field for mischief if the  President decides that big chunks of the Mueller report shouldn't be  disclosed to the public because he asserts executive privilege. Then  Attorney General Barr says: Good enough for me. I am not going to let  any of that go to the public or to Congress.   That, to me, is a problem. That door is wide open, and it is the  reason I have my opposition to this particular nominee.   There is a longstanding tradition at the Department of Justice that  when you are undertaking a criminal investigation and you develop, in  the course of that investigation, derogatory information about people-- particularly about uncharged people--you don't get to just spill that  out into the public record.   The bad deed that was done by Jim Comey was to violate that  Department rule and disclose derogatory investigative information about  an uncharged person--specifically, Mrs. Clinton. That violated  longstanding procedures and principles in the Department and kicked up  a lot of criticism, including by me right at the time and since and  also by Attorney General Barr. He stands, I think, in the best  traditions of the Department to condemn the release of derogatory  investigative information about an uncharged person.   The rule as a prosecutor is, if you are going to say it, save your  pleadings. Charge the guy. Put it in the indictment. Put it in the  criminal information. Then defense can fairly react. Then you are  accountable to the court for what you are saying, and then there is  some discipline to it, but you don't get to describe unrelated or  uncharged conduct that just happens to be derogatory.   That actually continues on through the whole criminal case. You are  not supposed to do it at any point. If you have something to say about  the evidence in the case, you plead it in a pleading before the court;  otherwise, you keep your mouth shut, and you stand on your pleadings.   The problem comes when that rule gets applied in this case, and here  is the circumstance: The Mueller report comes down, and it is full of  derogatory information about the President and the people around him.  But because the Office of Legal Counsel, as I described earlier, has  decided that you can't charge a sitting President with a crime, now  that President is an uncharged person--not because there wasn't an  indictment to be brought against him, not because he didn't engage in  criminal conduct, not because the government wouldn't ordinarily  prosecute that case to the full extent of the law, but simply because  of this little policy at the Office of Legal Counsel that you can't  indict a sitting President--one that has never been tested in court and  one that I think will fare badly in court if you look at the precedence  of Nixon and Clinton and others.   So now, with the President an uncharged person, do you then call in  this doctrine and say: Hey, all derogatory investigative information  about this uncharged person is now no longer amenable to disclosure to  Congress or the public.   It is a complicated situation, but it is easy to get there, and once  you are there, the answer ought to be ``Well, obviously no,'' but I  couldn't get that answer. I couldn't get a straight answer. Over and  over again, despite the terrific top-line assertions Mr. Barr made,  when you drilled down into the weeds, you couldn't get a straight  answer, and when you tried, very often it was an easy answer to give,  and you couldn't get that easy, straight answer. In those cases, it was  a choice between the policies and the protocols and the propriety of  the Department of Justice versus the political interests of the  President's.   If I can't get a good answer to a simple hearing question that  properly puts the weight where it belongs to support the protocols and  the procedures and the propriety of the Department of Justice, then  when it is not so public and when the pressure is really on and when  hard decisions have to be made, it is impossible for me to believe that  he won't lean toward yielding to the President rather than defending  and honoring the Department. That, for me, is enough reason to oppose  this nomination.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
