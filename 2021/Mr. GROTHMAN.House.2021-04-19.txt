 Madam Speaker, I rise in honor of the great Bernell  Trammell of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, who owned eXpressions Journal  Publications, which was located on 915 East Wright Street.   Bernell Trammell was an avid reader and a very religious man who  liked people. He graduated from Lincoln High School in Milwaukee.   Last July 23, he was shot dead carrying a sign for Donald Trump.   I would like to ask the city of Milwaukee to dial up the  investigation for the murder of Bernell Trammell. I believe it is a  shame in Milwaukee that when someone--one of few people--stands up and  announces by a sign that he is voting for Donald Trump that he would be  shot dead.   He was an iconoclast, he was a very spiritual man delving in  different religions, and he was all over the political spectrum as far  as the people he endorsed. But while he was carrying a Donald Trump  sign, he was shot down last July 23.   I beg the city of Milwaukee to do something about this horrible  crime.                            ____________________
