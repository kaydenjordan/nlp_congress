 Mr. President, I want to start by thanking our  colleague, the Senator from Minnesota, Ms. Smith, for her steadfast  support for this group of Federal contract employees who were left  behind, and I plan to address my remarks to that subject in one moment.   Before I do that, I just want to call on every Senator to stand up  against the vicious character assassination that is taking place  against patriotic Americans testifying under oath in the House.   Today we are hearing, in the House, the testimony of Lieutenant  Colonel Vindman. Here is an individual who served as an officer in the  U.S. Army, an infantry officer overseas, including in South Korea and  Germany and a deployment to Iraq for combat operations, where he was  wounded in an IED attack and awarded a Purple Heart.   Just a little while ago, the House heard sworn testimony from  Ambassador William Taylor, who is currently our Acting Ambassador to  Ukraine. He also served in the U.S. Army. He served in Vietnam; he  served in Germany. Later, in a different capacity, he served in Baghdad  as the director of the Iraq Reconstruction Management Office. He served  in Kabul, Afghanistan, coordinating international assistance. He was  selected by Secretary Pompeo to be our Acting Ambassador in Ukraine.   So we can disagree on a whole lot of things. We can also reach  different conclusions based on the facts. But I hope every Member,  including, importantly, our Republican Senate colleagues, will stand up  against the character assassination being launched at these witnesses  who are giving testimony under oath and under penalty of perjury.   It is absolutely disgraceful--this kind of character assassination,  impugning people's motives. These are patriotic Americans.   At the very least, we should agree on that.                              Amendment No. 1044    Mr. President, I also believe we should agree on this important  initiative that has been brought before this body by Senator Smith to  do justice and be fair to contract workers who perform a lot of  thankless and often unnoticed tasks for the Federal Government but who  are essential to its workings. These are cafeteria workers. These are  janitors. These are folks who work in Federal offices not just in  Washington, DC, but all over the country.   When we had that unnecessary and shameful 35-day government shutdown,  we not only locked out a lot of Federal workers from doing their jobs,  not only did the Small Business Administration freeze approvals of  small business loans, which were important to many businesses around  the country, not only did the Department of Agriculture shutter the  farm service centers in rural communities, not only did thousands of  homeowners face long delays  [[Page S6214]]  in loan processing approvals from the FHA, but these Federal contract  workers who, in many cases, are living paycheck to paycheck, went  without pay for 35 days, and they never recouped that pay.   We did the right thing in this body for Federal Government employees.  We recognized that the government was shut down through no fault of  their own. There was nothing Federal workers did to cause the  government shutdown. They wanted to be at work doing their jobs for the  American people, and we recognized that. We recognized that they should  not be penalized for something they had nothing to do with. We should  do the same thing now for Federal contract workers. That is exactly  what this measure will do.   These contract workers typically make between $450 to $650 a week.  These are not people living high on the hog. These are people getting  by day to day.   One of them is Ms. Lila Johnson. She is from Hagerstown, MD. She  worked as a cleaning services contractor for the Department of  Agriculture for over 20 years. She is the primary breadwinner for her  family and is helping raise two grandchildren. During the shutdown, she  struggled with her rent, her car payments, and her life insurance  payments on top of keeping food on the table. She lost $1,600. That may  not sound like a lot to some Senators, but I can tell you it is a lot  of money for someone living paycheck to paycheck, trying to meet the  bills, and who is the family's primary breadwinner.   What this bill is about is making sure Lila Johnson, and others like  her, are not penalized for something they had nothing to do with,  harmed by something that was totally beyond their control.   I thank Senator Smith. I thank our colleague Senator Brown and my  colleague from Maryland Senator Cardin.   I also want to remember, as my colleague from Minnesota did, Elijah  Cummings, who passed away recently--a great Marylander. I knew Elijah  for over 20 years. He committed himself to many causes important to  social justice, both for Marylanders and for every American, and this  was one of them. This is one of the things that he just recognized was  fundamentally unfair--people who were scraping to get by paycheck to  paycheck being punished for something they had nothing to do with-- wanting to show up for work, wanting to show up for work every day but  being shut out and then denied their paycheck. Let's remedy this wrong,  and let's make sure we adopt this measure.   Thank you.   I thank the Senator from Minnesota.   I yield the floor.
