 Mr. Speaker, I rise to highlight an exciting, new  development that builds on Michigan's leadership in the auto industry.   Earlier this week, General Motors and Honda announced a joint venture  to produce an advanced hydrogen fuel cell system. With an investment of  $85 million, this operation will bring new, good-paying jobs, and it  will be based at a manufacturing facility in southeast Michigan. This  is just the latest example of how Michigan continues to be on the  forefront of automotive and technological innovation that has the  potential to revolutionize the industry.   Mr. Speaker, that is not all. A few weeks ago, GM also announced a  plan to invest an additional $1 billion in United States manufacturing,  which will create thousands of jobs for American workers.   With our State's world-class workforce and commitment to cutting-edge  research, Michigan will remain a global automotive leader for  generations to come.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding and  for introducing this legislation and sponsoring it. I rise today in  support of H.J. Res. 37.   We all agree that bad actors who deny workers basic protections and  violate the Fair Labor Standards Act should not be rewarded with  government contracts funded by taxpayer dollars. However, the  Department of Labor's rule effectively blacklists Federal contractors  for alleged violations and would require contractors to defend  themselves against these allegations without being entitled to a formal  hearing.   The Federal District Court has already ruled that the Department of  Labor rule violates contractors' due process rights. Additionally, this  rule is unnecessary because the Department of Labor already has  significant oversight and investigation capabilities to assess  contractor compliance with Federal labor laws.   This rule supersedes agencies' existing authority to hold contractors  accountable under the current suspension and disbarment system. My  question is why don't they use it?   Misguided regulatory policies, like the blacklisting rule, don't stop  bad actors, but they do end up adding new layers of redundant  bureaucratic red tape, harming employers and older workers, disabled  workers, female workers, minority workers, and workers, in general,  alike.   I urge my colleagues to support the resolution of disapproval and  roll back this duplicative and unnecessary rule.
