 Madam Speaker, I rise to honor Sergeant Alipio Arroyo  Ramos. First Sergeant Alipio Arroyo Ramos, resident of Kissimmee,  Florida, was born on January 14, 1949, in Cayey, Puerto Rico.   At the age of 18, he joined the United States Armed Services where he  served proudly for over 22 years. During his time in the Armed Forces,  he obtained a degree in accounting from the University of Maryland and  completed combat medical training at the U.S. Army Medical Department  Center and School in Texas.   In 1969, he volunteered and served in the Vietnam war as a combat  medic where he fought for our Nation and provided critical medical aid  to wounded fellow servicemembers and civilians in the line of fire.   As a result, he was awarded the Bronze Star for his courage in the  Vietnam war. After the Vietnam war, he briefly returned to the civilian  sector and applied his military medical experience with the  epidemiology division of the Puerto Rico Department of Health before  deciding to rejoin the United States Armed Forces on Active Duty.   Upon rejoining, Mr. Arroyo was assigned to multiple posts throughout  the United States and abroad. In 1988, he was stationed in Fort Bragg,  North Carolina, where he successfully passed rigorous training and  evaluations to  [[Page H1006]]  become a member of the United States Special Forces Command, a lifetime  achievement he and his family are proud of to this day.   During his tenure with the United States Special Forces he worked  directly under two different four-star generals. Since his retirement  in 1998, he continues to be an active member of the Disabled American  Veterans organization and is a passionate and fierce advocate for  veterans' rights, particularly those, such as him, who have suffered  the unfortunate and debilitating consequences of having been exposed to  Agent Orange during the Vietnam war. To this day, he continues to adopt  the motto: ``Duty, Honor, Country,'' as his life creed.   First Sergeant Arroyo resides in Kissimmee, Florida, with his wife,  Luz Amary, who has always stood by his side in support throughout his  entire military career. He is the father of three children: Nikolas,  Phillip, Zulimar Arroyo; and three grandchildren, Camila, Valeria, and  Sofia, all of whom he loves dearly.                          Unpaid Government Workers     Madam Speaker, I want to take a moment to talk a little bit  about the shutdown. We are in day 33, since the shutdown began. The  House and Senate came together originally with bipartisan budgets to  try to resolve this. But then on that fateful day, President Trump said  that he will take the mantle and he would shut down the government over  border security.   Over 2 weeks ago, I met with TSA, PASS, and Department of Corrections  employees, and they told me their stories about not being able to make  a mortgage; about not being able to have healthcare and childcare;  about those facing diabetes and cancer.   Last week, I returned back to the TSA in their break room to speak  with workers about how we were going to transport people to and from  work, waiving tolls, addressing diabetes, and childcare, once again.   This past week, I joined Second Harvest Food Bank to help feed  Federal employees because the United States Government is not paying  them. Our Federal workers are about to miss their second paycheck.   Mr. Speaker, I ask the President: How long will TSA protect our  airports without pay; how long will the IRS workers clock in to timely  process our tax refunds if they are not getting a paycheck; and how  long will U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents protect our very  border that we are debating without getting paid?                                time  1045    We can debate and negotiate over border security.   But why, Mr. President, must you hold nearly 800,000 Federal workers  and their families hostage?   Where is the Senate?   We have voted 10 times to reopen the Federal Government. The number  of times they voted: zero.   The offer that was given this week, a temporary 3 years for Dreamers  and TPS refugees for a permanent border wall with $5.7 billion and a  political asylum system that is worse than the current one.   If you are really serious, President Trump, why not make the changes  for our Dreamers and TPS refugees permanent, much like the wall you are  asking for?   Now the House Democrats have a counteroffer. We already put in a $1.3  billion increase for border security in a bipartisan Homeland Security  budget. This was the budget passed by the last GOP Congress. Now we are  adding an additional $1.5 billion to improve our security in a three- part border and security plan: one, more security for our ports of  entry where most of the drugs are coming in; two, more technology at  the border so we know when people are coming across it; and, three,  more personnel.   Mr. President, reopen this Federal Government.   I ask the Senate to get a backbone and act.
