[[Page H8470]]      Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 3630.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.                                time  1600     Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak in support of H.R. 3630,  the Lymphedema Treatment Act. This bipartisan legislation sponsored by  Representative Schakowsky will help Medicare beneficiaries suffering  from lymphedema access needed compression garments.   Lymphedema is a condition caused by a chronic failure of the  lymphatic system that results in the accumulation of lymph fluid and  swelling in various parts of the body. Lymphedema can sometimes be a  congenital condition but is more often a secondary complication of  common health issues like burns or cancer.   Altogether, an estimated 3 to 5 million Americans are affected by  this chronic condition, and if left untreated, individuals have a  higher risk of hospitalization, disability, and even death.   While there is no known cure for lymphedema, it can be effectively  treated and managed. Compression therapy is a critical component of  treatment.   While Medicare covers some lymphedema treatments like compression  pumps, Medicare does not cover the compression garments needed for  ongoing lymphedema management because it lacks the legislative  authority to cover these items.   The Lymphedema Treatment Act will close the unintended gap in  coverage that prevents Medicare beneficiaries from accessing medically  necessary, prescribed compression garments.   I thank Representative Schakowsky for her longtime advocacy on this  issue and the more than 350 bipartisan Members who signed on in support  of this legislation. This bill passed out of the Energy and Commerce  Committee in July by a unanimous vote, and it will help ensure that  patients with lymphedema have access to the full range of treatment  they need.   Mr. Speaker, I urge its passage, and I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to the  gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. Schakowsky), the sponsor of this  legislation and the chairwoman of the subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I also urge passage of this bill, another  bipartisan bill where we all worked together from the Energy and  Commerce Committee, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 4275) to provide for certain reports on enrollment in the  Lifeline program, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 4275         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Ensuring Phone and Internet       Access Through Lifeline and Affordable Connectivity Program       Act of 2022''.       SEC. 2. REPORTS ON ENROLLMENT IN CERTAIN PROGRAMS.         (a) Annual Report on Enrollment in Lifeline and Affordable       Connectivity Programs Through Qualifying Programs.--Not later       than 1 year after the date of the enactment of this Act, and       annually thereafter for 2 calendar years after the calendar       year during which the first report is submitted under this       subsection, the Commission shall submit to Congress a report       on--        (1) enrollment in the Lifeline program by individuals       participating in each of the Lifeline qualifying programs,       broken out by each of the Lifeline qualifying programs, to       the extent the Commission holds or has access to the       necessary data relating to such enrollment; and        (2) enrollment in the Affordable Connectivity Program by       individuals participating in each of the Affordable       Connectivity Program qualifying programs, broken out by each       of the Affordable Connectivity Program qualifying programs,       to the extent the Commission holds or has access to the       necessary data relating to such enrollment.        (b) GAO Study and Report on Efforts To Promote Enrollment       in Lifeline and Affordable Connectivity Programs.--Not later       than 1 year after the date of the enactment of this Act, the       Comptroller General of the United States shall submit a       report to Congress identifying outreach and publicity efforts       to promote participation and enrollment in the Lifeline       program and, separately, the Affordable Connectivity Program.        (c) Definitions.--In this section:        (1) Affordable connectivity program qualifying program.--      The term ``Affordable Connectivity Program qualifying       program'' means the programs set forth in paragraphs (1),       (3), (4), and (6) of section 54.1800(j) of title 47, Code of       Federal Regulations, or any successor regulation.        (2) Commission.--The term ``Commission'' means the Federal       Communications Commission.        (3) Lifeline qualifying program.--The term ``Lifeline       qualifying program'' means the programs set forth in       subsections (a)(2) and (b) of section 54.409 of title 47,       Code of Federal Regulations, or any successor regulation.     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 4275, the Ensuring  Phone and Internet Access Through Lifeline and Affordable Connectivity  Program Act of 2022.   Congress has long recognized the critical importance of ensuring that  everyone in this country can access basic communication tools. Indeed,  this body wisely included as a cornerstone of the Communications Act  the directive that rapid, efficient, and nationwide communications  service must be available to ``all people of the United States, without  discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin,  or sex.'' The Communications Act also said that all Americans must have  access to adequate facilities and reasonable charges.   There are two programs, the Lifeline and the Affordable Connectivity  Program, that play a critical role in helping us advance these long- held, universal service goals. They move us closer to closing the  digital divide by allowing millions of American families across the  country to fit high-speed broadband internet access into their budgets.   Both programs are effectively targeted to families that need the help  most, including those who are eligible for Medicaid, the Supplemental  Nutrition Assistance Program, Supplemental Security Income, Bureau of  Indian Affairs General Assistance, and the Veterans and Survivors  Pension benefit.   As we all know too well, a broadband connection is necessary to  participate in our modern economy and society. Families without  broadband are left without equal educational, career, healthcare, and  economic opportunities compared to those with this essential service.   Continuing to strengthen these programs and make them more efficient  and accessible not only benefits those who sign up but all Americans.  That is why I support this bipartisan bill introduced by  Representatives Luria and Katko. It provides us with more transparency  into these programs and can help us better identify opportunities to  maximize their support.   I commend Ranking Member Rodgers and Representative Latta for working  with me to advance this legislation on a bipartisan basis. It advanced  out of the Energy and Commerce Committee unanimously in July by a vote  of 48-0.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to likewise support this  bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 4275.    Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the  aisle to support this bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 6290) to provide for the establishment of a section of the  website of the Department of Commerce that shall serve as the primary  hub for information relating to Federal manufacturing programs, and for  other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 6290         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Manufacturing.gov Act''.       SEC. 2. MANUFACTURING.GOV HUB.         (a) Definition.--In this section, the term ``Secretary''       means the Secretary of Commerce.        (b) Establishment.--Not later than 1 year after the date of       enactment of this Act, the Secretary, in coordination with       the Chief Information Officer of the Department of Commerce,       shall modify the manufacturing.gov website by establishing a       section of the website to be known as the ``manufacturing.gov       hub''.        (c) Functions.--The manufacturing.gov hub established under       subsection (b) shall--        (1) serve as the primary hub for information relating to       every Federal manufacturing program, including the programs       identified in the report of the Government Accountability       Office entitled ``U.S. Manufacturing'' (GAO 17-240),       published on March 28, 2017;        (2) provide the contact information of relevant program       offices carrying out the Federal manufacturing programs       described in paragraph (1);        (3) provide an avenue for public input and feedback       relating to--        (A) the functionality of the website of the Department of       Commerce;        (B) the Federal manufacturing programs described in       paragraph (1); and        (C) any other manufacturing-related challenges experienced       by manufacturers in the United States;        (4) establish web pages within the hub that shall focus       on--        (A) technology and research and development;        (B) trade;        (C) workforce development and training;        (D) industrial commons and supply chains; and        (E) small and medium manufacturers; and        (5) use machine learning to--        (A) identify frequently asked questions; and        (B) disseminate to the public answers to the questions       identified under subparagraph (A).        (d) No Additional Funds.--No additional funds are       authorized to be appropriated for the purpose of carrying out       this section.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 6290.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak in support of H.R. 6290, the  Manufacturing.gov Act.   America's competitiveness helped build the largest, most dynamic  economy in the world. But America's competitiveness is facing  unprecedented challenges.   Once the envy of the world, our manufacturing base has faced steady  headwinds for decades now. Between 2002 and 2020, our Nation's share of  global manufacturing activity declined from 28 percent to just over 17  percent. Five million manufacturing jobs have been lost since 2000.  Investment in America's small and medium manufacturers, the bedrock of  our industrial might, has also declined over the last 20 years by over  $200 billion.   To support economic growth and opportunity, we must ensure that the  United States has a vibrant, thriving industrial base. It must be  capable of developing the technologies and manufacturing the products  essential for economic development and prosperity in the 21st century.  Fortunately, there are dozens of programs across the Federal Government  that provide support for American manufacturing, but today, there is no  centralized repository of information about these programs.   Manufacturing programs cannot have their intended effect if not used,  and programs cannot be used if potential beneficiaries are not aware  that they exist.   The Manufacturing.gov Act requires the Department of Commerce to  ensure that the Manufacturing.gov website serves as the primary hub for  information relating to Federal manufacturing programs. This critical  web page will arm beneficiaries with the information they need to tap  into these vital manufacturing programs.   The Manufacturing.gov Act was unanimously reported out of the  Committee on Energy and Commerce by a vote of 54-0 in July.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from New York (Mr. Tonko), the sponsor of this bill and chair  of our Subcommittee on the Environment and Climate Change.    Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this on a  bipartisan basis. It is certainly a goal of this Congress to bring back  manufacturing and do whatever we can to encourage domestic  manufacturing.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 5441) to amend the Horse Protection Act to designate  additional unlawful acts under the Act, strengthen penalties for  violations of the Act, improve Department of Agriculture enforcement of  the Act, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 5441         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Prevent All Soring Tactics       Act of 2022'' or the ``PAST Act of 2022''.       SEC. 2. INCREASED ENFORCEMENT UNDER HORSE PROTECTION ACT.         (a) Definitions.--Section 2 of the Horse Protection Act (15       U.S.C. 1821) is amended--        (1) by redesignating paragraphs (1), (2), (3), and (4) as       paragraphs (2), (3), (4), and (5), respectively;        (2) by inserting before paragraph (2) (as so redesignated)       the following new paragraph:        ``(1)(A) The term `action device' means any boot, collar,       chain, roller, or other device that encircles or is placed       upon the lower extremity of the leg of a horse in such a       manner that it can--        ``(i) rotate around the leg or slide up and down the leg,       so as to cause friction; or        ``(ii) strike the hoof, coronet band, fetlock joint, or       pastern of the horse.        ``(B) Such term does not include soft rubber or soft       leather bell boots or quarter boots that are used as       protective devices.''; and        (3) by adding at the end the following new paragraph:        ``(6)(A) The term `participate' means engaging in any       activity with respect to a horse show, horse exhibition, or       horse sale or auction, including--        ``(i) transporting or arranging for the transportation of a       horse to or from a horse show, horse exhibition, or horse       sale or auction;        ``(ii) personally giving instructions to an exhibitor; or        ``(iii) being knowingly present in a warm-up area,       inspection area, or other area at a horse show, horse       exhibition, or horse sale or auction that spectators are not       permitted to enter.        ``(B) Such term does not include spectating.''.

(c) Horse Shows and Exhibitions.--Section 4 of the Horse       Protection Act (15 U.S.C. 1823) is amended--        (1) in subsection (a)--        (A) by striking ``appointed'' and inserting ``licensed'';       and        (B) by adding at the end the following new sentences: ``In       the first instance in which the Secretary determines that a       horse is sore, the Secretary shall disqualify the horse from       being shown or exhibited for a period of not less than 180       days.

SEC. 3. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS.         The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 5441.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak in support of H.R. 5441, the Prevent All  Soring Tactics Act of 2021.   This important bill will protect horses from cruel and inhumane  practices. It is necessary because today there are gaps in our animal  welfare laws that have left these innocent animals vulnerable to abuse.   Despite a national ban, the abusive and barbaric practice of soring  continues. Soring is a process of applying an irritating or blistering  agent to the limb of a horse to accentuate the horse's gait, which may  cause a horse to move with exaggerated high steps. In the 1950s and  1960s, some exhibitors used soring to improve the performance of show  horses. To end this abuse, Congress passed the Horse Protection Act in  1970 to prohibit soring at horse shows, horse sales, and other horse  exhibitions.   Unfortunately, despite this prohibition, soring continues today. The  U.S. Department of Agriculture Inspector General found that the USDA's  program for inspecting horses for soring does not adequately prevent  abuse. According to the Inspector General, the program faces  significant limitations. There are inadequate inspections and  enforcement as the USDA relies on industry inspectors with inherent  conflicts of interest. The Inspector General also found that there is  insufficient information sharing and distribution, which has made it  more difficult to punish violators and enforce suspensions.   The PAST Act will help end this intolerable abuse of horses by  strengthening the protections and penalties for soring. This  legislation requires the USDA to prescribe regulations for the  licensing, training, assignment, and oversight of people responsible  for detecting and diagnosing a sore horse. It also increases penalties  to imprisonment up to 3 years and fines up to $5,000 per violation. The  legislation mandates that the USDA publish on a website information on  violations to improve the enforcement of suspensions.   I thank Representative Cohen for his leadership on this legislation,  which passed out of the Committee on Energy and Commerce with strong  bipartisan support in September.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support this bill to help  us bring an end to this cruel treatment of horses, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Tennessee (Mr. Cohen), the sponsor of this legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Oregon (Mr. Blumenauer), the chair of the Animal Protection Caucus.    Mr. Speaker, I have no additional speakers. I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, again, I urge support on a bipartisan basis  for this important bill to protect horses, and I yield back the balance  of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 5502) to require online marketplaces to verify certain  information regarding high-volume third party sellers of consumer  products on such online marketplaces and to disclose to consumers  certain contact and other information regarding such high-volume third  party sellers, as amended.    =========================== NOTE ===========================        November 14, 2022, on page H8477, in the first column, the  following appeared: ------------------------ COLLECTION,  VERIFICATION, AND DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION BY ONLINE MARKETPLACES  TO INFORM CONSUMERS  Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend  the rules and pass the bill      The online version has been corrected to read: ---------------- -------- INTEGRITY, NOTIFICATION, AND FAIRNESS IN ONLINE RETAIL  MARKETPLACES FOR CONSUMERS ACT  Mr. Speaker, I move to  suspend the rules and pass the bill    ========================= END NOTE =========================      The Clerk read the title of the bill.

(c) Enforcement by Federal Trade Commission.--        (1) Unfair and deceptive acts or practices.--A violation of       subsection (a) or (b) by an online marketplace shall be       treated as a violation of a rule defining an unfair or       deceptive act or practice prescribed under section       18(a)(1)(B) of the Federal Trade Commission Act (15 U.S.C.       57a(a)(1)(B)).

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 5502.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak in support of H.R. 5502, the Integrity,  Notification, and Fairness in Online Retail  [[Page H8479]]  Marketplaces for Consumers Act, also known as the INFORM Consumers Act.   In the 21st century, e-commerce is no longer a luxury but a necessity  for millions of Americans seeking to purchase household essentials. For  thousands of businesses across the country, e-commerce sites serve as a  vital platform connecting American producers to consumers worldwide.   Regrettably, online marketplaces have become pervasive sources of  counterfeit, defective, and unsafe goods. The Government Accountability  Office found that 20 of 47 items it purchased from third-party sellers  on popular consumer websites were counterfeit.   Sixteen percent of counterfeit products seized in fiscal year 2018  posed a direct risk to health, safety, and security. Such frauds steal  market share from legitimate businesses and can cause severe  reputational damage to the companies and products they impersonate.   The INFORM Consumers Act will help curb the deluge of counterfeit,  defective, and unsafe products on e-commerce sites. The bill requires  these sites to display critical information about high-volume sellers,  including contact information, business tax ID numbers, and working  email addresses and phone numbers. Such transparency will help prevent  those fake and unsafe goods from getting into our homes and empower  consumers and businesses to seek recourse.   I commend Consumer Protection and Commerce Subcommittee Chairwoman  Schakowsky and Ranking Member Bilirakis for coming together on this  bill. It passed out of the Energy and Commerce Committee by voice vote  last November.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to help protect consumers by  supporting this bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to the  gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. Schakowsky), the sponsor of this  legislation and the chair of the subcommittee from which it came.    Mr. Speaker, as you can see, this bill is truly  bipartisan, and I urge all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle  to vote in favor of it.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
