 Mr. Speaker, Jessica and Brandon Batten of Johnston  County, North Carolina, have received the distinct honor of being  selected as the 2019 National Outstanding Young Farmers of the Year. No  couple is more deserving of this award than Jessica and Brandon.   Brandon has been farming his entire life. He is a sixth-generation  farmer and the third generation of his family's operation Triple B  Farms, Incorporated, where he and his family produce tobacco, wheat,  rye, soybeans, corn, and hay, along with beef cattle. His wife,  Jessica, is an environmental engineer, providing innovative  conservation plans to help increase farm productivity.   Not only are the Battens helping to produce our food supply, they are  also very active members of their community. Brandon is a first  responder for Strickland's Crossroads Volunteer Fire Department, and  both are active in their church.   During a time when North Carolina's farm families have been facing a  great deal of uncertainty, Brandon has been a strong advocate for his  occupation through various farm organizations as well as the promotion  of research and technological advancements in agriculture to help the  industry remain strong.    Mr. Speaker, these are two great young Americans who deserve to have  their hard work and efforts rewarded, and I congratulate them on being  selected for this very distinguished recognition.                            ____________________
