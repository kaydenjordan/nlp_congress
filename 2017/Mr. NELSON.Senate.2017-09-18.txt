 Mr. President, I wish to speak about the Defense bill,  but before I do, I want to give the Senate a report.   Senator Rubio and I have been together quite a bit this past week, as  Florida has not only encountered a hurricane, but this was quite  unusual in that it basically affected almost all of the State of  Florida.   Florida is a big State. If you went from Key West to Pensacola, it is  as far as going from Pensacola all the way to Chicago. That is how big  our State is. With almost 21 million people, it is the third largest  State, with 75 percent of that a population along the coast. Of course,  we know what happens when hurricanes start threatening those coasts.   This was an unusual one because it was first going to hit the east  coast of Florida. That was the track. The National Hurricane Center has  gotten quite good in their ability to project the path and the velocity  of the winds. But once it took an unexpected turn, hitting the north  coast of Cuba as a category 5, its velocity and forward motion were  reduced, and it then took a more westerly path, making landfall in the  Middle and Lower Keys of Florida, where the winds were category 3,  approaching category 4. Residents were not even let back in to see  their homes until Sunday morning.   As of now, although FEMA is present in the Lower Keys--Key West--and  in the Upper Keys--Key Largo--individual assistance and disaster teams  were still trying to get into the areas that had the biggest impact,  the areas around Big Pine Key and Marathon. It is a painfully slow  process. FEMA is having to deal with the problems in Texas and now the  enormity of the storm affecting almost all of Florida. FEMA is  stretched. But FEMA is supposed to bring emergency assistance to  people, organizations, and local governments in the aftermath of a  natural disaster. That will be a work in progress as we go on.   There are places where Senator Rubio and I have gotten personally  involved in asking FEMA to come in, areas in Lee County and Collier  County. Areas where FEMA had not visited, they now have come in--Lee  County, east of Fort Myers, and Lehigh Acres.   The little farming community of Immokalee was exceptionally torn up.  There is a great story there. The university president opened up the  fieldhouse so that a lot of the poor people in Immokalee had a place to  go if they didn't have another shelter. Indeed, they took in some 400  people. Elderly people in an apartment complex whose caregivers had  left were picked up by the sheriff and taken to the university, and the  students cared for them for 4 nights. This is a great example of  Floridians helping Floridians, which we have seen throughout.   This Senator has been all over the State, much of it with my  colleague, demonstrating that the two Senators, in a bipartisan way,  actually get along and were there to try to help the people.   First, right after the storm in the Florida Keys, we saw damage in  Key West and Boca Chica. But that was the back side of the storm. The  eye of the storm had gone farther to the east, so the damage was in the  northeastern quadrant since the most severe winds were in the Big Pine  Key and the Marathon area. The military, the Coast Guard, FEMA, and the  engineers came in immediately after the storm. Floridians helping  Floridians. Americans helping Americans.   Then Senator Rubio and I went to the Jacksonville area. Quite unusual  was that all the extra rainfall had flowed into the St. Johns River  Basin. The river had swollen, and all of that water was trying to get  its normal outlet into the Atlantic Ocean at Jacksonville. But lo and  behold, the winds covering up the entire peninsula moving northward,  now the eye over land between Tampa and Orlando and that northeastern  quadrant of those winds coming from east going west--what did it do at  Jacksonville? It pushed back all of the water that needed to get out  into the Atlantic. That, combined with the incoming high tide--what you  had was phenomenal flooding, an overflowing of the banks of the St.  Johns River in many places in the Upper St. Johns, at considerable loss  of property and considerable distress to the citizens. A good part of  downtown Jacksonville was flooded.   The next day, Senator Rubio and I ended up in a citrus grove in Lake  Wales, FL. Fifty percent of the fruit in this citrus grove was on the  ground. Farther south, 75 percent of the citrus crop was on the ground.  They can't salvage that. That is a huge percentage of the loss. So it  made Senator Rubio and me all the more determined that we are going to  try to pass an amendment to the Tax Code that would give the citrus  growers of Florida--not only because of this loss but also because of  every grove now infected by a bacteria called citrus greening that will  kill the tree in 5 years--that would give the citrus industry a chance  to start over by plowing under the grove of those diseased citrus trees  and replanting new stock that has new promise to outlast the bacteria-- at least for a number of years more than the 5 years that will kill the  tree--until we can find the cure, and we are working on that. But do  that in the IRS Code by allowing them to expense in the first year the  plowing under and replanting in order to save the citrus industry.   Senator Rubio and I were in that grove and saw all of that lost crop.  That was going to be a promising crop  [[Page S5778]]  for the first time in 10 years of declines of the citrus crop because  of the bacteria. This was going to be a good year, but we saw half of  that crop on the ground in that grove, lost, gone. Citrus crop  insurance is not going to really help them--only if it is a much  greater loss.   From there, the two of us went on to a poor part of Florida, east of  Lake Okeechobee, called Belle Glade. A lot of the residences were torn  up by the winds.   This was a hurricane whose winds affected virtually all of the  peninsula of Florida and even reached over into the panhandle as far as  Tallahassee and even other parts west.   In Belle Glade, we served a meal. Charities had come together to  bring food to hungry people because they had no power and they had no  refrigeration. It had been several days since the hurricane, and  therefore they had no food.   From there, we went to another very poor part of Florida, Immokalee,  FL, which I described earlier, which had been torn up considerably.   Whether it was what I just described or whether it was feeding poor  people in Apopka, FL, who at that point had been without power for 5  days, and they had no food because there was no refrigeration, or  whether it was going down to Lehigh Acres, where the Florida National  Guard had organized the distribution of MREs, which are meals ready to  eat, and gallons of fresh water because so many of those homes out in  Lehigh Acres, east of Fort Myers, were on water wells, and without  electricity, there were no pumps to give them water--there are so many  things that we often take for granted. If power is taken away, you  suffer not only because of the 90 degree-plus heat and humidity but  also because you can't even get any water because you are on a water  well.    It was a privilege to be there with the Florida National Guard,  handing out food, handing out water, and talking to those local  residents who are living paycheck to paycheck--and now they have no  paycheck. Where is the FEMA assistant to help them? Because there is no  power, they can't go online to apply for individual assistance. In  fact, they can't pick up the phone because of the intermittent cell  service. Even if they could get a cell signal, they couldn't get  through to the FEMA number. That is why we wanted the FEMA  representatives to come in, and fortunately, just yesterday, they  finally did come in.   It has been quite a couple of weeks--first, anticipating the storm  coming in and getting all of the emergency operation centers ready.  Fortunately, people obeyed the evacuation orders. It was estimated that  out of the population of almost 100,000 in the Keys, there were only  10,000 left. That was a huge evacuation. Those folks did not get in to  find out what was left of their homes until yesterday. You can imagine,  a week after the storm had hit--the weekend before the Keys--all of  that water was in there, setting in with the heat and the humidity, the  mold and the mildew. You can imagine the mess, the cleanup.   All the while, FEMA has to worry about Texas, now Florida, and maybe  another hurricane that is going to come up. It looks as though it is  going to turn out to sea but is still going to have some of the wind  effects along the northeast Atlantic Coast.   Floridians helping Floridians--and then there was a great, great  tragedy that occurred 4 days after the hurricane. Why there is not a  requirement that every nursing home or assisted living facility, an  ALF, have a generator not only for power, for lights, but have a  generator capacity that will run air conditioning units--I think this  is going to be the subject of great debate that I hope will change that  requirement in the State of Florida because eight people died. Eight  people died in a nursing home right across the street from a major  hospital in Hollywood, FL--eight frail elderly, from ages 70 to 99-- eight needless deaths as a result. A criminal investigation is  underway.   All the phone calls that had been made that were not answered, both  to the government as well as to the power company, as reported by the  press, specifically a Miami television station--we don't know all the  facts; they will come out in the criminal investigation. But it is  inexcusable that eight frail, elderly people would die from heat  exhaustion by being left so that their condition deteriorated over the  course of 3 or 4 days.   What is wrong with a regulatory scheme that does not have a backup  generator that would kick in when, in fact, the hospital right across  the street had one? What was the disconnect there? Why did it take days  and days until 911 was called? We will find out in this great tragedy.   I can tell you, the Miami Herald had done a series, over the last  couple of years, of three investigative pieces, which pointed out that  these ALFs and these nursing homes had not been properly managed or  regulated by the State of Florida. That is to be determined.   Hurricane Irma is just another reminder that we are going to confront  huge natural occurrences and maybe, just maybe, people will realize  there is something to the fact that the Earth is getting hotter.  Because of that, two-thirds of the Earth is covered by oceans, with the  oceans absorbing 90 percent of that heat. What happens to water when it  is heated? It expands. Thus, the sea levels are rising.   Mr. President, as we turn to this Defense bill, this is an issue of  national security. As Secretary of Defense Mattis has said, ``Climate  change is impacting stability in areas of the world where our troops  are operating today.''   Maybe we should pay attention to issues like those I have just  described in Florida or maybe in Texas. Or what about tornadoes causing  damage to military depots in Georgia? Or what about the severe heat  canceling military training and hail storms damaging aircraft in Texas?  What about the coastal erosion, not only in Florida but also  threatening early-warning radar in Alaska? What about the wildfires  causing ranges to be closed and the flooding that we saw in not only  Texas but also the flooding damaging military logistics rail in  Louisiana and affecting warehouses containing hazardous materials in  Virginia?   That is why, in this version of the Defense bill that we will pass  today, there is a provision that this Senator had something to do with,  which calls for the Defense Department to conduct a comprehensive  assessment of the threats to the training and readiness of our Armed  Forces and the military infrastructure caused by climate-related  events.   It is critical that we recognize the threat so we will ensure that  our forces and installations are resilient enough to withstand and  quickly recover from all of these natural disasters that we have been  talking about. Not only must we ensure that our military infrastructure  is resilient, we must also ensure that it provides our warfighters with  the space they need to train and the technology they need to stay ahead  of our adversaries.   I have opined on this subject over and over in speeches to the  Senate. I have opined over and over about the Gulf Test and Training  Range that the Air Force needs to make huge investments in for the  precise measurements of all of our sophisticated weapons and our  systems.   I thank Chairman McCain and Ranking Member Reed for their good work  on the bill. It begins to address some of the training and readiness  shortfalls in our military. I look forward to continuing to discuss  this.   I yield the floor.                      Recognition of the Minority Leader
