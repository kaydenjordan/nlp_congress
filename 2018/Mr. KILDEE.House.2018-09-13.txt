 Mr. Speaker, the recent indictments of two GOP House  Members showcases this rampant culture of corruption symbolic of a  government of, by, and for special interests and wealthy donors.   Now, this week, Republicans are trying to rush through their tax scam  2.0, which explodes the deficit to give more money to wealthy donors  and the richest Americans. Because of the first tax scam, some of the  biggest corporations are now on track to spend $1 trillion on dividends  and stock buybacks.   Meanwhile, working class constituents struggle to keep a roof over  their head, pay for healthcare, and put food on the table for their  family.   Democrats want real bipartisan tax reform that creates jobs, reduces  the deficit, and is for the people, not just the ultra-rich.   We want to clean up the corruption and make Washington work for the  people again. This means strengthening our ethics laws to fight special  interests. This means fixing our broken campaign finance system to end  the influence of big-money donors, and this means empowering voters to  demand a responsive, accountable government, one that protects the  right to vote, secures our election infrastructure, and ends partisan  redistricting.                            ____________________
