[[Page H1967]]            SEC. 8. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS.         The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 2523, as amended.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2523, as amended, the  Training in High-Demand Roles to Improve Veteran Employment Act, or  THRIVE Act.   H.R. 2523, as amended, builds off the work of the American Rescue  Plan to deliver employment training quicker and more effectively to  veterans who have lost their jobs due to COVID-19.   The American Rescue Plan was one of the most important pieces of  legislation many of us will ever have the chance to vote on, making  generational investments into veteran healthcare, homelessness, and job  training programs.   Following the passage of that legislation into law, the Department of  Veterans Affairs highlighted some improvements to the law to deliver  job training benefits quicker and more equitably to all Americans,  regardless of where they live.   The legislation before us will get those benefits out quicker to  veterans and will improve the recordkeeping of the Department of  Veterans Affairs and the Department of Labor to ensure veterans are  aware of options available to them to find quality employment.   The THRIVE Act will also see the VA partner with local business  groups to facilitate job placement.   Madam Speaker, in addition, the Department shared with our committee  ways to improve the Johnny Isakson and David P. Roe, M.D. Veterans  Health Care and Benefits Improvement Act of 2020, to improve the  experience for student veterans who are still being impacted by  classroom experiences due to COVID-19.   This is why this legislation, offered by Economic Opportunity  Subcommittee Chairman   Mike Levin and Ranking Member   Mike Bost, is  so timely and important.   This legislation is endorsed by many VSOs, including the Student  Veterans of America, the National Association of State Approving  Agencies, Paralyzed Veterans of America, and Disabled American  Veterans.   I wish to thank Speaker Pelosi and Leader Hoyer for bringing H.R.  2523, as amended, to the floor so quickly. I urge the rest of my  colleagues to support this legislation to ensure VA can deliver  assistance to our veterans as quickly as possible.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Levin), the chairman of the Subcommittee on Economic  Opportunity, the author of the bill, and also my good friend and fellow  Californian.    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 1\1/2\ minutes to  the gentleman from California.    Madam Speaker, I have no further speakers at this time, I  am prepared to close, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I appreciate the bipartisan way in which  we moved forward on this bill. I want to thank all my colleagues, and I  urge all of them to join me in passing H.R. 2523, as amended.   I yield back the balance of my time.
