 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to  Mary Duffy Sheaffer Burton, who passed away earlier this year. I  certainly appreciated Mary's friendship and support over the last  several decades. She was an incredible lady.   Mary made an indelible mark through her works and service to the  Lancaster County community. She was a lifelong entrepreneur, a pioneer  of the manufacturing industry in Lancaster, starting her first business  in her garage, HDJ Company, in 1960, which became a leader in the  design and manufacture of precision machining parts and would later  become specialized medical devices and implants.   Her businesses would employ many individuals over the years, building  lasting relationships with many, positively impacting their lives.   Mary received the Golden Micrometer Award from the Precision Machined  Products Association of America, which is the highest honor of the  industry in 2008 and was a recognition of her outstanding efforts and  achievement.   She was just as devoted to improving her community, generously  supporting, with her time and talents, many organizations which built  Lancaster's thriving arts community, historical organizations, and  organizations supporting women and children.   Mary is survived by her three children, who we express our sincerest  condolences to, Duffy, Mary, and Edward, and by her grandchildren and  her great-grandchildren.   We are sad at Mary's passing, but she brought happiness to the lives  of so many, and for that we give thanks.                           Taxing the Middle Class     Madam Speaker, President Biden is raising taxes on the  middle class. Make no mistake about it. Middle-class Americans are  feeling the squeeze of inflation as well--at the gas pump, at the  grocery store, at the hardware store, and everywhere in between--as a  result of the President's reckless Big Government spending plans.   This irresponsible $6 trillion budget doubles down on taxing the  middle class, breaking his pledge to only tax the wealthy. And we know  he wants to tax the middle class because the President's budget would  let the working- and middle-class tax hikes from the Tax Cut and Jobs  Act expire.                                time  1045    By the way, from 2017 to 2019, the TCJA raised the median household  income by over $5,000. This was a real positive impact for families  across the district that I represent, for families across the country.  And it also led to the lowest poverty rate in history, lifting more  people out of poverty than ever before and historically slow  unemployment.   But, apparently, Biden wants to throw away those policies that built  the strongest economy that we have seen in generations and, instead,  will force greater dependence on the Federal Government.   Even with all of the radical socialist policies included in the  President's budget, their own projections indicate the worst economic  growth of any decade since the Great Depression, at the cost of more  than $17 trillion added to the national debt.   Madam Speaker, the President says he wants to build back better, but  I fear that he will end up building back bankrupt.   America can simply not afford his middle-class tax hikes and  socialist spending wish list.                            ____________________
