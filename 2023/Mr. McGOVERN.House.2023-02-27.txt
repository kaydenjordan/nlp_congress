 Mr. Speaker, this week, millions of Americans will see  their SNAP benefits drastically reduced when emergency allotments end.  These supplemental benefits have been a lifeline for families, and I am  deeply disappointed they are ending.   In Massachusetts, SNAP benefits will be reduced by $100 per person  per month. One family in western Massachusetts, for example, says the  reduction will mean having to choose between healthy foods or therapies  for their young son with Down syndrome. There are thousands of other  heart-wrenching stories just like this.   Thankfully, our incredible Governor, Maura Healey, has a proposal to  extend 3 months of State-level partial payments. I support the  Massachusetts State legislature acting as quickly as possible on her  proposal. I encourage other States to look for ways to help ease the  cliff for SNAP recipients.   In the upcoming farm bill, Congress must thoroughly examine benefit  adequacy. The average benefit of $2 a meal  [[Page H886]]  just is not enough. We can and must do more to end hunger now.                            ____________________
