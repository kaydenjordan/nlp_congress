 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a very  impressive group of individuals visiting the Capitol this week.   Delegates of the National Center for Learning Disabilities have  traveled from all over the country to advocate for themselves and their  peers.   When it comes to learning, each of us must deal with our own unique  challenges. These young people face some particularly difficult  obstacles, including dyslexia and dysgraphia, which interfere with the  brain's ability to interpret information.   But they have not let these obstacles prevent them from doing great  things. They have persevered, working hard, not just for their own  success but for the future success of others.   By traveling to Washington to share their stories and discuss  opportunities for governmental and societal change, these young adults  have demonstrated deep commitment to the community of those who have  learning disabilities.   I admire their dedication and hope to use my role as co-chair of the  Congressional Dyslexia Caucus to help them in these efforts. May they  be encouraged to keep up their great work.                            ____________________
