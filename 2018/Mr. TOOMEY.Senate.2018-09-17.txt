 Mr. President, I congratulate the board of directors of  the Jewish Community Center, or JCC, in Allentown, PA as they celebrate  their 100th anniversary. Community leaders and JCC members will gather  on October 4 through 6 to celebrate and honor this remarkable  institution in the Lehigh Valley.   For 100 years, the JCC of Allentown has served as the beating heart  of the Lehigh Valley Jewish community. Through its early childhood and  afterschool programs, sports, wellness, and cultural activities, the  JCC enriches the lives of generations of Lehigh Valley families of all  backgrounds and heritage.   Many JCC members are first introduced to the JCC community in  preschool. Eventually, they are old enough to attend a JCC summer camp,  where they may learn to swim, play basketball, cook, or act in theatre.  As adults, these members may take their own children to a community  Seder, attend the Jewish Film Festival, or practice a healthy lifestyle  of weekly gym sessions. Eventually, many members will participate in  the Friendship Circle and Silver Sneakers programs at the JCC.   If you take a drive through Allentown's historic downtown area, it is  difficult to miss a building called Alliance Hall on the corner of 6th  and Chew Streets. Today, the building is occupied by the Allentown  Health Bureau. A century ago, however, the 19th century Victorian  mansion standing at this location served as the first Allentown JCC.   In 1918, the leaders of the Allentown Jewish community--among them  successful local entrepreneurs, high-skilled professionals, and  survivors of pogroms overseas--were searching for ways to support  younger Jewish immigrants as they integrated into American society and  aspired to fulfill the opportunities offered by the American dream.  They purchased the Victorian mansion, turning it into a focal point for  the Jewish community and especially its youth.   The facility was so popular that, within a decade, it was clear the  JCC would need more space. David Levy, Allentown's first Jewish  architect, graciously donated his services to design a new, larger  building on the same site. That building would be called Alliance Hall,  and from 1928 to 1954, it reliably served the JCC's ever-expanding  membership. The JCC flourished and inevitably had to relocate, one last  time, to where it resides today at 22nd and Tilghman Streets in  Allentown's West End neighborhood.   Most importantly, since 1918, the JCC of Allentown has been the place  where all community members feel welcomed, engaged, and part of the JCC  family. Today it serves over 2,000 members, and I am honored to  congratulate them on the 100th anniversary of the JCC's establishment.                            ____________________
