 Madam Speaker, I am grateful to  recognize the 2022 Army Congressional Fellow, Master Sergeant John  Gardner, for his service to the Second District of South Carolina.   His yearlong service with the office is ending, and John will be  missed. Not only has he been an indispensable coordinator and  contributor to legislative goals, including the National Defense  Authorization Act, but also a valued team player.   Including a combat tour on the front line as an infantry medic in  Iraq, John has held many leadership assignments throughout his 20-year  decorated career in the Army, including most recently in the Defense  Attache Office of the American Embassy in Tashkent, Uzbekistan.   John hails from Houston, Texas. He has a master's degree from  Colorado State and holds two graduate degrees. His next assignment is  in the Pentagon, where John will be a valued participant in peace  through strength.   In conclusion, God bless our troops who successfully protected  America for 20 years as the global war on terrorism continues moving  from the Afghanistan safe haven to America.   Godspeed, Speaker Nancy Pelosi.                            ____________________
