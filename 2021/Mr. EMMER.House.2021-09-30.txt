 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Private  Nicole Burnham. Private Burnham didn't die on the battlefield. Her life  was stolen by the cruelty of her fellow soldiers and the apathy of her  superiors.   There are several tragedies in Nicole's story.   The first is the horrific sexual assault she endured at the hands of  her fellow soldiers.   The second is the failure of our military leadership to protect her.   The third is the amount of time it took to ensure something like this  never happens again.   Nicole did everything right. She reported the incident and applied  for a transfer. Instead, her superiors, who are capable of deploying  soldiers into a war zone overnight, let her request languish for an  unconscionable 82 days. During that time, she was harassed, ostracized,  and assaulted a second time.  [[Page H5565]]    A few months later, Nicole took her own life.   On October 2, the Third Annual Nicole Burnham Veteran Suicide 5k will  take place along the Rum River in Anoka, Minnesota, the town where  Nicole grew up.   We cannot forget Nicole's story, and we owe it to Nicole and her  family to ensure her legacy is one that prevents injustices like she  suffered from ever happening again.                            ____________________
