 Mr. President, so far, the 116th Congress has been full  of a number of dubious measures, as I might characterize them, by our  friends across the aisle as it relates to our healthcare system.   For starters, our Democratic colleagues in the Senate and the House  and on the Presidential campaign trail are hailing Medicare for All as  the gold standard for healthcare in America.   I was here during the debates over the Affordable Care Act, and I  remember President Obama's saying, if you like your policy, you can  keep it and that if you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor.  Neither one of those proved to be correct and true. Yet, here, our  Democratic colleagues have simply given up all pretense and have  embraced a Medicare for All Program that would outlaw some 180 million  Americans' private health insurance policies. In other words, the  policy you get through your employer as part of the fringe benefits of  your employment would no longer be available under Medicare for All.  This is, of course, socialized medicine, which ensures long waits for  substandard care.   Yes, it is true that I have heard some say: ``Well, it is Medicare  for All. Who would want it?'' and others say: ``No. I am for the public  option.'' Both of these are slippery slopes into a single-payer,  socialized medicine healthcare system that will deny consumers the  choices they might prefer to make for themselves rather than to leave  the government to make those choices for them. Not only would this  trigger a lot of disruption, it would also lead to sharp increases in  taxes to fund this, roughly, $30 trillion pipedream.   Last month, Speaker Pelosi managed to take this debate on healthcare  to the next level. It seems like controlling people's healthcare alone  isn't enough. Now they want to run the drug industry too. Forget about  choice. Forget about competition. Forget about innovation. One of the  things that has characterized the American healthcare system is the  lifesaving innovation of drugs. The Democrats want to now have the  Federal Government determine what the formulary is, what drugs are  available to you. They want to set the prices and ensure the  bureaucrats rather than families are at the center of our healthcare  system. They are churning out partisan healthcare bills, one after  another, and taking their party further and further to the left with  every move.   I would like to think, ultimately, cooler heads will prevail in the  Senate, where we have been working on bipartisan bills to bring down  healthcare costs. For example, the Senate's Judiciary, Finance, and  HELP Committees have each passed bipartisan packages of bills to end  surprise billing so as to  [[Page S6272]]  create more transparency when it comes to pharmaceuticals and increased  competition, but that doesn't mean this side of the Capitol is immune  from some of the politics when it comes to our healthcare system.   Rather than following the Speaker's lead in introducing partisan  bills, the Democratic leader in the Senate has taken a different tack,  that of blocking bipartisan consensus bills. For example, there is a  bill I introduced earlier this year with our colleague from  Connecticut, Senator Blumenthal, to bring down skyrocketing drug  prices. Senator Blumenthal is a Democrat, and I am a Republican, but  contrary to what you may see in the media, that doesn't mean we can't  talk to each other or work together in the best interests of our  constituents.   Because Senator Blumenthal and I both sit on the Committee on the  Judiciary, we have been looking at the price hikes that have been  caused by people who game the patent system, specifically something  called patent thicketing. Some drugmakers build a web of patents that  is so intricate it is virtually impossible for competition to go to  market even when the patent on the underlying drug has expired or will  expire soon. They use these so-called patent thickets to hold  competitors at bay and keep prices high for as long as possible.   This is something Senator Blumenthal and I are trying to stop through  our bill, the Affordable Prescriptions for Patients Act. This  legislation would disarm those patent thickets and streamline  litigation by limiting the number of patents companies can use so  competition can go to market sooner.   This legislation passed the Senate's Judiciary Committee in June  without having a single member on either side of the aisle vote against  it. It was unanimous, which is something that doesn't happen all that  often in the Committee on the Judiciary. In the past, something with  this level of support would have quickly sailed through the full Senate  but not today, not on the minority leader's watch. According to a  report in POLITICO, the minority leader is blocking this bipartisan  bill.   With the House Democrats' obsession of impeaching the President and,  apparently, their interest in accomplishing nothing else, the odds of  bipartisan legislation getting done around here are getting slimmer and  slimmer each day. Rather than seizing the opportunity to pass a bill  that will provide relief to the folks we represent who struggle with  the high costs of prescriptions, it is politics 24/7. I am disappointed  in our colleagues' single-minded obsession with undoing the 2016  election and removing the President from office. One of the casualties  of that, though, is the prevention of our being able to pass even  bipartisan bills to help the American people, the people we represent.   I ask here, publicly today, for the minority leader to reconsider his  decision of blocking this bipartisan piece of legislation.   I am afraid the vote our Democratic colleagues have just forced us to  take this afternoon shows just how far they are willing to go to prove  a point, even when the point is not well made, which leaves me with  little optimism that the minority leader will have a change of heart.   As we have heard, the Affordable Care Act has what is known as State  innovation waivers. That is part of what we voted on just a moment ago.  It is important to reiterate that these innovation waivers, which were  a part of the Affordable Care Act, enable States to waive some of the  law's burdensome requirements in pursuit of finding alternative means  of coverage. States can apply for these waivers to change how insurance  subsidies are used, for example, and select a combination that better  fits their States' and their citizens' needs. What works in a State as  big as mine, with 28 million citizens, isn't, maybe, going to work in  the same way as in a smaller State--North Dakota or Delaware.   Washington bureaucrats shouldn't be able to decide what best suits  the needs of my constituents in Texas. That is why these waivers, which  are part of the Affordable Care Act, are so important and why, last  year, the administration gave the States more flexibility to tailor  their insurance plans to suit their constituents' needs. This does not  mean, as we have heard, that the States have an entirely free hand. It  just gives them more flexibility to use Federal dollars where they are  needed most. Unfortunately, our Democratic colleagues are opposed to  these expanded innovation options.   They claim they forced this vote to repeal the rule because it puts  patients' coverage for preexisting conditions at risk, but that is not  true. Section No. 1332 does not allow States to waive ObamaCare's  preexisting conditions' coverage. In fact, these waivers give States  the ability to provide enhanced support for those with preexisting  conditions and high healthcare costs. So far, 13 States have been  approved for these waivers.   It is worth noting on this chart the 1332 waivers that have been  issued this year. Colorado has seen a reduction in premiums by 16  percent; Delaware by 13 percent; Montana by 8 percent; North Dakota by  a whopping 20 percent; and Rhode Island by 6 percent.   So with preexisting conditions covered, and with premiums actually  going down, what is there to object to?   Well, our Democratic colleagues are simply waging a war against a  problem that does not exist, but I guess if you say it often enough and  loudly enough, some people, somewhere, may just believe that coverage  of preexisting conditions is somehow a partisan issue. It is not. They  are grasping at straws as their party unfortunately has gone further  and further to the left on healthcare.   Well, 10 of the 13 States that received waivers are represented by at  least one Democrat in the Senate. Why would you vote for a repeal of a  rule consistent with existing law that would lower premiums for your  constituents which would require coverage for preexisting conditions  unless it is your good sense overcome by perhaps politics?   Our Democratic friends make it seem like coverage of preexisting  conditions is a partisan issue when it is not. We all agree that  patients with preexisting conditions should receive health coverage,  period.   Earlier this year, I cosponsored a bill introduced by our friend, the  Senator from North Carolina, Mr. Tillis, called the PROTECT Act, which  would reaffirm our commitment that no American will ever be denied  health coverage due to a preexisting condition. We believe that  coverage for preexisting conditions shouldn't hang in the balance of a  court decision. It would finally codify what every Member of this body  says they agree with: That all Americans deserve access to health  coverage, specifically to cover preexisting conditions.   All this rule by the Trump administration does is provide the States  with the flexibility to cater to their citizens' healthcare needs, and  there simply was no reason to overturn it, and we did not.   So I would encourage our colleagues to stop daydreaming about pie in  the sky ideas like Medicare for All--simply unaffordable, absolutely  unworkable--or a government-run pharmaceutical industry where the  government sets the prices and says what drugs you or your family can  get access to.   Quit trying to fight the President at every turn and every step he  wants to make. Try to find places where we can work together, and let's  do that by moving bipartisan legislation that will lower out-of-pocket  costs for drugs and improve people's quality of life and standard of  living.
