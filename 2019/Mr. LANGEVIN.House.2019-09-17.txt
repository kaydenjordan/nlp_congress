 Madam Speaker, I rise today on National Constitution  Day to renew my call for expanded civics education.  [[Page H7746]]    The father of our Constitution, James Madison, wrote: ``A popular  government, without popular information, or the means of acquiring it,  is but a prologue to a farce or a tragedy; or, perhaps both.''   Yet, today, it feels as if we are in the middle acts of Madison's  feared drama.   Sadly, only 26 percent of Americans can name all three branches of  government, and 37 percent cannot name a single right guaranteed under  the First Amendment. Meanwhile, public trust in government and voter  participation is low, and foreign adversaries have taken advantage of  this to sow discord among us.   Madam Speaker, I was proud to include a program in the House-passed  National Defense Authorization Act to fund further development and  evaluation of civics education programs, but this is just a first step.  We must ensure that every child has access to evidence-based civics  programs. The future of our democracy depends on it.                            ____________________
