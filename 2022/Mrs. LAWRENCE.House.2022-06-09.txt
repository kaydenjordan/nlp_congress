 Madam Speaker, I rise today to make an urgent plea for  action.   How can we listen to an 11-year-old girl talk about smearing herself  with her own dead friend's blood so she doesn't get killed and think  that the appropriate response is thoughts and prayers. It is  unacceptable.   We have the power to make real change and end gun violence. Right  now, the American people are calling on us to protect their kids, their  family, and their community. I am not going to sit on the sidelines and  neither should this legislative body. If not now, when? Every Member  should support commonsense gun safety legislation. Not taking away your  right to own a gun or your constitutional right, but use common sense,  that, as my grandmother used to say, is not very common today.   Madam Speaker, the people of America are counting on us. Act now.
