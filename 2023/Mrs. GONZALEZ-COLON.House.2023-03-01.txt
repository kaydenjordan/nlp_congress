 Madam Speaker, today I rise to celebrate the  106th anniversary of the people of Puerto Rico being granted their U.S.  citizenship.   Puerto Rico became a U.S. territory in 1898. In 1906, President  Roosevelt called on Congress to confer U.S. citizenship to Puerto  Ricans. On March 2, 1917, the Jones Act was signed into law.   We are proud American citizens, and we are proud of the contributions  we have made to this great Nation. More than 235,000 Puerto Rican  servicemembers have served and have fought in every military conflict  that our Nation has had since World War I.   However, although we are U.S. citizens, the Federal Government often  treats us unequally. I live on the island, and I can tell you that we  no longer want to be treated differently.   We want the same rights and responsibilities as our fellow citizens  in the States, which can only be achieved with statehood.   Like Congress acted 106 years ago to grant us our cherished American  citizenship, Congress has an obligation to act again and make us a  permanent part of the Union as the 51st State.                            ____________________
