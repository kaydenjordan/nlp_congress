 Madam Speaker, I rise today on behalf of  eastern North Carolina.   Today begins the start of Women's History Month. And I would take  this time to acknowledge a group of young women who represent the best  of eastern North Carolina.   During my Live the Dream Down East tour, I had the pleasure of  visiting the Radiant Rays program at the Center for Energy Education in  Roanoke Rapids.   The program allows students to visit colleges and corporate renewable  industries while working with teachers and industry professionals to  extend knowledge beyond classroom walls.   I was honored to spend time with the students of this program who  emphasized why representation matters.   Madam Speaker, we must do all that we can to empower young women and  girls to pursue STEM-related career paths. I will continue fighting to  ensure the next generation of women, like our Radiant Rays, have the  tools they need to thrive in the East.                            ____________________
