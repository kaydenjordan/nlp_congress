 Madam Speaker, this weekend, our Nation will solemnly  observe Memorial Day to honor our fallen heroes and their families.   Instead of this honoring of our veterans, shamefully, the Republicans  across the aisle will spend the weekend working to impose suffering on  our valiant veterans.   The Republicans have forced Americans down a treacherous path to  accept their extreme proposal, which would eliminate 30 million health  visits for our veterans and slash revenues at the VA.   It would trigger a catastrophic default, which would force our Nation  to stiff veterans on the benefits they have earned. That also applies  to the effect it would have on America's middle class.   All this is for the Republicans to pass another massive tax cut,  which they will do in a matter of weeks. That is their plan, to do it  by the birthday of the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, June  16.   Trillions of dollars will be added to the national debt to give tax  breaks to the high end at the cost of the suffering of our veterans.   It is disgraceful. Republicans must stay here and not skip town, work  to avoid a default, and honor the sacred duty of our veterans as we  observe Memorial Day.                            ____________________
