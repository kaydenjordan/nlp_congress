Thank you, Mr. President.   We are starting to hear rumors of what is in the so-called skinny  bill, and it is not skinny. It is humongous. It is filled with all  sorts of conservative priorities, whether it be--these are rumors--the  end to the individual mandate, the elimination that insurance companies  are required to include certain coverages, the denial of funding to  Planned Parenthood. This is not a bill that is designed to go to  conference. This is a bill that is designed to become law.   I just want to put all of the pieces together for folks what we are  hearing tonight, because you are hearing, if you are following this all  across America, different pieces of news emerging from different parts  of this city. Let me try to put it together for you for a minute.   First, you are seeing this skinny bill get fatter and fatter, which  all of a sudden looks like a piece of legislation that is not designed  to go to conference. It looks like a piece of legislation designed to  become law.   It is healthcare arson. It sets the insurance markets on fire. It  immediately takes insurance from 16 million people and drives rates up  by 20 percent on a compounding basis. This is insanity.   It is getting bigger and bigger, which makes you wonder, wait a  second, is this about going to conference or becoming law? Then we got  another piece of information. The White House doesn't support the  conference. The White House likes the skinny bill and wants it to  become law. Then we got another piece of information. The House of  Representatives tomorrow morning will declare what is called martial  law. That is a procedural move that will allow the House to pass the  bill that comes from the Senate as quickly as possible. This isn't  going to conference, this is becoming law. Then the icing on the cake  is the most curious piece of news: a statement from the Speaker of the  House in which he says, not ``we will go to conference,'' he says, ``I  am willing to go to conference.''   Why ``I am willing to go to conference'' and not ``we will go to  conference''? Well, maybe you got the clarification from his spokesman  who said: ``Conference committee is one option under consideration, and  something we are taking steps to prepare for should we choose that  route, after first discussing with the members of our conference.''   Can you see what is happening here? Can you see what is happening  here? This is a bill that is being sold as just a procedural step to  get to conference, but everything else that is happening around it  suggests this is becoming law. Even if I am not right, let's also be  clear about the process. Even if there is a conference, how on Earth is  the conference going to come to a conclusion that the Senate could not?  Right? You are going to introduce the Freedom Caucus to the U.S. Senate  and think you are going to get more functionality and not less  functionality? Even if you get to that conference, it will last for a  couple days, maybe a couple weeks. They will come to no conclusion, and  then guess what. The skinny bill, which is not so skinny any longer, is  there for the U.S. House of Representatives to pass and put into law.  All the while, the President of the United States is cheering that on.  That is the signal he gave you. The President of the United States does  not support a conference. He supports a bill that we are going to have  unveiled later tonight and passed. He supports that bill going into  law.   So even if you get to conference, with the President chiding the  conference to give us and pass the Senate bill, which is available to  the House for passage, that is what the outcome will be.   So for our Senate friends who want assurances that this bill will not  become law, you are getting exactly the opposite tonight.   With that, I yield the floor to the Senator from Minnesota.    Mr. President, this process is an embarrassment. This is  nuclear-grade bonkers what is happening here tonight.   We are about to reorder one-fifth of the American healthcare system,  and we are going to have 2 hours to review a bill which, at first  blush, stands essentially as healthcare system arson.   This bill is lighting the American healthcare system on fire with  intentionality. To use the word ``freedom'' at its center--there is  freedom in this bill. There is the freedom to go bankrupt, there is the  freedom to get sick and not be able to find a doctor, and there is  freedom in this bill to die early. That is not hyperbole. That is what  happens when, overnight, 16 million people lose insurance.   Don't tell us that is because people all of a sudden will not be  mandated to buy it. This is a vicious cycle that happens. When you get  rid of the mandate, every insurance company will tell you that rates  skyrocket because you are not getting rid of the provision that  requires insurance companies to price sick people the same as healthy  people. CBO says that rates go up immediately by 20 percent and then 20  percent after that and then 20 percent after that. So all of a sudden  you can't have the individual mandate because nobody can afford to buy  the product.   There is a lot of freedom in this bill, it is just not the kind of  freedom we all thought was at the heart of this reform measure. This is  real life. It is not a game.   I know lots of Members on the Republican side are voting for this  because they have some promise that even though this bill is terrible-- and everybody admits it doesn't solve any problems--it will get to a  forum in which the problems can be truly solved. That is gamesmanship.  That is not senatorial. That is not what this place was supposed to be.  This was supposed to be the great deliberative body where we solved big  problems, and this bill surrenders to the House of Representatives.   Let's just be honest about what is going to happen when this bill  gets to the House. Maybe there will be a conference committee, but it  will not resolve any of the problems which have been inherent in the  Republican conference here in the Senate. In fact, those problems will  get worse because you will inject the Freedom Caucus into a Republican  conference here that alone wasn't able to come to a conclusion. They  will argue for a couple weeks, maybe a month, and then the House will  decide to proceed with a vote on this bill.   There is nothing in the rules that locks this bill into the  conference committee once it is there. The House can pick it up out of  that conference committee and move it to a vote--and they will do that  because none of the problems that were solved here will be solved  there.   We have seen this happen before. Remember the budget stalemate in  which this hammer of sequestration was created, and the supercommittee  was supposed to solve all the problems the House and the Senate  couldn't? They didn't, and now we are stuck with sequestration-- something nobody thought would happen. This is the same thing.   This will not be a hammer sufficient enough to solve the dysfunction  which has always been present in this process. Thus, the conference  will be doomed, and this bill will become law--raising rates for  everyone, locking millions of people out of the system of insurance,  with no answer for the parents of those disabled kids who have been  begging to get into Senators' offices. This isn't a game. This is real  life. If this bill becomes law, real people will be hurt.   We are begging our colleagues to vote for the motion to commit. Take  us at our word. We want to work with you. We acknowledge there are  still problems that need to be solved, though we maintain there are  parts of the Affordable Care Act that are working. What if we owned the  problem and the solution together? What if this wasn't a perpetual  political football? There is still time for us to work this out  together if you support us and vote for the motion to commit.   This process is an embarrassment to the U.S. Senate. This isn't why  we all came here--and don't delude yourself into thinking that this  bill you are voting on will not become law. There is a very good chance  that it will, and the end result will be absolute devastation and  humanitarian catastrophe visited upon this country.   It doesn't have to be this way.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?    Maybe this time would be better used if you allowed us to  ask you some questions about the bill.
