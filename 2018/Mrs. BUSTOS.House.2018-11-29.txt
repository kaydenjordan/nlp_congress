 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from New York for  yielding me time. I appreciate it.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of my bipartisan bill, the All- American Flag Act. This commonsense legislation will require all  American flags purchased by the Federal Government to be made entirely  in the United States from materials grown or manufactured in the United  States.   The idea for this bill came to me when I was sitting down and talking  with a Vietnam vet. We were at a VFW hall, and he pointed to the  corner, saw an American flag there, and said: Do you know that the  American flag can be made in China?   I was very surprised that that could even happen. I will never forget  when he looked at me and said: ``I didn't fight for China. I fought for  the USA.''   I later learned that, in 2015 alone, taxpayers footed the bill to  import American flags to the tune of $4.4 million, $4 million of which  went straight to China.   Since that conversation, I have worked with my colleagues on both  sides of the aisle to require the Department of Defense to purchase 100  percent American-made flags. With the support of my colleagues today,  we can ensure that all American flags purchased with taxpayer money are  100 percent American made.   There is no reason that the symbol of our Nation, our freedoms, and  our values, proudly worn on the sleeves of our American soldiers or  displayed right here, like right behind me, in our Nation's Capitol  should be manufactured anywhere but in the United States of America.   By purchasing flags made on American soil, we can ensure that the  symbol of our Nation is preserved, while supporting American jobs and  manufacturing.
