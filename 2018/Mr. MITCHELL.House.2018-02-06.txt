 Mr. Speaker, I think everyone can agree here that  continuing resolutions--CRs--are bad policy.   For the folks in the gallery, it is simple. CRs are whether we keep  the lights on or not. They are whether you can call Social Security and  get assistance. They are whether you can figure out what is going on  with your taxes, call the IRS. They are whether or not we actually  function.   Yes, it is going to be our fifth CR. Shame on all of us, and I do  mean all of us.   However, the people on the other side of the aisle, they talk about  all their legislative agenda they want put in the package and passed or  they are going to vote against keeping the lights on. Think about that.   They say: If we don't get DACA, we are shutting the lights off. If we  don't get this, we will shut the lights off.   That is what happened in the Senate the last shutdown.   They say: If we don't get full-year funding for the military, we are  shutting the lights off. If we don't get DACA, we are shutting the  lights off. If we don't get permanent funding for CHIP, we are shutting  the lights off.   It didn't work out very well, did it?   Our fundamental responsibility is to keep the lights on. There is  nothing in this bill that is objectionable. In fact, they have all  passed. This bill supports full-year funding for the Department of  Defense appropriations. This isn't the first time we passed the  appropriations bill for the Department of Defense. We have passed it  three times. And we sent it to the Senate to die a cruel and horrible  death.   Why?   Not because, as was noted by my colleague, that we can't get 51  votes.   We can't get 60 votes.   And where do those votes come from?   On the other side of the aisle, who will do anything to get their  agenda,  [[Page H826]]  including putting our military at risk. People die when we make those  decisions, and they have.                                time  1545    The funding is fully consistent with the NDAA, National Defense  Authorization Act, something that was a bipartisan vote. It provides a  2.4 percent increase to the men and women in the military who put their  lives on the line for our Nation, well deserved, something we also  voted for and supported.   The bill provides full extensions for popular health programs that,  in fact, both sides of the aisle supported, a 2-year extension of  community health centers.   In Michigan, federally qualified health centers serve nearly 650,000  individuals. There are 11 health centers located in my congressional  district. They need the funding. That is why I support it. In all of  your districts, you have community health centers.   But you will argue: Unless we get DACA, we won't fund the military;  we won't fund the health centers. This bill also extends Medicare  policies, providing options for people receiving home care. Again, it  was a bipartisan vote, but now we don't want to support it.   I believe we shouldn't continue the habit of short-term spending  bills. They are offensive to me; they truly are. We passed, in  September, in this House, all 12 appropriations bills and sent them to  the Senate. My suggestion to my colleagues on the other side of the  aisle is, rather than lecture us about math--I can count to 60. I can  get between 51 and 60. I suggest you make a phone call to some of your  colleagues in the Senate and tell them to do their job and bring up the  appropriations bills. If they don't like what they are, amend them, go  to conference, rather than just obstruct the functioning of our  government.   The most fundamental responsibility we have is to keep the lights on,  is to defend this Nation. If we are not doing that, I have to wonder  what we are doing for a job.   So I suggest we pass this bill here, we send it to the Senate. And  may I suggest that someone on the other side of the aisle make a phone  call and ask if they want to see how Schumer shutdown part 2 goes-- their choice.
