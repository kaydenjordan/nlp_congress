 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous materials on S. Con. Res. 3.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentlewoman from Tennessee?   There was no objection.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 48 and rule  XVIII, the Chair declares the House in the Committee of the Whole House  on the state of the Union for the consideration of the concurrent  resolution, S. Con. Res. 3.   The Chair appoints the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Hultgren) to  preside over the Committee of the Whole.                                time  1057                        In the Committee of the Whole    Accordingly, the House resolved itself into the Committee of the  Whole House on the state of the Union for the consideration of the  concurrent resolution (S. Con. Res. 3) setting forth the congressional  budget for the United States Government for fiscal year 2017 and  setting forth the appropriate budgetary levels for fiscal years 2018  through 2026, with Mr. Hultgren in the chair.   The Clerk read the title of the concurrent resolution.   The CHAIR. Pursuant to the rule, the concurrent resolution is  considered read the first time.   General debate shall not exceed 2 hours, with 90 minutes confined to  the congressional budget, equally divided and controlled by the chair  and ranking minority member of the Committee on the Budget, and 30  minutes on the subject of economic goals and policies, equally divided  and controlled by the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Tiberi) and the  gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. Carolyn B. Maloney), or their  designees.   The gentlewoman from Tennessee (Mrs. Black) and the gentleman from  Kentucky (Mr. Yarmuth) each will control 45 minutes of debate on the  congressional budget.   The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Tennessee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, I would like to inform my colleagues that I intend to  reserve 5 minutes of debate time to use after the Joint Economic  Committee debate has concluded.   Mr. Chairman, I rise today to speak on behalf of Americans everywhere  who are hurting because of ObamaCare. They are calling out for relief  from this disastrous law, and Republicans are here today to begin  delivering on our promise to provide relief.   We hear plenty of claims from the other side of the aisle during this  debate, but let's be clear: ObamaCare has failed and it is only going  to get worse.                                time  1100    Patients have seen skyrocketing premiums and deductibles, lost access  to the doctors they preferred, had fewer coverage options, while others  have had their plans canceled outright. It is no wonder so many people  have rejected this law.   In 2015, roughly 8 million Americans paid the ObamaCare penalty, and  more than 12 million Americans claimed an exemption from the penalty.  That is 20 million Americans. What does that say about this law that 20  million Americans want nothing to do with it, many preferring to pay a  penalty rather than to be subjected to its higher costs and fewer  choices? If you ask me, it is strong evidence that the American people  are tired of paying more and getting less.   Of course, the destruction that ObamaCare has caused extends beyond  discouraging individuals to purchase coverage. It has been a direct  attack on those who had insurance already.   In my home State of Tennessee, 28,000 people lost coverage on a  single day when the CoverTN program lapsed after the Obama  administration decreed that it ran afoul of the Federal Government's  top-down requirements. Now premiums in our State are rising by an  average of 63 percent, and three-quarters of our counties only have one  coverage option to choose from on the ObamaCare exchange.   In five other States around the country--Alabama, Alaska, Oklahoma,  South Carolina, and Wyoming--patients only have one insurer in the  marketplace to choose from. That makes it pretty difficult for someone  to find a plan that meets their unique needs or that of their family.   President Obama promised that this law would lower premiums by $2,500  per year for the average family. The exact opposite has happened.  Average family premiums have gone up by $4,300, and deductibles have  gone up by 60 percent. This is hitting hardworking Americans, many of  whom are already struggling to make ends meet.   Folks in Tennessee and all across the country are spending more and  more money on their health insurance because of ObamaCare, when they  would rather be saving for a new house or for their children's college.  The last thing working men and women need right now is the Federal  Government making their life harder with more expensive health  insurance by continuing to support this failed law.   That is why we are here today. The Senate successfully passed this  resolution yesterday, and now it is time for the House to deliver on  our promise, by kick-starting the reconciliation process so that we can  repeal ObamaCare and provide relief for the folks who are hurting  because of this law.   While our friends on the other side of the aisle always claim that  Republicans have no ideas or no plans to replace ObamaCare, that simply  isn't  [[Page H491]]  true, and they know it. I have with me here today a few examples,  including A Better Way, the 37-page proposal that will provide access  to care for all Americans and increase choice and competition.   I would like to also reference that Pete Sessions has a healthcare  bill that he has filed. The RSC, with Phil Roe, has a replacement bill  that has been filed. Paul Ryan filed a bill right after the passage of  ObamaCare. We also have Tom Price's replacement bill that is here. All  of these documents are here and available for people to look at and to  also find online, as well as A Better Way that we have put out from our  Conference.   I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this resolution to begin the  process of repealing ObamaCare and paving the way for patient-centered  reforms.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Indiana (Mr. Rokita), one of my classmates and also the vice chair of  the Committee on the Budget.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Indiana (Mr. Rokita), one of my classmates and also the vice chair of  the Committee on the Budget.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Indiana (Mr. Rokita), one of my classmates and also the vice chair of  the Committee on the Budget.    Mr. Chairman, it is my pleasure to yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Johnson), one of my classmates from the 2010  class, and a member of the Budget Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I do want to make reference to Ranking  Member Yarmuth's information on the Commonwealth fund. I want to note  that that report that was reported out does not take into account that  Republicans do have a plan. It also does not take into account that the  repeal of the taxes would put money back into the economy and boost the  economy.   I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Lewis), a  freshman and one of the newest members of the Budget Committee.    Mr. Chairman, it is my distinct honor to yield 2 minutes  to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Scalise), our House whip.    Mr. Chairman, it is my distinct honor to yield 2 minutes  to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Scalise), our House whip.    Mr. Chairman, it is my distinct honor to yield 2 minutes  to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Scalise), our House whip.    Mr. Chairman, it is my honor to yield 3 minutes to the  distinguished gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. Foxx), who is the  chairman of the Education and the Workforce Committee.                                time  1130     Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Wisconsin (Mr. Grothman), who is also a member of our Budget Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from Georgia (Mr. Ferguson), a new member of the Budget Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from Georgia (Mr. Ferguson), a new member of the Budget Committee.    Mr. Chairman, in response to the gentleman from New York,  when he says we do not have a plan, I reference him to all of the plans  that are here on the desk. He says we don't have a plan, but then he  references all of the things that will happen under the Republican  plan. He can't have it both ways.   Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr.  Womack), who is a member of both the Budget Committee and the  Appropriations Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I would just like to note that it is  ObamaCare that has, sadly, hurt these rural hospitals, healthcare  providers, and people living in those rural areas. As a matter of fact,  since January of 2010, there have been at least 80 rural hospitals that  have had to close. The damage has already been done.   Mr. Chairman, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Arrington), a freshmen on the Budget Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield an additional 15 seconds to the  gentleman from Texas.    Mr. Chairman, I yield an additional 15 seconds to the  gentleman from Texas.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Smucker), who is a new member of our Budget  Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Smucker), who is a new member of our Budget  Committee.    Mr. Chair, I yield an additional 15 seconds to the  gentleman from Pennsylvania.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from Florida (Mr. Gaetz), who is a freshman on our Budget Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I do want to note, once again, for my  colleagues on the other side of the aisle, if they say we have no  plans, I want to reference them several plans that have been filed, and  I will leave those here on the desk so they can pick those up at their  convenience.   Mr. Chairman, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the distinguished gentleman  from Texas (Mr. Poe).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Kansas (Mr. Marshall).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Kansas (Mr. Marshall).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Kansas (Mr. Marshall).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Michigan (Mr. Mitchell), who is one of our freshman Members.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from Virginia (Mr. Garrett), who is one of our freshman Members.    Mr. Chairman, it is now my honor to yield 1\1/2\ minutes  to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Rodney Davis), one of the leaders  of our conference.   Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Chairman, ObamaCare is not working.  We know this because the average increase for plans in Illinois was  between 45 and 55 percent this year. As a matter of fact, a good friend  of mine had an 87 percent increase.   We know this because millions of Americans who were told they could  keep their health insurance were kicked off their plans. We know it is  not working because 31 million people are underinsured, meaning they  can't afford to use the insurance they have. Deductibles are simply too  high.   It is not enough to judge this law simply by the number of people who  are insured, since it mandates people buy insurance anyway. We must  remember the people paying premiums that continue to double and then  have a deductible so high that it will never be reached.   That is not success. That is a problem for hardworking taxpayers,  many of whom don't qualify for subsidies but were forced off their  previous plans because they didn't meet the standards set by ObamaCare  and now can't afford the plan they are mandated to buy.   We know it is not working because people in a third of our counties  in the U.S. only have one insurance provider to choose from. ObamaCare  is collapsing on itself.   Some say: Why not work to fix it? I did. We did. We passed my Hire  More Heroes Act. It helps small businesses, helps our heroes. But we  have to begin today to fix the bill itself.   To know why this process is needed, let's remember how we got here.  This bill was rushed through Congress. It then had 20,000 pages of  regulations just for that one bill.   But taking this first step to repeal it should not be mistaken for  supporting the status quo before the ACA was put in place. We have a  plan. We are going to cover preexisting conditions. Because my wife is  a cancer survivor, we have to do that.    Mr. Chairman, it is my distinct honor to yield 1 minute  to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Ryan), who was the chair of our  Budget Committee, our Ways and Means Committee, and now he is the  Speaker of the House.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from New York (Mr. Faso), one of our newest Members.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, I want to read the names of some of the groups that  have written to us in support of S. Con. Res. 3. There are more than 35  names on here, but I am going to read off some that we would recognize  very quickly:   The American Center for Law and Justice, Association of Mature  American Citizens, Citizens Against Government Waste, Concerned Women  for America, Health Benefits Group, Independent Women's Voice, Medical  Device Manufacturers Association, National Association of  Manufacturers, National Association of Wholesaler-Distributors,  National Restaurant Association, National Retail Federation, National  Taxpayers Union, Society for Human Resource Management, and the  U.S. Chamber of Commerce.    I just want to extract one paragraph out of the U.S. Chamber's letter  that they have written:         The U.S. Chamber of Commerce supports S. Con. Res. 3, the       concurrent resolution setting forth the congressional budget       for 2016, an initial step toward making critical improvements       to the American healthcare system.''    I think that you can see that not only do our constituents support a  change, but also these companies around the country.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, what I would like to do now is to read some  of the broken promises that have occurred through the Affordable Care  Act.   Here is one that I think we will all recognize: ``That means that no  matter how we reform health care, we will keep this promise to the  American people: If you like your doctor, you will be able to keep your  doctor, period.'' Those are remarks by the President at the annual  conference of the American Medical Association back on June 15, 2009.   Here is another one: ``I will sign a universal health care bill into  law by the end of my first term as president that will cover every  American and cut the cost of a typical family's premium by up to $2,500  a year.'' This was in a speech on June 23, 2007.   Here is another: ``You should know that once we have fully  implemented, you're going to be able to buy insurance through a pool so  that you can get the same good rates as a group that if you're an  employee at a big company you can get right now--which means your  premiums will go down.'' Which we know has absolutely not happened.  These were remarks that were made by the President at a campaign event  on July 16, 2012.   Here is another one, remarks made by the President after a meeting  with the Senate Democrats on December 15, 2009: ``Whatever ideas exist  in terms of bending the cost curve and starting to reduce costs for  families, businesses, and government, those elements are in this  bill.'' As we know today, those elements have not come to fruition.   Another: ``So this law means more choice, more competition, lower  costs for millions of Americans.'' These were remarks by the President  on the Affordable Care Act and the government shutdown on October 1,  2013.   Another: ``In my mind the Affordable Care Act has been a huge  success, but it's got real problems.'' This came from Jonathan Chait,  ``Five Days That Shaped a Presidency,'' on October 2, 2016.   The last one that I will read to you: ``I'm willing to look at other  ideas to bring down costs. . . .'' These were remarks by the President  in the State of the Union Address on January 25, 2011.   In 2013, PolitiFact rated this the number one lie of the year. At  publication, PolitiFact found that there were at least 37 instances  when President Obama made this vow to the American people. I can say  that, as we look at these statements that were made, these are not  statements that have come true.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I have no other speakers, and I reserve the  balance of my time to conclude the debate of the budget resolution  after the Joint Economic Committee has finished its debate.   The CHAIR. The gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Tiberi) and the gentlewoman  from New York (Mrs. Carolyn B. Maloney) each will control 15 minutes on  the subject of economic goals and policies.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Ohio.    I reserve the balance of my time.    I reserve the balance of my time.    I reserve the balance of my time.    I reserve the balance of my time.    I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, after all the debate that we have had  today, these facts remain: ObamaCare is failing; health coverage is  becoming less affordable; health care is becoming less accessible; and  the American people want and deserve something better than this broken  status quo.   While my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are doing their  best to defend this law and make excuses for the harm it is causing,  Republicans promised the American people we will not ignore those in  our country who are suffering under the current healthcare system.   Today, we have an opportunity to begin to bring relief to the  American people. Today's vote will kick-start the reconciliation  process through which we can and must repeal ObamaCare and pave the way  to a patient-centered healthcare system, and I include in the Record  letters supporting passage of S. Con. Res. 3.                                          Chamber of Commerce of the                                        United States of America,                                   Washington, DC, January 13, 2017.        To the Members of the U.S. House of Representatives: The       U.S. Chamber of Commerce supports S. Con. Res. 3, the       concurrent resolution setting forth the congressional budget       for fiscal year 2017, as an initial step toward making       critical improvements to the American health care system.        Congress must repeal the ``Cadillac'' tax, the health       insurance tax, the medical device tax, the employer       responsibility penalties, and other harmful taxes of the       Affordable Care Act that have increased health care costs for       millions of Americans. As committees begin consideration of       reconciliation legislation, the Chamber will continue to       advocate strongly for those and other issues.        Furthermore, this proposal provides for modifications to       enacted FY 2017 discretionary spending levels to bring them       into alignment with the Appropriations Committee's existing       allocation as part of the deeming resolution required by the       Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015. These levels are consistent       with the statutory limits established by the Budget Control       Act and amended by the Bipartisan Budget Act. This       legislation would also make changes to mandatory spending to       reflect $2 billion in mandatory savings--the same amount       established in the reconciliation instructions.        The FY 2017 Appropriations bills include many Chamber       policy priorities. The Chamber strongly supports completing       work on those bills and hopes that passage of this budget       resolution will provide the framework for their quick       consideration, including beginning the important work on       fiscal year 2018 bills.            Sincerely,      Jack Howard.                                   ____                                       National Retail Federation,                                                   January 11, 2017.      Hon. Paul Ryan,      Speaker, House of Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Democratic Leader, House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Ryan and Democratic Leader Pelosi: I write to       share the support of the National Retail Federation (NRF) for       S. Con. Res. 3, the fiscal year 2017 budget resolution.       Please note that NRF may consider votes on S. Con. Res. 3 and       related procedural motions as Opportunity Index Votes for our       annual voting scorecard.        The Affordable Care Act (ACA) remains a great concern for       NRF and the greater retail community. The ACA adversely       influences staffing patterns, discourages full-time       employment and adds to the cost of goods in retail stores.       NRF opposed enactment of the ACA in 2010 but has also worked       steadfastly to change the law since its enactment. We have       supported reasonable bipartisan efforts to reduce the ACA's       cost burdens and ease compliance concerns. The ACA remains a       heavy burden for the retail community despite all of our       efforts to fix and adjust to the law.        This budget resolution is the first step toward the       eventual repeal of the ACA. We support this first step but       will be closely watching the ensuing reconciliation       legislation to help keep employment-based coverage as stable       and predictable as possible. We strongly urge that the       process of replacing the ACA be both bipartisan as well as       deliberate. Consensus reform will build on the employment       based system, which covers 178 million Americans, but not       threaten this coverage in the effort to help others.        For all of these reasons, NRF supports S. Con. Res. 3 and       ask for your vote in support.            Sincerely,                                                      David French,                       Senior Vice President, Government Relations.  [[Page H509]]                                          ____                                            National Association of                                         Wholesaler-Distributors,                                   Washington, DC, January 12, 2017.      Hon. Paul Ryan,      Speaker, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Democratic Leader, House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Ryan and Leader Pelosi: I write on behalf of       the National Association of Wholesaler-Distributors (NAW) to       express support for S. Con. Res. 3, the Fiscal Year 2017       Budget Resolution. Passage of the budget resolution will       provide an important first step toward the repeal and       replacement of the Affordable Care Act (ACA).        It has become painfully apparent that the ACA has not and       will not achieve the affordability, competition and choice       goals promised by its sponsors. Looking forward, NAW members       are deeply concerned about the ACA's potential to do harm to       the employment-based health insurance system through which       some 170 million Americans acquire their health coverage,       particularly as two ill-advised ACA financing components--the       excise tax on high-cost health plans (the ``Cadillac Tax'')       and the annual fee on health insurance providers (the       ``Health Insurance Tax'' or ``HIT'')--take hold.        NAW looks forward to working with Members of both houses of       Congress on both sides of the aisle in what we hope will be a       collaborative effort to find common legislative ground on       marketplace-driven, patient-centered ways to achieve shared       access, cost-containment, and quality goals.        I advise that votes taken on and in relation to S. Con.       Res. 3 may be considered key votes for the 115th Congress.            Sincerely,                                            James A. Anderson, Jr.,      Vice President-Government Relations.                                   ____                                             National Association of                                                   Manufacturers,                                   Washington, DC, January 12, 2017.        Dear Representatives: The National Association of       Manufacturers (NAM), the largest manufacturing association in       the United States, representing manufacturers in every       industrial sector and in all 50 states, urges you to support       S. Con. Res. 3 the Obamacare Repeal Resolution.        The Budget Resolution takes the first step towards       repealing the mandates and taxes resulting from the Patient       Protection and Affordable Care Act that are driving up the       costs of healthcare for manufacturers. Manufacturers believe       that repeal of the 40 percent excise tax on high cost plans,       the Health Insurance Tax, the Medical Device Tax, and other       fees and taxes associated with the Affordable Care Act will       help employers contain rising health care costs.        Manufacturers historically have led the business community       in providing health benefits to their employees and are       committed to continuing this tradition in the future. At the       same time, providing health coverage in an environment where       costs are consistently rising represents a major challenge       for the industry.        The NAM's Key Vote Advisory Committee has indicated that       votes on S. Con. Res. 3, including podural motions, may be       considered for designation as Key Manufacturing Votes in the       115th Congress.        Thank you for your consideration.            Sincerely,                                                  Aric Newhouse,                                   Senior Vice President, Policy and      Government Relations.                                   ____                                        Council for Citizens Against                                                Government Waste,                                   Washington, DC, January 12, 2017.      U.S. House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative: You will soon have the opportunity to       vote on S. Con. Res. 3, a budget resolution that will begin       the long-awaited process of repealing the Patient Protection       and Affordable Care Act (ACA), better known as Obamacare. On       behalf of the more than one million members and supporters of       the Council for Citizens Against Government Waste (CCAGW), I       urge you to support this important legislation.        Obamacare, which has been a disaster for patients and       taxpayers since it was passed in 2010, cannot be fixed.       Premiums have dramatically increased, co-ops and state       exchanges have failed, and medical costs continue to       skyrocket. Conservative estimates suggest that, by its sixth       birthday in early 2016, Obamacare had wasted $55 billion,       while its onerous regulations and taxes have stifled economic       growth and job creation.        Over the past year, more co-ops have collapsed; health       insurers have abandoned numerous exchanges; and premiums have       increased an average of 25 percent for 2017. Even worse,       Obamacare has allowed overzealous Washington bureaucrats to       meddle in Americans' most personal and private decisions       concerning their health. At the same time, patients are       getting less care for their plans due to fewer healthcare       options and increasing medical costs; some counties have only       one or even no healthcare insurance options (and have to pay       a fine, as a result).        Obamacare must be repealed before it further damages       consumers and the slow-growing economy. Passage of the       ``Obamacare repeal resolution'' is the first step to       accomplishing that critical objective. All votes on S. Con.       Res. 3 will be among those considered for CCAGW's 2017       Congressional Ratings.            Sincerely,                                                        Tom Schatz,      President.                                   ____                           Americans for Tax Reform         Congress is expected to soon vote on S. Con. Res. 3, a       budget resolution providing for repeal of Obamacare. The       ``repeal resolution'' is step one in undoing the legacy of       broken promises under the Barack Obama presidency which have       led to higher healthcare costs, cancelled plans, lost       doctors, and more than $1 trillion in tax increases which hit       millions of middle class families.        All members of the House and Senate should vote ``yes'' on       the repeal resolution. The record of Obamacare is one of       broken promises and failed policies. Poll after poll has       shown the law is unpopular with the American people.       Republicans campaigned on repealing Obamacare and this       resolution will allow them to fulfill that promise        Members of the Senate should also vote ``no'' on the       numerous amendments expected to be offered during       consideration of the repeal resolution. The purpose of this       budget resolution is to allow for an expedited process to       repeal Obamacare through budget reconciliation. These       amendments will slow down the process and are largely an       attempt for members to play political games.        Passing the repeal resolution will allow members of       Congress to pass the first of many tax cuts over the next       four years by repealing the more than $1 trillion in higher       taxes over a decade. Obamacare's tax hikes directly hit       middle class families, in violation of President Obama's       ``firm pledge'' not to raise any tax on any family earning       less than $250,000 per year. Passing the repeal resolution       will allow members of Congress the opportunity to pass the       first of many tax cuts over the next four years by repealing       these taxes.        The Obamacare law imposed taxes on Health Savings Accounts       and Flexible Spending Accounts and imposed an income tax       increase on Americans with high medical bills. Obamacare       levied a new tax on health insurance, a tax on medical       devices, a tax on employer provided care, a steep ``indoor       tanning tax'' and even a tax for not buying ``qualifying''       government-mandated insurance.        Passing the repeal resolution will also allow Congress to       undo a long list of wasteful subsidies including the risk       corridor and reinsurance programs as well as the Prevention       and Public Health slush fund. Each of these programs and       agencies have seen billions in taxpayer dollars wasted on       partisan activities at a time when the federal government       already spends far too much. Support for S. Con. Res. 3 is       the first step toward enacting a conservative, patient-      centered, fiscally responsible healthcare system and       eliminating the broken promises, wasteful spending, and       higher taxes of the Obama years.                          Americans for Prosperity         For years, our lawmakers in Congress have vowed to get rid       of Obamacare. Now, they have their best chance yet to make       good on their word.        Barack Obama's signature health-care law has failed to       deliver on its promises, and continues to leave Americans       with cancelled insurance plans, reduced access to doctors,       and premium increases in the double digits--or worse.        Using a process called budget reconciliation, Obamacare's       opponents in our new Senate can repeal large portions of the       law with a simple majority, while leaving no possibility of a       filibuster by lawmakers who want to keep it. Then, the       resolution would just need to be passed in the House of       Representatives and signed by President Trump after he takes       office.        We can't let our lawmakers pass up this opportunity to turn       back years of terrible policy and free Americans from       Obamacare's burdensome mandates and costs.     Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this  resolution so that we can pursue those solutions that will expand  access to care, increase the quality and affordability of that care,  and give the American people, not Washington, the power to choose what  best fits their individual needs.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition.   The CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Tennessee is recognized for 10  minutes.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition.   The CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Tennessee is recognized for 10  minutes.    Mr. Chairman, the Democratic substitute would guarantee  that the American people continue to be harmed by ObamaCare. It would  ensure that insurance markets continue to collapse and that premiums  and deductibles continue to rise and that patients have less access to  healthcare choices.   At a time when we are trying to provide relief to the American people  and protect them from a failed and broken status quo, this amendment  ignores those who are suffering under the law. It ignores the 20  million Americans who have either paid the ObamaCare penalty or sought  an exemption from it because the cost of complying with the law is  either too costly or not worth their trouble.   This amendment tells those families who have seen their premiums go  up dramatically--many, who are paying more and getting less--that there  is no relief in sight for you. What is more, the substitute does not  include any reconciliation instructions, and it lacks the savings we  achieve through our instructions.   The bottom line is this: ObamaCare is collapsing. It is failing. The  American people need relief. And in order to get them that relief, we  need to reject this amendment and get to work on patient-centered  solutions for our Nation's healthcare challenges.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I move that the Committee do now rise.   The motion was agreed to.   Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr.  Womack) having assumed the chair, Mr. Hultgren, Chair of the Committee  of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that that  Committee, having had under consideration the concurrent resolution (S.  Con. Res. 3) setting forth the congressional budget for the United  States Government for fiscal year 2017 and setting forth the  appropriate budgetary levels for fiscal years 2018 through 2026, had  come to no resolution thereon.                            ____________________
