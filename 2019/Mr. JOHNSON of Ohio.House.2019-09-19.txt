 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  important work being done at the VA to help prevent suicides.   An estimated 45,000 Americans die each year from suicide. Roughly  6,000 are veterans. That is over 16 per day, over 115 per week.   Suicide is a national public health issue, and it is important that  we educate ourselves on how to recognize the warning signs.   In the spirit of Suicide Prevention Month, the VA has launched  efforts to help deliver assistance to veterans, funding for additional  research, strategies to educate communities about suicide prevention,  and collaboration with public and private partnerships to implement  tools to help curb suicides among our Nation's veterans.   As a fellow veteran, I have seen firsthand some of the difficulties  veterans face following their military service, and we owe to them our  support after they have sacrificed so much. Veterans are all around  us--neighbors, friends, and family members--and they deserve our utmost  attention.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the VA for their support and their work  in addressing this important issue.                            ____________________
