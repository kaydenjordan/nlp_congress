 Madam Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the Arlington  Babe Ruth 13U All-Star Team, who won the Virginia Babe Ruth Baseball  13U State championship and represented Virginia in the 2023 Babe Ruth  World Series.   The team was undefeated in the State tournament, outscoring their  opponents 41-7. The team went on to proudly represent Virginia in the  2023 Babe Ruth World Series where they faced regional champions from  all over the country.   While they came up short in their goal of winning the world series,  they should nevertheless be tremendously proud of a wonderful season.  It would also not have been possible without a dedicated group of  friends, families, and supporters who cheered them on and spent  countless hours and hundreds of miles supporting the team.   It made Arlington and the rest of the Eighth District proud. I am  sure they will go on to even greater things.   Madam Speaker, please join me in congratulating head coach Chris  Chiuchiolo, assistant coach Thor Koomey, and their championship team:  Sammy Braccia, George Cocker, Ryan DiVincenzo, Nolan Foerster, Luca  Feden, Clive Gay, Aden Heinzer, Michael Huff, Booker Lawson, Michael  Mastrangelo, Jack Riordan, Charlie Rotz, and Jones Tallent.   Go Arlington.                            ____________________
