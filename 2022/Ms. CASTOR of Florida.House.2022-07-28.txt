 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 263, the Big Cat  Public Safety Act, as a proud cosponsor of this legislation for many  years.   Big cats such as lions, tigers, panthers, and others deserve to live  in the wild or in a safe and secure refuge like Big Cat Rescue back  home in Tampa.   But too often these beautiful creatures are privately owned and  exploited for profit in the exotic pet trade where they are owned by  unfit individuals and kept in awful conditions. That is why we must  pass the Big Cat Public Safety Act. It would be a catastrophe if we did  not pass it.   Big cats are wild animals. They do not belong in backyards and  garages and should not be in regular contact with people unsuited to  take care of them. It is dangerous as well. We have seen numerous law  enforcement and emergency calls due to the irresponsible private  ownership of big cats fueled by those who are making money off of their  suffering.   So I am proud to have advocated for this legislation with many of the  cool cats and kittens, volunteers, and supporters of Big Cat Rescue in  Tampa.   I thank Representative Quigley and the Natural Resources Committee  Chair Grijalva for moving to protect big cats from exploitation.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage all of my colleagues to do the same with a  big ``yes'' vote on the Big Cat Public Safety Act.
