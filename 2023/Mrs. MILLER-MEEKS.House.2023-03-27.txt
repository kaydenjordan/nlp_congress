 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize two World  War II veterans who recently celebrated their 100th and 101st  birthdays.   Lowell Dibble of Iowa City, Iowa, celebrated his 101st birthday on  St. Patrick's Day. Mr. Dibble served as a radio operator for the  Merchant Marines during the Second World War, using Morse code and  other communications to receive and record time signals, weather  reports, and other information important to the smooth operation of  their vessels.   Mr. Dibble starts each day with a workout and still talks to his  friends in Morse code every night. He attributes his longevity to his  positive attitude, his faith, and keeping busy. We can all learn a  valuable lesson from Mr. Dibble, who should be an inspiration for  people of all ages who struggle to find motivation in their lives.   Mr. Speaker, I also recognize Max Wilson from Maquoketa, Iowa, who  celebrated his 100th birthday last month.    Mr. Wilson was drafted in 1941 and served as a bombardier during the  Second World War, flying 43 missions in a B-17 in five different  countries. As bombardier, he was responsible for landing more than  240,000 tons of bombs on target during critical missions throughout the  war.   Mr. Wilson is a humble man who doesn't see himself as a hero, though  he certainly is deserving of recognition. On his birthday, he received  a special gift from the University of Dubuque's Jet Center--a private  flight around Dubuque and down to his hometown of Maquoketa.   Mr. Dibble and Mr. Wilson are two heroes from the Greatest  Generation, and I am honored to recognize them both on the House floor.  I hope each enjoyed a wonderful and memorable birthday.                     China is our Greatest Foreign Threat     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss China's  growing role in international relations and its impact on American  national security.   In just the last few weeks, China has brokered a peace deal between  Iran and Saudi Arabia and re-established diplomatic relations with  Honduras following its break with Taiwan. Both negotiations are  worrisome as Iran continues to target and kill Americans in Syria and  China edges closer to invading Taiwan. Also, the Chinese Communist  Party is fully supporting Russia in its unprecedented and unprovoked  invasion of Ukraine.   China's growing influence across Latin America is concerning,  particularly as these relationships continue to appear lopsided.  Nations are receiving investments from the Chinese, but in return are  left dependent on the Chinese Communist Party.   The Middle East is especially concerning, though. For decades, the  United States has brokered peace negotiations in the region or, at the  very least, been in the room as these deals have been agreed upon.   Between Iran and Saudi Arabia, however, the United States was left  out. The implications of this decision are profound, particularly as  Iran continues to sponsor terrorist attacks as it is unclear what peace  was agreed to and our response was weak.   Our Nation has watched as the Chinese Communist Party has grown in  power and influence, and has fallen victim to its espionage efforts  whether through TikTok, Confucius Institutes, or even spy balloons.   The Chinese Communist Party's goals are clear: Infiltrate and  undermine American economic and national security. As the CCP's  influence continues to grow, its threat to our national security does  too. We must actively seek ways to decouple our economy, end our  dependence on Chinese supply chains, and bolster our national security.   China is our greatest foreign threat and it is time we begin to act  accordingly.   I wish a happy birthday to Joseph and Matthew Martino of Connecticut,  who are my nephews. Happy 16th birthday, Joseph and Matthew.  [[Page H1443]]    Congratulations to Kyle and Jill Jacobs on the birth of their  daughter, Sierra Rose, on Saturday. I hope that they are able to get  some sleep.                            ____________________
