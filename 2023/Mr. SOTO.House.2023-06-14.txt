 Madam Speaker, 7 years ago this week, on June 12, 2016, our  happy town of Orlando was the site of an act of gun violence and  terrorism. We lost 49 angels and 53 were injured at the Pulse nightclub  shooting.   While that was a terrible and violent act, we will always remember  those we lost. We also came together to reject hate and to speak to  those across the Nation about both preventing gun violence, about LGBTQ  rights, and about making sure that we have love define our region.   For the 49 angels we lost and the 53 who were injured, the first  responders, their families, and so many others in the Orlando  community, I ask for a moment of silence.                            ____________________
