 Mr. Chief Justice.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Senator from Washington.    Mr. Chief Justice, I send a question to the desk for the  House managers.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you.   Senator Murray asks the House managers:         Yesterday, when asked about why the House did not amend or       reissue subpoenas after it passed its resolution authorizing       its impeachment inquiry, the House Managers touched upon the       House having the sole Power of Impeachment as specified by       Article I of the Constitution. Could you further elaborate as       to why that authority controls despite any arguments brought       forth by members of the defense team contesting the validity       of those subpoenas?    Ms. Manager LOFGREN. Mr. Chief Justice and Senators, that is a good  question.   The answer is that these were validly issued subpoenas under the  House rules. The White House argument to the contrary is wrong, and it  would have profound negative implications for how Congress and our  democracy function.   On January 9, 2019, the House adopted its rules, like we do every  Congress, and these rules gave the committee the power to issue  subpoenas. They are not ambiguous rules. Here is the relevant portion  of rule XI on slide 55: The House's standing rules give each committee  subpoena power ``for the purpose of carrying out any of its functions  and duties'' as it considers necessary. This investigation began on  September 9, before the Speaker's announcement on September 24 that it  would become part of the impeachment inquiry umbrella.   The President doesn't dispute that the subpoenas issued by these  committees were fully within their respective jurisdiction. The  argument is that somehow, by declaring that this investigation also  falls under an inquiry to consider Articles of Impeachment, which gives  Congress actually greater authority, somehow it nullifies the  traditional oversight authority. And this just doesn't make any sense.   The President counters that we have to take a full vote on  impeachment first because that is what has been done in the past. In  the Nixon inquiry, however, the Judiciary Committee needed a House  resolution to delegate subpoena power, and that is different than the  Committee's standing rules today.   The President actually compels the opposite conclusion. Several  Federal judges have been investigated and impeached and convicted in  the Senate without the House having ever taken an official vote to  authorize the inquiry, and a Federal court recently confirmed there was  no need for a formal vote of the full House to commence impeachment  proceedings.   Even assuming a House vote was necessary, there was a vote. The text  of H.  [[Page S694]]  Res. 660 declared that the six investigative committees of the House  were directed to continue their ongoing investigations as part of the  existing House of Representatives inquiry into whether there was  sufficient grounds for the House of Representatives to exercise its  constitutional power to impeach. And the committee report, which  accompanies the resolution, specifically described the subpoenas that  had been issued by the investigating committees and said ``all  subpoenas to the executive branch remain in full force.''   So why didn't the House committee just reissue these subpoenas after  the resolution? The short answer is they didn't need to. The subpoenas  were already fully authorized.   In any event, even after the resolution passed, the committees issued  subpoenas to Mick Mulvaney, Robert Blair, and four other witnesses, and  the President continued to block those subpoenas. The argument about a  full House vote really is just an excuse about President Trump's  obstruction. The President refused to comply with the House subpoenas  before the House vote and after the House vote. The only logical  explanation is the one that President Trump gave us all along: He was  determined to fight all the subpoenas because, in President Trump's  view, according to what he said, he can do what he wants.   That is not what the constitutional Republic entrusted to us by the  Founders had in mind. This argument doesn't just apply to impeachment.  It would apply to ordinary oversight investigations. And it doesn't  just apply to the House. It would also apply to the Senate.   By sanctioning the President's blanket obstruction, the Senate would  be curtailing its own subpoena power in the future, as well as the  House's, and the oversight obligation that we have, as we now know it,  would be permanently altered.   I yield back.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, Ms. Manager.    Mr. Chief Justice.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Senator from Washington.    Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. I send a question to the  desk for the House managers.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you.   The question for the House managers from Senator Murray:         If there are no consequences to openly defying a valid       congressional subpoena, how will Congress be able to perform       its constitutional oversight responsibility to make sure any       administration is following the law and acting in the best       interests of American families?    Ms. Manager GARCIA of Texas. Well, they could have very serious,  devastating, and dire consequences. If the Senate ignores President  Trump's ongoing obstruction of Congress, it would lead to the end of  congressional oversight as we know it today.   President Trump's attorneys argued that our congressional subpoenas  are constitutionally invalid until a court determines otherwise. Their  argument is false, and it is an attack on congressional oversight  powers.  [[Page S712]]    A vote against article II is a vote to condone President Trump's  corrupted view of America's constitutional balance. Voting against  article II would grant President Trump--and every other President from  now until forever--the power to simply ignore all congressional  subpoenas unless and until we seek a court to enforce it.   Under President Trump's view, even if all of you Senators were to  vote to favor to issue a subpoena for documents or witnesses, the  administration could still ignore them until a court ruled on it.   I think Mr. Schiff addressed some of that earlier in another  question. You could go to court to enforce it. Then, it would get  appealed, then, go back to court. We could go on and on because, quite  frankly, that is what their position is.   So, again, as Mr. Schiff said earlier, imagine yourselves having  jurisdiction over an item that you care deeply about, and you needed  information. You heard of some wrongdoing. You heard there was a  whistleblower complaint on something, and you decided that you wanted  to do a hearing. It is very possible that the President would just  flatly refuse your subpoena, because, if we ignore article II, that  would be the precedent--to ignore all subpoenas.   But we need you to issue a subpoena for us today not only to get Mr.  Bolton here but Mr. Duffey, Mr. Mulvaney, and everyone else with  relevant evidence on this case.   Now, when the administration exerts executive privilege, there might  be some privilege, one, that is available to them on any of these  documents, but those have to be asserted with every document as we send  a subpoena.   So don't buy the White House argument that our subpoenas are invalid  because we don't have any authority to issue them. We know we do. You  know we do. So let's make sure that this body will make sure that no  future President will just simply defy, disrespect, and ignore  subpoenas because some day you may be in our shoes wanting to get  information, wanting to get to the bottom line to ensure that no  President is above the law.   Thank you.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, Ms. Manager.
