 Madam Chairwoman, I have an amendment at the  desk.    Madam Chairwoman, I rise in support of this  amendment. It is a straightforward amendment transferring $13 million  from the Federal Prisoner Detention  [[Page H4889]]  account to support local delinquency prevention grants authorized under  the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act.   Last Congress, I was honored to work with my colleague, the  gentlewoman from North Carolina, then chair, now Ranking Member  Virginia Foxx, to reauthorize JJDPA, and it passed without opposition  and was signed by the President last year.   Included in that bill was an overhaul of title V of the act which  authorizes grants for local delinquency prevention. That overhaul  included provisions of the Youth PROMISE Act which I first introduced  in 2007.   The Youth PROMISE Act model is based on what we all know, and that  is, that evidence-based prevention and intervention programs can stop  young people from heading down the wrong path and instead, keep them on  the right track, usually saving more money in the long run than the  programs cost. I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chairwoman, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. Foxx).    Madam Chairwoman, investments in prevention  can avoid the necessity for incarceration.   Texas found this out several years ago when their appropriations  committee was told that they needed to come up with $2 billion--one  State--$2 billion in prison construction to deal with their increasing  prison population. They, instead, invested about 10 percent of that in  prevention, early intervention, and rehabilitation effectively, and  found that after that investment, they didn't need to build any new  prisons at all.                                time  1745    That is the focus of the Youth PROMISE Act. I hope we can adopt the  amendment's focus on prevention, early intervention, and rehabilitation  rather than just mass incarceration.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
