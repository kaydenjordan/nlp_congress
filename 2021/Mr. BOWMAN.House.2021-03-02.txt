 Madam Speaker, our friends, our neighbors, and our family  [[Page H1001]]  members who are entangled in this injustice system did not lose their  citizenship, so they should not lose their right to vote.    These are people from our communities, still connected strongly to  our families, our schools, and our workplaces. As a result, they should  not lose their right to vote.   Their right to vote must be restored because these are individuals-- people, not criminals--who can still think critically and creatively  and contribute to our democracy. Our democracy will remain broken and  sick and unhealthy until we heal by restoring the right to vote to our  incarcerated individuals.
