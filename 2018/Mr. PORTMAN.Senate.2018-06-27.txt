 Mr. President, today I want to talk about the tax reform  legislation that this body passed at the end of last year. It turns out  that this week is the 6-month anniversary of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act,  the tax reform legislation. It is time for us to look at it and  determine how it is working. It is particularly important because there  are a number of provisions in the tax legislation that are not  permanent. In other words, there is a sunset on some of the tax cuts.  Some of these provisions expire as soon as the end of 2019, which is  just the end of next year, so it is time to start thinking about how it  works.   Second, we have Members on the other side of the aisle saying that we  ought to get rid of this altogether. That would mean, of course, big  tax increases for a lot of folks. But let's look at what the results  are before we take those kinds of votes and make those kinds of  decisions.   I would submit that in the 6 months since it has been put into place,  it has worked incredibly well for the people I represent, for the  workers and small businesses I represent, and for those who are  concerned about getting wages back up, fighting poverty, and helping to  grow the economy.   I know that in the debate we are having on the farm bill right now,  there has been discussion about the food stamp program. One of the  points that are being made is that food stamp spending is actually down  right now. It has decreased in the last 6 months. Why? Because the  economy is improving. That is a good thing.   Before tax reform, let's face it, our economy was incredibly weak.  Wages were flat and had been flat for almost a decade. With the  Congressional Budget Office estimating that this year's growth was  going to be only 2 percent, we were looking at more weak economic  performance. We were looking at another year where we were going to be  performing way below our potential as an economy. So what happened? A  couple months ago, when the Congressional Budget Office looked at what  is happening with the economy, which they attributed to pro-growth  policies, including tax reform, they said: You know what, the economy  is not going to grow at 2 percent this year. Their projection for this  year is now 3.3 percent growth. That is a huge difference. Going from 2  percent to 3.3 percent is going to make a world of difference to people  in their lives, in our economy, in their ability to see higher wages  and better jobs.   The economy is doing better. Six months into this new law, the  economy is up and running and moving toward its full potential. In the  most recent Congressional Budget Office estimate for this quarter, it  looks as though we are going to see some significant growth. There is  no estimate yet from the CBO, but it was stated that the Federal  Reserve gave an estimate of 4.5 percent growth. I don't know if that  will happen, but the consensus estimate from economists is that in the  second quarter of this year, we are likely to see growth at over 4  percent. We will hear the final number from the Congressional Budget  Office at the end of July, but, again, we are seeing more jobs, higher  wages, better economic growth, and therefore more opportunity for all  Americans. That is a good thing.   Why is tax reform helping to create this new opportunity for higher  wages  [[Page S4490]]  and more growth? I am going to discuss three reasons why I believe this  tax reform proposal has been helping to get the economy moving and why  it is so important to keep these policies in place and to not risk  higher taxes on individuals or lower economic growth if we were to move  away from this legislation and not make it permanent.   No. 1, updating our international tax code has definitely encouraged  companies to invest in America. We had a totally outdated international  tax code. We had the highest tax rates among all the industrialized  countries at the business level for international companies. We had a  system that actually encouraged companies to keep their money overseas  and therefore spend it overseas. So a company facing our old Tax Code  would have had their board and stakeholders saying: Don't bring that  money back because it is going to be taxed too high. Keep it overseas.  That was crazy. It made no sense whatsoever.   Frankly, it took us too long to address that issue, but we finally  did. Let me give an example. I am told that in the first quarter of  this year, more than $300 billion was brought into this country,  repatriated back to America from overseas. This is the profit U.S.  companies made overseas, and $300 billion was brought back. Compare  that to the first quarter of last year, when $38 billion was brought  back. This is because of tax reform. This is good. This money is being  brought back to invest in America, and it is the most money on record,  by the way. So something is changing, and it is positive. The change to  the international system is helping in a number of ways, including  companies bringing the money back and investing it here.   Second, lowering the tax rate for small and large businesses has  resulted in new investments in people, plant equipment, and technology.  We have seen it in terms of higher bonuses, higher wages, and increased  retirement contributions.   There are a lot of examples. We have seen it in terms of investing in  new technology and new equipment, which, in the end, is probably as  important as anything because--think about it--one thing the economists  have said about our economy over the last decade is that we are not  improving our productivity as we should. What they mean by that is that  the productivity of each worker has been disappointing, and that leads  to lower wages and not having higher economic performance. If you make  a worker more productive by investing in the latest technology and new  equipment, that helps everybody. It helps that worker have a higher  salary, and it helps the economy.   That is actually happening out there. I have seen the results of it  all over Ohio. I represent the State of Ohio, which has a lot of  manufacturing and a lot of small businesses. I have gone around and  talked with them. I visited 21 individual businesses and held about a  dozen roundtable discussions with small and midsized businesses and one  large business. We talked about this, and of the 21 businesses I  visited, every single one of them is taking the tax savings and  investing it in their people, their plant, and their equipment. Some  are raising wages. Some are giving bonuses to their employees. Some are  buying new equipment. Some are expanding their operations. Some of them  are improving employee benefits.   There is a company that has three branches of an auto parts store  that stopped offering healthcare about 5 years ago because of the cost  of the Affordable Care Act. They couldn't afford healthcare. Their  people had to go out on the individual market and get it through the  Affordable Care Act. They are now offering healthcare again, and the  employees are extremely happy. Their costs are down, and their  deductibles are down. They did that all with tax savings.   Many companies have done a combination of these things. They are  investing in their people. There is a small manufacturing company in  Cincinnati, and shortly after the tax bill was signed into law, they  said: We are going to give $1,000 bonuses to our people. And they did.  They also invested in equipment.   A company I visited in Columbus, OH, invested in equipment. It is a  steel processer. The equipment they used was from 1986. The equipment  itself was 31 years old, which is exactly the age of our old Tax Code.  Nineteen eighty six was when we last reformed the Tax Code. After we  modernized the Tax Code--finally modernized an antiquated tax code that  was 31 years old--they got rid of a 31-year-old piece of equipment and  replaced it with a brandnew piece of equipment. I thought that was  appropriate.   That is how these tax savings are being used. There are some groups  in town that put up a website saying: These businesses have benefited  from this and these employees. I can tell you that it is way  understated. I can't find a business in Ohio that hasn't benefited from  it.   Some are doing more than others, no question about it. Some of the  big financial service companies are giving big wage increases. Other  small businesses might be investing in a new piece of equipment, but  there are so many businesses out there. They are not all putting out  press releases or talking about it, but they are doing something. This  is good.   This is why you see this economic growth coming up, finally, after so  many years of flat wages and high expenses. You are seeing people begin  to see a little improvement in their wages. That is really important.   First are the international parts. Second is what this is doing in  terms of the business side and how that affects people. The third one  is direct tax relief to individuals because that is part of this bill  too. If you hear people talk about this bill--sometimes on the other  side of the aisle--you would think that is not in there. It is very  much in there.   People are able to keep more of their hard-earned money, and it goes  directly to the middle-class constituents whom I represent. They are  the ones who get the biggest bang for their buck because we doubled the  standard deduction, taking it from $12,000 to $24,000 for a family  because we doubled the child tax credit, including increasing the part  that is refundable. Even if you don't have an income tax liability, you  get it.   We also lowered tax rates for people. That combination means that  people have seen their paychecks go up. About 90 percent of workers in  America got a paycheck that had more money going into their bank  account rather than to Uncle Sam because their withholding changed. You  know this if you are listening today because you probably had this  happen to you if you are one of the 90 percent, which you probably are.  Uncle Sam is taking a little less withholding, and you are able to keep  a little more.   As I said consistently during the debate on tax reform, and we went  back and forth on this, I just said: Look, the proof is in the  paycheck. We can argue this all day long. When people get their  paycheck, it is either going to be better or not. For 90 percent of the  people I represent, it is better. Of course, they are happy about that.   In addition to that, we also made the Tax Code more progressive. What  does that mean? That means those at the top of the income ladder are  actually paying a larger portion of the overall tax burden, not a  smaller portion. Let me say that again. The Tax Code is more  progressive. If you are at the top of the income ladder, you are now  paying a larger portion of the overall tax burden. At the lower end,  you are paying less in terms of the overall tax burden. The biggest  percentage tax increase is for those making over $1 million a year, and  the biggest tax decrease is for those making $30,000 a year or less.  This is why the Joint Committee on Taxation, in response to questions I  asked them directly, said that over 3 million Americans now have no tax  liability at all in terms of income tax liability thanks to this tax  reform effort because they are at the lower end of the economic scale.  Before, they had a tax liability, but now they don't because of a lower  rate doubling the standard deduction--doubling the tax credit.   Three million Americans don't have to worry about Uncle Sam because  they don't have tax liability anymore under this bill. This has changed  the way our tax bill works. The Joint Committee on Taxation can show  you those numbers. All of this resulted in higher wages for the first  time in about a decade. This was the strongest wage growth for  nonsupervisory employees in 9 years. That is the latest data. You  [[Page S4491]]  can check it out at the Department of Labor.   It also resulted in a lot more optimism out there. If you look at the  surveys on optimism--I saw there was one done by an NBC station  recently saying this is the highest level of optimism they have seen.   There is optimism also in small businesses. The National Federation  of Independent Business does surveys regularly. Their surveys are  unprecedented because they are coming back saying that small businesses  are ready to invest now and planning to invest.   In my home State of Ohio, we had the Ohio Chamber of Commerce do a  survey recently. They found that 70 percent of the businesses already  added new employees. We are now in the second quarter, and 75 percent  are planning to add new employees. It is amazing. This is actually  happening as we talk because we changed a tax system that was  discouraging growth, discouraging investment, and making it harder for  people to get ahead, harder to see wages go up to meet expenses.   There are good things going on. Since December, the number of long- term unemployed people has decreased by about 400,000 people. The  unemployment rate has fallen from 4.9 percent to 4.3 percent in my home  State of Ohio. Nationally, unemployment is now down to 3.8 percent, the  lowest since 2000.   That is all good news. What do you hear now? I hear from businesses,  not so much about the tax burden--and, frankly, not so much about the  regulatory burden because Congress has also done some things to relieve  the regulatory burden, particularly for small businesses--but I hear  that finding qualified workers is their biggest challenge. I heard it  last weekend, and I will hear it this coming weekend.   As a small business person myself, I sense it. It is a major hurdle  right now. There is a shortage of workers. A big reason is what  economists call the labor force participation rate. What does that  mean? It just means the number of Americans who are unemployed and not  looking for work at all is higher than it has been in the past. These  are folks who are on the sidelines. They are not even reported in the  unemployment numbers. It is so bad, our labor force participation rate  was at its prerecession level of 66 percent of people working rather  than the current 62.7 percent. If we just had a level of 66 percent  working 10 years ago, our unemployment rate today would not be 3.8  percent. If you take into account those people, our unemployment rate  would be about 8.6 percent. It is pretty disappointing.   That is one challenge we still have with this incredible tax relief  and tax cut legislation, and increasing economic opportunities, growing  jobs, and raising wages. We still have a lot of people who are on the  sidelines and not in the workforce.   Among able-bodied men, by the way, between 25 and 55, 8.5 million of  them are in this category. They are not even showing up in the  unemployment numbers. That is wrong. You want them to have the dignity  and self-respect that comes from work, and our economy needs these  people to be able to work.   According to the Congressional Budget Office's 30-year projection  they gave us yesterday, they think the labor force participation rate  will get even worse. That is what they told us yesterday. It will be  declining over the next 30 years to even below what it is now--below 60  percent. That can't happen. That is unacceptable.   The low labor force participation rate cannot be the new normal, and  it can't get worse. We want people to get that dignity and self-respect  that comes from work. We want them to enter into our economy.   As the economy is growing and businesses are expanding, there is no  better time to reverse this trend, to bring people into the economy and  bring them back to work.   I have dug into this issue, trying to figure out why this is. There  are a number of reasons: dependency on government programs and being  sure we don't have people go to work who then lose all their benefits  right away--trying to deal with that cliff. Then there is the tax  issue. When you go to work, you have higher taxes. We should do more to  get people into work making more pay. We should have work requirements  in some of these programs. That has been talked about a lot on the  floor. We should deal with other issues, including the skills gap. We  are doing it with career technical schools and other things.                               Opioid Epidemic    Mr. President, I want to mention the single most important problem we  face, and that is the opioid crisis. I say this because the opioid  epidemic has hit our country and is, by the way, the No. 1 killer in my  State of Ohio right now and in many States around the country. It is  already having a devastating impact on everything--on crime, families,  the ability for jails to work, our healthcare system to work--but it is  also affecting employment in huge ways.   A recent report by the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland found that  counties with higher levels of opioid prescriptions have lower  workforce participation rates. It is no wonder. They surveyed the  business community, and about half the organizations they contacted  said the opioid epidemic has negatively impacted their businesses.  People can't get through the drug tests. Also, people aren't applying  for work.   Why do I say that? Well, the Department of Labor did a study earlier  this year that showed 44 percent of these people outside the workforce  altogether, who are off in the shadows or on the sidelines--44 percent  of them had taken a drug, a pain medication the previous day. The  Brookings Institute says the number is 47 percent. When further pushed,  two-thirds said they were taking prescription pain medication. That is  amazing. That 44 percent is likely underreported. There is a stigma  attached to the opioid crisis. Second, there is a legal issue for a lot  of people.   It is not like this is an overreported number. That is an amazing  number that nearly half of the people who are outside the workforce are  saying they are taking pain medication on a daily basis. The sad  reality is, again, it is likely to be much higher than that.   We know what we have to do. We need to get people into treatment,  support them, help them overcome their addiction, and get them back to  work and leading productive lives. There are things Congress can and  should do to take care of that.   I ask unanimous consent to continue to discuss solutions to the  opioid epidemic after the majority leader has a chance to make his  remarks.    Mr. President, we talked a little about the growing  economy, and we talked about the fact that one of the weaknesses we  have is, in spite of a growing economy and lower unemployment--all this  good news coming with the tax cuts and tax reforms and investments--we  have a problem, which is that many people are outside the workforce  altogether.   Historically high levels of labor force participation are not being  part of the workforce, but instead people are being sidelined. How do  you get those people back to work? There are 8.5 million men between 25  and 55, as an example, who are not working. They are not showing up on  the unemployment numbers because they are not looking for work.   There are a number of reasons for that. The one I think that is most  significant today, that puts us at this high level of people outside  the workforce, is the opioid epidemic. I am talking about the fact that  we have data on this from the Federal Reserve. We have data on this  from the Brookings Institute and data from the Department of Labor and  the Trump administration showing this is a huge problem.   About half the people, for instance, outside the workforce altogether  are taking pain medication on a regular basis. This opioid crisis is  affecting us in every way. What is Congress doing about it?   We have made progress. In the last couple of years, we have made  unprecedented progress to combat addiction with legislation like the  Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act, a bipartisan bill I  coauthored with my colleague Senator Whitehouse. We have the 20th  Century Cures Act, which has been very important in getting funding out  to the States to deal with this crisis. We just passed legislation that  provides more funding for the kind of treatment and prevention in  longer term recovery programs that are proven to work, that have  evidence-based results behind them.   That is all very important. We need to continue to push back against  this addiction by helping people get the care they need and the  treatment they need to overcome their dependency.   By the way, I have been with three community roundtables in the last  few weeks talking specifically about how this funding is being used. It  is exciting because it is being used on innovative new ideas that will  make a big difference going forward, in terms of getting people who are  addicted and overdosing. We are getting them the Narcan they need to  save their lives and then not allowing that gap to occur where they go  back to that same environment but getting them into treatment. There  are quick response teams--a combination of law enforcement, social  workers, and treatment providers getting in immediately saying: OK. You  overdosed. Your life was saved by this Narcan--this miracle drug that  reverses the effect of the overdose. Now, instead of going back to your  old community where, unfortunately, many of those people are overdosing  again and again, let's get you into treatment.   One of these organizations that is funded by the Comprehensive  Addiction and Recovery Act is telling me they are getting an 80-percent  success rate getting people into treatment. That is huge. It is still  too low, but that is so much higher, unfortunately, than what is  typical out there.   So we are beginning to make progress--closing some of the gaps,  getting people into the treatment they need, and sending a stronger  prevention message out there, keeping people out of the funnel of  addiction in the first place. But, in the meantime, we have a huge  problem, and it is not getting better in my home State. It is actually  getting worse.   In most areas of the State, you will now see higher rates of  addiction and more overdoses, and the increase is almost all due to one  thing, and that is fentanyl. This is this synthetic form of opioid that  is now coming in and kind of taking over, pushing out heroin,  prescription drugs, and other drugs.   Fentanyl is incredibly powerful--50 times more powerful than heroin.  It is incredibly inexpensive. We are told by the experts that most of  it is coming from China--not over land from Mexico but from China-- through our U.S. mail system. It is unbelievable. It is a shock, but it  is true. It is so potent that a few flakes of it can be deadly. It is  totally unacceptable that in some laboratory in China, some evil  scientist is making this poison and being allowed to ship it into our  country.   It is now the No. 1 cause of death in my home State. Two-thirds of  our overdose deaths last year, we believe, are going to be as a result  of fentanyl, not heroin or prescription drugs. It is tragic and eye- opening that, when you look at what has happened, the Ohio Alliance for  Innovation in Population Health has estimated that opioid overdoses  were responsible for more than 500,000 years of life expectancy lost in  Ohio between 2010 and 2016. It is an interesting way to look at it. It  is tragic. More than 500,000 years of life expectancy were lost in Ohio  between 2010 and the end of 2016.   Overdoses are now the top cause of deaths for all Americans over the  age of 50. It is the top cause of death in my home State for everybody.   Increasingly, these drug overdoses are from fentanyl. In Ohio, two- thirds of overdose deaths last year were from fentanyl. That is up from  about 58 percent in 2016. It is the deadliest, most difficult drug for  us to deal with right now.   Two weeks ago, the police in Dayton, OH, seized about 20 pounds of  fentanyl during a drug arrest. Last Friday, Federal agents in Columbus  arrested 4 people and seized 22 pounds of fentanyl. Taken together,  these two busts--20 pounds and 22 pounds of fentanyl--is enough  fentanyl to kill 9.5 million people. Think about that. By the way, that  is about 80 percent of the population in my State of Ohio, from just  these two busts alone.   On Monday we had a tele-townhall here. We do these on a monthly  basis. We asked a number of questions. One question I have started to  ask in the last several years is this: Do you know anybody who has been  directly affected by the opioid epidemic?   We had the highest percentage of response ever at our townhall  meeting here on Monday. The tele-townhall response was that 67 percent  of the people on the call said yes. Over two-thirds of the people on  this call said that yes, they knew someone who has been directly  affected by the opioid epidemic. That is the highest level we have had.   One woman I spoke to on the call, Pauline from Zanesville, OH, told  me a tragic story that is, unfortunately, similar to other ones I hear  as I travel across the State. It was about her brother. Her brother had  died of an overdose. Her brother, according to her, did not use  opioids, and yet he died of an opioid overdose. She said he did smoke  marijuana, but she said somehow there was something put into the  marijuana that he was smoking that caused him to overdose and die.   I hear this story a lot back home. I talked about the three  roundtable discussions we had recently in Ohio. In two of those three  roundtables, a police chief and a sheriff, respectively, told me about  a young man who overdosed, who was saved by Narcan, and then woke up  and said: I was just smoking dope. Well, they checked, and guess what  it was? It was fentanyl that had been sprinkled into the marijuana.   I am sure it is the same situation with Pauline's brother. The  fentanyl that she talked about was what killed him.   What is the lesson here? It is that every street drug--whether it is  cocaine, whether it is heroin, whether it is crystal meth--all of them  are now subject to having fentanyl included within them, including  description  [[Page S4493]]  pills, because sometimes they are reformulated to make it look like  prescription pills.   That fentanyl is the killer. It is not that those other drugs can't  cause you to overdose and die also, but with regard to fentanyl, that  is the deadliest and riskiest of all. Any of these street drugs can be  deadly. We need to combat this drug influx of fentanyl, and Congress  has had a breakthrough recently in a way to do that.   I mentioned that it primarily comes from China, and it primarily  comes through our U.S. postal system. The STOP Act, which is bipartisan  legislation that I authored with my colleague Amy Klobuchar from  Minnesota--I see her colleague is on the floor now--will combat  fentanyl at the source by closing a loophole that is currently in place  in the Federal law.   After 9/11, we insisted that all of the private carriers--FedEx, UPS,  DHL--had to give law enforcement information about every package that  comes into America. This was after 9/11, remember. We asked the post  office to study it, and we asked the Postmaster General to get together  with the Homeland Security people and to come up with an answer. That  was 16 years ago, and it hasn't happened.   Even though you send something by one of these private carriers, like  FedEx, you have to provide this information up front: What is in the  package? Where is it from? Where is it going?   Electronically, law enforcement takes that big data and decides what  packages should be taken offline. They have been able to stop a lot of  bad stuff, including fentanyl, from coming through. The post office  doesn't require that because we haven't required it here in the  Congress. It is time for us to do that.    I am pleased to tell you that after a few years of work, last week  the House of Representatives passed the STOP Act by a vote of 353 to  52. The appropriate committee here in the Senate that has jurisdiction,  the Finance Committee, also agreed to discharge the STOP Act recently.  So now we can vote on it in the full Senate and get it to the  President's desk to be signed into law.   As we developed the STOP Act, we conducted an 18-month investigation  into this in the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, which I  chair. We revealed just how easy it was to purchase fentanyl online and  have it shipped to the United States.   Based on our undercover investigation, these drugs could be found  through a simple Google search. Overseas sellers accessed through an  undercover investigator, essentially guaranteed delivery if fentanyl  was sent through the U.S. Postal Service, not if it was sent through  one of the private carriers.   Traffickers prefer the Postal Service because it doesn't have the  screening that you have through the private carriers. So we need to be  sure that the requirement is met with the advanced electronic data that  is on all of the packages coming in. It tells law enforcement that they  need to be able to use big data to identify suspicious packages and to  keep this poison from coming into our communities.   That law is something we can do right now. The post office would say:  Well, we are beginning to provide that information. Unfortunately,  based on their testimony before my subcommittee, even with the pressure  from us over the last couple of years, only 36 percent of packages are  getting screened, and 20 percent of those aren't presented to law  enforcement, based on their testimony. Also, some of the information is  not helpful because it is not legible.   We need better data. We need to get 100 percent of the packages  subject to this data. We need to be sure we can do a better job of,  one, stopping the poison from coming into our country, into our  communities, into our homes, but also, at the very least, increasing  the cost of this. By reducing the supply, we can increase the cost.   One of the reasons fentanyl is growing so much is because it is so  incredibly powerful, but, also, it is so incredibly inexpensive.   Let's have a vote on the STOP Act in the Senate as soon as possible.  I think we can do it next month. Let's get it to the President. Let's  get it signed into law. There is an urgency here.   As I mentioned, in just 7 years, in my home State, Ohioans have lost  an estimated half million years of life expectancy as a result of  opioid overdoses.   The impact is far greater than that, though. There are families who  are broken apart. Prisons are flooded. Businesses are deplete of  workers because of this addiction. We talked about this earlier. There  is a lack of workforce because of this addiction.   The STOP Act will allow our country to push back against this  international influx of fentanyl and will help our economy continue  this positive momentum we have been experiencing since tax reform  became law. We can do so by combating this newest and deadliest scourge  of the opioid epidemic.   Thank you, Mr. President.   I yield back my time.
