 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 3147, the  Improving Safety and Security for Veterans Act of 2019.   The bill is indeed the companion to H.R. 5616, which I introduced in  January of this year following the death of seven veterans at our  Clarksburg VA Medical Center.   A former nursing assistant at the hospital has now pled guilty to  murdering these veterans by intentionally and inappropriately injecting  them with insulin. Her actions are beyond the pale. Congress must do  everything it can to ensure that this never happens again.   This bill was just the first step toward that goal. It will, indeed,  as you heard the chairman say, provide transparency and accountability  at our VA medical facilities by requiring the VA to submit to Congress  detailed reports on patient safety and quality of care at those  hospitals.   It will also ensure that the public is well-informed as to what  occurred in Clarksburg. The public was kept in the dark for far too  long during the course of this investigation.   Our veterans have sacrificed so much for our country, and they  deserve the best possible care and should feel safe when they come to  one of our facilities.   Congress now has the opportunity to restore the public's confidence  in our Veterans Affairs system and ensure that our veterans are  receiving the care they deserve.   I join with the chairman, Mr. Speaker, in saying that I urge all of  our colleagues to join unanimously in supporting this bill.
