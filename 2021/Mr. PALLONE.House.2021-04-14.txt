 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 172) to reauthorize the United States Anti-Doping Agency,  and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 172         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``United States Anti-Doping       Agency Reauthorization Act of 2021''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress makes the following findings:        (1) The United States Anti-Doping Agency--        (A) is the independent national anti-doping organization of       the United States; and        (B) manages the anti-doping program, results management       processes, drug reference resources, and athlete education       for all United States Olympic Committee-recognized national       governing bodies and the athletes and events of such national       governing bodies.        (2) The United States Anti-Doping Agency contributes to the       advancement of clean sport through scientific research, anti-      doping education, and outreach programs, and the mission of       the United States Anti-Doping Agency is to preserve the       integrity of competition and protect the rights of athletes.        (3) Participation in youth sports has the potential to       equip young athletes with important skills and values       necessary for success in life, and it is essential that the       culture of youth sports emphasizes such skills and values.        (4) The TrueSport program of the United States Anti-Doping       Agency partners with youth sport organizations across the       United States to promote sportsmanship, character building,       and healthy performance through the use of targeted       educational materials designed to promote a positive youth       sport experience.        (5) In modifying the authority of the United States Anti-      Doping Agency to include the promotion of the positive values       of youth sport, Congress sends a strong signal that the goals       of youth sport should include instilling in young athletes       the values of integrity, respect, teamwork, courage, and       responsibility.        (6) Due to the unique leadership position of the United       States in the global community, adequate funding of the anti-      doping and clean sport programs of the United States Anti-      Doping Agency is imperative to the preparation for the 2028       Summer Olympic Games, which will be held in Los Angeles,       California.        (7) Increased appropriations for fiscal years 2022 through       2030 would enable the United States Anti-Doping Agency to       directly affect the integrity and well-being of sport, both       domestically and internationally.       SEC. 3. MODIFICATIONS OF AUTHORITY.         Section 701 of the Office of National Drug Control Policy       Reauthorization Act of 2006 (21 U.S.C. 2001) is amended--        (1) in subsection (b)--        (A) by amending paragraph (1) to read as follows:        ``(1)(A) serve as the independent anti-doping organization       for the amateur athletic competitions recognized by the       United States Olympic and Paralympic Committee;        ``(B) be responsible for certifying in advance any testing       conducted by international organizations under the World       Anti-Doping Code for international amateur athletes and       athletic competitions occurring within the jurisdiction of       the United States; and        ``(C) be recognized worldwide as the independent national       anti-doping organization for the United States;'';        (B) in paragraph (4), by striking the period at the end and       inserting ``; and''; and        (C) by adding at the end the following:        ``(5) promote a positive youth sport experience by using a       portion of the funding of the United States Anti-Doping       Agency to provide educational materials on sportsmanship,       character building, and healthy performance for the athletes,       parents, and coaches who participate in youth sports.''; and        (2) by adding at the end the following:        ``(c) Due Process in Arbitration Proceedings.--Any action       taken by the United States Anti-Doping Agency to enforce a       policy, procedure, or requirement of the United States Anti-      Doping Agency against a person with respect to a violation of       Federal law, including an investigation, a disciplinary       action, a sanction, or any other administrative action, shall       be carried out in a manner that provides due process       protection to the person.''.       SEC. 4. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.         Section 703 of the Office of National Drug Control Policy       Reauthorization Act of 2006 (21 U.S.C. 2003) is amended to       read as follows:       ``SEC. 703. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.         ``There are authorized to be appropriated to the United       States Anti-Doping Agency--        ``(1) for fiscal year 2022, $15,500,000;        ``(2) for fiscal year 2023, $16,200,000;        ``(3) for fiscal year 2024, $16,900,000;        ``(4) for fiscal year 2025, $17,700,000;        ``(5) for fiscal year 2026, $18,500,000;        ``(6) for fiscal year 2027, $19,800,000;        ``(7) for fiscal year 2028, $22,100,000;        ``(8) for fiscal year 2029, $24,900,000; and        ``(9) for fiscal year 2030, $23,700,000.''.       SEC. 5. INFORMATION SHARING.         Except as otherwise prohibited by law and except in cases       in which the integrity of a criminal investigation would be       affected, pursuant to the obligation of the United States       under Article 7 of the United Nations Educational,       Scientific, and Cultural Organization International       Convention Against Doping in Sport done at Paris October 19,       2005, and ratified by the United States in 2008, the Attorney       General, the Secretary of Homeland Security, and the       Commissioner of Food and Drugs shall provide to the United       States Anti-Doping Agency any relevant information relating       to the prevention of the use of performance-enhancing drugs       or the prohibition of performance-enhancing methods.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 172.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise today in support of H.R. 172, the United States Anti-Doping  Agency Reauthorization Act of 2021.   For two decades, Mr. Speaker, the United States Anti-Doping Agency,  or USADA, has worked to ensure integrity in our American Olympic and  Paralympic sporting activities through the promotion and support of  drug-free competition.   Recommended by an Olympic committee task force, this independent  organization was established to manage a comprehensive anti-doping  program in the United States. And since its authorization in 2000,  USADA has helped to advance clean sports through scientific research,  anti-doping education, and outreach programs.   To ensure USADA can continue this good work, H.R. 172 would extend  and increase the authorization level through fiscal year 2030. Further,  this bill would empower USADA to encourage a positive sporting  environment for young athletes by providing educational materials on  sportsmanship, character building, and healthy performance.   The bill also improves anti-doping efforts in the U.S. by encouraging  Federal agencies to coordinate and share information with USADA to  prevent the use of performance-enhancing drugs and methods.   Taken together, these actions will make positive improvements to the  good work that USADA is already doing and provide critical support as  [[Page H1749]]  we lead up to the 2028 Summer Olympic and Paralympic Games in Los  Angeles.   I want to thank my colleagues, Representatives   Mike Thompson, Diana  DeGette, and Bill Johnson for leading this important bipartisan  legislation. I would also like to thank Ranking Member Rodgers and all  the members and staff of our committee for their efforts to move this  legislation forward in a bipartisan manner.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Thompson) who is the lead sponsor of the legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I have no additional speakers. I urge  support for the legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (S. 578) to improve the health and safety of Americans living with  food allergies and related disorders, including potentially life- threatening anaphylaxis, food protein-induced enterocolitis syndrome,  and eosinophilic gastrointestinal diseases, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                   S. 578         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Food Allergy Safety,       Treatment, Education, and Research Act of 2021'' or the       ``FASTER Act of 2021''.       SEC. 2. FOOD ALLERGY SAFETY.         (a) In General.--Section 201(qq)(1) of the Federal Food,       Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 321(qq)(1)) is amended by       striking ``and soybeans'' and inserting ``soybeans, and       sesame''.        (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by subsection (a)       shall apply to any food that is introduced or delivered for       introduction into interstate commerce on or after January 1,       2023.       SEC. 3. REPORT TO CONGRESS.         (a) Report.--Not later than 18 months after the date of       enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Health and Human       Services (referred to in this section as the ``Secretary'')       shall submit to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor,       and Pensions of the Senate and the Committee on Energy and       Commerce of the House of Representatives a report that       includes--        (1) descriptions of ongoing Federal activities related to--        (A) the surveillance and collection of data on the       prevalence of food allergies and severity of allergic       reactions for specific food or food ingredients, including       the identification of any gaps in such activities;        (B) the development of effective food allergy diagnostics;        (C) the prevention of the onset of food allergies;        (D) the reduction of risks related to living with food       allergies; and        (E) the development of new therapeutics to prevent, treat,       cure, and manage food allergies; and        (2) specific recommendations and strategies to expand,       enhance, or improve activities described in paragraph (1),       including--        (A) strategies to improve the accuracy of food allergy       prevalence data by expanding and intensifying current       collection methods, including support for research that       includes the identification of biomarkers and tests to       validate survey data and the investigation of the use of       identified biomarkers and tests in national surveys;        (B) strategies to overcome gaps in surveillance and data       collection activities related to food allergies and specific       food allergens; and        (C) recommendations for the development and implementation       of a regulatory process and framework that would allow for       the timely, transparent, and evidence-based modification of       the definition of ``major food allergen'' included in section       201(qq) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C.       321(qq)), including with respect to--  [[Page H1750]]         (i) the scientific criteria for defining a food or food       ingredient as a ``major food allergen'' pursuant to such       process, including recommendations pertaining to evidence of       the prevalence and severity of allergic reactions to a food       or food ingredient that would be required in order to       establish that such food or food ingredient is an allergen of       public health concern appropriate for such process; and        (ii) opportunities for stakeholder engagement and comment,       as appropriate, in considering any such modification to such       definition.        (b) Publication.--The Secretary shall make the report under       subsection (a) available on the internet website of the       Department of Health and Human Services.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on S. 578.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Food Allergy Safety,  Treatment, Education, and Research Act, also known as the FASTER Act.   An estimated 32 million Americans, including approximately one in  every 13 children, are affected by food allergies. These allergies can  pose significant risks, particularly when inaccurate food labels fail  to warn consumers about the presence of some of these allergens.   Under current law, eight allergens are considered major food  allergens. These allergens include milk, eggs, shellfish, tree nuts,  wheat, peanuts, and soybeans. Due to their status as major food  allergens, manufacturers must clearly state the presence of any of  these ingredients on labels.   Notably missing from this list of allergens is sesame. Sesame is  considered an allergen of growing concern. While its prevalence has  more than doubled over the last decade, it is not required to be listed  as an allergen on food packaging. In fact, in some cases, a food may  contain sesame, but the ingredient won't be listed at all on the  labels, instead being referred to through nonspecific terms such as  ``spices'' or words that may not be easily recognized by consumers as  containing sesame, such as tahini.   While many may not recognize the significance of a simple ingredients  label, for many families, a lack of clarity on ingredients could mean  life or death for those who are allergic to sesame. Clearly, this  information should be prominently featured on all packaged food labels.   This is an issue we have been working on for quite some time. I  previously introduced a bill several years ago that would list sesame  as a major food allergen, and although the Food and Drug Administration  opened a docket to solicit feedback about sesame labeling, the agency  has not been able to require the listing of sesame due to overly long  regulatory processes.   So today, Mr. Speaker, we are bypassing these regulatory delays and  taking action. The appropriately-named FASTER Act would quickly move  this process along by recognizing sesame as a major food allergen and  requiring its listing on new food labels after a phase-in process.   The bill will also require FDA to report recommendations on how we  can make additional improvements to protect individuals with food  allergies, including ways to add additional major food allergens.   So I want to thank Representative Matsui for her tireless work on  this bill. She is the prime sponsor. We came so close to getting this  over the finish line in the last Congress, and I am glad that today we  are sending this bill to President Biden for his signature. I am proud  to support the legislation. I encourage all Members to vote for it.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to the  gentlewoman from California (Ms. Matsui) who is the House sponsor of  the legislation.     Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill,  S. 578, the FASTER Act, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 189) to amend the Public Health Service Act to provide that  the authority of the Director of the National Institute on Minority  Health and Health Disparities to make certain research endowments  applies with respect to both current and former centers of excellence,  and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 189         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``John Lewis NIMHD Research       Endowment Revitalization Act of 2021''.       SEC. 2. RESEARCH ENDOWMENTS AT BOTH CURRENT AND FORMER                     CENTERS OF EXCELLENCE.         Paragraph (1) (beginning with ``(1) In general'') of       section 464z-3(h) of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C.       285t(h)) is amended to read as follows:        ``(1) In general.--The Director of the Institute may carry       out a program to facilitate minority health disparities       research and other health disparities research by providing       for research endowments--        ``(A) at current or former centers of excellence under       section 736; and        ``(B) at current or former centers of excellence under       section 464z-4.''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 189.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 189, the John Lewis  National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities Research  Endowment Revitalization Act of 2021. This legislation would resume  grants to minority academic institutions that fell out of eligibility  for funding through the NIMHD Research Endowment Program.   By allowing those schools to resume eligibility, we will once again  help these institutions conduct critical research into minority health  disparities.   COVID-19, Mr. Speaker, has further exacerbated many of the inequities  that minority communities experience when interacting with the  healthcare system, inequities that we know existed long before the  pandemic. In order to address the inequities in our healthcare system  and in our society, we must confront them head-on and work together to  eliminate them.   By supporting NIMHD and the academic institutions funded through it,  we are helping to advance minority health disparity research and  strengthen the diversity of the scientific workforce by recruiting and  retaining individuals underrepresented in these fields.   This bill is a step toward progress and an equitable public health  system. This bill is named after our former colleague, the late and  great Congressman John Lewis from Georgia, who introduced this  legislation last Congress. He was a dear friend and a longtime champion  of eliminating disparities across the board, and he is certainly  missed.   I want to thank my colleagues, the two sponsors, Representatives  Barragan and Carter, for leading the effort on this legislation this  year. This is truly bipartisan.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to the  gentlewoman from California (Ms. Barragan), a member of our committee  and the lead sponsor of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I urge support for this legislation, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 941) to reauthorize the Stem Cell Therapeutic and Research  Act of 2005, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 941         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Timely ReAuthorization of       Necessary Stem-cell Programs Lends Access to Needed Therapies       Act of 2021'' or the ``TRANSPLANT Act of 2021''.       SEC. 2.

(2) Eliminating deadwood.--Subparagraph (B) of section       379(d)(2) of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C.       274k(d)(2)) is amended by striking the second and third       sentences in such subparagraph.        (c) Periodic Review of State of Science.--Section 379 of       the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 274k) is amended by       adding at the end the following new subsection:        ``(o) Periodic Review of State of Science.--        ``(1) Review.--Not less frequently than every 2 years, the       Secretary, in consultation with the Director of the National       Institutes of Health, the Commissioner of Food and Drugs, the       Administrator of the Health Resources and Services       Administration, the Advisory Council, and other stakeholders,       where appropriate given relevant expertise, shall conduct a       review of the state of the science of using adult stem cells       and birthing tissues to develop new types of therapies for       patients, for the purpose of considering the potential       inclusion of such new types of therapies in the Program.        ``(2) Recommendations.--Not later than June 30, 2025, the       Secretary shall--        ``(A) complete the second review required by paragraph (1);       and        ``(B) informed by such review, submit to the Committee on       Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions of the Senate and the       Committee on Energy and Commerce of the House of       Representatives recommendations on the appropriateness of the       inclusion of new types of therapies in the Program.''.        (d) Authorization of Appropriations.--Section 379B of the       Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 274m) is amended by       striking ``$33,000,000 for fiscal year 2015 and $30,000,000       for each of fiscal years 2016 through 2020'' and inserting       ``$31,009,000 for each of fiscal years 2022 through 2026''.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 941.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, the C.W. Bill Young Transplant Program and the National  Cord Blood Inventory Program facilitate lifesaving bone marrow and  umbilical cord blood donations to help patients suffering from blood  cancers, disorders, and diseases.   These critical programs assist transplant patients by providing  additional information about bone marrow and cord blood transplants,  maintaining an efficient process for identifying donor matches, and  increasing the number of unrelated donors available for transplant. The  programs also collect data and expand research to improve patient  outcomes.   I thank my colleagues--Representatives Matsui, Bilirakis, and  Pingree--for their bipartisan leadership on this bill, and I would urge  my colleagues to support H.R. 941.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no additional speakers, but I think  my colleague does, so I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I also urge support for the bill, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (S. 164) to educate health care providers and the public on  biosimilar biological products, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                   S. 164         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on S. 164.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, the rising cost of prescription drugs continues to be a  major issue for families all across the country. These costs are  particularly daunting at a time when we are facing a severe economic  downturn and the ongoing pandemic.   We are committed to continuing to find solutions to make prescription  drugs more affordable for the American people. One important way to  help families out is to ensure they are aware of more affordable  options, like biosimilars and generics. These are both cheaper options,  but, unfortunately, utilization of these products continues to be too  low here in the United States.   The Advancing Education on Biosimilars Act of 2021 is commonsense  legislation that will help provide patients and healthcare providers  with greater information about biologics and biosimilars. To do this,  the bill requires the FDA to establish a public website with  educational materials, including what products are interchangeable, as  well as how to report any adverse events.   In addition, the bill would support the development of continuing  education programs for healthcare providers about biologics. It is  critical that healthcare providers and patients are aware of all of  their options, and this legislation will certainly help do that.   I am pleased to work with my colleagues in the Senate on this  legislation, and I urge my colleagues to support the bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no additional speakers.    Mr. Speaker, I also urge support for this bill, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (S. 415) to amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act with  respect to the scope of new chemical exclusivity.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to  [[Page H1756]]  revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on S.  415.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, rising prescription drug costs are a concern for so many  Americans. Skyrocketing costs can result in some people postponing or  altering treatment because the necessary drugs are simply priced out of  reach.   One way to help reduce drug costs is to provide early access to  generic drugs. This legislation we are considering today will help to  do that by ensuring that exclusivity, which can delay generics from  entering the market, is only made available to truly innovative  products. This will ensure that drug manufacturers cannot game the  system by simply making small tweaks to old drugs as a way to block or  delay competition. The legislation will also codify the Food and Drug  Administration's current approach to awarding exclusivity.   I thank Representatives Schrader and Guthrie for their bipartisan  work on this legislation with Senators Cassidy, Smith, and Marshall.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Oregon (Mr. Schrader), a member of the Energy and  Commerce Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I also urge support for this bill, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 1215) to establish an office within the Federal Trade  Commission and an outside advisory group to prevent fraud targeting  seniors and to direct the Commission to include additional information  in an annual report to Congress on fraud targeting seniors, and for  other purposes, as amended.

The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 1215.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak in support of H.R. 1215, the Fraud and  Scam Reduction Act. This bipartisan bill was introduced by  Representatives Blunt Rochester and Walberg with strong bipartisan  support of 16 other Members. It also incorporates a bill originally  introduced by Representatives Deutch, Buchanan, and Welch.   Reducing scams and fraud is an issue of utmost importance in every  community and especially so during these uncertain and unprecedented  times. Right now, we are seeing the best of humanity, but unscrupulous  scammers and fraudsters still abound, seeking to capitalize on the  confusion and fear that is out there.   Seniors are especially vulnerable. According to the most recent  report from the Federal Trade Commission, older adults reported nearly  $400 million in losses from fraud in 2018. It is rare to recover these  losses. We all need to work together to protect senior citizens from  scams before they fall victim and suffer monetary losses.   Mr. Speaker, this bill establishes a new senior scams prevention  advisory group composed of relevant government agencies and industry  representatives to collect and implement best practices that stop  scammers before they can cause harm. It will also establish new  programs to prevent fraud that targets seniors. The legislation will  also improve educational materials on senior scams and make sure that  they are publicly available.   This legislation also establishes an office at the FTC dedicated to  preventing fraud targeting seniors and monitoring the market for such  fraud. This office will also assist the FTC in monitoring the market  for mail, television, internet, and telemarketing fraud targeting  seniors. The office will also help with consumer education on fraud  targeting seniors.   The bill will help reinforce the efforts of the FTC to prevent fraud  and mitigate the massive losses from fraud targeting seniors.   I urge my colleagues to support this important measure, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to the  gentlewoman from Delaware (Ms. Blunt Rochester), who is also a member  of the Energy and Commerce Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I also urge support for the bill, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 1460) to encourage States to require the installation of  residential carbon monoxide detectors in homes, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1460         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

(a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:        (1) Carbon monoxide is a colorless, odorless gas produced       by burning any fuel. Exposure to unhealthy levels of carbon       monoxide can lead to carbon monoxide poisoning, a serious       health condition that could result in death.        (2) Unintentional carbon monoxide poisoning from motor       vehicles and improper operation of fuel-burning appliances,       such as furnaces, water heaters, portable generators, and       stoves, annually kills more than 400 individuals and sends       approximately 15,000 individuals to hospital emergency rooms       for treatment.        (3) Research shows that installing carbon monoxide alarms       close to the sleeping areas in residential homes and other       dwelling units can help avoid fatalities.        (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that       Congress should promote the installation of carbon monoxide       alarms in residential homes and dwelling units across the       United States in order to promote the health and public       safety of citizens throughout the United States.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 1460.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1460, the Nicholas and  Zachary Burt Memorial Carbon Monoxide Poisoning Prevention Act of 2021.   This important bipartisan bill was introduced again this Congress by  Representatives Ann Kuster and Buddy Carter.   Mr. Speaker, carbon monoxide--colorless, odorless, tasteless--is a  silent killer. More than 400 people die, and approximately 50,000  people visit emergency rooms each year in the U.S. from carbon monoxide  poisoning.   The tragedy is that these deaths and injuries are preventable with  the installation of carbon monoxide detectors. However, many people are  unaware of the importance of carbon monoxide detectors or don't know  how to install or maintain them properly.   This bill will change that. It will assist States in educating the  public on the dangers of carbon monoxide poisoning and the proper use  of carbon monoxide detectors. It will also provide States with grants  so they can purchase and install carbon monoxide detectors in the homes  of the elderly and low-income citizens, as well as in educational  facilities.   Mr. Speaker, I call on my colleagues to support this measure, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to the  gentlewoman from New Hampshire (Ms. Kuster), who is the lead sponsor of  the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I have no additional speakers, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I also urge support for the bill, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 446) to require the Federal Trade Commission to submit a  report to Congress on scams targeting seniors, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 446         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Protecting Seniors from       Emergency Scams Act''.       SEC. 2. FTC REPORT ON SCAMS TARGETING SENIORS DURING                     EMERGENCIES.         Not later than 30 days after the date of enactment of this       Act, the Federal Trade Commission (referred to in this Act as       the ``Commission'') shall submit a report to Congress       including--        (1) a description of the number and types of scams       identified by the Commission as being targeted at senior       citizens; and        (2) policy recommendations to prevent such scams,       especially as such scams relate to future national       emergencies.       SEC. 3. INCREASING AWARENESS OF SCAMS TARGETING SENIORS.         (a) In General.--As soon as practicable after the date of       enactment of this Act, the Commission shall update its web       portal to include the latest information, searchable by       region and type of scam, on scams targeting seniors,       including contacts for relevant law enforcement and adult       protective service agencies.        (b) Coordination With Media Outlets and Law Enforcement.--      The Commission shall work with media outlets and law       enforcement to distribute the information included in the web       portal of the Commission pursuant to subsection (a) to senior       citizens and their families and caregivers.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 446.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak in support of H.R. 446, the Protecting  Seniors from Emergency Scams Act. Representatives Kelly and Balderson  introduced this bipartisan legislation to further efforts by the FTC to  stop fraud targeting seniors.   This bill streamlines efforts to protect seniors from falling prey to  scams during national emergencies, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, by  establishing a searchable database of scams targeting seniors.   In the Committee on Energy and Commerce, we have held multiple  hearings exploring the rise in fraud and scams that have come with the  COVID-19 pandemic.   Unfortunately, scammers often take advantage of the fear and  uncertainty that results from emergency situations. And since the  beginning of the COVID pandemic, consumers have reported losing more  than $300 million in just pandemic-related fraud.   After Hurricane Sandy ravaged the East Coast, including my own  district in New Jersey, scammers preyed on people who lost their homes  and livelihoods. We saw contracting scammers promising to rebuild  people's homes but who took the money and ran. One man was in prison  for using fake titles to sell Sandy-damaged cars.   Unfortunately, older Americans are targeted disproportionately and  affected by this fraud. Older Americans reported significantly bigger  monetary losses from fraud than younger adults.   According to a recent FTC report, phone scams result in the highest  reported losses by older adults, particularly adults over 80. Phone- based scams can be especially problematic in emergency situations like  the pandemic when people are spending more time at home and seniors may  be more isolated.  [[Page H1761]]    Representatives Kelly and Balderson's bill will help address these  scams. It directs the FTC to issue a report on fraud targeting seniors  during the pandemic and how to improve efforts against senior scams  during future emergencies.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to join me in supporting this  bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1345     Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to the  gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. Kelly), the lead sponsor of the bill who  has worked so hard, particularly during the pandemic, to address  disparities in healthcare.    Mr. Speaker, I also urge support for the bill, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 1762) to direct the Federal Trade Commission to submit to  Congress a report on unfair or deceptive acts or practices targeted at  Indian Tribes or members of Indian Tribes, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1762         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Protecting Indian Tribes       from Scams Act''.       SEC. 2. PROTECTING INDIAN TRIBES FROM UNFAIR OR DECEPTIVE                     ACTS OR PRACTICES.         (a) FTC Report on Unfair or Deceptive Acts or Practices       Targeting Indian Tribes.--Not later than 1 year after the       date of the enactment of this Act, and after consultation       with Indian Tribes, the Commission shall make publicly       available on the website of the Commission and submit to the       Committee on Energy and Commerce of the House of       Representatives and the Committee on Commerce, Science, and       Transportation of the Senate a report on unfair or deceptive       acts or practices targeted at Indian Tribes or members of       Indian Tribes, including--        (1) a description of the types of unfair or deceptive acts       or practices identified by the Commission as being targeted       at Indian Tribes or members of Indian Tribes;        (2) a description of the consumer education activities of       the Commission with respect to such acts or practices;        (3) a description of the efforts of the Commission to       collaborate with Indian Tribes to prevent such acts or       practices or to pursue persons using such acts or practices;        (4) a summary of the enforcement actions taken by the       Commission related to such acts or practices; and        (5) any recommendations for legislation to prevent such       acts or practices.        (b) Increasing Awareness of Unfair or Deceptive Acts or       Practices Targeting Indian Tribes.--Not later than 6 months       after the date of the submission of the report required by       subsection (a), the Commission shall update the website of       the Commission to include information for consumers and       businesses on identifying and avoiding unfair or deceptive       acts or practices targeted at Indian Tribes or members of       Indian Tribes.        (c) Commission Defined.--In this section, the term       ``Commission'' means the Federal Trade Commission.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 1762.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  [[Page H1762]]    Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak in support of H.R. 1762, the Protecting  Indian Tribes from Scams Act. The often-overlooked area in Federal  fraud prevention efforts is scams targeting Indian Tribes and Tribal  members. The scope and scale of scams affecting Indian Tribes have not  been well documented, hindering efforts to prevent them.   This bipartisan bill, reintroduced this Congress by Representatives  Mullin and O'Halleran, will help get the needed information about fraud  and scams targeting Tribes and members of Tribes. This bill directs the  FTC to consult with Indian Tribes about these scams and then issue a  report to Congress that will be made public. It also requires the FTC  to update its website to include information on these scams.   Mr. Speaker, as this pandemic continues, scammers are taking  advantage of people's fear and uncertainty to steal people's money and  commit fraud. American Indians are not exempt from these unfair and  deceptive practices and may even be specifically targeted with certain  kinds of scams. But there is not much information about it.   Mr. Speaker, I commend Representatives Mullin and O'Halleran for  introducing this bill, an important step in helping prevent fraud and  scams targeting Tribes and members of Tribes. I urge my colleagues to  support the bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no additional speakers, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I also urge support for the bill, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 1766) to enhance cooperation between the Federal Trade  Commission and State Attorneys General to combat unfair and deceptive  practices, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1766         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``FTC Collaboration Act of       2021''.       SEC. 2. UNFAIR AND DECEPTIVE PRACTICES COOPERATION STUDY.         (a) In General.--        (1) Study required.--Not later than 1 year after the date       of the enactment of this Act, the Federal Trade Commission       shall conduct a study on facilitating and refining existing       efforts with State Attorneys General to prevent, publicize,       and penalize frauds and scams being perpetrated on       individuals in the United States.        (2) Requirements of study.--In conducting the study, the       Commission shall examine the following:        (A) The roles and responsibilities of the Commission and       State Attorneys General that best advance collaboration and       consumer protection.        (B) The policies, procedures, and mechanisms that       facilitate cooperation and communications across the       Commission.        (C) How resources should be dedicated to best advance such       collaboration and consumer protection.        (D) The accountability mechanisms that should be       implemented to promote collaboration and consumer protection.        (3) Consultation and public comment.--In producing the       study required in paragraph (1), the Commission shall--        (A) consult with--        (i) the National Association of State Attorneys General;        (ii) public interest organizations dedicated to consumer       protection;        (iii) relevant private sector entities; and        (iv) any other Federal or State agency that the Federal       Trade Commission considers necessary; and        (B) provide opportunity for public comment and advice       relevant to the production of the study.        (b) Report to Congress.--Not later than 6 months after the       completion of the study required pursuant to subsection (a),       the Commission shall submit to the Committee on Energy and       Commerce of the House of Representatives and the Committee on       Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate, and make       publicly available on the website of the Commission, a report       that contains the following:        (1) The results of the study.        (2) Recommended best practices to enhance collaboration       efforts between the Commission and State Attorneys General       with respect to preventing, publicizing, and penalizing fraud       and scams.        (3) Quantifiable metrics by which enhanced collaboration       can be measured.        (4) Legislative recommendations, if any, to enhance       collaboration efforts between the Commission and State       Attorneys General to prevent, publicize, and penalize fraud       and scams.        (c) Commission Defined.--In this section, the term       ``Commission'' means the Federal Trade Commission.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 1766.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak in support of H.R. 1766, the FTC  Collaboration Act of 2021. This bipartisan bill was introduced again  this year by Representatives O'Halleran and Hudson.  [[Page H1763]]  The bill will help reinforce the important relationship between the FTC  and State attorneys general.   Our State attorneys general play a critical role in enforcing and  complementing Federal consumer protection laws. The FTC is a relatively  small law enforcement agency charged with protecting consumers across  the country. By partnering with State attorneys general, the reach of  Federal consumer protection efforts is expanded. Stronger enforcement  actions can be taken against unscrupulous companies and those engaging  in unfair and deceptive practices hurting consumers.   When Americans are harmed by fraud and scams, they often turn to  their State attorneys general for help, but these scammers may be  targeting people across the country. By working together, State AGs and  the FTC can pool their resources and protect consumers across the  country.   This bill will help the FTC optimize its collaboration with State  attorneys general by studying the matter and issuing a report on how to  further promote collaboration.

Section 304 of the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C.       824) is amended by adding at the end the following:        ``(h) The Attorney General may issue an order to prohibit,       conditionally or unconditionally, and permanently or for such       period as the Attorney General may determine, any person from       being registered under this title to manufacture, distribute,       or dispense a controlled substance or a list I chemical, if       the Attorney General finds that--        ``(1) such person meets or has met any of the conditions       for suspension or revocation of registration under subsection       (a); and        ``(2) such person has a history of prior suspensions or       revocations of registration.''.       SEC. 3. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS.         The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 1002.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1002, the Debarment  Enforcement of Bad Actor Registrants Act of 2021, or the DEBAR Act of  2021.   One of the critical missions of the Drug Enforcement Administration  is enforcing and implementing the Controlled Substances Act in order to  prevent drug diversion and limit access to substances that may pose a  risk if used incorrectly.   One important lever the DEA has at its disposal to manage diversion  or noncompliance with the law is the ability to revoke or surrender an  individual's controlled substance registration, which is needed to  handle controlled substances.   A recent report by the Department of Justice Office of the Inspector  General found weaknesses in the DEA's current registration processes  and instances where the agency did not fully utilize its regulatory  authorities to address noncompliance. Specifically, the inspector  general found cases where entities whose registration were revoked were  later able to obtain a new license.   For example, the report included one case where a doctor who had  their registration revoked for serious misconduct then moved to another  State under the authority of a different DEA field division and was  granted a controlled substances registration after reapplying.   Another example in the report included a dentist who had voluntarily  surrendered his medical license and DEA registration on two separate  occasions. The dentist had also been convicted of a felony, which is  grounds for suspension or revocation of an individual's registration  under the Controlled Substances Act. However, this dentist was still  able to obtain another DEA registration.   Amid rising substance abuse and tragic drug overdoses, errors like  these can be tragic and simply should not be happening. H.R. 1002 would  address these errors by authorizing the debarment of any registrant who  either meets the criteria for temporary or permanent suspension or  revocation or has a history of prior suspensions or revocations.   I thank my committee colleagues--Representative Latta, in  particular--for leading this legislation, and also Ranking Member  Rodgers for her work on this legislation.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the bill, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I also urge support for the legislation,  and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 1899) to amend the Controlled Substances Act to provide for  the modification, transfer, and termination of a registration to  manufacture, distribute, or dispense controlled substances or list I  chemicals, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1899         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Ensuring Compliance Against       Drug Diversion Act of 2021''.       SEC. 2. MODIFICATION, TRANSFER, AND TERMINATION OF                     REGISTRATION TO MANUFACTURE, DISTRIBUTE, OR                     DISPENSE CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.         Subsection (a) of section 302 of the Controlled Substances       Act (21 U.S.C. 822) is amended by adding at the end the       following new paragraph:        ``(3)(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (C), the       registration of any registrant under this title to       manufacture, distribute, or dispense controlled substances or       list I chemicals terminates if and when such registrant--        ``(i) dies;        ``(ii) ceases legal existence;        ``(iii) discontinues business or professional practice; or        ``(iv) surrenders such registration.        ``(B) In the case of such a registrant who ceases legal       existence or discontinues business or professional practice,       such registrant shall promptly notify the Attorney General in       writing of such fact.        ``(C) No registration under this title to manufacture,       distribute, or dispense controlled substances or list I       chemicals, and no authority conferred thereby, may be       assigned or otherwise transferred except upon such conditions       as the Attorney General may specify and then only pursuant to       written consent. A registrant to whom a registration is       assigned or transferred pursuant to the preceding sentence       may not manufacture, distribute, or dispense controlled       substances or list I chemicals pursuant to such registration       until the Attorney General receives such written consent.        ``(D) In the case of a registrant under this title to       manufacture, distribute, or dispense controlled substances or       list I chemicals desiring to discontinue business or       professional practice altogether or with respect to       controlled substances and list I chemicals (without assigning       or transferring such business or professional practice to       another entity), such registrant shall return to the Attorney       General for cancellation--        ``(i) the registrant's certificate of registration;        ``(ii) any unexecuted order forms in the registrant's       possession; and        ``(iii) any other documentation that the Attorney General       may require.''.       SEC. 3. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS.         The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 1899.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1899, the Ensuring  Compliance Against Drug Diversion Act.   The Drug Enforcement Administration is charged with regulating  controlled substances and manages access to these substances through a  registration system. This system is meant to identify entities that  manufacture, distribute, and dispense controlled substances, such as  opioids; as well as to prevent diversion of these substances. We rely  on the DEA to maintain the integrity of this system as one way to stop  illicit diversion before it starts.   However, a 2018 Government Accountability Office report found over  700 registrants in the DEA's system may have been ineligible for  registration under the Controlled Substances Act. In fact, the GAO  found that some of these registrants were reportedly deceased, did not  possess State-level authority, or were incarcerated for offenses  related to controlled substances.   If we are to curb rising substance abuse in the U.S., we must ensure,  Madam Speaker, that bad actors are prevented from having access to  these substances. The legislation we are considering today would  terminate the  [[Page H1765]]  controlled substance registration of any registrant if the registrant  dies, ceases legal existence, discontinues business or professional  practice, or surrenders their registration. This bill also codifies DEA  authority to ensure accuracy of registrations and limit the transfer of  such registrations.   I thank the lead sponsor of this bill, Representative Griffith, for  his leadership on this issue.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I also urge support for the bill, and I  yield back the balance of my time.
