 Madam President, it is with great pleasure that I  rise, along with Senator Tom Carper of Delaware and Representative Lisa  Blunt Rochester of Delaware, to recognize Allen Chorman & Son, Inc., a  longstanding Delaware business that has provided exemplary service to  the State and its surrounding areas for 30 years.   Since 1987, Allen Chorman & Son, Inc., has played a vital role in the  success of one of Delaware's key economic resources: farming. With the  largest aerial spraying business in the State, Allen Chorman & Son,  Inc., has assisted farmers in increasing crop efficiency via pesticide  spraying and fertilizer spraying--sometimes in instances when ground  conditions are not conducive to tractor services. Allen Chorman & Son,  Inc., also provides critical mosquito spraying for both rural and urban  areas. We are honored to extend our sincere thanks for their commitment  and unyielding efforts to support one of our Nation's most valuable  industries: agriculture.   In addition to aiding farmers within Delaware and the surrounding  areas with critical crop services, Allen Chorman & Son, Inc., has  assisted in environmental preservation efforts, monitoring artificial  reefs off of the Delaware and Maryland coasts, as well as spraying  invasive plants that, if uncontrolled, can choke area wetlands. We are  truly honored to extend our appreciation for everything the business  has accomplished.   We wholeheartedly congratulate the many staff members past and  present of Allen Chorman & Son, Inc., on 30 years of service to the  State of Delaware and surrounding areas. Your quality of service and  continued care for our farms and environment set an exemplary standard  of service for many others to follow. We wish you continued growth and  success.                            ____________________     Madam President, it is with great pleasure that I  rise, along with Senator Tom Carper of Delaware and Representative Lisa  Blunt Rochester of Delaware, to honor one of Delaware's longstanding  businesses that has provided exemplary service to the State of Delaware  for the past 50 years: King Crop Insurance, Inc.   Since 1967, King Crop Insurance, Inc., has played an essential role  in meeting the needs of Delaware farmers and those in its surrounding  areas. From providing financial assistance and support--ensuring that  farms have the economic security to repay loans--to aiding those same  farmers in expanding and growing their businesses, King Crop Insurance  has committed itself to the people of our great State, while exhibiting  unyielding support of one our Nation's most valuable industries:  agriculture.   The values of hard work and giving back to their community have  always been a part of the King family. Catherine, Jackie, Donna, and  the entire family are known throughout the State of Delaware for their  generosity and support of local agricultural programs, such as the 4-H.  The Kings are visible examples of serving others, as well as sowing  seeds of success for the future. We are truly grateful for all they  have done to inspire business growth and development, as well as  preparing future generations for success in farming.   We wholeheartedly congratulate King Crop Insurance, Inc., on 50 years  of service to the State of Delaware and surrounding areas. Your quality  of service and continued care for our farming community serves as a  wonderful example for many others. We wish everyone the best.                            ____________________
