 Mr. Chief Justice.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Senator from Iowa.    I send a question to the desk.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Senator Grassley asks counsel for the President:         Does the House's failure to enforce its subpoenas render       its ``obstruction of Congress'' theory unprecedented?    Mr. Counsel PHILBIN. Mr. Chief Justice, Senators, the answer is yes.  As far as I am aware, there has never been a prior instance in which  there has been an attempt, even in the House, as in the Nixon  proceeding--never mind in the Clinton proceeding, which actually left  the House and came to the Senate--to suggest that there can be  obstruction of Congress when there hasn't been anything beyond simply  issuing a subpoena, getting resistance, and then throwing up your hands  and giving up and saying: Oh, well, that is obstruction.   In the Clinton situation, most of the litigation was with independent  counsel, and there were privileges asserted in litigation and  litigation again and again, but the point is that the issues about the  privileges were all litigated, and they were resolved before things  came to this body.   Similarly, in the Nixon impeachment proceeding within the House, a  lot of investigation had been done by the special counsel, and there  was litigation over assertions of privileges there in order to get the  tapes, and some tapes and transcripts had already been turned over,  but, again, there was litigation about the assertion of the privilege  in response to the grand jury subpoena that then fed into the House's  proceedings.   So it would be completely unprecedented for the House to attempt to  actually bring a charge of obstruction into the Senate where all they  can present is: Well, we issued a subpoena, and there were legal  grounds asserted for the invalidity of the subpoena, and there were  different grounds, as I have gone through. I will not repeat them all  in detail here.   Some of those subpoenas were just invalid when issued because there  was no vote. Some of the subpoenas for witnesses were invalid because  senior advisers to the President had absolute immunity from compulsion.  Some were that they were forcing executive branch officials to testify  without the benefit of agency counsel and executive branch counsel with  them. So there were various reasons asserted for the  [[Page S652]]  invalidity and the defects in various subpoenas and then no attempt to  enforce them, no attempt to litigate out what the validity or  invalidity might be but to just bring it here as an obstruction charge  is unprecedented.   I will note that House managers have said--and I am sure that they  will say again today--that, well, but if we had gone to court, the  Trump administration would have said that the courts don't have  jurisdiction over those claims. Now, that is true. In some cases--there  is one being litigated right now related to the former Counsel for the  President, Don McGahn. The Trump administration's position, just like  the position of the Obama administration, is that an effort by the  House to enforce a subpoena in an article III court is a nonjusticiable  controversy. That is our position, and we would argue that in court.   But that is part of what would have to be litigated. That doesn't  change the fact that the House managers can't have it both ways. I want  to make this clear. The House managers want to say that they have an  avenue for going to court; they are using that avenue for going to  court; and they actually told the court in McGahn that once they  reached an impasse with the executive branch, the courts were the only  way to resolve the impasse.   As I explained the other day, there are mechanisms for dealing with  these disputes between the executive and Congress. First is an  accommodations process. They didn't do that. We offered to do that in  the White House Counsel's October 8 letter. They didn't do  accommodations. If they think they can sue, they have to take that step  because the Constitution, the courts have made clear, requires  incrementalism in disputes between the executive and the legislative  branch.   So if they think that the courts can resolve that dispute, that is  the next step. They should do that and have that litigated, and then  things can proceed on to a higher level of confrontation. But to jump  straight to impeachment, to the ultimate constitutional confrontation,  doesn't make sense. It is not the system that the Constitution  requires, and it is unprecedented in this case. Thank you.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, counsel.   The Senator from Michigan.
