 Mr. President, let me start by thanking our  colleague, the Senator from Oregon, Senator Merkley, for his leadership  in working to restore the functioning of the Senate and to protect our  democracy. We need both, and we need them now.   It was just 12 days ago that we marked the 1-year anniversary of the  January 6 attack on this Capitol and on our democracy itself. It was a  violent attempt to stop Congress from certifying the Presidential  election of Joe Biden and to overturn the decision of the American  people. It was inspired and instigated by the former President.   While that assault did not succeed in stopping us from counting the  vote that day, the Big Lie did not die. In fact, the Big Lie has  metastasized. It has spread, and its poison is seeping across the  country. It is now taking  [[Page S240]]  the form of Republican-controlled State legislatures enacting laws that  erect new barriers to the ballot box. Let's be clear. They are erecting  barriers specifically designed to make it harder for people of color  and younger voters to cast their ballots.   As we saw in a Federal Circuit Court case a number of years ago with  respect to North Carolina, the court found that the State legislature  had targeted African-American voters with surgical precision.   Dr. King observed that voting is ``the foundation stone for political  action.'' He also observed that when the right to vote is impeded, a  tragic betrayal of the highest mandates of our democratic tradition are  betrayed.   What we see happening in State legislatures are not just efforts to  put up barriers to the ballot box; they are also passing laws to  authorize partisan operatives to interfere in the counting of the votes  and even to overturn the results after the count. So laws to interfere  with the casting of the votes and laws to interfere with the counting  of the votes--that is what is happening right now. Nineteen  legislatures around the country have already enacted these kinds of  laws.   So, yes, our democracy was under attack right here on January 6 of  last year, but 1 year later, the evidence is clear: The Big Lie is  alive, and our democracy is still under attack. It is under attack by  those seeking to implement the Big Lie in State legislatures. It is  just the venue that has changed.   When we reconvened here after the attacks of January 6, I said on  this floor that what we witnessed is what happens when we don't stand  up together as Democrats and Republicans to confront the Big Lie.   Now, over a year later, we have another chance to stand up together.  To meet this moment and to protect our democracy, we need to take  action here and now. That is what the Freedom to Vote Act does. It  establishes minimum standards to ensure equal access to the ballot box  across the country. It guards against partisan election meddling. It  ends gerrymandering nationwide, and it ends secret money in elections.  It contains the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act to restore  the protections guaranteed in the Voting Rights Act of 1965. That is  what it does.   We are well within our rights as Federal lawmakers to write and pass  these bills. The relevant portion of article I, section 4, clause 1 of  the Constitution--I have that here--clearly states:         The Times, Places and Manner of holding Elections for       Senators and Representatives, shall be prescribed in each       State by the Legislature thereof; but the Congress may at any       time by Law make or alter such Regulations.    The Constitution specifically empowers us to pass these laws to  protect voting. So enough of the specious argument I have heard so many  times here on the Senate floor that these bills somehow represent an  unconstitutional power grab--far from it. The Framers expressly  empowered the Congress to protect Federal elections.   Now, all 50 Members of the Democratic majority, the Democratic  caucus, support these bills to protect our democracy. I am disappointed  that, as of this moment, not one Member of the Senate Republican caucus  plans to join us. In fact, we know that there are 16 Republican  Senators here today who voted in 2006 to reauthorize the Voting Rights  Act. Today, not a single Republican Senator will stand up and support  these bills. That is a very sad and bad sign of this moment in our  history.   I accept that each and every Senator has the right to cast their vote  on bills however they choose. That is the way democracy works. But what  is happening now is very different. Republican Senators are using the  current version of the Senate rules to block a vote on these vital  measures to protect our democracy; to prevent this body from having a  final vote on the Freedom to Vote legislation and the John R. Lewis  Voting Rights Advancement Act.   So let's step back and look at how the current version of the Senate  rules operates in practice, and I say ``current rules'' because the  Senate rules have evolved over time, as our colleague from Oregon has  mentioned. They have taken many twists and turns over the years. In  their current form and practice, they have departed radically from  their original purpose and design.   Today, with some exceptions, 41 out of 100 Senators can block the  other 59 from voting on legislation that is important to the American  people. Over the last year, this Senate rule has been used to block  bills that enact commonsense gun safety provisions and provide for  equal pay for equal work. Many other bills have been blocked from even  getting a vote under the current Senate rules.   So let's unpack this. Let's understand what this means.   Right now, under our rules, it is possible for 41 Senators  representing 21 States and 11 percent of the U.S. population to block  the will of 50 Senators representing 84 percent of the U.S. population.  Think about that. Under our current rules, Senators representing a  small percentage of the population--11 percent--can block the will of  the majority.   How did this happen? Well, it happened because over time--not at the  beginning but over time--Senators decided to empower themselves at the  expense of the American people. It wasn't always this way. As I said,  in its earliest days, the Senate was founded on two principles. The  first was that Senators would have ample opportunity to make their case  to their fellow Senators and to the country. If they had the minority  position on a particular issue, they had a chance to come here to the  floor of the Senate to persuade their colleagues of the merits of their  position and maybe in the process have the whole country turn to their  side of the debate and influence the ultimate result.    So the Senators were given the opportunity for a prolonged debate to  ensure that all opinions were heard and considered before the final  vote. In fact, as my colleague from Oregon mentioned, each Senator was  able to deliver two speeches on a particular question on a single  legislative day. But after all the views were heard, after prolonged  debate was ended, the Senate would move to a majority vote. That is how  the Senate earned its representation as the world's greatest  deliberative body.   Nothing could be further from that truth today. We have very little  debate on the Senate floor today--real debate, where Senators engage on  the big questions of the day. In fact, the minority of Senators who  oppose legislation pending before the Senate can block it without even  coming to the Senate floor to debate. They don't even have to come here  to make their case to their fellow Senators and the American people,  don't even have to show up to debate. We are talking about a Senate  rule that was designed to encourage debate. Yet we have it operating  today where nobody has to even show up on this floor to make their  position known.   It is not that Senators don't even have to show up to debate; they  don't even have to show up for the vote to cut off debate. Under our  current rules, we could have a vote right here in the Senate of 59 to  nothing in favor of moving forward on legislation, and the 41 Senators  who didn't even show up would carry the day. They would block the 59  from expressing the will of the American people. How crazy is that?  That is what the current Senate rules provide.   That is not what the Founders of our Republic envisioned. In fact,  the current version and application of the Senate's rules amount to a  total perversion of the constitutional framework. These rules pervert  the intent of our Framers, and they undermine the democratic  architecture of our Republic.   Our Founders never--never--intended for a minority of Senators--for  41 Senators--to be able to thwart the will of the majority and of the  people.   In Federalist 22, Alexander Hamilton asserted that the fundamental  maxim of republican government was ``the sense of the majority should  prevail.''   Even more clearly right on point was James Madison in Federalist 58,  where he directly warned against requiring more than a majority for a  decision in the legislature, saying that ``the fundamental principle of  free government would be reversed. It would be no longer the majority  that would rule: the power would be transferred to the minority.'' This  is James Madison, a key architect of our Constitution and the framework  of this Republic.  [[Page S241]]    Now, we know it is true that the Framers of our Constitution knew the  dangers of overly powerful majorities, and they wanted to and did guard  against that risk in the Constitution itself. That is why the Framers  diffused power among the people, among the States, and within the  Federal Government--to protect minority viewpoints in the country.   In the Bill of Rights, our Founders clearly said that each American  has certain unalienable rights that no government action can take  away--not by a vote of this Congress, not by an order of the President,  not by anybody in the executive branch. That is the Bill of Rights. Our  Founders also created three coequal branches of government constrained  by a system of checks and balances. It is all right here in the  Constitution. Within the legislative branch, they didn't create one  unitary body, like most Parliaments today; they created two separate  bodies--the Senate and the House of Representatives--and a totally  independent executive branch, with the President directly elected by  the people through the electoral college.   Now, I think it is worth pointing out that the Senate contains built- in protections for the minority by its very structure. The 2 Senators  from Wyoming represent 578,000 of our fellow Americans, and the 2  Senators from California represent 39 million of our fellow Americans.  Two Senators from Wyoming represent 578,000 people, and 2 Senators from  California represent 39 million Americans, but here in the Senate, each  of those Senators, whether from Wyoming or California, has votes of  equal weight. We can do the math, the political math.   People of Wyoming are already exerting influence here in the Senate  way out of proportion to their share of the American population. That  is in the structure. But if you layer the current version of the Senate  filibuster rule on top of the Senate structure and on top of other  protections for minority rights enshrined in our Constitution, you  further nullify the will of the American people. You nullify the will  of the majority of our fellow citizens.   That is why the anti--majoritarian, anti-democratic--small ``d''-- Senate rule is nowhere to be found in the Constitution. You can search  high and low; it is nowhere to be found here. In fact, as I said, our  Founders were very clear about allowing the majority sentiment vote to  prevail in the end. And they were very clear in this document, the  Constitution, exactly when to require a supermajority vote. It is right  here: Two-thirds vote of all Members is required to convict and remove  a President; two-thirds vote is needed to expel a Senator; two-thirds  needed to override a Presidential veto; two-thirds vote to concur on  treaties; two-thirds to amend the Constitution. That is it. That is  what is in the Constitution of the United States.    Our Founders did not envision a Senate where the normal course of  legislative process and business could be permanently blocked by a  minority of Senators. There is nothing in here about needing 60 out of  100 votes to pass legislation like the Freedom to Vote Act. There is  nothing in our Constitution about a Senate where 41 out of 100 Senators  can routinely block the will of the majority and subvert the will of  the American people.   James Madison expressly warned against requiring supermajorities for  legislation--yes for treaties, yes for removal of a President, not for  the normal course of legislation.   So where did the current Senate rule come from? It is a total  invention of Senators that empowers individual Senators by  disempowering the overwhelming majority of the American people. That is  what it is.   Think about this in the context of the Freedom to Vote Act. The duly  elected President of the United States, who won over 80 million votes  and in the electoral college, is in favor of it. A majority of the  House of Representatives representing the majority of the American  people is in favor of it. And 50 U.S. Senators representing 62 percent  of the American people are in favor of it. But the bill is being  blocked by a minority of Senators representing a minority of the  American people.   And think about this. State legislatures around the country, as we  gather here, are passing laws to erect barriers to voting by a majority  vote. The laws they are passing impact every citizen in this country  because they impact the outcome of Federal elections. When State  legislatures in Georgia pass laws to disenfranchise voters in Federal  elections, they are disenfranchising voters in all of the other 49  States who have a stake in the outcome of Federal elections.   But the current version of the Senate rules prevents the U.S. Senate  from casting a majority vote to protect voting for every American, even  though the Constitution expressly empowers us to do that--to regulate  Federal elections.   So, Mr. President, what arguments do proponents of the current  filibuster rule present to justify this self-anointed power to thwart  the majority will of the American people?   One claim is that it promotes bipartisanship. Look, I know the  Presiding Officer. I know the Senator from Virginia who has joined us.  I know the Senator from Oregon. All of us prefer to find common ground  to meet the challenges of the day when we can. I am proud to be the  author of many bipartisan measures and to sponsor many others, and to  vote for many of those measures. But let's not kid ourselves here in  the U.S. Senate about the ability of the 60-vote requirement to promote  bipartisanship. The Senate we are living in today is the most polarized  ever. The claim that this rule promotes bipartisanship flies in the  face of the reality we witness every day.   In fact, the filibuster in its current form has become a partisan  political weapon. Tim Lau of the Brennan Center notes that, while there  have been more than 2,000 filibusters since 1917, about half of them  have been in just the past 12 years. Think about that. There were more  filibusters in President Obama's second term than in all the years  between World War I and the end of the Reagan administration combined.  This abuse has led to partisan gridlock, not bipartisan cooperation.   But let's talk about bipartisanship. I had hoped--we had hoped--that  action to preserve our democracy would be a bipartisan endeavor. But  that isn't where we are today, and that is not new. The battle to  protect constitutional rights has been waged along party lines in the  past. The Fourteenth Amendment, which guaranteed citizenship to former  slaves and guarantees equal protection under the law, was passed by  Republicans in Congress with almost no bipartisan support. We salute  them for that action. The 15th Amendment guarantees the right to vote  to all citizens of the United States, and it was passed by one party  and one party alone. Those actions were taken by the old Republican  Party that used to be the party of Lincoln. Should we have sacrificed  those critical amendments at the altar of bipartisanship? Should we  have said to them: Don't pass them because no Democrats at that time  supported them? Of course not.   We all strive for bipartisanship, but that goal should not stand in  the way of legislative action, especially on issues central to  protecting our democracy.    Another argument often made, including by many of our Democratic  colleagues, in favor of keeping the current version of the Senate rules  and the supermajority requirement, highlights the risk of giving up the  ``protection'' of the filibuster on issues that Democrats hold dear and  where Republicans hold a different position.   If we eliminate the 60-vote threshold to pass policies that  Republicans don't like, won't Republicans be able to use a majority  vote to pass policies that Democrats don't like?   That is true. That is the nature of democracy. That is what elections  are for--every 2 years for Members of the House, every 6 years for the  Senate, and every 4 years for the President. If the American people  don't like a law that we have passed, they get to go to the ballot box  to render a decision. That is the ultimate accountability in the  system, and we should not be erecting artificial rules to protect  ourselves from the majority views of the American people.   In fact, it is simply arrogant--arrogant--to invent a rule that  blocks the will of the American people. It is simply arrogant to say  that we Senators, not we the people, are the guardians of our  democracy, and we are going to come up with this rule that is not in  the Constitution to do that. That is what our current Senate rules do.  [[Page S242]]    Now, there is one major exception to the 60-vote rule to end a  filibuster on legislation. It is called the reconciliation process. I  believe that this major exception exposes the absurdity of the current  Senate rule itself. Most folks watching this debate may be justifiably  confused. They are watching the Senate and they are saying: It was  about a year ago that the Senate passed the American Rescue Plan with a  majority vote. It was a vote of 50 to 49. It was a major piece of  legislation responding to the pandemic emergency. Not a single  Republican Senator voted for it, but it passed. During the Trump  administration, Senate Republicans passed a major tax giveaway to the  rich by a vote of 51 to 48. Not a single Democrat voted for it.   Those laws contained major policy changes, but they could not be  blocked by a vote of a minority of 41 Senators. Why is that? It is  because in 1974, the Senate carved out a major exception to the  supermajority filibuster rule for legislation connected to the annual  budget process. That carve-out--that procedure--allowed for the passage  of the Trump tax law, for the American Rescue Plan, and earlier for the  Affordable Care Act.   So, colleagues, here we are maintaining this carve-out to the  filibuster rule that allows Donald Trump and Senate Republicans to pass  big tax cuts by a majority party-line vote. You can't block it with a  vote of 41. It allows us to pass important things like the American  Rescue Plan, using the same procedure.   But our rules don't allow us to pass rules to protect our democracy.  That is absurd. Anyone paying close attention to the rules would see  how absurd that is in a great democracy, and it needs to change and it  needs to change now.   Each day that we maintain the current undemocratic Senate rules that  allow 41 Senators to block the will of the majority, we allow State  legislatures to continue their assault on democracy and we prevent our  own democracy from working the way it was intended.   The American people sent us here to get things done, to move the  country forward, and the overwhelming majority are crying out for us to  protect the future of our democracy. That is why we must amend the  undemocratic rule that empowers 41 of 100 Senators to disempower the  majority of the people of our country.   And I support the proposal put forward by our colleague from Oregon,  Senator Merkley, that takes us back to the original design and intent  of the first Senate and the Framers--debate. Everyone gets a chance to  make their point. Convince your colleagues and convince the American  people. But as James Madison said, at the end of the day, a great  democracy must have a majority rule subject to the conditions already  applied and set out in our Constitution.   So I urge my colleagues to join us in restoring the Senate to its  original purpose and then to pass the Freedom to Vote Act, including  the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, to protect our  democracy.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
