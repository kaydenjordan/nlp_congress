 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R.  4547, the Strengthening Protections for Social Security Beneficiaries  Act of 2018. This bill is important to two program areas under the  jurisdiction of the Subcommittee on Human Resources, which I chair:  Supplemental Security Income and child welfare.   Thank you to Chairman Johnson and Ranking Member Larson for their  work on this bill and for including Supplemental Security Income  recipients.   All individuals receiving benefits through the Social Security  Administration deserve to be protected, especially those who need the  assistance of a representative payee to manage their finances.                                time  1615    I would specifically like to highlight the important changes this  bill would make for children involved with the foster care system,  another vulnerable population in need of protection.   H.R. 4547 requires the Social Security Administration, or SSA, to  enter into monthly data exchanges with State foster care programs to  identify when a child receiving Social Security benefits has entered or  exited foster care or changed foster care placement.   When a change occurs, SSA will now be required to redetermine the  appropriate representative payee to ensure Social Security benefits  follow the child. Additionally, the Government Accountability Office  will be required to produce a report on minor beneficiaries in foster  care and the representative payees to identify whether additional  changes are needed.   H.R. 4547 also clarifies liability for overpayments when a child is  in foster care. In cases where a Social Security beneficiary or  Supplemental Security Income recipient is overpaid while in foster care  and the State foster care agency is the payee, the beneficiary or  recipient would not be liable for the overpayment. Instead, the State  foster care agency would be required to repay SSA for the overpayment  it received.   Foster youth exiting the system have enough challenges, and paying  back an overpayment they never received should not have to be one of  them.   I am proud to cosponsor this legislation, and I encourage my  colleagues to support its passage.
