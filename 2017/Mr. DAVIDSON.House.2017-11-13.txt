 Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to work with  Mr. Sherman and the rest of the committee on this bill. It is indeed  impressive that it was 59-1 in our committee in its present form. It  does do some really good things, and I think the message that it really  sends is that it is important for our government agency to lead by  example.   The SEC holds people that they oversee accountable for maintaining  cybersecurity and protecting personally identifiable information.   What we know: on September 20, Chairman Clayton highlighted that they  had had a breach of the EDGAR system. This follows on an April 2016  report by the GAO that highlighted some concerns with their  cybersecurity program with SEC. The concerning thing is that when  Chairman Clayton took over the SEC, he found this so much time  afterwards. It wasn't part of his in-briefing. So there is a real  concern that there could be some systemic cybersecurity risks there.   I think it is great that our committee came together to provide SEC a  mandate to get their own house in order in quick fashion, and to do  that with not just their existing products, but with products that are  on the cusp of launching: notably, the consolidated audit trail.                                time  1615    The consolidated audit trail became the subject of some additional  concerns because it is so close to launching.  [[Page H9142]]  What we are trusting here is that Chairman Clayton does the right  thing--takes the message from this vote that we are about to take, and  then begins to work with our committee to get this cybersecurity risk  under control to provide the assurances that the American people want  and that the markets need in order to trust that no more data is  collected and made vulnerable than is necessary to accomplish the  mission, but that whatever data is made available is secure.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of our colleagues to support the passage of  this bill.
