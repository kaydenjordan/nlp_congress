 Madam Speaker, the conventional wisdom that Speaker  Pelosi and the Democrats gained nothing from the delay in sending the  Articles of Impeachment to the Senate is contradicted by the results.  Some Republican Senators are said to be working to assure witnesses, as  Speaker Pelosi demanded.   There are 53 Republican Senators and 47 Democrats. Notwithstanding  where they stand on impeachment itself, it would benefit Republican  moderates and even others to avoid the stigma of unprecedented  unfairness by at least allowing witnesses, which requires only a 51  percent majority. Witnesses would help mitigate Majority Leader Mitch  McConnell's undisguised unfairness in working directly with the White  House.   As a result of the Pelosi delay, even Senator McConnell now says he  will follow the Clinton impeachment process. Depositions from witnesses  were ultimately allowed there.                            ____________________
