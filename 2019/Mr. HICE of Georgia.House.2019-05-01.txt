 Madam Speaker, I thank my good friend, Mrs.  Lesko, for yielding some time.   H.R. 9 is an attempt simply to force the President to reenter an  ineffectual international agreement, one that pushes the United States  to adopt burdensome, painful measures and hold us to a standard that no  other country that is a part of the agreement has bothered to meet  themselves, all to do something that we are already doing, and that is  lowering greenhouse gas emissions.   But H.R. 9 is not the real agenda of our Democratic colleagues. To  understand what the real Democratic Party wants to do, one need look no  further than H. Res. 109, better known as the Green New Deal.   Look, people in my district are not asking where I stand or what I  think about the Paris climate agreement, but they are asking, eagerly,  where I stand on the Green New Deal. Everywhere I go, people are asking  about it.   Last night, on a telephone townhall, several questions were asking  where I stood on this. They are concerned that their Representative  might support a proposal that would drastically increase their energy  bills.   And businesses I talk to want to know whether or not I would support  what amounts to a torrent of heavyhanded regulations.   I assure you, as I did them, that I do not. I strongly oppose the  Green New Deal, but I cannot say the same for my colleagues across the  aisle.   Madam Speaker, 92 Democrats have cosponsored the Green New Deal, and  nearly every Democrat running for President has endorsed it. It seems  clear that this really is the new policy platform for the Democratic  Party.    I know that many of my Democratic colleagues disagree with me. They  believe strongly in the policies of the Green New Deal, and I am sure  some of their constituents would agree as well.   But I am also positive that their constituents, Democratic  constituents, want to know where their Representative stands on this  issue just as much as mine want to know where I stand. So let's have a  vote.   But let's be frank with each other. The Speaker would not allow a  recorded vote. Speaker Pelosi knows very likely that to have a vote on  the Green New Deal could cost the Democrats the majority.   So, look, here is the deal. We Republicans are more than happy to go  on record with our opposition to the Green New Deal, and we are more  than happy to help our Democratic colleagues go on record with their  support for the Green New Deal. So help us defeat the previous  question.   As my friend, Mrs. Lesko, has said, if we defeat the previous  question, then we will amend the rule and enable a vote on the Green  New Deal, and I hope to have support in that regard.   But I understand it may be difficult for some of my colleagues across  the aisle to do so, and if they are unable to help support us on this  previous question, then I have another opportunity.                                time  1330    If we do not defeat the previous question immediately following this  vote series, I am going to file a discharge petition to ensure a vote  on the Green New Deal. I encourage all Members here to vote against the  previous question, vote against the rule, and sign the discharge  petition. Let's have a vote on the Green New Deal.   Again, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding this time.
