 Mr. Speaker, due to severe illness, I missed  today's vote series. Had I been present, I would have voted ``yea'' on  rollcall No. 676, ``yea'' on rollcall No. 677, ``yea'' on rollcall No.  678, ``yea'' on rollcall No. 679, and ``yea'' on rollcall No. 680.                            ____________________
