 Madam Speaker, last week, on November  11, we celebrated Veterans Day. I rise today to thank our great men and  women who answered the call to serve our country.   Our Nation recognizes the generations of brave men and women who have  defended our freedoms and protected our great country from threats  across the globe.   We owe the valiant men and women of the Army, Navy, Air Force,  Marines, Coast Guard, National Guard, and Reserves our unwavering  support and gratitude.   In Congress, we must work to ensure veterans receive the care and  support they so deserve, even after they transition from uniform to  civilian lives. I am proud to support legislation in Congress focused  on mental health and telehealth, spouses and families, and  accountability from the VA.   Madam Speaker, our veterans and their families have given so much for  this country and ask so little in return. I offer my sincere gratitude  one last time to the men and women who have selflessly served our  country in the United States military.   God bless our military and God bless the United States of America.  [[Page H6260]]                                ____________________
