 Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to honor the selfless bravery  and service of a member of my community in New York's 22nd  Congressional District, Timothy Chadwick, Sr.   Mr. Chadwick served our country in the Air Force during the Vietnam  war. Timothy's story is shared by so many Vietnam veterans across our  country. While serving in Laos, Timothy was exposed to Agent Orange,  which has plagued his health ever since.   Many U.S. servicemembers who were stationed in Vietnam were exposed  to the toxic herbicide known as Agent Orange. As a result, our veterans  are at an increased risk of developing cancer, Parkinson's disease,  non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and many other deadly illnesses.   These brave veterans risked everything to defend our freedom, and  they deserve our support as they overcome the effects of their service.  I will never stop standing up and fighting for veterans like they stood  up and fought for us.   God bless men like Timothy Chadwick and so many others who served our  Nation honorably, and God bless all the men and women currently serving  in the U.S. Armed Forces.                            ____________________
