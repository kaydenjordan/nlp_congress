 Mr. Speaker, last week on November 11,  we celebrated Veterans Day, and I rise today to thank each and every  one of the men and women who have donned the uniform of the United  States military; to express my gratitude for the individuals who have  served to secure and protect our most precious freedoms; to acknowledge  the sacrifices that these brave Americans have endured to make America  the country that it is today.   In the Pentagon, in the stairwell to the office of the Secretary of  Defense, there is a painting of a soldier in gear ready for deployment  surrounded by family at the altar of a church.   Accompanying that painting is a verse of scripture from the Holy  Scripture from the Book of Isaiah. And it reads: ``Who shall I send?  Who will go for me?'' In the painting, that is from the Gospel and the  word of God. That painting communicates that our Nation's veterans have  answered that call.   Recently, I was approached about cosponsoring H.R. 2350, the Ghost  Army Congressional Gold Medal Act. A 16-year-old young lady named  Madeline reached out to my office to share the story of her great  grandfather's service.   Her great grandfather served in the Ghost Army during World War II.  The Ghost Army was a tactical deception unit that sought to undermine  the Axis Power efforts in Germany during the war.   Madeline shared with me that there are two gentlemen from my district  who served in the Ghost Army, Tom Ebeling from Bradford and Claude  Blake from Patton.   There are many fascinating stories from the Ghost Army that were kept  secret for decades after the war. It wasn't until 1996 that this  information was declassified, and their bravery could be shared with us  all.   I would also like to mention that Veterans Day took place during  National Apprenticeship Week, and this is a great opportunity to remind  everyone what incredible value veterans add to our workforce.   Veterans exhibit proven leadership, higher retention rates, have the  ability to work well under pressure, and they have a strong work ethic.   Our veterans are highly trained and highly skilled. They deserve our  support while deployed and when they return home. One of the best ways  to do  [[Page H5801]]  that is to prepare them for the workforce outside of the military.   I am a proud original cosponsor of the Veterans in Effective  Apprenticeships Act, which instructs apprenticeship programs to account  for a participant's competencies and prior experiences, including those  gained during military service, among other things.   Mr. Speaker, the best way to thank a veteran is to hire a veteran.  The skills obtained during service are invaluable.   In closing, I would like to offer my sincerest gratitude one last  time to the men and women who have selflessly served our country in the  United States military. They have put their lives on the line for us,  and we are forever indebted to them for this sacrifice.                            ____________________
