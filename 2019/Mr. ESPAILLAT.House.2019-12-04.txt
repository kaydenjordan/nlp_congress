 Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the subject of my Special Order in the  Record.    Madam Speaker, as the whip of the Congressional  Hispanic Caucus, I am pleased to lead this monthly Special Order hour.  This afternoon's topic comes at a critical time for our Nation and for  the communities we represent who are all concerned with the state of  healthcare and harmful actions of the Trump administration.   There is no more personal an issue than one's health, and as such,  this should be top on the minds of Members of Congress.   It was the late Martin Luther King, Jr. who said in 1966 that of all  the forms of inequality, injustice in healthcare is perhaps the most  shocking and inhumane.   Healthcare is a priority of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, and we  want to use today's opportunity to discuss the state of Latino health  in the United States of America. The Affordable Care Act was landmark  legislation that extended healthcare coverage to more than 20 million  Americans either through Medicaid expansion or tax credits to purchase  quality and comprehensive healthcare insurance products.   In the Latino community, at least 4 million Latino adults and 600,000  Latino children have gained health insurance coverage thanks to the  ACA. And we cannot forget that the ACA extended health insurance  coverage for children through age 26. Especially for children and young  adolescents, the uninsured rate for Latino children has decreased  considerably, from 11.5 percent to around 7.5 percent.   The gains in health insurance coverage for these children and  preventive healthcare and reduction in the severity of chronic  conditions is a testament to the good and constructive health policy  that Democrats are committed to. However, the Trump administration has  sought to undermine the ACA and the benefits it brings to the Latino  community.   Earlier this year in a bipartisan vote, the U.S. House of  Representatives felt compelled to rebuke the Trump administration for  its promotion of the skinny junk plans that offer no guarantee of  essential health benefits. That is no guarantee for mental health  treatment; no guarantee for preventive healthcare, which lowers the  overall cost of healthcare; and no guarantee for prescription drug  coverage.   According to the data collected from the Kaiser Family Foundation,  from 2013 to 2017, people of color had higher uninsured rates than non- Hispanic Whites prior to 2014. And it was only after the Affordable  Care Act came into effect that Latinos had larger gains in health  insurance coverage from 2013 to 2016 than non-Hispanic Whites. But our  work is not done. It is truly not done.   Every day we are working to curb the destructive actions of this  administration to harm the gains that we have made in the healthcare  arena and well-being of the Latino community overall, and we continue  working to close the health equity gaps that the ACA did not address.   According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Latino  Americans are twice as likely to have type 2 diabetes than White  Americans. In the United States, adults over their lifetime have a 40  percent chance of developing type 2 diabetes, but the Latino adult has  a rate of 50 percent higher. Given that, coverage of and the overall  cost of insulin--a necessary treatment for managing diabetes--is a  priority for the Congressional Hispanic Caucus.    Since the start of this 116th Congress, the Congressional Hispanic  Caucus has invited the CEOs of insulin manufacturers and pharmacy  benefit managers to meet with us and explain how and why insulin  remains unaffordable for so many Americans. We met with the largest  pharmacy benefit managers in this country who collectively comprise 78  percent of the market and cover 180 million individuals with health  insurance: CVS Health, Express Scripts, and OptumRx of UnitedHealth  Group. In our discussions we were, quite frankly, met with much  resistance by all parties in the prescription drug supply chain and  pharmacy benefits business.   It is infuriating for patients at the local pharmacy counter; and  trust me, it is infuriating to me and my colleagues in the  Congressional Hispanic Caucus.   In addition to benefits managers, the CHC met with the CEOs of the  top three insulin manufacturers who produce 90 percent of the global  insulin supply and 100 percent of the supply for diabetic patients in  the United States of America. They are Sanofi, Novo Nordisk, and Eli  Lilly and Company.   It may seem impossible, but Dr. Frederick Banting who discovered and  cultivated insulin as a treatment for diabetes, sold the patent for his  remarkable drug for only $1 to the University of Toronto.   Madam Speaker, he sold this important patent that has saved the lives  of millions of people just for $1 to the University of Toronto, yet the  price of insulin both with insurance and without it has risen  astronomically to the point where diabetic patients must make the  decision between purchasing lifesaving insulin versus paying their  rent, finding childcare for their families, or getting an education.   We asked them why this is, and, in short, they simply did not have a  good answer.   So we are concerned, Madam Speaker, that the patent for insulin which  was sold by Dr. Frederick Banting to the University of Toronto for $1  has now been placed in a position that is inaccessible to patients  across America who will subsequently die without having that treatment.   But we are committed to shedding a light on this obscured process and  making sure that patients receive the therapies they need at the price  they can afford. This is our promise. This is our commitment.   We, as the Congressional Hispanic Caucus and greater Democratic  Caucus, are committed to fighting for healthcare that lies in stark  contrast to this White House administration. That is why we have passed  legislation to strengthen the ACA, not to weaken it, not to obliterate  it, but to strengthen it, and it is why we will consider landmark  legislation later this month to help lower the cost of prescription  drugs.   Now, before I conclude, Madam Speaker, I want to lay out some  important events taking place as we speak, because they will have an  unimaginably detrimental impact on the state of health in the Latino  community.   The Trump Department of Justice and Attorney General William Barr  abandoned their obligation to defend our current healthcare system and  the Affordable Care Act. The State of Texas is seeking to invalidate  the ACA and unravel the law that has benefited constituents across  America represented in this, the House of Representatives of the U.S.  Congress, and this Department of Justice is willing to let this happen  undeterred.   This administration told the Texas district court that it was opting  to not defend existing regulations such as protections for preexisting  conditions. Imagine that, Madam Speaker, not protecting preexisting  conditions, meaning that those who suffer from diabetes and those who  suffer from hypertension and cardiovascular problems who have  preexisting conditions will not be protected and will be out in the  cold.   This administration is turning its back on over 130 million  Americans, including 17 million children and adolescents with  preexisting conditions. With no plan or idea of what to do going  forward, they are willing to harm the lives of millions of Americans.  This is purely irresponsible, and it is reprehensible.   Neither the Congressional Hispanic Caucus nor Democrats will allow  this to happen unchecked. We will continue to work hard to make sure  healthcare continues to be made more affordable and more equally  accessible for all  [[Page H9249]]  Americans, especially people whom we represent.   Madam Speaker, I am so grateful for this opportunity. I will now  conclude, Madam Speaker. I would like to thank my colleagues who could  not be here today or are here today.   And I would like to reiterate that we will defend the Affordable Care  Act and make sure that Latinos across America are not further harmed by  this administration or partisan politics.   We are committed to lowering the cost of prescription drugs and  making sure that insulin remains available and affordable to all  communities across America and particularly communities of color that  are disproportionately affected by diabetes. And we will raise hell  every time that we find another instance of capricious price inflation  or market consolidation or an obvious attempt to shift the blame.   With that, Madam Speaker, the Congressional Hispanic Caucus will not  cease in our advocacy for the healthcare and the well-being of our  communities that we represent here in the Congress and across our  country.   This is a crucial time in America where the Affordable Care Act, as  presented by the past administration, not only provided access to  healthcare for people with preexisting conditions and not only did it  allow our children up to the age of 26 to be part of our health plan,  but it also provided funding for Medicaid and Medicare. It also  provided funding for mental health services, an arena that has, for far  too long, been left aside with not having the appropriate funding that  it needs, and for people suffering from opioid addiction.                                time  1445    These are the services that were provided by the ACA. This  administration has moved forward to dismantle it and to put people's  lives in jeopardy.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
