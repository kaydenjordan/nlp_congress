 Mr. Speaker, we may be relieved that an impulsive act  by President Trump has not immediately led to war with Iran, we may be  relieved that an evil man is dead, but as that evil man wished, our  troops have now been asked to leave Iraq, and if they stay, their  ability to work with Iraqis to fight ISIS has been shot.   As he wished, the protest movement in Iran and Iraq that threatened  the Iranian regime has been silenced.   As he wished, Iran is now breaking free of all restrictions on its  nuclear program.   We are not safer today.   In this moment of danger, there is just one question that this  resolution asks. It is not do you support what the President has  already done, but should Congress play our constitutional role in  deciding what happens next.   I support this resolution because passing it will protect us against  going to war with a tweet, but it also ensures that, if we do go to  war, which we may have to at some point, we will do so with the  American people united, not divided, as the Framers intended, as our  national interest demands.
