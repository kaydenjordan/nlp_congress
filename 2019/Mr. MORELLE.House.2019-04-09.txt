 Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I  call up House Resolution 294 and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 294         Resolved, That at any time after adoption of this       resolution the Speaker may, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule       XVIII, declare the House resolved into the Committee of the       Whole House on the state of the Union for consideration of       the bill (H.R. 1644) to restore the open internet order of       the Federal Communications Commission. The first reading of       the bill shall be dispensed with. All points of order against       consideration of the bill are waived. General debate shall be       confined to the bill and shall not exceed one hour equally       divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority       member of the Committee on Energy and Commerce. After general       debate the bill shall be considered for amendment under the       five-minute rule. In lieu of the amendment in the nature of a       substitute recommended by the Committee on Energy and       Commerce now printed in the bill, it shall be in order to       consider as an original bill for the purpose of amendment       under the five-minute rule an amendment in the nature of a       substitute consisting of the text of Rules Committee Print       116-10. That amendment in the nature of a substitute shall be       considered as read. All points of order against that       amendment in the nature of a substitute are waived. No       amendment to that amendment in the nature of a substitute       shall be in order except those printed in part A of the       report of the Committee on Rules accompanying this       resolution. Each such amendment may be offered only in the       order printed in the report, may be offered only by a Member       designated in the report, shall be considered as read, shall       be debatable for the time specified in the report equally       divided and controlled by the proponent and an opponent,       shall not be subject to amendment, and shall not be subject       to a demand for division of the question in the House or in       the Committee of the Whole. All points of order against such       amendments are waived. At the conclusion of consideration of       the bill for amendment the Committee shall rise and report       the bill to the House with such amendments as may have been       adopted. Any Member may demand a separate vote in the House       on any amendment adopted in the Committee of the Whole to the       bill or to the amendment in the nature of a substitute made       in order as original text. The previous question shall be       considered as ordered on the bill and amendments thereto to       final passage without intervening motion except one motion to       recommit with or without instructions.        Sec. 2.  At any time after adoption of this resolution the       Speaker may, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare       the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on       the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R.       2021) to amend the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit       Control Act of 1985 and to establish a congressional budget       for fiscal year 2020. The first reading of the bill shall be       dispensed with. All points of order against consideration of       the bill are waived. General debate shall be confined to the       bill and shall not exceed one hour equally divided and       controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the       Committee on the Budget. After general debate the bill shall       be considered for amendment under the five-minute rule.

Any Member may demand a separate vote in the House       on any amendment adopted in the Committee of the Whole to the       bill or to the amendment in the nature of a substitute made       in order as original text. The previous question shall be       considered as ordered on the bill and amendments thereto to       final passage without intervening motion except one motion to       recommit with or without instructions.        Sec. 3.  House Resolution 293 is hereby adopted.        Sec. 4.  On any legislative day during the period from       April 11, 2019, through April 26, 2019--         (a) the Journal of the proceedings of the previous day       shall be considered as approved; and        (b) the Chair may at any time declare the House adjourned       to meet at a date and time, within the limits of clause 4,       section 5, article I of the Constitution, to be announced by       the Chair in declaring the adjournment.        Sec. 5.  The Speaker may appoint Members to perform the       duties of the Chair for the duration of the period addressed       by section 4 of this resolution as though under clause 8(a)       of rule I.        Sec. 6.  Each day during the period addressed by section 4       of this resolution shall not constitute a calendar day for       purposes of section 7 of the War Powers Resolution (50 U.S.C.       1546).        Sec. 7.  Each day during the period addressed by section 4       of this resolution shall not constitute a legislative day for       purposes of clause 7 of rule XIII.     Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the  customary 30 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from Georgia (Mr.  Woodall), my friend, pending which I yield myself such time as I may  consume. During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is  for the purpose of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members be  given 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Mr. Speaker, on Monday, the Rules Committee met and  reported a rule, House Resolution 294, providing for consideration of  H.R. 2021, the Investing for the People Act, under a structured rule.  The rule provides 1 hour of debate equally divided and controlled by  the chair and ranking member of the Committee on the Budget. The rule  makes in order three amendments, each debatable for 10 minutes.   The rule also provides for consideration of H.R. 1644, the Save the  Internet Act. The rule provides 1 hour of debate equally divided and  controlled by the chair and ranking member of the Committee on Energy  and Commerce. The rule makes in order 12 amendments, each debatable for  10 minutes.   Additionally, the rule deems as passed House Resolution 293, which  will immediately put in place an enforceable top-line discretionary  spending level so that the Appropriations Committee can begin its work.   Finally, the rule provides standard recess instructions through April  26.   Mr. Speaker, the Investing for the People Act is a 2-year budget bill  that will raise the defense sequestration caps for defense and  nondefense discretionary spending for fiscal year 2020 and 2021.   I believe my colleagues from both sides of the aisle fully understand  the devastating effects of sequestration. Across-the-board, mandatory  cuts to every Federal program are not a successful path to fiscal  responsibility.   Without taking action to lift the caps established by the Budget  Control Act, nondefense discretionary funding will be cut by $54  billion. Such drastic cuts threaten public health, the environment,  access to education, job training, and lifesaving social services like  food and housing assistance.   Cuts to nondefense discretionary funding would also impact our  national security. Nearly one-third of investments in this area fund  veterans' programs, homeland security initiatives, diplomatic  operations, foreign aid, and Justice Department activities.   If an agreement on lifting the cap is not reached, defense programs  also stand to lose $71 billion. In a dangerous world, those cuts would  be, in my view, harmful to national and global security.  [[Page H3142]]    Only a few months ago, the American people felt the harsh effects of  a government shutdown. It is time to come together to take decisive  action to avoid another blow to essential Federal programs that help  hardworking Americans in every State. This legislation ensures working  families will be able to rely on continued Federal funding for the  programs that keep them safe, support their jobs, and invest in their  children.   In fiscal year 2020, defense spending would be capped at $664  billion, with nondefense discretionary spending capped at $631 billion.   The Investing for the People Act would also provide up to $8 billion,  annually, for nondefense overseas contingency operations, OCO,  activities that do not count against the spending caps, while limiting  OCO designation of defense spending in 2020 and 2021 to no more than  the fiscal year 2019 level of $69 billion dollars.   In his budget, President Trump proposed continued spending on defense  measures but massive cuts to domestic programs like public health  research, infrastructure investment, and support for low-income  families.   Even as our Nation draws down from our overseas war operations,  domestic spending remains at a historic low as a percentage of our  economy. H.R. 2021 provides a pathway for improving the lives of  Americans in every community and renews our commitment to spending to  meet the needs of our communities and invest in our economy.   In addition to protecting Americans from spending cuts, the House  will be considering protections for a product all of us here today rely  upon to do our jobs and live our lives, just like millions of  Americans: the internet. This rule also provides for consideration of  essential protections for American consumers who use the internet.   The Save the Internet Act would reinstate the Open Internet Order of  2015 that classifies broadband internet services as common carriers  that are prohibited from preferentially treating or discriminating  against groups of persons.    An overwhelming 86 percent of Americans opposed the FCC's rollback of  net neutrality protections. All this legislation does, Mr. Speaker, is  restore those protections.   Fair and reliable internet access is absolutely essential to millions  of working families and small business owners. Practices like blocking,  throttling, and paid prioritization harm the ability of every American  to experience the internet in the same way, regardless of provider or  how much money you pay.   The Save the Internet Act includes enhanced transparency protections  and enacts specific rules against throttling, blocking, and other  violations of net neutrality. The FCC would be empowered to investigate  consumer and business complaints and impose necessary fines against  internet service providers for violations of the Communications Act.   The bill also provides pathways to internet access for every  American, especially those in rural communities who are being left  behind by modern, high-speed internet infrastructure.   The Save the Internet Act would once again allow the FCC to fund  rural broadband through the Connect America Fund.   Additionally, this legislation revives the Lifeline program, created  under the Reagan administration to subsidize phone service for low- income families. Under this legislation, the FCC would again have  authorization to use the Lifeline program to expand access to broadband  for low-income Americans, especially seniors, students, veterans, and  disabled Americans.   In response to concerns raised by our Republican colleagues, the Save  the Internet Act also ensures that the FCC has the power to protect  access to the internet but does not have authority to make decisions  over internet content or the power to impose taxes and fees for  internet access.   This legislation forbears the FCC from applying more than 700  regulations under the Communications Act that are unnecessary to  protecting an open internet, such as rate setting.                                time  1230    Internet service providers have long claimed that they were hamstrung  by net neutrality protections and that strong consumer protections were  preventing them from investing in higher speeds and advanced broadband  infrastructure.   In reality, ISPs actually increased speeds and invested huge amounts  in improving their broadband during the time when net neutrality  protections were enforced by the FCC. Moreover, many of the largest  providers have failed to keep their promise of increased investing  after the Trump FCC repealed those protections, with investments  actually shrinking in recent years.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote for this rule and for both  pieces of legislation underlying it, and I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, let me just make a few brief comments, and I always  appreciate the passion that Mr. Woodall, my distinguished friend and  colleague, brings to this discussion.   I do want to say what this is. First of all, the rule before the  House has both a resolution, which I talked about, which is really the  safety net, it establishes the $1.295 trillion for discretionary  spending and, in addition, allows us to do IRS enforcement--$400  million is in the resolution--and the census 2020, which is upcoming  and which will take thousands and thousands of people to conduct the  census in the way that the Framers identified it to be.   It also has a budget bill. And I do want to just mention just a few  points that relate to what Mr. Woodall said.   The major components of the budget are in the budget bill. It  provides a top line for discretionary spending, provides allocations to  the authorizing committees, provides a revenue floor, enforces all  these 302 allocations, and sets new caps for discretionary spending,  gives allocations to authorizing committees, all of these things which  will match the CBO's baseline, I might add, and enforcement through  regular Budget Act points of order.   So this does have a budget bill. What we do with the resolution,  however, is critically important because it makes sure that we begin  this process.   I think the thing that we all want to avoid in the greatest possible  way is a shutdown. We saw that happen, and 2018 made history.   Although the House, the Senate, and the White House were all  controlled by the same party, we ended Congress for the first time in  U.S. history in a government shutdown, an inglorious end to the 115th  Congress.   We need to do anything we can. This starts that process, creates a  safety net, and jump-starts the budget process. So this is a completely  appropriate and, in my view, mandatory way to start this process. And I  will perhaps, if I get a moment or two, talk about the budget that the  President submitted to us.   I also want to just mention for a moment, if I can, the comments  raised by my colleague relative to the net neutrality bill. This, under  the current rule, has enormous exposure to consumers and businesses. It  does not impede innovation, what we are attempting to do. In fact, in  my view, it will spur innovation, and it provides predictably for all  users, consumers and businesses alike.   I do note that the rule that we reported out last night ensures that  we do everything we can to reaffirm that commitment to fair access.   The rule made in order 12 amendments, both from Democrats and  Republicans. It is a structured rule. Some of those amendments I agree  with, some of those I disagree with, but every single one is worthy of  debate on the floor. I am very proud, and I want to also congratulate  the chair of our committee, Mr. McGovern, for making sure that we have  amendments from both sides to discuss on this floor.   I do want to just mention a couple of them. Several amendments aim to  strengthen access to broadband internet in rural and underserved  communities. Mr. Brindisi, for instance, has an amendment which we will  take up which requires the GAO to produce a report about the ways the  U.S. government can promote the deployment of broadband to rural  communities.    Representative Wexton has an amendment requiring the FCC to submit to  Congress a plan on how the Commission would address problems in  collecting data on deployment of broadband. By fixing these problems,  we can have a better understanding of those communities that are served  by broadband and ensure every community has access.   We have an amendment by Representative Waters asking the Comptroller  General to submit a report on how net neutrality helps ethnic and  racial minorities and how those rules will help disadvantaged groups,  rural populations, individuals with disabilities, and the elderly.  Without that full information, we cannot ensure that everyone is  receiving the same treatment.   We have an amendment from Representative Davids directing GAO to  [[Page H3144]]  submit a report examining the FCC's efforts to assess competition.  Colleagues are worried about how net neutrality rules will impact  competition, but they have no data to back up their claims, so let's  collect the data we need. Good policy is always backed by good  evidence.   We also made in order an amendment by Representative McAdams which  would affirm that ISPs can still block unlawful content, such as child  pornography. Some content has no place on the internet, nor anywhere in  our homes, and we want to make sure that ISPs block this, as they  should, and that nothing in the bill will prevent them from doing so.   There are several other amendments made by Democrats that will be on  the floor. I won't go into them any further. But I do want to  acknowledge, also, that we have amendments in order submitted by  Republican colleagues as well.   Mr. Latta submitted an amendment requiring the FCC to share the list  of 700 rules that will be permanently forborne once this bill becomes  law, which makes sense to me. We had this conversation in rules  yesterday, to ask the question what those 700 rules are. The FCC has  determined them to be unnecessary and burdensome.   Let's look at them and see what they are. Let's see the list. Let's  show the American people that the government was not regulating for the  sake of regulating and that, when those regulations are no longer  appropriate, we will remove them.   Finally, my colleagues on the Rules Committee made Representative  Burgess' amendment in order. It directs the GAO to initiate a study to  examine the virtuous cycle of the internet ecosystem and the effect of  net neutrality on that ecosystem--again, an amendment which was made in  order to make sure that we have bipartisan discussion here on the  floor.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I appreciate my good friend, the gentleman from Oklahoma's comments.   Those on the other side may say this is messy, but do you know what  is messier? Another government shutdown.   We just endured, earlier this year, a 35-day government shutdown, the  longest shutdown in our history. In this committee, we are committed to  doing everything in our power to prevent that from happening again.   We want to make sure we can move forward with appropriations  legislation, and this provision is a safety net to assure that process  can begin. Whenever a budget bill comes up, whenever we begin that  appropriations process, we will have a path forward.   My good friend raised the question of the President. I have to admit  I am new here, haven't been here very long. I have been involved in the  budget process in the State of New York for many years.   Frankly, watching the budget and looking at the budget submitted by  the President, I would be embarrassed. I think it is no wonder that my  friends on the other side of the aisle didn't submit, as an amendment,  the President's budget.   The President's budget is devastating. I look to how it would  devastate the people in my home State of New York: repeals the  Affordable Care Act, eliminates health insurance for 2.2 million New  Yorkers, abolishes protections for people with preexisting conditions,  substantially increases premiums for older Americans.   If the budget that Donald Trump submitted became law, a 60-year-old  living in New York making $25,000 a year could see their healthcare  premiums increase by up to $5,000 annually, from $1,600 to $6,300 in  2020, a quarter of their income.   It cuts funding for New York's Medicaid program by $159 billion over  the next 10 years. Nationally, the Trump budget proposes to cut  Medicaid by $1.5 trillion over the next 10 years, 36 percent in 2029  alone.   College would be more expensive for 179,000 New Yorkers by completely  eliminating the Direct Subsidized Loan Program and taking away grants  for 108,000 students by abolishing the Supplemental Education  Opportunity Grant program. At a time when people need to have knowledge  more than at any other time in human history to safeguard their  economic future and those of their families, to cut college programs is  reprehensible.   But I don't care just about New Yorkers, Mr. Speaker. My friend from  Georgia, I have a brother who lives in Georgia. His children live in  Georgia. I care a great deal about the people in Georgia as well.   The Trump budget:   Eliminates after-school programs for 41,000 Georgia students by  zeroing out the 21st Century Community Learning Centers program;    Takes away high-quality childcare and early education for 4,200 low- income Georgia children by cutting Head  [[Page H3145]]  Start by 17 percent in the final year of this budget;   Eliminates nutrition assistance for up to 395,000 Georgians, 90  percent of whom live in households with at least one child, elderly  person, or a person with a disability, by cutting the Supplemental  Nutrition Assistance Program by $220 billion, nationally, over 10  years;   Takes the food out of the mouths of 4,000 pregnant women, new moms,  babies, and toddlers in Georgia by cutting the Women, Infants and  Children program by 13 percent in the final year of this budget.   I could go on and on, Mr. Speaker, but I will spare my colleagues a  long dissertation on the Trump budget, other than recognize that this  House is moving forward. We are beginning this process. We have  established a safety net.   This is what Americans want. They don't want another shutdown. And we  are going to do everything in our power--together, I hope, in a  bipartisan way--to make sure that we continue to move forward in the  years to come.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I do note for my friend, Mr. Burgess, whom I serve on the Rules  Committee with, that we, in an effort to enhance bipartisanship, made  his amendment in order. I believe it is the first amendment in order,  and I certainly expect that it will get broad consideration on both  sides of the aisle.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from over 120  businesses and startups urging Congress to support net neutrality. This  letter says: ``Passing H.R. 1644 will provide certainty for businesses  and startups and would ensure critical consumer protections for all  internet users.''       Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Speaker, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Kevin McCarthy,      Republican Leader, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Pelosi and Leader McCarthy: We are writing in       support of H.R. 1644, the Save the Internet Act, to fully       restore the strong net neutrality protections for Internet       users that were adopted through the FCC's 2015 Open Internet       Order but later repealed.        Net neutrality is fundamental to guaranteeing that every       American has unencumbered access to the Internet. This access       is also essential to a competitive, free market for the       technology economy to thrive as well as entrepreneurship in       this country. The benefits of these protections are not       confined to technology companies and startups. Main Street       businesses across numerous sectors increasingly rely on       unfettered Internet access to run their operations and to       reach customers.        Net neutrality has been critical to the Internet's       explosive growth, creating an open platform on which       companies large and small can grow. We urge members of       Congress to stand on the side of consumers and Internet users       to quickly pass a clean, unamended version of H.R. 1644. This       bill would restore strong rules prohibiting blocking,       throttling, and paid-prioritization while reinstating ex-ante       enforcement and oversight by the FCC to prevent net       neutrality-related harms from happening in the first place.        Passing H.R. 1644 will provide certainty for businesses and       startups and would ensure critical consumer protections for       all Internet users.

Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I might  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the sentiments of the gentleman. We  certainly agree.   The House has passed disaster relief. We await Senate conferees, so  we can move that process forward. But what strikes me is how troubling  it is to have this conversation.   The reality is that the President of the United States has chosen  which Americans to provide aid to. The island of Puerto Rico, American  citizens, has suffered disasters, calamities, as a result of Hurricane  Maria, yet the President shows no indication that he understands the  plight of the people on Puerto Rico. That is why it is necessary for  the House and Senate to come together to provide relief, because the  President, frankly, has chosen not to do it.   We welcome the comments by the gentleman. We look forward to the  Senate establishing members of a conference committee, so we can work  out differences that we may have and move this forward. We continue to  hope for that day and hope that the President will gain some  enlightenment about how we help and protect all American citizens.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I would just reiterate what I said earlier, which is  that all Americans need help in times of disaster.   Despite the fact that some would try to ignore the fact that climate  change exists and has created natural disasters that we could not have  predicted years ago, the fact is that those disasters continue to  happen.   All Americans--I don't care whether you live in New York or Alabama,  Florida, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands--all Americans need help.   One of the first bills we passed under a structured rule in this  Congress was to provide that relief, yet it sits in the Senate because  they seek to choose which Americans get benefited by the Federal  Government's relief efforts and which do not.   We are going to stand firmly in the corner of all Americans getting  the support from the Federal Government that they deserve. We are not  going to pick and choose.   Mr. Speaker, I certainly hope that my colleagues here across the  aisle are going to march across to the other Chamber and insist to the  United States Senate that it takes up that bill, that we establish a  conference committee, and that we send this to the White House.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I always appreciate the passion that Mr. Woodall brings  to conversations, both here on the floor as well as in the two  committees on which we are privileged to serve. I thank him for that  and thank him for his concerns about how we move forward.   I believe this is moving forward. Today, we are moving forward. We  set the tone of how we move forward. We establish our discretionary  amount. We end the sequestration caps. We begin to move forward, and I  think that is what we want to do.   It is fascinating. I note that Mr. Woodall, in his comments,  mentioned you can't get all 435 Members to agree. I certainly  understand that, and I appreciate it. We couldn't get one Member to  offer the President's budget as an amendment.   The truth is that there is a failure of leadership here. This is a  process that is new to me, but I certainly expected that the President  would provide greater leadership on how to move forward. We have seen  none from the White House, which I find troubling and I find puts us at  a considerable disadvantage.   We need to move forward, nonetheless, Mr. Speaker, and that is what  we are doing today.   I do know that, for me, the amount of discretionary investments we  make will say a great deal about where we are going as a country and  what our priorities are.   I think we need to make greater investments in education and in  public health, highways and transit, veterans healthcare, agricultural  research, workplace safety, K-12 education support, national parks,  housing assistance and mortgage insurance, small business assistance,  Head Start, food safety, scientific research and space exploration--God  knows, as a percentage of GDP, we need to continue to invest  dramatically in those--embassy security, Pell grants for higher  education students, hazardous waste cleanup, waterway maintenance for  commerce and recreation, weather forecasting, hurricane-proofing  communities, forest and wildlife habitat management, conservation  resources, patents and trademarks, consumer protections, and aviation  safety.   The list goes on and on for the kind of investments we need to make  to continue to make sure that America leads in the 21st century. That  is what this does today. That is what this rule will do. That is what  the resolution budget process starts today.   Mr. Speaker, I thank all my colleagues for their words of support for  H.R. 2021, the Investing for the People Act. I especially thank  Chairman Yarmuth and Ranking Member Womack for their work on our  Nation's budget.   I also thank Chairman Pallone and Ranking Member Walden and all those  who have worked on H.R. 1644, the Save the Internet Act.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on the rule, and I urge a ``yes''  vote on the previous question.   The material previously referred to by Mr. Woodall is as follows:         At the end of the resolution, add the following:        Sec. 8. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the       Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare       the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on       the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R.       2145) to provide disaster relief. The first reading of the       bill shall be dispensed with. All points of order against       consideration of the bill are waived. General debate shall be       confined to the bill and shall not exceed one hour equally       divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority       member of the Committee on Ways and Means. After general       debate the bill shall be considered for amendment under the       five-minute rule. All points of order against provisions in       the bill are waived. No amendment shall be in order except       the amendments specified in section 9 of this resolution.       Each such amendment may be offered only in the order       specified, may be offered only by the Member designated,       shall be considered as read, and shall be debatable for 10       minutes equally divided and controlled by the proponent and       an opponent. All points of order against such amendments are       waived. After the conclusion of consideration of the bill for       amendment, the Committee shall rise and  [[Page H3148]]       report the bill to the House with such amendments as may have       been adopted. The previous question shall be considered as       ordered on the bill and amendments thereto to final passage       without intervening motion except one motion to recommit with       or without instructions. If the Committee of the Whole rises       and reports that it has come to no resolution on the bill,       then on the next legislative day the House shall, immediately       after the third daily order of business under clause 1 of       rule XIV, resolve into the Committee of the Whole for further       consideration of the bill.        Sec. 9. The amendments referred to in section 8 of this       resolution are as follows:        (1) A proper amendment, if offered by the chair of the       Committee on Ways and Means or his designee; and        (2) A proper amendment, if offered by the ranking minority       member of the Committee on Ways and Means or his designee.        Sec. 10. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H.R. 2145.     Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I  move the previous question on the resolution.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
