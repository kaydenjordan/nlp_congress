 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, after Speaker Pelosi decided to open a  formal impeachment inquiry on Tuesday evening, there have been several  developments. Yesterday, the President released a memorandum of  conversation of his July 25 call with President Zelensky of Ukraine. In  plain text--plain text--no ands, ifs, or buts, the President pressured  the leader of Ukraine to investigate one of his leading political  rivals, confirming public reports.   Yesterday, as well, the House and Senate Intelligence Committees  received the official whistleblower complaint that precipitated this  series of events. I read the complaint yesterday afternoon and came  away more concerned--even more concerned than when I had read the  memorandum of the President's conversation.   This morning, the House Intelligence Committee made public the  declassified portion of the complaint and the intelligence community's  inspector general's cover letter. That was the correct decision. The  American people have a right to read the whistleblower's complaint for  themselves, and I hope that they will.   The whistleblower's complaint begins:         In the course of my official duties, I have received       information from multiple U.S. Government officials that the       President of the United States is using the power of his       office to solicit interference from a foreign country in the       2020 U.S. election. This interference includes, among others       things, pressuring a foreign country to investigate one of       the President's main domestic political rivals.    Those are his words.   The complaint goes on to describe specific, deliberate maneuvers by  White House lawyers and officials to lock down records of the  Presidential communications in question, including and especially ``the  official word-for-word transcript of the President's phone call with  President Zelensky.''   The whistleblower complaint contains allegations of underlying  crimes, a campaign of soliciting the interference of a foreign  government in an American election, and using the power of an official  government position for personal and political gain, as well as many  allegations of an attempted coverup.   If this was all so innocent, why did so many officials in the White  House, in the Justice Department, and elsewhere make such large efforts  to prevent it from being made public?   Both sets of allegations are said to have multiple witnesses and  multiple co-collaborators. If confirmed, the allegations contained in  the whistleblower  [[Page S5715]]  complaint are nothing short of explosive. The complaint unquestionably  validated Speaker Pelosi's decision to open a formal impeachment  inquiry into these matters.   We are living in an incredibly delicate time for our democracy. We  have a responsibility now to corroborate the facts in the  whistleblower's complaint, solicit testimony from those involved, and  pursue the relevant avenues of inquiry that arise.   We have a responsibility to consider the facts that emerge squarely  and with the best interests of our country, not our party, in our  hearts. We have a responsibility not to rush to final judgment or  overstate the case, not to let ourselves be ruled by passion but by  reason. For if the House, at the end of its inquiry, sees fit to accuse  the President of impeachable offenses, we in the Senate will act as  jury. Our role as the solemn jurors of democracy demands that we place  fidelity to country and fidelity to our Constitution above all else.                                Appropriations    Mr. President, on the Appropriations Committee, the business of the  American people and the responsibilities of Congress do not pause while  the House prepares to formally begin an impeachment inquiry. Today, for  example, the Senate must pass a continuing resolution to keep the  government open through the end of November and give appropriators time  to complete the 12 appropriations bills.   I expect the continuing resolution will pass this morning and head to  the President's desk. That is the easy part. The hard part is getting a  bipartisan appropriations process back on track here in the Senate.   Senate Republicans unilaterally departed from our bipartisan  negotiations earlier this month by proposing to divert as much as $12  billion from military construction and health programs to the  President's border wall. Obviously that was a nonstarter with  Democrats, and the Republican leader and the leaders of the  Appropriations Committee on the Republican side had to know that. As  yesterday's vote for the national emergency declaration showed, it is a  nonstarter with a double-digit number of Republicans as well.   Now that Republican leaders have shown the President they tried to  get his wall again, now that the Senate has taken two proxy votes on  the wall again this work period, neither of which came close to  passing, it is time for Leader McConnell, Chairman Shelby, and our  Republican colleagues on the Appropriations Committee to sit down with  Democrats and get a bipartisan process moving again.                         Nomination of Eugene Scalia    Mr. President, finally, on the Scalia nomination, today the Senate  will consider the nomination of Eugene Scalia to serve as Secretary of  Labor. Typical of the Trump administration, Mr. Scalia's nomination is  a slap to the face of labor because Mr. Scalia's life work has been  utterly opposed to the mission of the agency to which he is nominated.  He has sided repeatedly with the large corporate interests against  working people.   If any working person doubts that President Trump does not have their  interests at heart, look at who he has nominated. This guy shouldn't  even make it for Secretary of Commerce, let alone Secretary of Labor,  which is supposed to defend and protect the working people of America.   President Trump could have chosen a card-carrying union member for  the job. He could have chosen someone who understands the needs of  workers and unions, the history of the labor movement, and the  established right of workers to collectively bargain for better wages  and safer conditions. Instead, President Trump nominated Mr. Scalia, a  corporate lawyer who has spent his entire career protecting the  interests of CEOs, big corporations, and the wealthy elite--not  workers, not labor. Worse, he has proactively fought to weaken worker  protections. He has opposed minimum wage increases and even opposed  protections in the Americans with Disabilities Act. It is a disgrace.   My guess is that if every working person knew Mr. Scalia's record and  that President Trump nominated him, Mr. Trump would hardly get the vote  of a worker. This shows who President Trump is. This shows who our  Republican colleagues are. They talk about the rights of workers but  vote for somebody--I hope they won't, but in all likelihood, they will  vote for somebody who is anti-worker up and down in the very bones of  his body.   Mr. Scalia is part of a larger pattern. President Trump has claimed  to be a champion for working Americans, but he has filled our  government with millionaires and CEOs and folks like Scalia who work  for them with proven records of putting corporate interests before  workers' interests. Anyone who thinks President Trump is a friend of  the working person should look at Scalia's nomination.   The Republican majority, rather than use its advice and consent  powers to check the President when he does the wrong thing, rolls over  and approves these nominees.   Do all of these Republicans here oppose the Americans with  Disabilities Act? Do all of these Republicans oppose increasing the  minimum wage? Well, if you are against those kinds of things, vote for  him. But we have gotten a lot of doubletalk, people who say they are  for those things and then vote for nominees who oppose them and rip  them apart.   We should not confirm Mr. Scalia as Secretary of Labor, and I urge my  colleagues to oppose this nomination.   I yield the floor.
