 Mr. President, I thank the always gracious, always  thoughtful, always perspicacious, always persistent--and many other  good adjectives--Senator from Pennsylvania for yielding.   Now, Mr. President, there is only one way--only one way--to describe  the Supreme Court's reported decision to overturn Roe v. Wade: an  abomination.   Such a decision, if it comes to pass, would be an utter abomination.  Women across America would suffer irreparable harm to their rights,  their health, and their dignity. It would go down as one of the worst  and most damaging opinions that the Court has handed down in modern  history, and the Court would suffer a mortal blow to its reputation  that I fear will last forever.   Yesterday, I pledged that Senate Democrats will act on legislation to  codify Roe into law. It is vital that we act quickly because this is no  longer an abstract exercise. This is as real as it gets, America--as  real as it gets.   Every single American is going to see where every single Senator  stands on protecting a woman's right to choose. And rest assured,  Americans will be watching.   Now, we must be clear. This week's draft decision didn't come out of  nowhere. It didn't materialize in a vacuum. Indeed, the blame for the  end of Roe lies primarily right across the aisle here with Senate  Republicans.   The Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe would never have been  possible without Leader McConnell and Senate Republicans spending years  packing our courts with hard-right judges, judges who came from a list  under the Trump years that the Federalist Society approved. And the  Federalist Society's purpose, when it was put into action, from what I  have read, is to repeal Roe. And the Republicans on this side of the  aisle, right there, were willing--willing--accomplices in that deed.   Let me say it again. The Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe  would have never been possible without Leader McConnell and Senate  Republicans spending years packing our courts with hard-right judges.   Now, Republicans are twisting themselves into pretzels, trying to  distract from this truth. Yesterday, Leader McConnell said that the  real story was somehow the leaks and not the end of Roe.   Can you believe that? The leaks are more important than the rights of  100 million American women? Give me a break.   And when Leader McConnell evidently was asked at his press conference  yesterday: Are you glad Roe would be repealed, he wouldn't even answer  that, even though he had worked years to do it, because they know where  history is going. They know where the American people are. They know  they are on the wrong side of both so they are trying to ``low key''  it.   Republicans have spent decades trying to achieve the end of Roe, and  now that they are about to succeed, they are flailing around, talking  about a leak instead of owning up to their own actions. We won't let  them. We know, all of us, why Republicans are spending  [[Page S2299]]  all their focus on the leak. It is because they don't want to focus on  Roe, where, again, they are on the wrong side of history and the wrong  side of the American people.   Their hypocrisy and refusal to own this decision is utterly shameful.  The end of a constitutional right to choose is not some small or  inconsequential subject; it is huge. It touches on one of the most  personal, most private, most important decisions a woman can make  regarding her body.   So it is worth saying again: Without Senate Republicans working years  to pack our courts, without them changing the rules of the Senate to  confirm three ideological Justices, Roe would not--would not--be on the  brink of being overturned.   And don't take my word for it. Leader McConnell himself expected and  hoped for this outcome. When asked in 2019 what confirming President  Trump's Justices meant for the antiabortion movement, he said:         There are a number of [States] who have enacted new       legislation [that] would be winding its way up through the       courts and [it] gives us an opportunity to begin to pick away       at Roe v. Wade.    ``Pick away at Roe v. Wade.''   So what the Court did was not an aberration; it was a plan, a plan by  Senate Republicans, a plan by Leader McConnell.   Senate Republicans spent years rubberstamping one radical Trump judge  after another onto the Federal bench in order to ``pick away at Roe.''   Many of these judges were wildly unqualified. Many of them were out  of step--far out of step--from the American mainstream.   What is more, every single Republican also changed Senate rules to  confirm not one, not two, but three Trump Justices to the U.S. Supreme  Court, assuring a 6-to-3 conservative majority. Some of these Justices  lied to the Senate by misrepresenting their views on respecting  precedent when it came to decisions like Roe.   And, of course, after the death of Justice Scalia, Leader McConnell  took the unprecedented and truly destructive step of preventing the  Senate from considering the nomination of Merrick Garland.   So nobody here should be fooled. Nobody in America should be fooled.  The Republican leader might not say it, but the end of Roe is a  culmination of actions taken by the Republican leader and the  Republican Party writ large to skew our courts with hard-right,  ideological, vehemently anti-choice judges.   And now that they are close to succeeding, they can't even bring  themselves to own up to their own actions because they know--they  know--just how strongly the American people oppose restricting the  right to choose.   But this is not the end of the story. Republicans cannot hide from  the American people and cannot hide their role in bringing Roe to an  end. They will have to answer to the people this month, this year, and  especially this November, when American voters go to the polls. And we  are going to vote here in the Senate to make clear where every single  Member stands on the right to choose.   Few issues--few issues--are as personal, as private, and as important  to Americans as whether or not to have an abortion. The Nation will be  watching to see who in this Chamber will defend this precious right to  choose and who will stand with the Roberts Court to destroy this right  in one fell swoop.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    I ask unanimous consent that at 2:30 today, the Senate  resume legislative session and resume the House message to accompany  H.R. 4521; further, that the previous order be modified to allow  Senator Murkowski to offer the motion to instruct that is at the desk  in lieu of the motion in the previous order; that Senator Bennet or his  designee be permitted to make the Bennet motion; and that the Senate  vote on the motions in the order listed without further intervening  action or debate, with all other provisions in the previous order  remaining in effect, and that all votes after the first be 10-minute  votes.    OK. My colleagues, we have seven votes left; three look  like they will be voice, so there are four votes. If we stay in our  seats and try to stick as close as we can to the 10-minute vote, we can  finish very soon. So please do that.   I yield the floor.    Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.    Madam President, this is our last vote, and I want to  thank Members on both sides of the aisle for their cooperation. If you  would have told me at noon today we would finish this by 10:20, I would  have said we never could do it.   Thank you. Last vote.
