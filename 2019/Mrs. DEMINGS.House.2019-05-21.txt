 Madam Speaker, America has always been a work in  progress, and, therefore, we always have the opportunity to make our  democracy better, stronger, when we simply do the right thing.   The Declaration of Independence may have said that ``all men are  created equal,'' but it took a brave group of Americans to say that it  should really be ``all people.'' If the law applies to each of us  equally, then the right to vote must always be equal.   The women who fought for their right to vote weren't in it to make  friends. They were mocked and beaten, called extremists, told to slow  down, told that good things would come if they simply waited. But,  nevertheless, they persisted.   Today, on the 100th anniversary of the 19th Amendment passed in the  House, let's be inspired by this group of women who took the hard fight  and did the right thing, because they knew our democracy would be  stronger and better for it.                            ____________________
