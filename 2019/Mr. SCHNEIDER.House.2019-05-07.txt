 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to offer appreciation to the  incredible first responders in my congressional district.   Twice in as many weeks, our firefighters, police, and paramedics have  been called to respond to serious emergencies in Lake County.   On Thursday, April 25, a massive spill of anhydrous ammonia outside  of Beach Park sent 37 individuals to the hospital, including 11  firefighters who sustained injuries from the toxic fumes while  containing the site.   In particular, the quick action of two Lake County sheriff deputies-- Sergeant Kyle Brown and Deputy Marcus Bernardy--and four Beach Park  firefighters--Lieutenant Thomas Stahl and firefighter paramedics Pablo  Ramirez, Matthew Baran, and Ben Newman--helped save the lives of five  individuals trapped at the site and struggling to breathe.   Just days later, on Friday, May 3, a catastrophic explosion erupted  at a silicone plant in Waukegan, tragically claiming three lives. A  search continues for one missing individual. I offer my condolences to  the loved ones of Jeff Cummings, Byron Biehn, and Allen Stevens.   While we are still gathering details, it is clear the prompt response  of emergency professionals helped save others and extinguish the fires.  In both situations, local responders rushed selflessly into danger to  save others.   These events exemplify the incredible professionalism and bravery of  our first responders who put their lives on the line day in and day out  to protect our communities. We are all incredibly grateful for their  service.                            ____________________
