 Mr. President, before I say anything else this  morning, I want to say this: What we saw in Manchester last night  almost defies description. It was, in the words of Prime Minister May,  a ``callous terror attack'' that stood out ``for its appalling,  sickening cowardice, deliberately targeting innocent, defenseless  children and young people, who should have been enjoying one of the  most memorable nights of their lives.''   Although we will continue to learn more about what happened, this  much is very clear: Many have died, many more have been injured, and,  as the Prime Minister told us, many of them were children. It is hard  to imagine the pain the families of these victims must be feeling  today. On behalf of the Senate and our country, let me express our  heartfelt condolences to the victims, their families, and to the  British people, who have been our friends and allies through many  challenges.   The Senate also recognizes the many first responders, medical  professionals, and citizens who stepped in to provide help.   As I speak, I know that the intelligence professionals from both of  our countries are already working to discover whether this was the  result of an individual attacker or directed by ISIL. In either case,  the people of America will stand with our allies and provide any  assistance we possibly can.                            ____________________     Mr. President, as colleagues know, it is once again  the time of the year when Congress gets to work putting together the  next budget. One of the initial steps in the process is typically for  the President to send up a blueprint of his own laying out his  priorities, as Members continue to work through conversations here as  well.   The President's budget is being released this morning, and here are a  few things we should know about it already: It builds on the progress  made earlier this month on defense, prioritizing more of the resources  our servicemembers need. It builds on progress made earlier this month  on border security, calling for investing in more of the infrastructure  and technology our law enforcement officers actually need. And, unlike  any of President Obama's budget blueprints, this one actually achieves  balance.   The provisions I mentioned are encouraging to see. I am sure they  will serve as guideposts for Chairman Enzi and the Budget Committee as  they move forward on this matter.   I also appreciate the President's commitment to slowing the growth of  mandatory spending, which, if left unaddressed, could eventually limit  our ability to invest in nearly anything else as the debt--and the  interest we have to pay on it--increases and crowds out spending on  other major priorities.   This Thursday, Treasury Secretary Mnuchin will testify in front of  the Finance Committee on the budget blueprint and, with it, the  administration's interest in tax reform. I know we are all eager to  learn more from him and look forward to working with the administration  to make our Tax Code simpler and fairer for the American people and  American businesses.   Over the years, our tax system has grown only more complex and more  punitive, putting both individuals and employers at a disadvantage,  while also inadvertently incentivizing American companies and jobs to  leave this country to go overseas. It is evident that we need serious  reforms to our Tax Code, the type that will help families keep more of  their hard-earned money, while also helping businesses put more  Americans to work.   By implementing tax reform, we can again encourage investment in our  country, allowing American businesses to expand, hire more workers,  improve wages, and offer better benefits. In turn, families will have  access to more  [[Page S3076]]  opportunities and will be better positioned to actually get ahead.   It has been over three decades since we passed comprehensive tax  reform, and it is past time we do something about it. Fortunately, we  now have an administration that shares this interest in finally  improving our tax system instead of making it even more convoluted and  constricting--and without demanding $1 trillion in new taxes for the  government.   Easing the burden on the middle class and getting the economy moving  again are top concerns here in the Republican Senate. We understand  that for the past 8 years, too many families struggled under the weight  of an economy that failed to reach its potential, too many took home  wages that didn't meet their needs, and too many saw opportunity slip  away. We understand that these families deserve a change in direction  and expect each of us to do what we can to get the economy moving again  soon. That is why we passed legislation to provide relief from Obama- era regulations that stifle growth, and it is why we will keep working  to advance more legislative solutions to help hard-working Americans.  Tax reform is one way we can do just that.   This is an area where Republicans and Democrats have been able to  find some common ground in the past, and I am hopeful our friends  across the aisle will join us in working toward comprehensive tax  reform one more time. Either way, the Republican Senate remains  committed to enacting tax reform so we can help encourage American  investment, boost job creation, and promote wage growth all across our  country.   Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to legislative  session.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to executive session  to consider Calendar No. 54, Courtney Elwood to be General Counsel of  the CIA.    Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  mandatory quorum call with respect to the cloture motion be waived.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  resume consideration of the Sullivan nomination.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  be in a period of morning business, with Senators permitted to speak  therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 10 a.m.,  Wednesday, May 24; further, that following the prayer and pledge, the  morning hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved  to date, the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later  in the day, and morning business be closed; finally, that following  leader remarks, the Senate proceed to executive session to resume  consideration of the Sullivan nomination.    Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned  under the previous order, following the remarks of Senator Durbin.
