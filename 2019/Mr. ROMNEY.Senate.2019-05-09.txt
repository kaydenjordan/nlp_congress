 Mr. President, the Transcontinental Railroad is a  testament to the enduring American spirit of industry and national  unity.  [[Page S2768]]    On the precipice of the American Civil War, Utah's delegate to the  U.S. House of Representatives, William Henry Hooper, recognized that  ``A great band of Union throughout the family of man is a common  interest.'' Hooper petitioned Congress in his belief that ``a Central  Road would unite that interest as with a chain of iron, and would  effectually hold together our Federal union with an imperishable  identity of mutual interest.''   William Henry Hooper's letter to Congress would take several months  to reach Washington, DC, as any westward travel beyond the Mississippi  River required wagon, stagecoach, or horseback.   The U.S. Congress would, however, approve such an undertaking, and  soon, a National Central Railroad began to manifest from the worn hands  of laborers to execute a vision of national unity, a feat that would  propel American power and change the course of our history.   These hands belonged to men of differing national origins and creeds,  who labored together under one banner, often fleeing significant  hardship in pursuit of economic opportunity in the American West.  Roughly 15,000 Chinese immigrants, 10,000 Irish immigrants, and 4,000  Latter-day Saints joined the national effort to complete the most  remarkable and ambitious engineering project of the 19th century.   On May 10, 1869, the Union Pacific and Central Pacific railroads  formally met at Promontory Summit, UT, and the 17.6-carat golden spike  officially linked the East and West Coasts, marking a watershed moment  for American trade, commerce, and population.   A 6-month journey across the continent was reduced to 1 week. Within  a decade of the railroad's completion, Salt Lake City's population more  than doubled, further boosting Utah's significance in the national  economy.   Brigham Young recognized the enormous opportunities that global trade  would bring to Utah and the country and the abundant and yet untapped  resources of iron, coal, stone, and timber.   In pursuit of a national railroad project, Brigham Young recognized  that ``mineral resources of California, and these mountains, will never  be fully developed to the benefit of the people of the United States,  without the construction of such a road, and upon its completion, the  entire trade of China and the East Indies will pass through the heart  of the Union; thereby giving our Citizens the almost entire controls of  the Asiatic and Pacific trade.''   Indeed, the Transcontinental Railroad would transform the American  economy in profound ways. This achievement revolutionized  communications, global trade routes, and allowed for the movement of  people across the country at an unprecedented scale.   On the sesquicentennial of the completion of the Transcontinental  Railroad at Promontory Summit, let us remember the sacrifice of those  laborers who would not live to see to its conclusion, but whose  contributions helped transform the Nation and the world.   The 150th anniversary of the Golden Spike is also a celebration of  the limitless American imagination, spirit of ingenuity, and industry  that made this incredible project a success.   Let us not forget the example these pioneers set for us as we go  forward in a new era of challenges and opportunities.                            ____________________
