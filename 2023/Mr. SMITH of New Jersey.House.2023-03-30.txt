 Mr. Chair, I rise in support of the  amendment and ask for its immediate consideration.    Mr. Chair, like canaries in coal mines, the  recent spate of tragic whale and dolphin deaths and a well-founded  suspicion that geophysical surveys, including the use of sonar may be a  contributing cause, has brought new light and increased scrutiny to the  fast-tracking of approximately 3,400 offshore wind turbines covering  2.4 million acres by 2030, more after that by 2040--all embedded into  the ocean floor by massive pile drivers--in the North Atlantic Planning  Area that includes New Jersey's coast.   The offshore wind industrialization approval process has left  unaddressed and unanswered numerous serious questions concerning the  potentially harmful environmental impact on whales, marine life, and  the ecosystems that currently allow all sea creatures great and small  to thrive.   Cindy Zipf, executive director of Clean Ocean Action, pointed out in  testimony at a field hearing chaired by my good friend and colleague,  Jeff Van Drew, that the National Marine Fisheries Service has said,  ``Offshore wind is a new use of our marine waters, requiring  substantial scientific and regulatory review.''   So she asks: So, where is the substantial review?   My amendment, Mr. Chair, requires the U.S. Government Accountability  Office, or GAO, to investigate the sufficiency of the environmental  review process for offshore wind projects of the Marine Fisheries  Service, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, and any other relevant  Federal agency.    =========================== NOTE ===========================        On March 30, 2023, on page H1668, in the second column, the  following appeared: My amendment, Mr. Chair, requires the U.S.  Accountability Office, or GAO, to investigate the sufficiency of  the en-      The online version has been corrected to read: My amendment, Mr.  Chair, requires the U.S. Government Accountability Office, or GAO,  to investigate the sufficiency of the en-    ========================= END NOTE =========================                                  time  1000    Among other concerns, GAO would be required to investigate and report  to Congress on the impacts of offshore wind projects on whales,  finfish, and marine mammals; commercial and recreational fishing;  recreation and tourism; invertebrates; essential fish habitat; benthic  resources; cultural, historical, and archeological resources;  sustainability of shoreline beaches and inlets; military use and  navigation/vessel traffic; and the impacts of hurricanes and other  severe weather on offshore wind projects.   The GAO would also be tasked to reveal how the agencies determine  which stakeholders are consulted, whether a timely and comprehensive  comment period is provided for local representatives and interest  parties, and the estimated costs and who pays for the offshore wind  projects.   Mr. Chair, if and when the wind turbines go online, vessel  navigation--including U.S. Navy ships, merchant and cargo ships,  fishing boats, and search and rescue operations by the Coast Guard--may  be significantly hampered due to radar interference.   The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine  released a report in 2022--a year ago--titled ``Wind Turbine Generator  Impacts to Marine Vessel Radar'' and found that wind turbine generators  ``obfuscate the marine vessel radar for both magnetron-based and solid- state radar . . . and can cause significant interference and shadowing  that suppress the detection of small contacts.''   The study also found that wind turbine mitigation techniques for  marine vessel radar have not--I repeat, have not--been substantially  investigated, implemented, matured, or deployed.   That study was from 1 year ago.   The vulnerability of massive structures the size of the Chrysler  Building to hurricanes, nor'easters, and superstorms has not been  adequately investigated and vetted.   Yet one study in 2012 found that there is very substantial risk that  Category 3 and higher hurricanes can destroy one-half or more of the  turbines at some locations.   Remember, Mr. Chairman, these are about 1,000 feet tall. They could  topple like dominoes.   Any surface appeal argument made by the industry or by the government  comparing it to the survivability of ocean wind turbines on the East  Coast of the United States to the U.K. or Norway fails because Europe  doesn't get hurricanes. They get remnants of our hurricanes. They get  bad weather, but they don't get hurricanes.   In like manner, the devastating impact on commercial and recreational  fishing has been largely ignored. One expert, Meghan Lapp, gave  tremendous testimony at Mr. Van Drew's hearing. She said: ``We are  facing the annihilation of our industry at the hands of the Bureau of  Ocean Energy Management.''   New Jersey's amazing shore tourism industry is also being put at  grave risk.   Mr. Chairman, with so much at stake and out of an abundance of  caution and concern, support my amendment to require a comprehensive  and independent review by the GAO. It is absolutely warranted.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.
