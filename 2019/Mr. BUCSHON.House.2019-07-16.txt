 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the incredible life  of Eva Mozes Kor. Eva was a friend, a Holocaust survivor, and an  inspiration to us all.   As a young girl, Eva and her family were held at the Auschwitz  concentration camp. While at Auschwitz, Eva and her twin sister,  Miriam, were subjected to inhumane medical experiments by the Nazi  doctor Josef Mengele until their liberation in 1945.   Eva and her sister were the only members of their family to survive  the horrors of Auschwitz. Despite this dark atrocity, Eva used her life  to spread the message of forgiveness.   Eva married Michael Kor in 1960 and later that year moved to Terre  Haute, Indiana, in my district, where they raised two children.   Eva also spent decades teaching Hoosiers the importance of finding  peace, healing, and hope. In 1995, Eva opened the CANDLES Holocaust  Museum in Terre Haute, creating a permanent home to remind us of the  power of forgiveness and compassion.   Eva passed away, peacefully, at the age of 84 during her annual trip  to Poland.   Eva Kor was an incredible woman of integrity, spirit, and  forgiveness, and her story will be shared for generations to come. May  her memory be a blessing.                            ____________________
