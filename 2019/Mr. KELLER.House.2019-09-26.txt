 Mr. Speaker, while our Nation's farmers continue to bear  the brunt of the obstruction stopping passage of the USMCA, there is a  lot we can do to help our struggling dairy industry.   Currently, I am a proud cosponsor of three bills that would do just  that and implement the priorities of not just farmers in Pennsylvania's  12th Congressional District, but farmers across our Nation.   The bipartisan Dairy Pride Act would provide truth in labeling by  preventing nondairy products made from nuts, algae, seeds, and plants  from using dairy terms.   The Whole Milk for Healthy Kids Act of 2019, introduced by  Pennsylvania's own G.T. Thompson, would increase consumption of whole  milk in our schools, allowing children to reap the taste and  nutritional benefits of whole milk, and is a win-win for both children  and dairy producers alike.   In addition, the School Milk Nutrition Act of 2019, also sponsored by  Congressman Thompson, would roll back another bad policy from the Obama  years and would codify that schools may offer flavored low-fat milk in  the National School Lunch Program.   Mr. Speaker, if Democrat leaders will not bring up the USMCA for a  vote and help our dairy farmers by doing things like eliminating  Canada's Class 7 milk, then we should act to find other ways to solve  these problems for our dairy farmers. These are three bills that are a  great start.                            ____________________
