 Mr. President, this week I have the honor of  recognizing Virgil Gust of Sweet Grass County for his commitment to  keeping entrepreneurial spirits high during these challenging times.   The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted the lives of all Montanans and  has proven to be a significant challenge for small business owners.  Over the past several months, local business owners have faced  tremendous financial hardships as a result of the pandemic, making it  difficult to hold on to hope.   Virgil Gust, the founder of Gusts of Big Timber, opened the store in  1947 and has worked there for over 70 years. Virgil still approaches  his work with the same enthusiasm and dedication as he did at the  beginning of his career.   It is my honor to recognize Virgil for fostering the values of  positivity and hard work in his community during these difficult times.  As both a WWII veteran and a small business owner, Virgil brings a  unique entrepreneurial perspective to his community and is a truly  exceptional role model to Montanans from all walks of life.                            ____________________
