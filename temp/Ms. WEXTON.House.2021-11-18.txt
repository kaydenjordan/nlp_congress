 Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the  Build Back Better Act to deliver on the promises we have made to the  American people.  [[Page H6587]]    This bill is about families and fairness. Even before the pandemic,  parents in Virginia and across the country have been weighed down by  the cost of raising their kids, caring for their elderly parents, and  providing for their families. The Build Back Better Act will lighten  that burden.   The investments we are making with this bill, universal pre-K,  affordable childcare, and lower prices for healthcare and prescription  drugs, will bring everyday costs for families down and set all of our  children up for a bright future.   It will take long-overdue action to tackle the climate crisis by  making the historic investments that we need to create a clean energy  future for our kids, while creating millions of good-paying American  manufacturing jobs in the process.   We have the opportunity to enact once-in-a-generation change that  will improve the lives of our families and keep our economy on a path  to a strong and full recovery.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support a swift passage of the  Build Back Better Act.
