 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak in support of H.R.  4447, the Clean Economy Jobs and Innovation Act. I am proud that that  bill was used as a shell for this legislation.   This legislative package is the work of over 40 critical pieces of  energy and environment legislation from the House. Many of the bills  included in this package are bipartisan, and I would like to thank our  leadership, committee chairs, and Members on both sides of the aisle  for contributing to this effort.   This bill will take meaningful steps to update our energy  infrastructure, create new jobs, and take important steps to address  climate change in our country.   The last major Federal effort to address our changing energy  landscape occurred in 2007. The urgency of the climate crisis and  energy infrastructure crisis cannot be overstated.   As the proud Representative of Arizona's First Congressional  District, and as seen throughout the Western United States and our  Nation, communities are facing the effects of climate change every day.  From larger, deadlier forest fires to crippling droughts, Arizonans  know the real-life implications of our changing planet.   This is why today's bill is so important. It addresses the growing  climate crisis and revitalizes our sagging energy economy. It creates  much-needed job growth across our Nation. It is a win-win-win.   As Members of Congress, we must work in a bipartisan manner to  identify commonsense policy solutions to these critical issues and help  hardworking families find a just transition as our energy economy  continues to evolve.   The legislative package we are voting on today does more than just  update our Nation's energy infrastructure. It creates tens of thousands  of new, good-paying energy jobs that support a family and will be  created through the new programs, initiatives, and Federal projects  created within this bill to accelerate the deployment of clean energy  technologies.   We make meaningful investments in research and development programs  to unlock the energy technologies of tomorrow, limit our carbon  footprint, and preserve the environment for future generations to enjoy  and prosper. We need to continue to identify legislative initiatives  like the Clean Economy Jobs and Innovation Act that will work on a  large scale to create new jobs in growing industries.   I am humbled to see two bills I introduced, the Expanding Access to  Sustainable Energy Act, and the Tribal Power Act, be included in  today's critical legislative package. And I am proud to stand today in  favor of the Clean Economy Jobs and Innovation Act.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in voting to pass this  important legislation.                            ____________________
