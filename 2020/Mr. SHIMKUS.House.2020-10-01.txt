 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to continue to thank my staff  for excellent service to the constituents of my district and sometimes  to those even outside my district.   In our organization, caseworkers live and work in Illinois. They work  out of my district offices, which I have historically spread out  throughout my large, mainly rural district. During this Congress, my  offices have been in Maryville, Effingham, Harrisburg, and Danville.   My caseworkers are my representatives to that region. They also  welcome visitors and forward legislative concerns to my legislative  assistant, but their primary job is that of casework.   What is a case? A case is a concern, request, or correction by my  constituents who feel that they are not receiving due benefits or  having trouble just getting answers from the Federal Government. Our  job is to get them an answer. I was always careful never to promise  that I could solve their problem; I only promise that we would try. My  caseworkers did all the work.   Mr. Speaker, those district caseworkers are:   Ballard, Mary; Buettner, Ruth; Bugger, Doug; Carlson, Brad; Davis,  Rodney; Detmers, Deb (Fansler); Dillman, Jen; Flanigan, Matt; Graham,  Donna; Hall, Mike; Hamilton, Daniel; Hanson, John; Hantz, Chuck; Healy,  Holly (Linder); Hoffman, Doug.   Jamison, Reno; Madigan Andrea; Maxwell, Mary Ellen/Maria (Madonia);  Merriman, Angie; Nelson, Jed; Newcomb, Nate; Holloway, Kay D.; Pickett,  Matt; Pruitt, Jen; Rice, Matt; Rohan, Dora; Shull, Kristen;  Tomaszewski, Steve; Von Burg, Peggy; Weber, Amy.   Mr. Speaker, over the years, my office has been able to assist  literally thousands of people with their problems with the Federal  Government. Here are just a few examples of things that they have been  able to accomplish.   One of my constituents was born in Mississippi in the 1930s at home  with a midwife. In her seventies, she tried to get a passport for a  once-in-a-lifetime trip to Spain, but her birth was never recorded, and  her parents were deceased.   My office assisted her in obtaining school records, baptismal  certificates, marriage license, children's birth certificates, and  certified letters from old friends. These documents, combined with a  Census search showing her living with her grandmother in Mississippi in  the 1940s, finally was ample information for her to obtain a passport.   Mr. Speaker, I have been able to present medals to deserving veterans  across my district. Often the veterans  [[Page H5111]]  do not want to talk about their experience, but their awards are  important to their children and their grandchildren. One of these  veterans was the uncle of my veterans affairs caseworker, Doug Bugger.  Another is a veteran from Robinson, Illinois, who had been shot and  taken prisoner by the Germans during the Battle of the Bulge. After  receiving the awards, he gave an interview to the Robinson Daily News  and used a photograph of him with his medals, including his Purple  Heart. Helping in the recovery of these military awards helps these  veterans relay their experiences to family and friends.   Social Security disability is a long and frustrating process. One  gentleman had been approved but had waited nearly a year for his  backpay when he came to my Harrisburg office. It turned out it was  coded incorrectly in the Social Security system. Within 2 weeks, my  office got the situation corrected, and he received his backpay.   Some of our happiest casework is to help families with overseas  adoptions, like the family that was in the process of adopting a child  from Haiti just as the pandemic was shutting everything down. My office  was able to work with the Embassy to get child humanitarian parole to  come to the United States of America.                                time  0915    Mr. Speaker, I can go on and on like most offices could talking about  the work that their caseworkers do. I don't have time to do that, so I  will include these additional stories in the Record.   A veteran came to one of my Traveling Help Desks. He had recently  undergone a partial amputation of his foot. The VA doctor missed the  diagnosis, so a private doctor performed the procedure. The VA was  refusing to pay for the surgery, but after our inquiry, the VA agreed  the surgery was necessary and it was their mistake in missing the  diagnosis and paid the bill for $1,712.76.    A veteran had fallen off a crane during his time in the military.  This resulted in a 3-inch gash to the head and subsequent severe  seizures. He had been trying to get disability from the VA for 10  years. After our inquiry, he was granted a 100% service-connected  disability and approved retroactively for 10 years (estimated $227,440)  and now receives $1,940 per month.   A veteran requested our assistance in obtaining his father's silver  star from WWI. We were able to obtain this, as well as his other medals  and I presented them to the family at a family reunion. The family made  a box for the medals and gave them to the American Legion to display.  The family was very happy.   A constituent contacted our office on behalf of her husband. Medicare  was denying his claims because there was an error in the paperwork that  showed her husband had employer-provided insurance, when in fact he had  been retired since 1986. Her husband was terminally ill, and she was  spending a lot of time trying to resolve this situation. She had called  more than 50 places before she called our office. After contacting our  office, we were able to have the problem fixed and have the claims  reprocessed and paid.   A union contacted our office on the issue of wage differentiation  concerning government employees in Illinois. After our inquiry, it was  determined there was an error when the wage differentiation was made,  and a salary adjustment was made.   The local FSA was not allowing some constituents to mow their  property that was enrolled in the CRP program. Not mowing the land  would result in trees growing on the property, which would defeat the  purpose of having the land in CRP. After an inquiry from our office,  the state revised their rules.   A constituent came to us because Social Security was showing him as  deceased, when in fact it was his wife who had passed away on May 20 of  this year. We were able to expedite a correction of his records and  have his retirement benefits reinstated. This was a Social Security  Administration error.   A constituent received a notice from the IRS that after paying her  debt of $2,400 from her quarterly taxes of 9/87 and 12/87 on her  previous business, she now owed $3,184 in interest and penalties. She  was never aware of the interest and penalties as she had repeatedly  asked for a statement from the IRS for her $100.00 payments and federal  tax returns they had also been keeping. Also, she had never received  the original bills because her business closed in 1990, and they had  been sending these notices to that address. We ended up going with her  to an IRS problem solving day and staying with her through several  hours of negotiations. Eventually, her balance was zeroed. She was very  grateful and ended up testifying at our IRS hearings.   A constituent was applying for a teaching position at one of the  local schools. He needed transcripts from his alma mater in Oklahoma to  obtain his provisional teaching certificate. The school was telling him  they could not provide this because they did not keep records prior to  1985. We were able to intervene with the school, and obtain a letter  verifying his completion of a 72-hour course from a former instructor.  This worked for the teaching certificate and he received the job.   A constituent contacted our office regarding his request to help him  obtain an answer from AT&T Broadband Services concerning the free  internet service for schools that they have advertised. He contacted  AT&T several times but never felt he got a straight answer as to when  the service was going to be available to the school. I met with AT&T  representatives and told them of this situation. AT&T got in touch with  him and the school was hooked up. I was able to visit the school and  see the technology area. The kids all sent me a thank you note.   A constituent worked at a small local newspaper. She had contacted us  for assistance with child support enforcement. Her ex was in the Navy  and then became a pilot. According to the law, he could lose his  passport for being over $5,000 in arrears. He owed $10,330 and we were  able to work with the appropriate enforcement agencies and he ended up  paying $5,500 of his debt and his monthly payment increased from $200 a  month to $1,000 a month. She was very grateful to our office.   The Edwards County Coroner informed my office that the remains of a  Sgt. Kenneth Cunningham of Albion had been identified 45 years after  his plane went down over the Kon Tum Province in Vietnam. The coroner  and family were working to bring the remains home for a burial and were  having some difficulty with the bureaucracy. We were able to talk to  the Defense Department and help with the arrangements the family  wanted. The family was able to be at the airport in Louisville,  Kentucky when he arrived, and the Patriot Guard accompanied Sgt.  Cunningham back to Albion where citizens lined up along the route to  pay their respects. The VFW distributed 500 flags along the route and  more than 200 local volunteers lined the route from the town to the  cemetery with over 2,400 flags.   A constituent sought my help in March of this year during the COVID- 19 pandemic to bring his daughter and his grandson back to the United  States on the repatriation flights the Department of State offered.  Working with the father and the State Department they both made it back  to the United States two and half weeks after contacting us.   Also, in March we assisted 5 constituents stranded in Honduras after  the border had been closed. They had problems receiving their transit  letters from the U.S. Embassy so they could travel to the airport. We  were able to assist, and they were able to get seats on a plane  chartered by a church out of Lincoln, Nebraska.   The Sny Island Levee Drainage District protects 110,000 acres of  prime farmland in west central Illinois. Due to the change in flow of  the Mississippi, this privately owned and maintained levee was  threatened with failing. We helped coordinate emergency repairs by the  Corp of Engineers to protect the navigation channel at that location.  This also protected the farmland.   ``Lights On for Route 20'' was a movement for a four-lane road  between Springfield and Taylorville. Lobbied intensely by the local  communities and concerned parents we were able to designate one million  dollars for engineering. This was a small investment versus the total  costs. This investment did get the attention of the state  representative and the state senator who requested that this project be  included in the governor's Build Illinois project list. We now have a  four-lane road between Springfield and Taylorville.   Mr. Speaker, some cases resolve quickly. Many cases take months and  even years to resolve. My caseworkers always show compassion and  concern to my constituents. They answer their calls; they return their  calls; and for that, I say thanks. I am very proud of the service that  they have given to the people of southern Illinois.                            ____________________
