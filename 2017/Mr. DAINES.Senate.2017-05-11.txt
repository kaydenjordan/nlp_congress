 Mr. President, this week, I have the distinct  honor of recognizing Jack Young, a U.S. Army veteran and teacher at  Harlem Public Schools. Whether serving our Nation inside an Abrams tank  or serving his local community at the front of a classroom, Jack has  represented the character of the Treasure State in both settings.   After graduating from high school, Jack enlisted in the Army. He  served our Nation on Active Duty for 4 years and completed two overseas  assignments. Not long after finishing his military service, Jack  attended Montana State University--Northern and trained to become a  teacher. In 2006, he began teaching at Harlem Public Schools. Since  arriving in Blaine County, he has grown into a fixture in the local  community. Jack has taught history and government to both high school  and junior high school students. During the warm months, you will find  Jack in the classroom teaching summer school, helping students rise to  the next level academically. For the past 4 years, he has taught  government courses at the Aaniiih Nakoda College. Earlier in his  teaching career, Jack was an assistant coach for the Harlem Wildcats  football team. Through all seasons and across multiple academic levels,  Jack has served his fellow Montanans by teaching the historic context  and hard-earned value of our constitutional system of government.   Jack has excelled in his transition from a tanker to a teacher. The  best part of Jack's story is he loves what he does and plans to  continue doing it for a long time. Montanans are grateful for folks  like Jack who make our communities stronger. Thank you, Jack, for your  service, and I wish you the best in the years to come.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                  S. 1097         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Armed Forces Reserve and       National Guard Dual-Status Review and Modernization Act''.       SEC. 2. POSTPONEMENT OF DEADLINE FOR COMPLETION OF CONVERSION                     OF CERTAIN MILITARY TECHNICIAN (DUAL STATUS)                     POSITIONS TO POSITIONS OF CIVILIAN EMPLOYMENT                     BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.         (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:        (1) A September 2013 study conducted by a federally funded       research and development center found that 21 percent of the       military technician (dual status) positions are       administrative in nature--the largest category as a       percentage of military technician (dual status) positions.       The study recommends investigation on whether ``some Dual       Status MilTech positions supporting general administration       functions could be converted to Title 5 Federal civilian       full-time support positions without compromising unit       readiness''. The study further recommends investigation on       whether ``it is more appropriate to use military full-time       support for other reasons (such as currency in military       operations and training and augmentation)''.        (2) Section 1053 of the National Defense Authorization Act       for Fiscal Year 2016 directs the conversion of not fewer than       20 percent of all military technician positions to positions       of Federal civilian employment under title 5, United States       Code, by January 1, 2017. Section 1084 of the National       Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017 extends the       deadline for that conversion from January 1, 2017, to October       1, 2017.        (3) The Department of Defense submitted a report on the       management of military technicians in December 2016 that       finds that 12.6 percent of the military technician (dual       status) positions were administrative in nature, and       recommended a conversion of 4.8 percent of such positions to       positions of Federal civilian employment.        (4) The Chief of the National Guard Bureau testified before       Congress in April 2017 that a conversion of 20 percent of       military technician (dual status) positions to positions of       Federal civilian employment would degrade readiness, but that       a lower number could be converted with minimal impact. The       Chief of the National Guard Bureau also testified that the       Department of Defense had not conducted an analysis of the       associated costs and benefits of a conversion of 20 percent       of military technician (dual status) positions to positions       of Federal civilian employment.        (b) Postponement of Deadline for Completion of       Conversion.--Notwithstanding the deadline otherwise specified       in paragraph (1) of section 1053(a) of the National Defense       Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016 (10 U.S.C. 113 note)       for the completion of the conversion of military technician       positions as described in that subsection, the deadline for       the completion of such conversion shall be 180 days after the       date on which the Secretary of Defense transmits to Congress       under paragraph (6) of subsection (c) the report of the       working group required by paragraph (5) of that subsection.        (c) Working Group on Full Time Support of the Reserve       Components.--        (1) In general.--There shall be established in the       Department of Defense a working group to be known as the       ``Working Group on Full Time Support of the Reserve       Components'' (in this subsection referred to as the ``working       group'').        (2) Co-chairs.--The co-chairs of the working group shall be       the following:        (A) The Director of the Army National Guard.        (B) The Director of the Air National Guard.        (C) The Chief of the Army Reserve.        (D) The Chief of the Air Force Reserve.        (3) Members.--The members of the working group shall       include the co-chairs of the working group and such other       personnel of the Department of Defense as the Secretary shall       appoint from among organizations and elements of the       Department with an interest in full time support of the       reserve components of the Armed Forces, including the       National Guard Bureau and the Adjutants General of the       States.        (4) Duties.--The working group shall undertake a       comprehensive review of full time  [[Page S2918]]       support of the reserve components of the Armed Forces,       including the following:        (A) An identification of the missions, purposes, and       objectives of military technicians (dual status) in support       of an operational reserve force.        (B) A review of the posture of current military technician       (dual status) positions, and of their current role in meeting       the objectives identified pursuant to subparagraph (A).        (C) An analysis of potential restructurings of the       workforce of military technicians (dual status) in order to       identify a restructuring that fully aligns military       technician (dual status) positions with objectives for full       time support of the reserve components.        (D) An identification of the military technician (dual       status) positions whose conversion to positions of Federal       civilian employment under title 5, United States Code, would       best ensure the achievement of objectives for full time       support of the reserve components.        (E) An assessment of the impact on the readiness of the       National Guard for domestic operations of the conversion of       positions identified pursuant to subparagraph (D) as       described in that subparagraph.        (F) An assessment of costs and potential savings associated       with the conversion of positions identified pursuant to       subparagraph (D) as described in that subparagraph.        (5) Report to secretary of defense.--Not later than 180       days after the date of the enactment of this Act, the working       group shall submit to the Secretary of Defense a report on       the comprehensive review undertaken pursuant to paragraph       (4). The report shall include the following:        (A) A comprehensive description of the review and the       results of the review.        (B) The percentage of military technician (dual status)       positions whose conversion to positions of Federal civilian       employment under title 5, United States Code, would best       ensure the achievement of objectives for full time support of       the reserve components of the Armed Forces as an operational       reserve.        (C) A transition plan for implementing a new force       structure for full time support of the reserve components,       including for the conversion of positions as described in       subparagraph (B) which mitigates any risks to readiness       identified pursuant to paragraph (4)(E).        (D) Recommendations for the reform of personnel management       policy for military technician (dual status) positions that       address--        (i) the eligibility of military technicians (dual status)       for civilian retirement upon retirement from the Armed       Forces; and        (ii) the process for appealing employment decisions.        (E) Recommendations for reforms of compensation and       benefits policies for military technician (dual status)       positions in order to provide military technicians (dual       status) with parity in compensation and benefits with other       Federal civilian employees of the Department of Defense under       title 5, United States Code.        (6) Transmittal of report to congress.--The Secretary shall       transmit to the congressional defense committees the report       of the working group under paragraph (5), together with such       discussion and recommendations in connection with the report       as the Secretary considers appropriate. The Secretary shall       publish the report, and any such discussions and       recommendations, in the Federal Register at the time of       transmittal.        (7) Congressional defense committees defined.--In this       subsection, the term ``congressional defense committees'' has       the meaning given that term in section 101(a)(16) of title       10, United States Code.    Mr. President, under current law, twenty-percent of our  military dual-status technicians in the National Guard, Army Reserve,  and Air Force Reserve will become federal civilians on October 1st.  This will leave the state Governors to respond to wildfires, floods,  and other natural disasters with twenty-percent fewer people. The  benefits of this conversion are unclear. In fact, the Chief of the  National Guard Bureau testified that no formal analysis has been  conducted as to whether there is any benefit at all. It seems prudent  to me to take a pause, bring all of the affected stakeholders together,  and figure this problem out before we take any irreversible action.  Today, I'm introducing the ``Armed Forces Reserve and National Guard  Dual-Status Review and Modernization Act,'' to do exactly that.   As I've studied this situation, I understand there are a number of  valid concerns involved. The current statutory construct for dual- status military technicians is nearly 50 years old and the role of the  Reserve components has changed dramatically just in the past 15 years,  let alone the last half-century. I agree we should update the statute  to better meet the needs of the total force and my bill addresses this  concern. Similarly, many Guardsmen and Reservists feel that personnel  management practices under this aging construct doesn't fit the needs  of a 21st century workforce. My bill addresses those concerns as well.   Most importantly, the bill ensures that there is no adverse impact to  the Guard's ability to respond to domestic emergencies on October 1st,  by postponing that date until Department of Defense leadership conducts  a thorough, comprehensive review on the requirements of a 21st Century  total force, and how our current structure should be aligned to meet  those requirements. This will allow Congress to make an informed and  measured judgement on how to update current law. I urge my colleagues  to give this matter their full consideration and support.                                  ______                                         By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself and Ms. Collins):   S. 1113. A bill to amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to  ensure the safety of cosmetics; to the Committee on Health, Education,  Labor, and Pensions.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                  S. 1097         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.
