 Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, the amendment that I am offering would prohibit  the District of Columbia from using Federal funding to require that  elementary or secondary school students take the COVID-19 vaccine and  all the boosters to attend school.   In 2021, the D.C. City Council voted to create an unscientific  mandate that D.C. students be fully vaccinated against COVID-19  including boosters. It was repeatedly delayed, as the parents of more  than 40 percent of children over 12 in D.C. decided the COVID-19  vaccine was not worth the risks and declined to get vaccinated.   Today, the mandate would keep 73 percent of all D.C. students between  the ages of 12 and 17 out of classrooms.   Now, the issue here, obviously, is twofold. One is whether Congress  should have a role in impacting policy choices in the District of  Columbia, which the Constitution clearly contemplates.   In fact, the District of Columbia is not a State. It was not designed  to be a State. It is not going to be a State because the District of  Columbia was set up in our Constitution to be our National Capital, by  design, very specifically.   One of the things that we are able to do as a Congress is effect  policy in the District of Columbia, whereas we are not supposed to  intervene for the most part in the laboratories of democracy among the  States. My colleagues on the other side of the aisle never find any  limit to their ability to want to interject into the States.   One of the things we can do in D.C. is try to impact policy here.  Now, the fact is, these vaccine mandates were completely ineffective;  and, in fact, they were destructive. The CDC's own website states that  when cases have occurred, they have most frequently been seen in  adolescent and young adult males.   The Pfizer website states myocarditis and pericarditis have occurred  in some people who have received the vaccine, more commonly in  adolescent males.   The FDA has placed a warning label on both the Moderna and Pfizer  vaccines. I could go on and on with the evidence and the indication of  the concerns these mandates have on freedom and, importantly, our  children.   Now, obviously, the rule for this was passed before yesterday when  the D.C. City Council unanimously voted to repeal this unscientific  mandate.                                time  1845    There is not some vast Republican conspiracy afoot in D.C. The  Department of Health, Office of State Superintendent of Education, and  the Deputy Mayor of Education each testified in favor of repealing the  vaccine mandate.   What we are doing here in offering this is making clear that it is  the position of the United States Congress who is constitutionally  charged with ensuring that the District of Columbia is managed  appropriately is no longer foisting upon the children who live in the  Nation's Capital a, frankly, intrusive and harmful vaccine mandate, and  it should not continue.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, in March of this year President Biden signed  legislation that we moved through this body overturning the criminal  code revisions of the D.C. City Council that reduced the maximum  penalties for burglary, carjacking, and robbery.   Our own colleague, the gentleman from Texas, was carjacked at  gunpoint nine blocks from where we are right here.   The fact of the matter is D.C. needs continued oversight from this  body. I am glad that we acted and passed that legislation and forced  change to the code, and I am glad that President Biden signed it.   What we are doing here is not just academic. I understand the D.C.  City Council acted yesterday, but it is important for this body, for  the House of Representatives, to make clear that the students in this  country should not be subjected to mandatory vaccine mandates that  undermine their health through pseudoscience.   We have an obligation to ensure that we are ensuring that Nation's  Capital is doing the right thing, and, frankly, we have the ability to  influence that in ways we should not when interfering directly with the  laboratories of democracy.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, the amendment that I am offering here prohibits  any of the funding in the Financial Services and General Government  Appropriations Act from being used to carry out President Biden's  executive orders on climate change.   This is something I have been offering in each of the appropriations  bills because I believe that the implications of the President's  executive orders on climate change are significant.   They are undermining our well-being. They are undermining the  prosperity of American citizens. They are harming the economy. They are  driving up inflation. They are minimizing options for the people of  this country to go about doing their jobs. They are driving up the  price of energy. They are making cars more expensive. They are making  homes more expensive.   You wonder why we have high inflation? Look no further than the  radical environmental policies of my Democratic colleagues.   In September, the Department of the Treasury issued its ``Principles  for Net-Zero Financing & Investment,'' which highlighted best practices  for net-zero commitments and approaches to implementing them.   The SEC has proposed rules to force all public companies to report on  their emissions and all the emissions in their value chains. The bill  defunds that.   The IRS is implementing the vast majority of $1.2 trillion in climate  subsidies included in the IRA--again, $1.2 trillion in climate  subsidies included in the IRA.   The goal is clear: Force divestment from oil and gas--one of our  largest geopolitical assets, one of our strongest blessings from the  good Lord that this country has to be able to stand independently,  energy independent, and to be able to have a significant force in the  world.   These orders have directed the General Services Administration to  overhaul the Federal building portfolio and vehicle fleet.   Each agency's light-duty vehicle acquisitions shall be zero-emission  vehicles by the end of fiscal year 2027. Each agency shall achieve net- zero emissions across its portfolio of buildings, campuses, and  installations by 2045 and reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 50  percent.   This rapid overhaul of the Federal footprint should concern everyone.  We are going to make our Federal vehicle fleet dependent on an EV  supply chain that is 90 percent dominated by China.   Eight of the ten largest solar equipment makers are headquartered in  China, and 10 of the 15 largest wind equipment makers are Chinese.   The fact of the matter is the implementation of the President's  executive orders undermines our national security, empowers our  enemies, and undermines our ability to have a prosperous economy.   For that reason, I am glad it has been adopted in virtually every one  of the appropriations bills that we have moved forward, and I hope that  it will be here.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, the gentleman says ``come on'' to my  assertions about the damage that this causes, but I would just say come  on with respect to the family that has to choose between fuel and food  this month because that is what is happening.   It was the Secretary of Transportation who literally said earlier  this year: The American people need to feel pain.   Now, imagine if the Secretary of Transportation, allegedly in charge  of making sure we have roads and the ability for people to move around  this country, engage in commerce, take care of their families, have a  strong economy for our national security, for our well-being, our  prosperity, imagine if that Secretary says to all of the families out  there: Oh, I am sorry. Come on. Looks at them and says: Well, too bad.  You have got to experience some pain, don't you understand.   Never mind the 1,100 coal-fired plants in China compared to our 250.  Never mind they have two a week they keep adding.   Never mind that if you eliminate the internal combustion engine, you  are not going to dent CO2 production around the world.   We are pursuing a radical agenda to the detriment of the American  people, and they know it. They feel it. They see it every single day  with the high price of gas, the high price of electricity, the increase  in the cost of their homes, and the inability to buy goods and services  that rely on that energy.   They see it every day in a world destabilized around the globe  because we are not pushing out American energy, liquefied natural gas.  We are not building nuclear power.   We are not doing all the things we could do to be significantly  energy independent here using our resources to make sure that we are  not buying into unicorn energy, undermining our national security and  our prosperity.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield the balance of my time.
