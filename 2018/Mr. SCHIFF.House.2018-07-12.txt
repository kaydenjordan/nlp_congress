 Mr. Speaker, it was almost exactly 2 years ago, as Donald  Trump closed in on the Republican nomination, that the Russians began  weaponizing stolen emails it had acquired some time earlier.   This disclosure of stolen emails was only one vector of the Russian  active measures campaign. At the same time, the Russians were engaged  in a surreptitious social media campaign and a very overt use of their  paid media platforms, like Sputnik and Russia Today, to influence the  American electorate.   What was this about? Was this new and unprecedented intervention in  our affairs merely about choosing one candidate over another in the  American Presidential system? Or was there something broader within the  Russian aims?                                time  1015    It is certainly true that the Russians had a preferred candidate in  Donald Trump. Candidate Trump had talked disparagingly about NATO. He  had talked about doing away with sanctions on Russia over its invasion  of its neighbor. He had talked about making common cause with Russia in  Syria, where our interests are not at all aligned. And most  significant, he had talked about doing away with the penalties we had  imposed for Russia's invasion of its neighbor, something we never  thought would take place in the last century, the remaking of the map  of Europe by dint of military force. That is something we thought we  would never see in this century.   It is certainly true they had a preferred candidate in Donald Trump,  for all those reasons. It is also true that they had a deep antipathy  towards Hillary Clinton, someone who, when people gathered in massive  numbers in Russia to protest fraudulent elections in 2011, spoke out on  behalf of people's right to protest and assemble, something that the  Kremlin felt was a direct threat to the regime.   But far more fundamental was the Russian object of sowing discord in  the United States, of pitting one American against another, of playing  along the fault lines in our society, of weakening the very fabric of  our democracy.   It is very important to recognize that what the Russians did here,  they did not do alone in the United States. Yes, it was new and  unprecedented for us, but what the Russians did here, they have been  doing for years elsewhere in Europe and around the world. It is an  attack not only on our democracy, but on the very idea of liberal  democracy. This attack takes place at a time in our lives where, when  you look around the world, you must conclude objectively that the  autocrats are on the rise in places like Poland and in Hungary and the  rise of the far right parties in Germany, Austria, and France, with  Erdogan in Turkey--Turkey is the now the leading jailer of journalists  in the world--and in the Philippines with Duterte.   It cannot be said that an iron curtain is descending, but there is a  rising tide of authoritarianism that threatens to submerge some of the  great capitals around the globe. For those of us who had lived in the  post-World War II generation, I think we were always under the  assumption that our freedoms around the world were ever-increasing,  that it was some immutable law of nature, that our freedom to express  ourselves, to practice our faith, to associate with whom we would, was  ever-increasing. To paraphrase Martin Luther King, the moral arc of the  universe may be long, but it bends toward justice, only to find that  today, it does not bend towards justice.   As much as the idea of America as the indispensable Nation has been  given a bad name, we truly are indispensable. All around the world  people look to us: people in prison who gathered in Tahrir Square  wanting a better government; people in the Philippines, the victims of  a campaign of mass extrajudicial killing; people in prison in Turkey  for journalism.   People all over the world look to us. They are not going to look to  Russia; they are not going to look to China; they are not going to look  to Europe, with all of its problems; and increasingly they do not  recognize what they see. They look to our White House and they do not  recognize what they see. They see a President more comfortable with  autocrats and dictators than they do with Democrats and democracy. This  is a terrible tragedy for us. It is a bigger tragedy for the rest of  the world.   In 1938, Winston Churchill published a series of speeches he gave on  the rise of Nazism. In America, the book was titled, ``While England  Slept.'' America is not sleeping, but one of its great parties is. As  John Boehner said recently, the Republican Party is off taking a nap  somewhere.   Wake up. Freedom-loving people all around the world are looking to  us. Wake up. Our democracy is at risk at home, and the very idea of  liberal democracy is at risk around the world. Wake up.                            ____________________     Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, I join the chairman in urging support for the combined  2018 and 2019 Intelligence Authorization Act, which has been named in  honor of Matthew Young Pollard, a Senate Intelligence Committee staffer  who recently passed away, leaving behind a young son and bereaved  colleagues both in the Senate and here in the House.   For well over a year now, considerable attention has been focused on  the House Intelligence Committee and the profound disagreements that we  have had about the Russia investigation. Those differences remain, and  the American people should know that my Democratic colleagues on the  Intelligence Committee and I continue the important work of  investigating Russia's interference in the 2016 Presidential election.   Despite our disagreements over Russia with the majority, however, I  have consistently and publicly maintained that the committee must seek  to cordon off our disagreements over the Russia investigation and  continue with our other work on as bipartisan a basis as possible. We  owe the tens of thousands of men and women in the intelligence  community nothing less, not only because they put themselves at  personal risk every day, but also because their work is so important to  the country that it demands the shared responsibility and oversight of  the Congress.                                time  1345    The Intelligence Committee has a history of producing bipartisan  bills even under the most difficult political circumstances.   I am pleased that our staffs have worked to reach a mutually  acceptable final text, and have been able to weed out provisions that  would have made it impossible to move forward jointly.   Much of the committee's oversight work is reflected in the bill as  classified, but we can discuss some of the 2018-2019 IAA's elements  openly, including the fact that the bill helps to better ensure that  our elections are free from interference or manipulation.   This is essential to our democracy, and the bill includes important  provisions that continue the work that we have been doing in the  committee during the course of the work on the Russia investigation,  and as a part of our normal oversight to maintain the integrity of our  election system.   The bill also provides funding to our intelligence community in order  to meet all threats from terrorism to nation-state actors. The bill  authorizes funding across a wide range of endeavors that will allow the  intelligence community and the Department of Defense to not only  respond to threats, but to preempt them.   The bill takes steps to prevent a repeat of the Russian active  measures campaign that targeted our 2016 election, by including a  minority-authored provision requiring a briefing to key congressional  leaders, including members of the intelligence community and committee,  if the United States faces a significant foreign cyber intrusion or  active measures campaign directed at a federal election.   The bill also ensures that America's technological advantage remains  a priority for our intelligence services. As such, the bill resources  and directs efforts that will promote our advantages across a range of  cutting-edge domains, from space to artificial intelligence.   It enhances transparency and allows public access to certain work of  the IC. The bill reauthorizes for 10 years the Public Interest  Declassification Board which advises the President and executive branch  agencies on the review and declassification of IC records of historical  importance.   The bill also includes minority provisions related to parental leave,  student loan repayment, and diversity and inclusiveness that are  intended to make an exceptional workforce even better.   In the end, the men and women who serve in the intelligence community  and the Defense Department are the most important factor in the success  of our national security.   There are many other provisions in the bill that will build on the  work of past years and move us further along technical and other  pathways to meet new challenges and those still on the horizon.   This bill advances our national security, reinforces the principle of  congressional oversight, and honors our values as a Nation.   Mr. Chair, I urge the support of the House, and look forward to  considering amendments that will make a good bill even better. I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, it gives me great pleasure to yield 3  minutes to the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Carson). He is the ranking  member on the Emerging Threats Subcommittee and brings a wealth of  experience in homeland security to the Congress.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Alabama (Ms. Sewell). She is the ranking member on the Department of  Defense Intelligence and Overhead Architecture Subcommittee and does a  fabulous job for our committee.    Mr. Chair, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from Alabama.    Mr. Chair, it is now my pleasure to yield 2 minutes to  the gentleman from Washington (Mr. Heck), someone who we have come to  rely on in our committee in a great many areas, but, in particular, the  threat posed by foreign actors investing in American technologies, with  an eye toward either appropriating our intellectual property, or making  use of those  [[Page H6132]]  technologies for the purpose of spying on Americans.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Ruppersberger), who is the former ranking member of the  Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence and a great stalwart for the  men and women who work within the IC.    Mr. Chairman, might I inquire of the gentleman whether he  has any further speakers?    Mr. Chairman, I will take this opportunity to close, and  I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Chairman, 1 month ago, the CIA held its annual memorial ceremony  to honor its fallen. This year, the agency added four stars to the  memorial wall, signifying four officers killed in the line of duty but  who cannot be publicly named even in death. That, Mr. Chairman, is the  sacrifice that we ask of our intelligence professionals, and it is one  that they are prepared to make.   In exchange for that fidelity, it is our job to provide the  intelligence community with the tools and authorities that it needs to  keep us safe, all while exercising our constitutional authority of  oversight and direction. This bill meets that responsibility, and I  urge its passage by the House.   I would also like to take this opportunity to thank my colleagues on  the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence and our incredible  staff. In particular, I thank Shannon Stuart, Carly Blake, Alan Souza,  Mark Stewart, Wells Bennett, Scott Glabe, Rheanne Wirkkala, Amanda  Rogers Thorpe, Thomas Eager, Kris Breaux, Christine Bocchino, Maher  Bitar, Shannon Green, Linda Cohen, Patrick Boland, and Tim Bergreen.   These staff members labor three floors below the Capitol in a space  we affectionately call--and sometimes unaffectionately call--the  bunker. They do so for long hours and without daylight. We are very  grateful to them and for their service.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, as the designee of the gentleman from  Massachusetts (Mr. Keating), I offer amendment No. 1.    Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to offer this amendment on  behalf of its author, Mr. Keating of Massachusetts, who is one of our  fine members who has great experience in public safety prior to coming  to the Congress.   This amendment builds on an initiative from Chairman Nunes to extend  tour lengths of deployed U.S. Government personnel, particularly those  who are proficient in difficult languages such as Arabic, Farsi,  Chinese, and Korean. Specifically, the amendment adds the Russian  language to that list.   In view of the continuing threat to our national security posed by  the aggressive action of the Russian Government, the U.S. Government  must fully engage its cadre of personnel proficient in the Russian  language.   I am a slow talker. I am talking even more slowly, and my colleague  has arrived. I want to thank my colleague for his work.   Mr. Chairman, I urge support of this amendment, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Keating), who is the author of the  amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I urge passage of the amendment, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman for offering this  amendment.   I am pleased to rise in support. This amendment clarifies section  1503 of the bill dealing with foreign counterintelligence and  cybersecurity threats to Federal election campaigns.   The current provision directs that, for each Federal election, the  Director of National Intelligence, the Under Secretary of Homeland  Security, and the FBI will make publicly available a report on foreign  counterintelligence and cybersecurity threats to our elections.   Section 1503 strengthens our elections by providing information to  the public about these threats by providing information about best  practices and resources which may be used to counter these threats.   Mr. Schneider's amendment adds to the publicly available report the  identification of the foreign actor, when possible. This public  attribution can be very powerful, not only in terms of protecting the  public, but also in deterring any foreign intervention in our  democratic affairs.   I want to thank my colleague again for his work, and I am happy to  support the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the amendment offered  by my friend and colleague, the gentlewoman from Texas, Congresswoman  Sheila Jackson Lee.   This amendment complements other provisions in the bill focused on  improving the security clearance process in the Intelligence Committee.  Specifically, Ms. Jackson Lee's amendment recognizes that an immediate  review may be called for when a security clearance holder is reported  to have engaged in certain violent acts against individuals, property,  or public spaces based on an association or sympathy with persons or  organizations seeking to prevent others from exercising their  constitutional rights. Such rights include those related to race,  religion, national origin, or disability.   I thank the gentlewoman for offering this amendment. I am pleased to  support it, and I urge my colleagues to do the same.    Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   It is a great pleasure to team up with the gentleman again in pursuit  of important priorities for the intelligence community and for our  committee.  [[Page H6150]]    Enhancing diversity in the intelligence community is a continuing  priority for the House and, unfortunately, remains a continuing  challenge for the IC. While there are many intelligence professionals  who are sincerely working to create a culture of inclusion, they  acknowledge that progress is slow.   Mr. Hastings' amendment, together with initiatives championed by  committee colleagues, Representatives Terri Sewell and Andre Carson,  will help ensure that the Director of National Intelligence increases  geographic outreach in IC recruitment efforts.   As coordinator of the IC, the DNI and his team are well postured to  consolidate the separate recruitment activities of each IC entity into  a comprehensive recruitment campaign that reaches every corner of our  Nation, especially underserved regions that have had little interaction  with the intelligence community.   With the DNI's leadership, smart division of labor among IC agencies,  and innovative use of virtual communications vehicles, I am confident  that a comprehensive recruitment campaign can cover the Nation more  effectively and attract a workforce that is more representative of  America.   Once again, I want to thank my colleague, Mr. Hastings, as well as my  HPSCI colleagues for their commitment to diversity, and I encourage my  colleagues to support the amendment.    Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I am  proud to support the amendment offered by Representatives Schneider,  Meadows, Torres, and Sinema.   Mr. Chair, it is imperative that our Intelligence, Armed Services,  and Foreign Affairs Committees with oversight of Iran's role in Syria  and Lebanon stay informed of proxy forces operating there and the  strategic threat posed to  [[Page H6151]]  Israel, our other allies, and our Nation's interests in the region.   Requiring that the Director of National Intelligence report on areas  such as arms transfers from Iran to Hezbollah and other militias,  weapons facilities, supply chains, and financial capabilities will help  us gain greater understanding of nuclear, biological, and chemical  weapon proliferation in the region.   I thank my colleagues for offering the amendment. I appreciate Mr.  Schneider's leadership on this issue, and I urge the House to support  it.    Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   One hundred years ago, the great influenza pandemic, often called the  Spanish flu, caused about 50 million deaths worldwide, between 3 to 6  percent of the global population, and far more than the deaths from  combat casualties in World War I. Public health officials have warned  that we are overdue for another pandemic that will likely spread even  more virulently in our globalized world.   While global health may not be a topic that leaps to mind when  thinking of the roles and missions of the intelligence community, the  IC does play a pivotal role in defending us from microscopic threats.  The IC's unique capabilities can be as valuable in combating disease as  the other threats we face.   During the Ebola crisis, NGA and other IC agencies provided  geospatial and other intelligence to health workers battling the  outbreak. Ensuring  [[Page H6152]]  that we are prepared for any potential pandemic will be essential to  saving American lives.   I wholeheartedly support the bipartisan amendment by my colleagues  from California, Virginia, and Washington, and I thank them for working  with the committee staff to refine and perfect it.    Mr. Chairman, I thank my colleague for yielding, and I  rise in support of the amendment offered by the Representatives from  New York, Rice and King.   This amendment requires that the Director of National Intelligence,  with the Department of the Treasury, submit to Congress a report on the  possible exploitation of virtual currencies by terrorist actors,  including state sponsors of terrorism.   It has long been said that if you wish to uncover the truth about  malign activity, then follow the money. This remains true with the  development and use of virtual currencies.   The IC must always remain one step ahead of our adversaries, and this  amendment will help ensure that they continue to do just that.    Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Chairman, I am proud to rise in support of the amendment offered  by my colleague from Illinois, Congressman Lipinski.   This amendment requires that the Director of National Intelligence  submit a report to Congress describing spending by Iran on military and  terrorist activities outside of the country, including spending to  support Hezbollah, Houthi rebels in Yemen, Hamas, and proxy forces  elsewhere.   The intelligence community rightly remains focused on Iran's support  for malign foreign military and terrorist activities abroad.   This amendment helps ensure that Congress has full visibility into  the judgments and assessments of the IC  [[Page H6154]]  on Iran's spending to support these groups, and for that reason I  support the amendment.
