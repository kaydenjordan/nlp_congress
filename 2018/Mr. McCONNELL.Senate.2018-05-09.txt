 Mr. President, this morning the world has learned that  Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is on his way back from North Korea with  three American prisoners after securing their release. Two were  detained last year. One had been in captivity since 2015. Following  successful discussions, all three are on their way back to the United  States with our Secretary of State.   I am hopeful that by approaching our ongoing negotiations with clear  eyes, we can build on this progress and pursue a verifiable agreement  to dismantle North Korea's nuclear arms. The United States faces a  number of threats around the world--from the ambitions of dissatisfied  powers such as Iran, China, and Russia to terrorism, cyber attacks, and  the proliferation of missiles. In every instance, we need valuable  foreign intelligence to inform policymakers and help us protect the  American people.   As we speak, our colleagues on the Intelligence Committee are hearing  from one of President Trump's nominees to help us confront these  challenges. Gina Haspel is a tremendous choice to lead the Central  Intelligence Agency. She will bring more direct, hard-earned experience  to the role of CIA Director than any leader in the Agency's history.  Ms. Haspel is eminently qualified. She is widely esteemed. She is  absolutely the right person at the right moment for this position.   First, there are her ample qualifications. Raised in a military  family, Ms. Haspel had her sights set on attending West Point until she  found out that women were not yet allowed to attend. It was the Army's  loss, but my own alma mater, the University of Louisville, was happy to  have her. With a knack for foreign languages and a drive ``to be part  of something bigger than just me,'' she joined the CIA in 1985.   As a talented clandestine operations officer, Gina Haspel took on a  variety of challenging assignments and rose through the ranks. She  earned the George H.W. Bush Award for Excellence in Counterterrorism  and eventually transferred to the CIA's Counterterrorism Center. Her  first day in that role was September 11, 2001.   After this 33-year career, Ms. Haspel will not have to wonder what  life is like for the men and women she will be leading. From  clandestine missions overseas to the headquarters at Langley, she has  lived it herself. It is not surprising that Ms. Haspel has received so  much praise from across the political spectrum, including from those  who have led the Agency before her. President Obama's former Director,  John Brennan, calls her ``an exceptionally well-respected  professional.''   President Bush's former Director, General Michael Hayden, said this:  ``Her only goal is to live out the agency's mission. . . . [S]he is a  wonderful choice.''   In a letter to our colleagues on the Intelligence Committee, a  bipartisan group of 53 former national security leaders said her  qualifications ``match or exceed those of most candidates put forward  in the Agency's 70-year history.''   So Ms. Haspel's skill set is impressive, and it is an ideal match for  the very strategic challenges that currently face our country. As  Secretary Mattis made clear in his new National Defense Strategy, our  Nation must be prepared for a new era of competition between powerful  nations. ``We'll continue to prosecute the campaign against  terrorists,'' he explained a few months ago, ``but great-power  competition . . . is now the primary focus of U.S. national security.''   Ms. Haspel is the perfect candidate to lead the Central Intelligence  Agency through both these challenges. Her lengthy and distinguished CIA  service spans both the Cold War and the Global War on Terror. As a  result, she has firsthand experience gathering foreign intelligence in  an era of great-power competition and hard-won expertise in  counterterrorism operations and analysis.   In short, her resume could hardly be better tailored for the specific  challenges that our Nation faces at this  [[Page S2558]]  very moment. As CIA Director, Gina Haspel would help defend the  homeland from terrorists and help secure America's position on the  world stage.   This excellent nominee possesses the resume, the reputation, and the  unique skill set to lead the CIA at this critical juncture. I am glad  that my colleagues on the Senate Intelligence Committee have the  opportunity to meet with her and thoroughly examine her credentials. I  look forward to voting to confirm her soon here on the Senate floor.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on another matter, this week the Senate  is in the midst of processing six--six--well qualified nominees for the  Federal bench. We have voted to invoke cloture on the nomination of  Judge Kurt Engelhardt, and today we will vote to confirm him.   Given his impressive qualifications, Judge Engelhardt's arrival on  the bench will not come a moment too soon. Lawyers have described him  as ``a wonderful judge'' with ``excellent legal ability'' who is ``very  thoughtful and analytical.'' One said: ``[H]e would be great on the  Fifth Circuit.''   After Judge Engelhardt, we will vote to advance the nomination of  Michael Brennan of Wisconsin, another nominee who has earned the ABA's  highest rating of unanimously--unanimously--``well qualified.'' Each  nominee on the slate has been vetted by the Judiciary Committee, and  each stands ready to serve as a diligent caretaker of the rule of law.  Considering and confirming judicial nominations is one of the most  important functions of the Senate. We will keep taking care of the  people's business.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on one final matter, I wish to  recognize a distinguished Kentuckian this morning: our longtime State  historian, Dr. James Klotter. At the end of this semester, Jim will  depart Georgetown College in Scott County, KY, for a well-earned  retirement. Jim is a Kentucky native who has dedicated his entire  professional life to preserving and appreciating the Commonwealth's  history. He earned his Ph.D. from the University of Kentucky and set  out to examine a wide range of topics throughout our State's history.   As an author, coauthor, or editor, Jim has completed about 20 books,  some of them with his wife and frequent collaborator Freda. He has  worked to make Kentucky history accessible to students and readers of  all ages. To quote Jim and his self-deprecating humor, ``Students can  now be sick of Klotter at any level.''   Jim's scholarship has won local, State, and even international  recognition. In 2016, the University of Kentucky Libraries honored him  with the Medallion of Intellectual Achievement. On a personal note, I  owe Jim a debt of thanks for all of his help as I prepared a series of  historical speeches focusing on U.S. Senators from Kentucky. I recently  finished the final speech in the series, and I couldn't have done it  without Jim and his endless expertise.   Although Jim will soon retire from teaching, he will continue his  research, his writing, and his service as State historian. I wish him  well and look forward to all the great work that I am confident is yet  to come.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that  notwithstanding the provisions of rule XXII, at 12 noon, on Thursday,  May 10, all time be considered expired on the Brennan nomination and  the Senate vote on confirmation with no intervening action or debate;  further, that following disposition of the Brennan nomination, the  Senate vote on cloture on Executive Calendar No. 729, the Carson  nomination; further, that the cloture vote on Executive Calendar No.  777, the Nalbandian nomination, occur at 1:45 p.m.; and that if cloture  is invoked on both nominations, debate time run concurrently. Finally,  I ask that with respect to the Brennan nomination, if confirmed, the  motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table and the  President be immediately notified of the Senate's action.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the consideration of the following nomination: Executive  Calendar No. 828; that the nomination be confirmed; that the motion to  reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table; that the  President be immediately notified of the Senate's action; that no  further motions be in order; and that any statements relating to the  nomination be printed in the Record.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  resume legislative session for a period of morning business, with  Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 10 a.m.,  Thursday, May 10; further, that following the prayer and pledge, the  morning hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved  to date, the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later  in the day, and morning business be closed. Finally, I ask that  following leader remarks, the Senate proceed to executive session and  resume consideration of the Brennan nomination under the previous  order.    Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned  under the previous order.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 6:20 p.m., adjourned until  Thursday, May 10, 2018, at 10 a.m.                            ____________________
