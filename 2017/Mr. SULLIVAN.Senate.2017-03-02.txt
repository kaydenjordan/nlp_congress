 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Blunt). Without objection, it is so  ordered.                           Tribute to Joyce McCombs     Mr. President, I have been coming to the floor for the  past several weeks to highlight my State and the great people who live  in it. As the Presiding Officer and everybody in this room and those  watching on TV probably know, Alaska is a breathtaking place. In fact,  there is no place like it in the world--mountain ranges that seem to go  on for eternity, salmon-filled waters and rivers, streams, massive  glaciers. People save up their whole lives to come to visit my State.  We welcome them. We want them all to come.   As I have also been saying, it is the people who make Alaska truly  special, the Alaskans, people throughout my State banding together to  form warm communities in cold climates. In Alaska, where the conditions  are often extreme, we depend on each other--communities do--sometimes  even for survival.   Today I would like to recognize Joyce McCombs, the director of the  community library in Delta Junction, AK, as the Alaskan of the Week. On  March 9, Joyce will be celebrating 30 years as the library director-- 30. She was also recently named by the Alaska Library Association the  Audrey P. Kolb Public Library Service Award winner and received the  Public Library Roundtable Certificate of Appreciation for her  ``significant, innovative activities'' to improve her library. That  award is named after Audrey Kolb, who is a legend in the library world  in Alaska, and Joyce has that award as well as our award.   Delta Junction, where she lives, is a beautiful community of about  1,000 residents, surrounded by 3 spectacular mountain ranges. The  community is about 150 miles from Fairbanks, in Alaska's interior. It  gets cold there in the winter. As a matter of fact, this morning in  Delta Junction, it was 26 below zero. And it is home to Fort Greely,  which is the cornerstone of our Nation's entire missile defense system,  protected by 300 brave soldiers, part of the Alaskan National Guard.   For many in Delta Junction, the library--recognized by the Library  Journal as one of the best in the State--is the place where people  converge and find warmth and community. It is open 6 days a week, and  it only closes when it gets below 40 below zero. They are tough people  in Delta Junction.   Joyce, with the support of so many in Delta Junction, including Fort  Greely, which supports the library, has made sure that this library  stays one of the best in the State and in the country. In her words,  Delta's library is the ``community living room.'' In a small town like  Delta Junction, such spaces are rare and, indeed, special. Joyce brings  all sorts of services and learning to the library, including bands,  authors, cooking classes--``what the community wants and needs,'' she  said. Sometimes those needs entail sitting someplace warm and reading a  book. Sometimes it means Skyping a spouse who might be serving overseas  in Afghanistan or Iraq or applying for a job or getting the right form  to file their tax returns. Joyce said: ``We're open 6 days a week  serving everybody from nursery schools to nursing homes.''   One Delta resident told Joyce on Facebook:         Your assistance to the literary education of now two       generations of children has been an invaluable contribution       to our community that will be paying dividends for years to       come. This statewide honor is only a larger recognition of       what we already know here in Delta--that you are a great       librarian.    After 30 years as the director of the library, Joyce still loves her  job, saying she learns something every day from her patrons. Thankfully  for all of us, she has no plans to leave.   Congratulations on your award, Joyce. Happy birthday to your  grandson, Trek. And thank you--and to the many librarians across our  State and across our Nation--for your efforts to provide a warm  learning space for all Alaskans and all Americans.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.   The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.   Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.                            ____________________
