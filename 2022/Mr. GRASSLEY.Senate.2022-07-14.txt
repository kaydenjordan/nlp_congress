 Mr. President, I am here today in the Senate to sound  the alarm about one of America's guiding principles--everybody knows  about this--the constitutional principle of civilian control of our  military, very much a cornerstone of our Republic.   This fundamental principle of self-government may have been in  jeopardy during the final days of the Trump administration, but before  I get to that, I will provide a historical context.   That principle became part of the American fabric on June 14, 1775,  when the Congress of the Continental Congress appointed George  Washington commander of the Continental Army. His commission ordered  him to report to civilian authorities.   It specified:         You--    Meaning the new General Washington--       are punctually to observe such orders and directions, from       time to time, as you shall receive from this, or a future       Congress of these United Colonies.    Well, he followed that. At the war's end, General Washington gave  this  [[Page S3300]]  principle lasting purpose, and he did it with power and grace.   On December 23, 1783, in a solemn ceremony at the statehouse in  Annapolis, George Washington voluntarily surrendered his commission, as  well as his military power, to civilian authority, the President of the  Continental Congress. The scene is memorialized in a dramatic John  Trumbull painting that is displayed in the Rotunda not far from here.  All of my colleagues go through that part of this Capitol every day and  probably don't pay a lot of attention to it, but it is an important  description of our basic constitutional principles.   We know there are other ways of doing these things in other  countries. We know that dictators rule their nations with an iron fist  because they control the sword. Washington selflessly laid down that  sword to ensure America's destiny for generations to come. He chose to  disband the Army and return to private life at Mount Vernon.   One scholar explained it this way:         The Virginian . . . went home to plow.    By this noble act, Washington cemented a crown jewel of self-rule:  civilian control of the military. Five years later, as Washington was  elected President, this bedrock principle was enshrined in our  Constitution.   While this governing rule is essential to the preservation of  democracy, it has been challenged with grave consequences. The Truman- MacArthur dispute over conducting the Korean war is a case in point.  President Truman wanted to limit the war. General MacArthur disagreed.  General MacArthur defied orders, and General MacArthur criticized his  Commander in Chief's--Truman's--decision, and he did that publicly, so  Truman fired him for insubordination.   Now I want to get to the main purpose of coming to the floor.  Recently, several books, including a book entitled ``Peril'' by Bob  Woodward and Robert Costa, suggest that the Chairman of the Joint  Chiefs of Staff, General Milley, may have trampled on this principle.  The book ``Peril'' provides an alarming account of his words and deeds.   Milley told the authors he ``was certain'' that the Commander in  Chief was ``in serious mental decline . . . and could go rogue and  order military action or the use of nuclear weapons. Milley felt no  absolute certainty the military could control or trust the President.''   So Milley, in his words, ``took any and all necessary precautions.''   ``His job,'' he said, was ``to think the unthinkable'' and, in his  words, ``pull a Schlesinger.'' To ``contain Trump,'' he had to ``inject  a second opinion.'' His opinion was then injected into the command  structure.   In doing so, he may have stepped out of his lane as the President's  principal military adviser and into the statutory chain of command  where law doesn't allow him to go because, by law, the Chairman of the  Joint Chiefs of Staff has no command authority.   When President Nixon faced a crisis over impeachment and resignation,  Secretary of Defense Schlesinger feared that he might order an  unprovoked nuclear strike. So he, Schlesinger, reportedly took extra  legal steps to prevent it. That is the same Schlesinger that Milley  referred to as he was being interviewed for this book.   It happens that ``pulling a Milley'' as opposed to a ``Schlesinger''  is a very different kettle of fish. A four-star general can't ``pull a  Schlesinger.'' Schlesinger was at the top of the chain of command, just  below the President. He kept the President's constitutional command  authority firmly in civilian hands as the Constitution requires. Milley  allegedly placed military hands--his hands--on controls that belong  exclusively to the President.   According to ``Peril,'' the book I am referring to, he summoned  senior operations officers in the Military Command Center to his  office. He had them take ``an oath'' not to ``act'' on the President's  orders without checking with him first.   These brazen words and actions, if accurate, strike at the heart of  our democracy: civilian control of the military. They turn this guiding  rule upside down and show utter contempt for the Commander in Chief.  Coming from the Nation's top general, they are dangerous and contrary  to military code 10 U.S.C. 888.   After describing Milley's actions, the book's authors rightly ask  this question: ``Was he subverting the President?'' Had he  ``overstepped his authority and taken extraordinary power for  himself?''   Milley assured this Senator in a letter to this Senator that his  actions were on the up and up. The book, however, seems to imply a  different story. I had a hearing where the general was. Senator  Blackburn asked him about the mismatch. He replied: ``I haven't read  any of the books, so I don't know.''   She said to him: ``Read them and report back to us.''   He said: ``Absolutely,'' he agreed. ``Happy to do that.''   Nine months later, he is still dodging the question with the same  lame excuse.   To crank up the pressure, I joined Senators Paul and Blackburn a few  months ago in a letter pushing for a straight answer. When none came, I  began sending handwritten notes to the general. I soon received a 10- page letter from General Milley that ignored the question. My second  note sparked an email. It claimed that our letter did not raise ``a  direct question'' and asserted ``General Milley answered the specific  questions.''   I think I can legitimately ask: Is that Pentagon baloney or what is  it?   After my third note, General Milley responded with the same old  smoke-and-mirrors routine: ``I have never read the books.''   Years of oversight have taught me this lesson: Evasive answers  usually offer revealing clues about the truth. I think General Milley  knows better. He knows the score. If those books and all attendant  press coverage of those books contained gross misrepresentations, we  would have heard about it a long time ago. He would have hammered the  authors and corrected the record. However, to date, not a peep from the  general. His silence speaks volumes.    Something doesn't smell right. As the Pentagon watchdog, when I get a  whiff of wrongdoing, I sink in my teeth and don't let go.   So Congressman   Jim Banks, a member of the House Armed Services  Committee, and I upped the ante on April 11. With 12 pointed questions,  we gave General Milley a second bite of the apple to clear the air.  Now, 2\1/2\ months later, we still have no response.   General Milley, you said you were going to answer Senator Blackburn's  question. Honor your word. Answer the question. Come clean with the  American people. We are all ears.   I yield the floor.
