 Madam President, I ask to speak under leaders' time.    Madam President, before I begin, I want to express how  glad we all are to hear that Representative Scalise is doing better.  Over the weekend, his condition changed from critical to serious. It  seems he has a ways to go, but we are all very happy to hear that the  signs are more positive and moving in the right direction.                            ____________________     Madam President, I would also like to express my  heartfelt condolences to the families of the seven U.S. Navy sailors  who were lost in the crash of the USS Fitzgerald. The loss of these  seven men in peacetime, in such a bizarre and rare accident, is nothing  short of a tragedy. I expect the Navy will conduct a thorough and full  investigation to figure out what went wrong and hold all responsible  parties accountable. For now, our prayers are with the families of the  seven sailors who lost their lives in service to this great country.                            ____________________     Madam President, on healthcare, we are only 2 weeks away  from the July 4th recess, and my friends on the other side say we are  going to vote on a healthcare bill before the break. Democrats still  have not seen the bill. The Republican Health and Human Services  Secretary has not seen the bill. The American people have not seen the  bill. I am sure many Republican Senators have not seen the bill either.  The White House spokesman could not even say if the President has seen  the bill.   This is a bill that would likely reorder one-sixth of the American  economy and have life-and-death consequences for millions of Americans.  It is being discussed in secret, with no committee hearings, no debate,  no amendments, no input from the minority. This is the most glaring  departure from normal legislative procedure that I have ever seen. My  friend the majority leader used to sing the praises of regular order  and wax poetic about the wisdom of the committee process and an open  amendment process.   Republicans criticized Democrats vehemently for passing the  Affordable Care Act with only Democratic votes, and that is after we  accepted dozens of Republican amendments during a robust hearing  process. Now that the shoe is on the other foot and Republicans are in  charge, all of those concerns and criticisms have disappeared. No  committee process, no hearings, nothing--quite the opposite of what  they called for 5 years ago. What gall.   Why are my Republican friends engaging in this farce of a legislative  process? Why are Republicans willing to engage in such blatant  hypocrisy, contradicting all of the things they have said about good  procedure in the Senate? What are they afraid of? There is only one  reason Republicans are doing this: They are ashamed of their bill. The  Republicans are writing their healthcare bill under the cover of  darkness because they are ashamed of it, plain and simple. They are  ashamed that the bill will likely cause millions to lose their  healthcare insurance. They are ashamed because it will increase costs  for older and sicker Americans--all to pass along a big, fat tax break  to the wealthiest among us, the folks who need it the least. No wonder  they do not want to show anyone the bill. They are ashamed of it.   This radical departure from normal procedure on a bill of such  consequence leaves the Senate minority little choice but to depart from  normal procedure as well. Starting this evening, Democrats will begin  objecting to all unanimous consent requests in the Senate, save for  honorary resolutions. We will seek, in as many ways as we can, as many  times as we can, to refer the House-passed healthcare bill to  committee, where it can be vetted, debated, and amended in the open for  the American people to see, as is their right.   Tonight, Democrats will hold the floor late into the evening in a  series of speeches to highlight just how unprecedented this process is.  If Republicans are not going to allow debate on their bill on the floor  or in committee, Democrats will make opportunities to debate.   These are merely the first steps we are prepared to take in order to  shine a light on the shameful TrumpCare bill and reveal to the public  the GOP's backroom deal-making.   Of course there is another way. On Friday, I sent a letter to my  friend the majority leader requesting that we hold an all-Senators  meeting in the Old Senate Chamber to discuss a bipartisan way forward  on healthcare. We should all share common goals--improving the  healthcare system by lowering costs, raising the quality of care, and  stabilizing the marketplaces. Let's sit down together, all 100 of us,  and talk about how we can achieve those results together.   That option, I say to the Republican leader, is on the table, and I  hope he will not refuse it, but if Republicans will not relent and  debate their healthcare bill in the open for the American people to  see, they should not expect business as usual in the Senate.                            ____________________     Madam President, finally, on another matter entirely, I  continue to be alarmed by the wave of criticism from the far right of  Special Counsel Robert Mueller. It seems obvious that, because Mr.  Mueller--one of the most respected and trusted men in Washington--is in  charge of investigating Russian interference in our elections and any  other issues that arise out of that investigation, the far-right,  special interest partisans have set out on a despicable campaign to  smear his character and muddy the waters of his investigation.  [[Page S3569]]    I just want to remind my colleagues and the American people that  there is no one more qualified or more trusted to do this job than  Robert Mueller. He spent almost his entire adult life in service to his  country. He is a decorated veteran of the Vietnam war and served as  U.S. attorney for 12 years. He was appointed by a Republican President,  President George Bush, to lead the FBI in 2001 and served his full 10- year term with distinction, and then he was asked to spend an  additional 2 years under President Obama. Congress had to pass a  special waiver to allow him to continue in his FBI post, and the vote  was unanimous. Every Republican--many in this Chamber--voted  unanimously to ratify Robert Mueller for another 2 years as FBI  Director. What an endorsement--a great endorsement. That vote made Mr.  Mueller the longest serving FBI Director since J. Edgar Hoover and the  only FBI Director to serve under Presidents of both parties.   Mr. Mueller represents the best of public service. He will pursue  this investigation without regard to politics or pressure of any kind,  and that is exactly what America needs.   The chorus of extreme commentators and media personalities who seek  to curry favor with the President by trying to tear down this man of  great integrity is only heaping dishonor on themselves. Worse yet, they  are trying to discredit our most important democratic institution--the  rule of law. These critics know Mr. Mueller is a straight arrow, and  many of them said as much when he was appointed, but because he is in a  position to examine the President's actions and perhaps to take action,  they are attacking his character.   This is not, my colleagues, a political game. This is a very serious  investigation about foreign interference in our elections--something  that eats at, that corrodes the roots of our democracy, the very  wellspring of our being and pride as a nation.   The man leading this investigation ought to be trusted by the  American people, and over the course of his long, distinguished career,  he has certainly earned that trust.   Again, I urge that these attacks on Mr. Mueller cease and that my  friends on the other side of the aisle join me in defending his  reputation. The critics are going much too far.   I yield the floor and ask that the Senator wait 1 minute so that I  might have a word with him.    Madam President, we have a number of us gathered here  this evening because we are so, so appalled--and that is the word--by  the process that is going on with healthcare.   The idea that we could affect one-sixth of the Nation's economy--the  life and death, literally, of millions of Americans; the whole  structure of our healthcare system, affecting doctors, nurses, and  rural hospital workers--and that we could do all of that in such  darkness, behind such closed doors is the greatest miscarriage of  legislative practice that I have seen since I have been here in the  House and Senate.   We heard our colleagues, when the ACA came up, talk about an open  process: Read the bill. My good friend the leader will say: Well, we  are going to have an amendment process. No, we are not. Unless we  change reconciliation, we will have a mere 10 hours of debate on our  side and then amendments seriatim for something as important as this?  To say that we are having regular order, to say that we are having an  amendment process, in all due respect, is a joke.   Let me go over when we were in charge to show the complete  contradiction. The Senate Finance Committee held more than 50  hearings--Democrats and Republicans.   How many hearings has the Senate Finance Committee had on this bill,  this unknown bill? None. On the House bill--they are using the House  bill, as I understand it, as a model. None.   A markup, 8 days--can we get any commitment from our friends on the  Republican side that we will have 8 days of markup in the Finance  Committee when their bill is ready? I doubt it. Some 130 amendments  were considered. Two dozen Republican amendments were agreed to--all in  the committee process.   Then, a bill went to the HELP Committee. There were 47 bipartisan  hearings, roundtables, and walkthroughs. They considered nearly 300  amendments during the 13-day markup. That was one of the longest in  history, as it should have been on such a major bill. There were 160  Republican amendments. Our ranking member on the HELP Committee  couldn't be here because of plane delays, but she will augment that  when she gets here.   The Senate Finance Committee posted its legislation online for 6 days  before the markup. I ask rhetorically of my friend the majority leader:  When his bill is ready, is it going to be posted for 6 days prior to  debate or markup? Are the American people, our doctors, our nurses, our  patients, and the cancer care groups going to get a chance to see it? I  doubt it. That is not what it seems like.   The Senate spent 25 consecutive days in session on healthcare reform.  Again, I would ask my friend the leader, rhetorically: How many days  are we going to spend on it under reconciliation?   So, my friends, this is a travesty. Ask yourself, America: Why are  our Republican colleagues rushing through a bill in the dark of night?   I will tell you why. They don't want you, Mr. and Mrs. American, to  know about this bill. They don't want you to see that it cuts  healthcare for millions. They don't want you to see that it will reduce  opioid treatment. They don't want you to see that it will hurt people  in nursing homes. They don't want you to see that millions will lose  coverage and many more will get such minimal coverage that it will not  help them unless, God forbid, they get the most serious of illnesses.  That is what they don't want you to see.  [[Page S3575]]    They are not going to get away with it because we know one thing:  Even if the Senators don't get to see the bill and even if the leader,  who is a very good political person, gets 51 votes, the American people  will then see the bill, and they will be aghast. They will wonder why  they believed President Trump's promises that costs would go down and  benefits would go up. They will wonder why they believed the promises  that he would not cut Medicaid, Medicare, or Social Security.   It is no conciliation to us, but our Republican friends--House,  Senate, White House--will reap the whirlwind. It would be better for  them--for them--to debate the bill in open process, even if they keep  all their votes, because people will learn about the bill.   When you do a bill in the dark of night, things happen that no one  knows about. There are unintended consequences that only a thorough  vetting can reveal. When you do things in the dark of night, there are  individual accommodations that are made that are going to look ugly  when they become public. So the only consolation we will have on this  side--small consolation that it is--is the political blunder that our  colleagues on the other side of the aisle are making that will not  serve them well.    I would make one more point. So why are they doing it this way? Why  are they being so irrational, hurting people, doing it in the dark of  night? One reason. We know who the paymaster is here, we know who the  motivator is--the handful of wealthy Americans who will get a huge tax  break, benefiting from taking the dollars of healthcare away from  millions of average Americans. That is what really runs the other side  of the aisle. I had hoped it wouldn't run Donald Trump. He didn't  campaign like that, but it is running him too. That is the reason and  the only reason.   We will fight hard to prevent this bill from occurring. We will use  the procedural means we have, small as they might be. We will. It is a  small consolation to us, again, that our Republican colleagues will pay  such an awful price to help their wealthy donors.   Maybe it is not too late. Maybe the leader or maybe some of his  colleagues on the other side of the aisle will say that as much as they  might disagree with the ACA, to have a process in the dark of night is  wrong.   We would welcome discussion. That is why we wrote the leader and  asked him to have a closed session in the Old Senate Chamber with  Democrats and Republicans--without the press, without anything else--to  talk to each other. Maybe he will reconsider his rejection of that.   I have a few parliamentary inquiries.   First, is the Chair aware of the number of consecutive days in  session and the number of hours the Senate considered H.R. 3590, the  Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act?    Twenty-five days of consecutive session on a bill that  was partisan in the sense that Republicans were angry with it, but we  still had the courage of our convictions to have a debate on the floor.   The second Parliamentary inquiry: Is the Chair aware that a 25- consecutive-day period of session ranks second in terms of the longest  period of consecutive session in the history of the U.S. Senate?    Again, when the shoe was on the other foot, we  Democrats, knowing we would take brickbats, knowing there would be  criticism, but for the good of the process and the good of the country,  we were willing to have debate, hearings, and amendments. Unless there  is a dramatic change or I am misreading where my colleagues on the  other side of the aisle are going, they are not going there.                    Unanimous Consent Requests--H.R. 1628    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that no motion to proceed to  Calendar No. 120, H.R. 1628, the American Health Care Act, be in order  until the bill has been the subject of a public hearing in the  Committee on Finance.    Madam President, I heard what the leader had to say. I  think anyone who has observed the reconciliation vote-arama process  knows it is not a robust amendment process. There are ways to correct  that. Certainly, we have our differences pretty much on partisan lines  between repealing ACA and amending it and making it better, but what we  ought to be doing is discussing it with one another.   So I would renew my request to the majority leader. What is the harm  in us gathering in the Old Senate Chamber, 100 Senators, Democrats and  Republicans, and maybe trying to come together? Is there any harm? I  would renew my request that he join us in that because what the  American people clamor for is some kind of bipartisan coming together.  We have different views on how that should occur.   You say: Repeal. Join us in repeal.   We think that would hurt millions of people.   We say: Make it better.   You say that the ACA is irretrievable. I don't agree. But why can't  we join together 100 strong in the Senate Chamber, no press, and just  discuss our views with one another? Maybe something bipartisan and  helpful could come out of this instead of this dark, hidden process. I  would renew my request.    I would just renew my request for one other--the leader  said no. I get it.   One more. Will we have time--more than 10 hours since this is a  complicated bill--to review the bill? Will it be available to us and  the public for more than 10 hours before we have to vote for it, since  our Republican leader has said there will be plenty of time for a  process where people can make amendments? We need time to prepare those  amendments.    Will it be more than 10 hours? That is my question.    I rest my case.
