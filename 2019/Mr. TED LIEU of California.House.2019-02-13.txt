 Mr. Chair, I thank Chairman Engel for his  leadership.   Mr. Chair, I rise in support of this resolution. I want to commend  Congressman Khanna for offering it. It is another step in years of  pressure that Congress has put on the executive branch to get us out of  this bloody war in Yemen.   In 2015, I wrote a letter to the Pentagon about what was then a  little-known war in Yemen, asking why the U.S. was involved in war  crimes committed by the Saudis in Yemen.    I previously served in Active Duty in the military. It was clear to  me that what the Saudi jets were doing in dropping bombs on innocent  civilians was a war crime.   In 2016, I introduced legislation to limit the transfer of air-to- ground munitions from the U.S. to Saudi Arabia. And then, working with  other Members such as Representatives Pocan and Welch and others, we  were able to cause the Obama administration to stop a shipment of air- to-ground munitions to Saudi Arabia.   In 2017, I worked with Representative Ted Yoho, and we helped insert  language into the NDAA requesting the administration to certify what  the heck it was doing in Yemen.   And then last August, I wrote a letter to the Pentagon inspector  general asking for an investigation of whether U.S. personnel were  aiding and abetting Saudi war crimes in Yemen.   I am very pleased that a few months later, in November of last year,  the Trump administration announced it was going to stop the U.S.  refueling of Saudi jets in Yemen.   Now we need to pass this resolution as another step in increasing the  pressure on the administration to get us out of the war in Yemen.   It is not a partisan issue. This started under Obama's watch,  continues under Trump's, and at the end of the day, war crimes and  humanitarian catastrophes are not partisan issues. Every Member of  Congress should vote for this.
