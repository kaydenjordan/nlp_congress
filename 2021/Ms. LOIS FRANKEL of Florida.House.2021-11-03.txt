 Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Ted  Deutch and my colleagues.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in solidarity with the people of Cuba who  deserve the right to stand up peacefully for freedom and basic human  rights without fear of repercussions.   This summer, as my colleagues have already described, thousands of  Cubans took to the streets peacefully to raise their voices for basics  like food, and medicine, access to the internet, for freedom and  opportunity in their country. And what was the response by their Cuban  Government? Violence and arrests and detention without due process of  hundreds of the protesters.   Here is what I think we can all agree with: the ability to speak  freely, to rise and protest our fundamental human rights that everyone  deserves, no matter where they live in the world, and that is whether  you are marching here in Washington, or in south Florida, or on the  streets of Havana. We must continue to support and stand up for those  who are standing up for fundamental freedoms. And we must condemn the  acts of violence and undue repercussions against people for exercising  these rights.   So today, by passing this important resolution, we take a stand and  we shine a spotlight on these blatant attacks on human rights in Cuba  by condemning the acts.    Mr. Speaker, I just join those in  condemning the acts of repression by the Cuban regime and call for the  immediate release of Cuban citizens arbitrarily detained. I urge my  colleagues to pass this resolution.
