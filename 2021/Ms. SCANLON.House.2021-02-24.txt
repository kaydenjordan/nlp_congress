 Mr. Speaker, as we emerge from the darkest months of the  COVID-19 pandemic and some pretty brutal weather, I rise today to offer  some good news and to celebrate a development that is bringing jobs and  economic development to my district, along with a renewed connection to  our shared heritage with the island of Ireland.   Since the founding of our country, the Philadelphia region has been  known for some of the best ports and shipyards in America. Also since  that time, our area has been home to one of the largest groups of  native Irish and their descendants in North America. Fully 20 percent  of the people in my congressional district claim Irish heritage,  including myself.   Over the years, this robust community has developed strong  relationships with Irish educational, cultural, and business  institutions, including through the Irish American Business Chamber &  Network.   Therefore, I am very proud and excited to celebrate the new weekly  shipping route between the Port of Chester in Delaware County and Cork,  Ireland, which will expand our region's leadership as an entryway to  America. In addition to bringing critical medical, pharmaceutical,  food, and raw material supplies to the East Coast, the shipping route  is supporting good-paying jobs and a long-hoped-for renaissance in  Chester's riverfront economy, which can be an economic driver for our  entire region.   I am excited to continue working with my colleagues in the Friends of  Ireland Caucus and to increase our ties with Ireland, grow our economy,  and create good-paying jobs.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I  call up House Resolution 147 and ask for its immediate consideration.

Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the  customary 30 minutes to the gentleman and my colleague from the  Commonwealth of Pennsylvania (Mr. Reschenthaler), pending which I yield  myself such time as I may consume. During consideration of this  resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members be  given 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Mr. Speaker, yesterday, the Rules Committee met and  reported a rule, House Resolution 147, providing for consideration of  H.R. 5, the Equality Act, under a closed rule. The rule provides 90  minutes of debate equally divided and controlled by the chair and  ranking member of the Committee on the Judiciary and one motion to  recommit.   The rule also provides for consideration of H.R. 803, the Protecting  America's Wilderness and Public Lands Act, under a structured rule. The  rule provides 1 hour of debate equally divided and controlled by the  chair and ranking member of the Committee on Natural Resources and  self-executes a manager's amendment from Chairman Grijalva. It also  makes in order 29 amendments, provides en bloc authority to Chairman  Grijalva, and provides one motion to recommit.   Mr. Speaker, we are here today to debate the rule for two critical  pieces of legislation, H.R. 5, the Equality Act, and H.R. 803, the  Protecting America's Wilderness and Public Lands Act.   This is a historic day for Congress and for equal rights. Over 45  years ago, Congresswoman Bella Abzug introduced the first version of  the Equality Act, a bill that will provide full legal protections to  LGBTQ people all across our country by extending the protections of the  Civil Rights Act to them and making clear that we must respect, defend,  and celebrate the dignity innate of everyone in our communities,  including--and perhaps especially--those who are perceived as different  or non-binary.   The version of the Equality Act that we consider today is the result  of years of careful legislative drafting and amends existing civil  rights laws to provide protection from discrimination based on sexual  orientation and gender identity in key areas of public life:  employment, housing, credit, education, public spaces and services,  federally funded programs, and jury service.   Additionally, the Equality Act updates the public spaces and services  covered in current law to include retail stores and services, such as  banks, legal services, and transportation. These important updates  would strengthen existing protections for everyone.   The journey to this final version of the Equality Act was led by a  dear colleague who is a historymaker in his own right, co-chair of the  LGBTQ Equality Caucus and my colleague on the Judiciary Committee,  Congressman   David Cicilline of Rhode Island. Congressman Cicilline  worked with lawyers and advocates from the left and the right,  religious groups, and a host of civil rights groups to make sure the  language of the Equality Act achieved full legal equality while  protecting existing civil rights for other marginalized groups.   The resulting bill is supported by 130 of the largest employees in  the country, our largest labor unions, and the hundreds of  organizations including, to name just a few, the Leadership Conference  on Civil and Human Rights, the NAACP, the National Women's Law Center,  the Episcopal Church, the Union for Reform Judaism, and the United  Church of Christ.   And, most importantly, it is supported by a clear and overwhelming  majority of the American people. Seventy-one percent of Americans  support this legislation, including majorities of Democrats,  Independents, and Republicans.   The clear majority of both the House and the American people  recognize that for too long LGBTQ people have faced discrimination with  no Federal legal recourse. It is beyond dispute that LGBTQ people-- especially transgender people and, even more so, transgender women of  color--face discrimination across this country.   To echo other speakers, this issue is deeply personal for me. It has  been personal since my baby sister came out to me almost 40 years ago.  For many people all across this country and across this House, that is  when this fight hits home.   It gets personal when someone whom you love says: This is who I am.   It gets personal when you know and value that person and you want to  do whatever you can to make sure that your loved one can live their  life to the fullest, free from hate and discrimination.   I am sad to say that my home, Pennsylvania, is one of the 30 States  that defies the will of its people by not having legal protections for  LGBTQ people. The idea that my sister--someone who put her life on the  line for our country when she served in our Armed Forces--could drive  across State lines and lose protections is heartbreaking.   The Equality Act ends the patchwork of State laws and creates  uniform, nationwide protections. LGBTQ people won't have to worry that  being transferred to another State by their employer or needing to move  home to take care of ailing parents will cause them to lose civil  rights protections. From sea to shining sea, LGBTQ people will have the  security and stability that comes from knowing that, if they face  discrimination, they have legal recourse.   It is also important to note what the Equality Act does not do. The  Equality Act does not impinge on religious freedom. Religious liberty  is a cornerstone value of our Constitution and our country. Religious  organizations are currently able to prefer their own members and their  version of morality in hiring for religious positions, such as  ministers and schoolteachers. The Equality Act does nothing to change  that. The Equality Act does not force anyone to perform or obtain  abortions in violation of their religious beliefs, and it does not  strip girls of their title 9 protections.   The Equality Act does clarify what has long been held: That religious  freedom laws do not create an exemption to civil rights laws.                                time  1345    Just like a person can't use a claim of religious freedom to refuse  to sell a house to an interracial couple, under the Equality Act LGBTQ  families will be protected from discrimination regardless of its  motivation.   Consider the stakes facing LGBTQ people too often all across this  country. A same-sex couple walks into a restaurant. Having hired a  babysitter to look after their young children, they are hoping to have  a relaxing night out. But, instead, when they are seated and looking at  the menu, the manager comes over and tells them that they have to  leave. They aren't welcome.   This kind of insecurity and humiliation occurs on a daily basis  across this country, and in 30 States the couple would have no legal  recourse. Often, humiliation is just the tip of the iceberg. Same-sex  couples are far more likely to be denied housing; qualified and high- performing transgender people are more likely to be fired from their  jobs; and LGBTQ young people face rejection and discrimination in  school, which can deny them an education.   These injuries compound and lead to poverty, homelessness, and  violence. The impact is felt the hardest by transgender women of color,  who confront racial discrimination, sex discrimination, and gender  identity discrimination. The intersection of these forms of  discrimination is all too often deadly.   The protections provided by the Equality Act give LGBTQ people an  equal chance at the American Dream. While discrimination and rejection  has ended the lives of too many transgender people, many are succeeding  despite discrimination.   We are talking here about the civil rights of our friends, our  family, and public servants. In Pennsylvania, Dr. Rachel Levine, a  transgender woman, served in the Governor's cabinet as Secretary for  Health, and has recently been nominated by President Biden to serve as  Assistant Health Secretary.   Mara Keisling, a Pennsylvania native, is the founder and Executive  Director of the National Center for  [[Page H604]]  Transgender Equality and a pioneer for civil rights protections.   Sarah McBride was recently sworn in as the first transgender Senator  in the State of Delaware.   And of course, Pete Buttigieg was recently sworn in as the U.S.  Secretary of Transportation, becoming the first openly gay cabinet  member to be confirmed by the Senate.   Opponents of the Equality Act keep trying to pit cisgender girls  against transgender girls, when really this legislation is about  strengthening opportunity for all girls and women. Whether it is  women's sports, single-sex colleges, or homeless services for women,  the Equality Act simply prohibits discrimination on the basis of sexual  orientation and gender identity in these areas. It doesn't undermine  these institutions or prohibit them; it simply ensures that they are  inclusive of all women and girls, including trans women and girls.   Support for this legislation is overwhelming and deserves an  overwhelmingly positive response from this body. I encourage all of my  colleagues to support the rule and underlying legislation, and further  encourage the Senate to swiftly act to pass this bill so that we can  finally provide firm, statutory protections to the LGBTQ community.   Next, Mr. Speaker, is H.R. 803, the Protecting America's Wilderness  and Public Lands Act. This is a package of public bills from the  Natural Resources Committee that will designate more than 1.5 million  acres as wilderness areas, and more than 1,200 river miles into the  National Wild and Scenic Rivers System.   The bill would also withdraw more than 1.2 million acres of public  land from new drilling and mining, ensuring that iconic landscapes like  the Grand Canyon and Colorado's Thompson Divide are permanently  protected for future generations to enjoy.   Few things in the United States are as universally cherished by  Americans as are our public lands. Our country is home to more than 111  million acres of designated wilderness, and these lands help us combat  climate change, provide for an array of ecological diversity, and offer  recreational activities to Americans young and old.   As we continue to endure the devastating effects of climate change,  providing for millions of additional acres of wilderness will allow for  these areas to continue to serve as critical ``carbon sinks'' to  capture and mitigate carbon dioxide in our atmosphere.   A similar version of this legislation passed the House last Congress,  but this version includes a critical new piece from Natural Resources  Committee Chairman Grijalva, the Grand Canyon Protection Act. This bill  would permanently ban new mining claims on approximately one million  acres of public land surrounding Grand Canyon National Park, while  helping to protect the clean water resources critical to the  livelihoods of local Tribal communities.   The Grand Canyon Protection Act was developed by Chairman Grijalva in  close consultation with all of the relevant stakeholders in his  district and serves to protect one of the most cherished places in the  United States.   You may hear my colleague from Pennsylvania argue that this bill is  nothing but a land grab, an attempt to subvert private industry. Of  course, this couldn't be farther from the truth.   Mining, like every other industry, is subject to the whim of the free  market. Historically, when the demand for these minerals has dropped,  mining companies are all too prepared to skip town without cleaning up  any of their mess.   This bill isn't about whether or not nuclear energy and its inputs  will be part of our clean energy future, but if we want to ensure that  it is, then I would recommend that we first start by supporting  effective regulations on new and existing nuclear plants and their  capabilities. The best way to ensure demand for a product is to  similarly ensure that its user won't decide it isn't worth pursuing or  is unaffordable.   The merits of nuclear energy aside, you can't deny that its use in  this country is on the downswing or, at the very least, stagnant. This  isn't due to over-regulation; it is due to under-regulation. It is due  to massive cost overruns and incompetent government oversight.   The U.S. has had only one new nuclear reactor become operational in  the last 20 years. This isn't because a mining company or two hasn't  been afforded the opportunity to desecrate our national resources, but  because the U.S. has not yet proven we can responsibly operate a  nuclear plant that, from start to finish, is safe and has the trust of  the American people.   Public lands do not belong to those only in the Congressional  district in which they are located; they belong to all of us.  Wilderness areas in the great State of Colorado belong to you and me as  much as Independence Hall belongs to a native of Colorado. We all have  a role to play in protecting these lands and seeking carveouts for  mining companies is not the right way forward.   I want to especially thank my colleague, Congresswoman Diana DeGette,  for her tireless and bipartisan work in getting this legislation to  such a great place.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Massachusetts (Mr. McGovern), the distinguished chairman of the Rules  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I would just note for the record that over  20 States already have versions of this law, the Equality Act, with  respect to participation in sports, as do the Olympics, and we have not  seen the kind of behavior that has just been suggested.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Oregon (Mr.  Blumenauer).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentleman from Oregon.    Mr. Speaker, I would just restate that this act does not  take away any of the religious freedoms that are already enshrined in  multiple laws. It does not change those laws.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, with respect to the gentlewoman's question,  with respect to the language in question, it has long been held by our  courts that the Religious Freedom Restoration Act does not apply to  civil rights laws.   The Equality Act looks to treat discrimination against LGBTQ  individuals the same way as other forms of discrimination, including  racial discrimination. So, these arguments just don't hold water.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I would just note that what we saw in Texas  this past week was a truly astonishing, unusual snowstorm with frigid  cold conditions that are not normal--as the Speaker knows--in Texas,  and that happens because of climate change.   Because we haven't done enough to protect our wilderness and to  protect our environment, we end up with extreme climate events like we  just saw, and this bill is a step toward redressing that imbalance.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from  Massachusetts (Mr. McGovern).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I would just note, as a parent, a former school board member, and  education advocate, of course, we all want what is best for our  students and what is best for our schools.   But I would also suggest that a one-size-fits-all, everybody has to  go back in person to schools does not serve anybody well.   We have seen around the country--first of all, our schools in  Pennsylvania are not closed. They are open. Some are virtual, some are  hybrid, some are in person. But each community is doing what it needs  to do in response to the conditions that are present at this time.   So I agree with my colleague on the Rules Committee that we  absolutely need to get our school districts and our State and local  governments the money they need to safely reopen schools, and we are  looking forward to doing that with our reconciliation bill on Friday.   Mr. Speaker, I just inquire whether the gentleman from Pennsylvania  is prepared to close. I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, today, we are moving forward on two pieces of  legislation whose timely consideration is long overdue. And I would  note that H.R. 5 did pass last Congress with a bipartisan majority.   So we are looking forward, at long last, to passing the Equality Act  through both Chambers and removing the burden of discrimination that  can move us closer to a country where members of the LGBTQ community  have an equal opportunity to achieve the American Dream.   The Equality Act isn't going to be the end of our long journey toward  full LGBTQ equality, but it will bring our laws into line across the  country with values that our country was founded upon.   We must continually take steps to make our country more perfect.  Acknowledging in law the challenges that actually face LGBTQ people and  taking concrete action to correct them brings us another step closer.   Mr. Speaker, we will pass the Protecting America's Wilderness and  Public Lands Act in order to ensure that the sacred lands that all  Americans share equally cannot be tarnished for the benefit of a few.   We have a long way to go in addressing the myriad problems facing  this country, but the two bills before us today are a strong and  necessary start to helping our Nation live up to its full potential.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on the rule and the previous  question.   The material previously referred to by Mr. Reschenthaler is as  follows:                     Amendment to House Resolution 147         At the end of the resolution, add the following:        Sec. 6. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution, the       House shall resolve into the Committee of the Whole House on       the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R.       682) to encourage local educational agencies to resume in-      person instruction at elementary and secondary schools, and       for other purposes. The first reading of the bill shall be       dispensed with. All points of order against consideration of       the bill are waived. General debate shall be confined to the       bill and shall not exceed one hour equally divided and       controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the       Committee on Education and Labor. After general debate the       bill shall be considered for amendment under the five-minute       rule. All points of order against provisions in the bill are       waived. When the committee rises and reports the bill back to       the House with a recommendation that the bill do pass, the       previous question shall be considered as ordered on the bill       and amendments thereto to final passage without intervening       motion except one motion to recommit. If the Committee of the       Whole rises and reports that it has come to no resolution on       the bill, then on the next legislative day the House shall,       immediately after the third daily order of business under       clause 1 of rule XIV, resolve into the Committee of the Whole       for further consideration of the bill.        Sec. 7. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H.R. 682.     Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I  move the previous question on the resolution.
