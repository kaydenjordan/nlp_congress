 Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Engel for his  leadership on this issue. I also want to recognize Ranking Member  McCaul and all my colleagues on the Foreign Affairs Committee for  working with me to ensure that we could move forward with this bill in  a bipartisan way.   All of us agree that our relationship with Saudi Arabia is important,  but we equally agree that how the Saudi Government treats its people  and the people of other countries is important.                                time  1600    We have known this for a long time, I think, but last year's murder  of Jamal Khashoggi by the Saudi Government makes it especially  important that we take meaningful action in defense of our interest and  our values.   When I was campaigning for Congress last year in New Jersey, foreign  policy issues did not come up very often, and yet the murder of Jamal  Khashoggi somehow broke through the noise. I was asked about it a lot.   I think this is because people understand that, while human rights  violations in countries like Saudi Arabia are all too common, what  happened to Khashoggi was not common. He was not killed, after all,  inside Saudi Arabia. He was a resident of the United States. And yet  the Saudi Government lured him into one of their embassies on the soil  of a NATO country, where they brutally slaughtered him.   Many governments around the world abuse their people. Very few  governments reach out beyond their borders to kidnap or kill people  living in other countries. Russia has done it; Iran has reportedly done  it.   But this kind of crime is very rare. It is profoundly in our interest  to keep it rare, and that is why it is essential that we name and hold  accountable those who are responsible for the killing of Jamal  Khashoggi.   We need to do this not because what the Saudi Government did was  wrong, but because it crossed a line that no partner of the United  States should ever be allowed to cross--not just because it showed a  lack of respect for human rights, but because it demonstrated a lack of  respect for the United States.   Let's remember that there are thousands of Jamal Khashoggis living in  America today. Men and women who have taken refuge in our country from  dictatorships around the world and who sometimes speak up about  injustices in their countries of origin.   If the Saudi Government gets away with what it did to a resident of  the United States, what is to stop China or Russia or Cuba or Iran or  North Korea or Venezuela or any other dictatorship from doing the same.   We know it is not their scruples that hold them back. The only thing  that stops them is their fear of the consequences if they do this to  somebody living in our country or to an American abroad. That is why  there have to be consequences.   Our bill ensures that there will be. It requires the Director of  National Intelligence to give us a list of everyone--without  exception--whom the intelligence community believes to be responsible  for planning, executing, or covering up this terrible crime. All on  this list will be subject to a visa ban. The sanctions can only be  lifted if the Saudi Government takes meaningful steps to reform human  rights conditions in the kingdom.   Mr. Speaker, it is clear that, while the Saudi Government has faced a  lot of rhetorical condemnation for what they did to Jamal Khashoggi, it  has not yet gotten the message. We know that the FBI has visited at  least four Saudi dissidents living in the United States since  Khashoggi's murder to warn them about the threats to their life from  Saudi Arabia, including as recently as 6 weeks ago.   The Saudis also continue to imprison American citizens without trial  or charge, despite repeated requests from the Trump administration for  their release. While I appreciate that the State Department has  sanctioned several Saudis for their involvement in Khashoggi's murder,  this action also risks sending the wrong message.   By only sanctioning the rogues, whom the Saudis themselves are  willing to throw under the bus for this crime, we risk reinforcing the  Saudi Crown Prince's lie that the murder of Khashoggi was a rogue  operation.   The relationship with Saudi Arabia is important, but it is not so  important that we have to lie for the Saudis or allow them, literally,  to get away with murder. No relationship and no individual is so  important that we need to debase ourselves in that way.   Now is the time to send the message, especially now, before Mohammad  bin Salman ascends to the Saudi throne, that this is wrong.   Now is the time to make clear that reckless behavior, whether the  murder of an American resident or the kidnapping of the Lebanese Prime  Minister or the blockade of Qatar, carries a price, that the men who  rule Saudi Arabia, who, after all, depend far more on us than we depend  on them, need to take our interests and values into account rather than  always counting on us to cover up for them.
