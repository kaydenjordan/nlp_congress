 Mr. Speaker, I stand in this Chamber today thanks to the  young people of Westchester and Rockland Counties.   When I first ran for Congress, I was joined by a small group of  young, committed volunteers. Many of them were not eligible to vote.  Many of them were 16 and 17 years old. And my goodness, did they know  more about policy and national politics than people who are four and  five times their senior.   In this country, when you are 16 and 17 years old, we charge you as  an adult in the courtroom. You are able to drive to the job we expect  you to work in order to help support your family. So I think that the  least we can do is give 16- and 17-year-olds a say in who governs them.                                time  1100     Madam Speaker, I thank the distinguished gentlewoman from  California, Karen Bass, for her leadership; as well as the  Congressional Black Caucus for always speaking truth to power.   Madam Speaker, today we take a stride towards ending racism in  policing. But this is just the beginning. We must recognize that  systemic racism extends well beyond law enforcement. Systemic racism is  the way governments have deliberately impoverished Black families, then  condition necessary medical care on our ability to pay.   It is the way we fund our public schools, a property tax-based system  that concentrates tens of billions more dollars in White communities  than in Black and Brown communities.   In America, it is the way we run our elections, purging Black voters,  especially in Southern States, from the rolls and closing the polls in  Black neighborhoods. We can't stop until we have eradicated systemic  racism in all of its forms.
