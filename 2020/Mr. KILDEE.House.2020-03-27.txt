 Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for yielding.   This is an unprecedented moment for this country, and it is important  that this Congress respond in a way consistent with this threat.   We have differences about this bill. There are things in it that many  of us don't like, but this moves us forward. This gives the American  people the support they need in order to follow the medical advice that  they are given without putting their families at risk.   It supports small businesses. It puts money in the hands of Americans  so that they can take care of their families financially while they are  taking care of their families. I support this legislation.
