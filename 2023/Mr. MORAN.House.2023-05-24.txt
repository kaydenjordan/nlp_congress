 Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Good of Virginia for  introducing H.J. Res. 45, and I thank Chairwoman Foxx for her  leadership in getting this important resolution to the floor.   Mr. Speaker, just a few statistics from my particular district in  northeast Texas: Almost 70 percent of my district does not hold a  college degree, and under this program, effectively what the President  is asking for is, that those 70 percent should subsidize the college  education of the rest of those individuals in my district.   The cost for my district is $1.55 billion. The estimated number of  constituents ineligible for student debt relief in my district is  640,000 individuals out of 767,000 individuals in east Texas.   Nearly 30 years ago when I began my post-education studies, I had to  support myself through college. My parents wanted to do that, but they  couldn't do it because of their financial status at the time, so paying  for college was a matter of personal responsibility for me.   Better stated, it was a matter of personal investment for my future.  It was an investment that I chose to make. It was an investment that I  knew I needed to make to fulfill God's call on my life.   To pay for my education, I took on a variety of jobs, including being  a server at a restaurant, running a vending route, serving as a  painter's helper, even roofing a roof in the middle of the hot Texas  sun.   There was still a gap between what college was going to cost me and  what I could earn on my own during those summer and weekend jobs that I  had. Despite my hard work, a shortfall was still there, so I picked up  college loans.   When I did so, I evaluated what I was going to have to repay in the  future. I looked at the degree programs I was studying, I looked at the  future repayment plans before me, and I knew that it was a matter of my  personal responsibility to pay back that loan that was going to benefit  me and benefit my family.   It was not a matter of me taking out those loans believing that  others would, in fact, be on the hook to pay for them. As a father of  four school-aged children, we are now going through that same process  with my older two children to determine what we are going to do about  their future. It is a decision we know we need to make and an  obligation we know we need to keep on the back side of taking out any  loans.   Unfortunately, that is a conversation a lot of families don't have in  this world before they send their kids off to school, and we need to  make sure that there is more information out there before they incur  the debt that ultimately they are going to have to repay.                                time  1315    But to saddle that repayment on the backs of others who have not  benefited from it is simply wrongheaded. Frankly, it is  unconstitutional for the executive branch to take that action without  going through the legislative branch, but that is precisely what the  President is attempting to do.   Mr. Speaker, I stand in opposition to the student loan debt  forgiveness program and in support of Mr. Good's joint resolution. I  look forward to this being on the floor.   I look forward to Americans in this country understanding that when  they take an obligation for a loan repayment, that they are going to  repay it, not others, because once we assume the obligations of every  other person in this country, the free market, capitalist society that  drives our economy is gone. We do not need to see that.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Alabama for  yielding.   Every year, Mr. Speaker, thousands of Americans lose their lives as a  result of fentanyl-related overdoses.   I rise today to bring added attention to the fentanyl crisis, a  crisis that has affected every corner of America, including the 17  counties in east Texas that I represent.   Since the introduction of this drug in our Nation almost a decade  ago, thousands of kids and teenagers have overdosed on this dangerous  substance.   Since 2020, over 3,300 Texans have lost their lives in fentanyl- related overdoses. That is 3,300 too many lives snuffed out before they  can fulfill their calling in this life.   Mr. Speaker, before coming to Congress to combat the opioid crisis in  Texas, I worked with a small group of other interested parties to help  negotiate what became known as the Texas Term Sheet, something that  established a settlement structure for opioid-related claims in the  State. It worked to ensure that State and local governments, along with  regional health districts, could work together to reach global  settlements with bad actors and then use that money specifically for  activities to combat the expanding causes and effects of opioid  addictions. Now, as a Congressman, I continue this fight.   Earlier this year, I introduced legislation that would require the  President to impose sanctions on Mexican individuals, such as cartel  members and corrupt Mexican officials who are involved with the  manufacture, distribution, and transport of illicit fentanyl. It is  past time that we hold these individuals personally accountable for  their roles in the deaths of thousands of Americans.   Today, I am proud to stand here and express my full support for the  HALT Fentanyl Act, which would classify fentanyl-related substances as  schedule I narcotics, the most serious and dangerous classification of  a drug, and establish a refined process for research on these drugs,  ensuring that companies and researchers entrusted with access to these  drugs do not abuse this access.   This is a steady and strong step in the right direction, but it is  just a small step. There is much more for this Congress to do.   While these measures do not bring back those we have lost, they are a  step, as I said, in the right direction to ensure that we do not lose  any more lives, any more young lives, any more lives of any age to  these lethal drugs.   Let us stand together in this fight. Let us work against this demon  of fentanyl.
