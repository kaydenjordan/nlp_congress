 Madam Chair, I am proud to support this bill,  and I thank Chairwoman Kaptur for her leadership.   I am especially pleased to see this bill's increased investment in  the important work of the Army Corps of Engineers to advance key water  infrastructure construction priorities.   My amendment prioritizes $30 million of that funding for critically  needed projects that improve the quality of freshwater bodies like Lake  St. Clair in my district.   To make urgent water quality improvements to Lake St. Clair, to the  Great Lakes, and to freshwater bodies across our country, we must  prioritize Federal funding for improving Macomb County's Chapaton  Retention Basin and other such sewer overflow systems that help us  protect the water sources our communities rely on every day.   I would like to point out that I am working on this with the now  director of public works in Macomb County, former Member of this body,  Candice Miller.
