 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that  notwithstanding rule XXII, the Senate proceed to executive session and  resume consideration of the Singhal nomination; further, that at 1:45  p.m., the Senate proceed to vote on the confirmations of the  nominations under the previous order.    Reserving the right to object, let me explain what is  going on here.   My colleague from Hawaii has an amendment that he would like to make  to the NDAA legislation that we passed recently. It has been described  by our Democratic colleagues as a technical correction.   Well, I have a technical correction that I would like to have  considered as well. So I think we have a good solution where we can  both get the technical corrections we would like. We have been waiting  on mine for 2 years, but the good news is that we have broad bipartisan  support for mine. Every Republican Senator supports it, and 13  Democrats are cosponsors of my legislation to make this technical  correction. If my math is right, that means 66 Senators support doing  this. There is huge bipartisan support in the House. So I would say  let's fix both problems. The fix that I have in mind is to fix a  drafting error from our tax reform bill from 2 years ago, and  specifically, it would be to restore the ability of people who make  leasehold improvements to fully expense that at the time it occurs.    That was always the intent. Nobody disputes that that was the intent,  but because of a drafting error, when someone makes a leasehold  improvement, not only are they unable to expense it in the year in  which it incurs, but they have to depreciate it over 39 years, the  exact opposite of our intention. This is a huge problem for restaurants  and retailers generally, and every one of our States has how many  retailers, how many restaurants that are adversely affected today by  this technical error, and it is having an economic impact.   This category of business investment is the only category that has  declined over the last year. It was down almost  [[Page S7187]]  4 percent in the third quarter. That is because of the adverse tax  treatment. That is not good for any of us. It is not good for the  United States. It is not good for our States. In the omnibus bill that  we just passed, we had all kinds of tax provisions--$427 billion,  actually, worth of tax provisions announced at 2 in the morning on  Tuesday, by the way.   It has things, including a resurrection of a special tax rule that  was supposed to die in 2017. We are going to send checks to people for  what they did in 2018, which will have no impact whatsoever, obviously,  on changing incentives since it is the past. We did that. We reversed a  deal that was struck in 2015 to phase out expensive renewable energy  credits. We made two changes to the tax reform of 2017, but we weren't  able to include the technical fix that 66 Senators want that would cost  zero.   What we were told by our Democratic colleagues is that, if you want  to do that, there is a price you have to pay. The price would be tens  of billions of dollars of increases in refundable tax credits. That is  checks being sent to people who don't pay taxes. Ranking Member of the  Finance Committee, Senator Wyden, said just this week: ``Democrats have  long said the Republicans need to negotiate on broader issues if they  want to fix all the mistakes in their tax giveaway.'' In other words,  there has to be a price.   Well, if I were adopting the approach of my Democratic colleagues-- and when my colleague from Hawaii comes down and makes this request--I  could say, Well, you need to come up with $50 billion worth of  Republican priorities, maybe $50 billion worth of capital gain tax  cuts, or $50 billion in reduction in some kind of mandatory spending or  something. That is what I would do if I were taking the exact same  approach that our Democratic colleagues took.   I am not going to do that. I am going to suggest that we both get  what we are after here, and the American people get the benefit. Here  is what I am going to do. I am going to modify the unanimous consent  request. The way I am going to do that is to take the bill advocated by  the Senator from Hawaii, drop it into a legislative vehicle, add the  technical fix that I and 66 Senators support--and, by the way, 297  House Members have cosponsored the companion legislation, including 145  Democrat House Members--I am going to put them together in an otherwise  empty legislative vehicle so that we can do both. When we pass it here  in the Senate by unanimous consent in just a moment, if we do, then the  House would virtually be assured of passage, since 297 House Members  have cosponsored this legislation.   Mr. President, my suggestion is we modify this unanimous consent  request so that the Senator from Hawaii gets the provision that he  wants and I get the provision that 66 Senators want.                     Unanimous Consent Request--H.R. 748    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator modify his  request so that the Senate proceed to the immediate consideration of  Calendar No. 157, H.R. 748. I further ask unanimous consent that the  Toomey amendment at the desk be considered and agreed to, the bill, as  amended, be considered read a third time and passed, and that the  motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table.    Mr. President, I am kind of shocked by what I just heard,  that I am characterized as taking a hostage. Let's just be very clear.  I am the Senator on the floor who is proposing that both Senators get  their way, that the outcome works for both sides. This is a Democratic  priority. Some Republicans support it; some don't. It is a Democratic  priority on a mistake that was made, and I am suggesting let's fix it.   Let's take the opportunity to also fix something that 66 Senators  have supported. They cosponsored it. There is even broader support-- much broader in the House where it is massive. I do not know what is  more reasonable than a very broadly bipartisan technical fix that  scores at zero and helps every single community in America and tying  that with an opportunity to do something that is a very high priority  for my colleague from Hawaii.  [[Page S7188]]    Since my colleague from Hawaii refuses to allow us both to be able to  accomplish this, I am going to have to hope that we can do it another  time, and I will object to his request.    Mr. President, on the motion to invoke cloture on the  House amendment to the Senate Amendment to H.R. 1158, the Consolidated  Appropriations Act, vote No. 427, I had intended to be recorded as  voting no.
