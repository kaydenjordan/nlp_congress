 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of the work that  we did to pass the Inflation Reduction Act, the single largest  investment in climate action in American history.   Thanks to the IRA, not only will we see expanded access to lower  energy costs, but we will also lower emissions and give our children a  better shot at an inhabitable planet. But if we are going to build all  that clean generation and connect it to all those new loads from  electric vehicles to heat pumps, we are going to have to enhance our  electric grid, and that is not going to happen without an independent,  fully staffed Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, or FERC, as they  say in the streets.   Now you all remember that last year, as we worked on what became the  Inflation Reduction Act, the White House had not acted to fill a  vacancy at FERC, and FERC was frozen into inaction. We needed a hot  FERC summer, and this Chamber--along with Megan Thee Stallion, Fergie  and Dolly Parton--delivered.   Yet now, we are on the verge of freezing again. This time, because  the Senate has failed to act to reconfirm Chairman Glick.    Just at the moment when we need to expedite transmission permitting  reform to ensure cheap, reliable energy and fix power markets, FERC is  again on the brink of being deadlocked.   So with a little help from Rihanna this time, it is my duty to once  again remind the legislative branch of our desperate need to FERC,  FERC, FERC, FERC, FERC, FERC.   Climate change is urgent. Capital markets are mobilizing in response  to the Inflation Reduction Act. There is no time to have us lurking.   To be blunt, Mr. Chair:         I do nuh like it, and you know I have dealt with it the       nicest . . . but this delay is nuh righteous . . . and now we       are in a crisis.    A deadlocked FERC would eliminate up to 80 percent of the emissions  reductions created by the IRA. We need them working now to ensure that  we can rapidly bolster interregional grid connections, shorten  interconnection queues, and reform the siting and cost allocation  processes that doom so many projects today.   Sing with me, Mr. Chairman.   We got to FERC, FERC, FERC, FERC, FERC, FERC.   You can do it. Come on.   To my colleagues in the Senate, the eyes of the Nation, and of this  Chamber are on you.         We will never, no, never neglect you. We do not hold your       past against you. But you need to get this done, done, done,       done, done, done.    Our utilities, our electricians, our consumers, and our planet  believed you when you said that failure to ensure comprehensive  permitting reform was, ``not an option.'' But now they are asking  whether you really believed that.   Did you really mean it when you said you would give them ``something  that they'd never seen''? Or are they right now when they cry that this  is just a dream of ``something that you've never been''?   It is time for the Senate to give our energy markets reasons to  believe in ``all their dreams, their adoration''.  [[Page H9693]]  They don't have ``much more patience''.   We need them to con-firm, firm, firm, firm, firm, firm.   A person who will work, work, work, work, work, work.   To ensure that we can FERC, FERC, FERC, FERC, FERC, FERC.   Mr. Speaker, ``What else I say? I am tryin', babe.''                            ____________________
