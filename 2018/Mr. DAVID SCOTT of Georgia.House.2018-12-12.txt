 Mr. Speaker, this is a great farm bill.  There is so much in it, so many great things. But in this farm bill is  perhaps the absolute best example of bipartisanship at its best, to  have Democrats and Republicans working together to give $80 million to  African American, 1890s land grant colleges and universities.   I just want to say a big thank you. I thank our Ranking Member  Peterson. And I thank Mike Conaway, who started with me on this  journey. God bless you, Mike. Thank you so much for your help.   I thank our friends over on the Senate side. I thank Senator David  Perdue, who took the reins over there and helped put the money back in.  I also thank Senator Roberts, the chairman of the Senate committee.   I thank my staffer, Ashley Smith, my legislative director who worked  night and day with me on this bill.   And I thank God Almighty. Mr. Speaker, God had His hand in this, to  pull Democrats and Republicans together, to give $80 million to badly  needed African American land grant colleges and universities. Only God  could pull this together, and we thank God for this blessing and for  touching the hearts and the souls and the spirits of all of my  colleagues who will vote for this historic bill.   I thank, also, the staff of the Senate Agriculture Committee, as well  as the House Agriculture Committee. Thank you all for the work that you  all did in this bill. I thank you for all the people in America who are  grateful for this, but especially the African American community thanks  you for opening up these opportunities for their light to shine as  well.
