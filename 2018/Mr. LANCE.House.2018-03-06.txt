 Mr. Speaker, I rise in very strong support of the RAY  BAUM'S Act, which reauthorizes the Federal Communications Commission  for the first time in 28 years.   How appropriate that this critical legislation is named for Ray Baum,  who dedicated his tremendous public service to these issues, and whom  we all admired.  [[Page H1411]]    I commend the leadership. The Energy and Commerce Committee puts more  bipartisan bills on the President's desk than any other committee here  on Capitol Hill. This is important legislation strengthening the FCC,  protecting consumers, and, most important of all, expanding the  information channels our lives and the economy need.   I am pleased that this legislation includes the Anti-Spoofing Act, a  bill I have worked on with Congresswoman Meng and Chairman Emeritus  Barton for several years. Spoofing is an insidious practice used by  scammers to call consumers using a faked phone number, often pretending  to be a bank or government agency. Millions of Americans continue to be  defrauded by con artists and scammers who perpetrate this despicable  crime. This disgraceful practice must end, and it will be ended in  large part due to this legislation. I am pleased this FCC  reauthorization enacts consumer protections like those in the Anti- Spoofing Act.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote.
