 Mr. Speaker, as Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, I  have worked long and hard to preserve the availability of fair,  affordable arbitration to consumers. Hearings before the Judiciary  Committee have demonstrated repeatedly that arbitration allows  consumers to resolve disputes quickly, fairly and at lower costs than  litigation. It also helps consumers to preserve relationships with  companies with whom they contract, by avoiding the acrimony of  litigation.   The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's Arbitration Rule threatens  to undo all of that, not to benefit consumers, but to benefit one  special interest--the plaintiffs class-action trial bar.   By prohibiting consumers and companies from contracting to arbitrate  individual matters, rather than litigate disputes through class  actions, it ensures a steady stream of class-action litigation--and  handsome class-action attorneys' fees--for the trial bar. But for  consumers, it burdens their freedom of contract, subjects them to long,  drawn-out class-action litigation, and sets up scenarios in which large  portions of any recoveries they obtain will go, not to them, but to  class-action lawyers with whom they are forced to deal.   For companies, meanwhile, the Rule threatens to force them into  choosing whether to continue to fund their arbitration programs or,  instead, to shutter those programs to preserve funds for high-dollar  class-action defense.   I urge my colleagues to vote for this resolution and against the  CFPB's special-interest, anti-consumer rule.   Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to H.J.  Res. 111, which would repeal the Arbitration Rule recently created by  the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.   The Arbitration Rule is an important victory for consumer protection,  because it prevents banks and other financial institutions from  stripping consumers of their constitutionally-guaranteed right to a day  in court.   The ``forced arbitration'' clauses that this rule addresses prevents  a consumer from filing a lawsuit against a company, and always forces  the consumer into a private and confidential arbitration process that  operates outside of the legal system.   Additionally, these clauses, which are often buried in the fine-print  of agreements and do not allow the consumer any authority to change  them, frequently prohibit class-action claims.   This means that even if there are thousands of consumers who have  been hurt by a bank or financial institution in a similar way, they  would not be able to join their complaints into one case.   By forcing each and every consumer to endure arbitration on his or  her own, outcomes for cases with the exact same complaints will vary  unjustly, because arbitration does not set legal precedent.   Mr. Speaker, these forced arbitration clauses essentially amount to a  rip-off clause.   It is clear that this rip-off clause is stacked against the consumer  and is meant to shield predatory banks, payday lenders, credit card  companies and other financial institutions from accountability when  they cheat or plunder consumers.   In April of this year, it was revealed that Wells Fargo opened as  many as 149,857 fraudulent bank accounts in my home state of Texas,  including many in Houston.  [[Page H6278]]    But the rip-off clause prevented consumers from getting justice.   The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's Arbitration Rule  rightfully aims to protect consumers from being forced to sign away  their legal rights when doing something as simple as opening a bank  account, obtaining a credit card, financing a home, or obtaining a  private student loan.   The CFPB's Arbitration Rule makes it easier for consumers to file a  lawsuit if they are harmed by a bank or financial institution, and  increases transparency in the arbitration process.   The Arbitration Rule strongly serves the public interest.   H.J. Res. 111 is only the latest in a long series of attacks that  Republicans have leveled against the Consumer Financial Protection  Bureau since its very creation in 2011.   The Bureau is a tremendous ally in the fight for consumer protection,  and it is imperative that its work be allowed to continue.   It is unconscionable that Republicans are working so hard to repeal a  rule that only serves to protect consumers from harmful and predatory  practices by the financial services industry.   I urge all of my colleagues to join me in rejecting this harmful  resolution.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for debate has expired.   Pursuant to House Resolution 468, the previous question is ordered.   The question is on the engrossment and third reading of the joint  resolution.   The joint resolution was ordered to be engrossed and read a third  time, and was read the third time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the passage of the joint  resolution.
