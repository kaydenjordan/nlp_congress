 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, today, the House oversight and reform  committee heard from a witness who, by all means, should never ever  have had to come before the Congress, Miah Cerrillo, an 11-year-old  girl who survived the shooting in Uvalde, TX.   Our House colleagues will also hear from Felix and Kimberly Rubio,  the parents of 10-year-old Lexi, who was killed in the shooting. You  can just imagine their broken hearts.   They will also hear from the only pediatrician in Uvalde available to  treat the victims on that awful, awful, awful day.   I hope every single Member of the House and Senate pays attention to  these proceedings. God knows, many in Congress need to listen to what  these witnesses have to say.   We need to listen, and Congress needs to act, because across every  neighborhood, every school, every city, every town--urban, suburban,  rural--Americans are wondering the same thing: When is Congress going  to act to stop the violence?   Now, that is precisely what we are working on right now in the  Senate. It will be hard to believe, after hearing what these witnesses  have to say, that the Senate cannot find a way to come together and act  on gun violence.   Over the past week and a half, my Democratic colleagues, led by the  efforts of Senators Murphy, Sinema, Blumenthal, Manchin, Coons,  Heinrich, and others, have been holding good faith talks with  Republicans to see if we can arrive at an agreement on gun violence  legislation.   As I have said, these bipartisan talks deserve the space they need to  produce meaningful results, and so I hope my colleagues continue to  make progress toward an effective agreement--hopefully, by the end of  the week.   The overwhelming consensus of our caucus, among the gun safety  violence prevention advocates and among the American people, is that  even if we can't get everything done, that getting something real done  is worth pursuing.   Let me repeat that. It is an overwhelming consensus in this caucus,  among the broad panoply of gun groups, gun safety groups, and among the  American people: Get something done. Get something real done, even if  it is not everything that many of us would wish for.   Given the other side's long-held refusal to do anything meaningful on  gun violence, we know how difficult this is. But that is all the more  reason for us to explore every realistic opportunity to getting  something real done.   We know we won't get everything we want. The debate for gun safety  will continue after this moment, but we have a moral obligation right  now to try and get something meaningful--something meaningful--done for  the American people in the name of those who have died.   This is not a partisan issue. Gun safety is overwhelmingly backed by  a large majority of Americans, a majority of Democrats, Republicans,  Independents. It is bipartisan because all Americans know the same  thing: We stand alone in the developed world in the number of mass  shootings that take place every year. We stand alone among the  developed nations in the world in that on any given day, another  school, another grocery store, another hospital, another concert,  another neighborhood can suddenly become a site of unimaginable  tragedy.   Americans, many for the first time, are thinking: I am going to be  shot, whether they are in a supermarket, their kids are in a school, or  anywhere else.   And we stand alone in that year after year, the plague of mass  shootings in this country has been met by inaction. When other  countries have faced these mass shootings, they have acted, and they  have acted well.   Why aren't we?   The American people are tired and angry of the same thing happening  again and again. They are tired of nothing getting done. They are tired  of the greatest country in the world being paralyzed and not acting in  a right way, mainly because people on the other side of the aisle  haven't joined us.  [[Page S2843]]    But I urge my colleagues now, let's get something done. The sooner we  act, the greater chance we have of preventing another senseless mass  shooting in America. Let's break this cycle of gun violence, and let's  end the days when parents, doctors, and children have to come to the  U.S. Capitol in order to beg their elected representatives to take  action.                            ____________________     Mr. President, now, on FOX News and January 6.   Tomorrow evening, the House Select Committee will hold its first  public hearings on the insurrection of January 6. It will be a  watershed moment for what has now been a 10-month investigation to  uncover the truth of what happened on that terrible, terrible day in  our Nation's history.   The American people need to see January 6 for what it was--a  deliberate, organized, and violent attempt to reverse a free and fair  election. It was a profane and grotesque assault upon American  democracy. Worst of all, it was part of a larger effort from the hard  right to erode our constitutional order from within.   Just a couple of days ago, someone was arrested who said he was  within 20 feet of me and was trying to get me as we left this Chamber.   These hearings will be essential viewing. They are a direct look into  the dark soul of the hard right, and every single American needs to  know the truth of what happened that day.   Every major broadcast and cable network will cover these proceedings  live--every network except one, that is: FOX News.   In one of the most cowardly journalistic decisions in modern memory,  FOX News, one of main amplifiers of the Big Lie about January 6 and  about the election, has stated they will not broadcast Thursday's  hearing.   After giving the likes of Tucker Carlson a blank check to spread  conspiracy theories and White supremacist views night after night, it  is beyond repugnant that FOX News refuses to cover the investigation  into the deadliest attack on our democracy in modern history.   It is a disgusting and treacherous decision, one that will gravely  harm our democracy, one that deliberately will conceal the truth from a  large portion of the viewing public.   Let me say it once again. FOX's decision not to air live proceedings  on January 6 is cowardly and is tantamount to hiding the truth from the  American people.   FOX News has an obligation to report the facts of the January 6  investigation so their viewers can learn the truth, especially after  FOX News was one of the main propagators of so many of the Big Lies.   Are they a real news station? They don't seem to be. I hope they  reverse this awful decision.                            ____________________     Mr. President, finally, on the PACT Act, today, the  Senate is going to adopt a motion to proceed to Honoring our PACT Act,  and my colleague from Montana, chair of our Veterans' Committee, who  has worked so hard on this, will speak about that shortly, in a moment.   The PACT Act is one of the most important veteran healthcare bills  this Chamber has considered in decades. Yesterday, the Senate invoked  cloture on the motion to proceed by a whopping 86 votes.   Three and a half million veterans--three and a half million--have  been likely exposed to toxic chemicals in the line of duty since 2001.  Over the years, these toxic exposures have led to terrible healthcare  complications that have cut too many lives short and burdened far too  many of our Nation's heroes.   Tragically, many of our Nation's veterans have been unable to access  the care they need because of outdated VA rules that dictate  eligibility for benefits. The PACT Act would fix that for some of the  biggest reforms to the VA ever.   It is a no-brainer to move forward on a bill to take care of veterans  who have been exposed to toxins in the line of duty. We cannot let  dilatory or destructive amendments stand in the way of the need of our  veterans' dire and crucial needs.   Again, last night's vote was overwhelmingly bipartisan. There is no  reason for us not to pass this important, vital, sensible bill A-S-A-P.  Every one of us in this Chamber has heard from a military servicemember  who is struggling to afford quality healthcare, and this is one of the  best steps the Senate can take to improve the lives of those who have  given their all for our country.   Veterans service organizations across the country are urging the  Senate to act, so let's get this bill passed with the same bipartisan  good will that has characterized the negotiations to date.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 5065.    Mr. President, I ask to dispense with further reading of  the amendment.    Mr. President, I enter a motion to reconsider.    Madam President, another criminal trial arising out of  the events of January 6, 2021, is scheduled to begin on June 13, 2022,  in Federal district court in the District of Columbia. The two  defendants in this case, Kevin and Hunter Seefried, are charged with  five counts: obstructing the counting by Congress of the electoral  ballots for President and Vice President; entering and remaining in a  restricted area within the United States Capitol grounds; unlawful  parading, demonstrating, and picketing; and two counts of engaging in  disorderly and disruptive conduct. Hunter Seefried is additionally  charged with destruction of government property and two counts of  engaging in physical violence.   The prosecution has requested trial testimony from Daniel Schwager,  formerly counsel to the Secretary of the Senate, related to the  obstruction count, including his knowledge and observations of the  process and constitutional and legal bases for Congress' counting of  the Electoral College votes. The prosecution is also seeking testimony  at trial, if necessary, from Nate Russell and Diego Torres, custodians  of records in the Senate Recording Studio, which operates under the  authority of the Sergeant at Arms and Doorkeeper of the Senate, to  authenticate Senate video of the proceeding that day. Senate Secretary  Berry and Senate Sergeant at Arms Gibson would like to cooperate with  these requests by providing relevant testimony in this proceeding from  Messrs. Schwager, Russell, and Torres, respectively .   In keeping with the rules and practices of the Senate, this  resolution would authorize the production of relevant testimony from  Messrs. Schwager, Russell, and Torres, with representation by the  Senate legal counsel.    Madam President, another criminal trial arising out of  the events of January 6, 2021, is scheduled to begin on June 27, 2022,  in Federal district court in the District of Columbia.

The government has requested trial testimony from Daniel Schwager,  formerly counsel to the Secretary of the Senate, related to the  obstruction count, including his knowledge and observations of the  process and constitutional and legal bases for Congress' counting of  the Electoral College votes.
