 Madam President, over the last few decades, Americans'  views on cannabis legalization have dramatically, dramatically changed.  Twenty years ago, less than a third of Americans believed that cannabis  should be made legal. Today, that share is nearly 70 percent of the  population, the highest level of support ever.   We can see this shift playing out in the States. Nearly 90 percent of  Americans live in a State that has legalized cannabis for either  medical or adult recreational use. New York legalized cannabis in 2021.  And even voters in deep-red South Dakota voted to legalize it for adult  recreational use.   Cannabis legalization has proven immensely successful at the State  level so it is time that Congress catches up with the rest of the  country.   Last year, Senators Wyden, Booker, and I released a discussion draft  of the Cannabis Administration and Opportunity Act. After receiving  more than 1,800 public comments and working with numerous Senate  committees to improve the bill, today we are introducing this historic  legislation.   I am proud to be the first majority leader ever to say that it is  time to end the Federal prohibition on cannabis, and this bill provides  the best framework for updating our cannabis laws and reversing decades  of harm inflicted by the War on Drugs.   I have had many productive conversations with my Republican and  Democratic colleagues about cannabis reform, and I look forward to  working with Members from both sides of the aisle to secure support for  this bill.   Our bill will legalize cannabis by removing it from the Controlled  Substances Act, empowering States to create their own cannabis laws  instead. It  [[Page S3582]]  will establish a robust regulatory system to protect public health and  ensure that cannabis is as safe as possible. It includes rules to  prevent impaired driving, prevent youth access, and prevent illegal  diversion. We also robustly fund a variety of research programs to make  up for lost time when it comes to cannabis research.   So important, our bill will also expunge the Federal criminal records  of people with convictions for nonviolent cannabis offenses and allow  those in Federal prison for nonviolent cannabis offenses to appeal  their sentences.   It is a tragedy--tragedy--that far too many Americans, particularly  Black and Hispanic Americans, have permanent blocks on their record,  making it nearly impossible to move forward with their lives just  because they were arrested with a little marijuana in their pocket. How  unfair and what a waste of human resources.   Our bill will also establish an Opportunity Trust Fund to reinvest in  communities that have been devastated by the War on Drugs. And it will  create opportunities for entrepreneurs and small businesses to  legitimately pursue new opportunities in the growing cannabis industry.   And, of course, underlying it all, this bill is about individual  freedom and basic fairness. The fact that cannabis remains a schedule I  controlled substance--in the same bad company of other drugs like  heroin--is not just senseless; it is deeply harmful for countless  Americans--again, almost always people of color--and it impinges on the  freedom of all of us. If this is working in all the States, why not let  people use it?   We need to change that. We need to change the lack of freedom and  fairness. We need to create opportunities for entrepreneurs to  legitimately pursue new opportunities, and comprehensive Federal  cannabis legislation is critical to reaching that goal.   I want to extend my deep appreciation to Senators Booker and Wyden as  well as all of my colleagues who have worked with us on this important  and long-overdue change. I want to thank Senators Murray and Senator  Peters and all the chairs of the more than 10 Senate committees who  worked with us over the past several years to significantly improve the  bill from the discussion draft we released last year. This bill would  not be possible without the hard work of them and their staffs.   I want to stress that this is the beginning of the legislative  process, not the end. We are going to work hard to create support for  our bill, and I hope we can make more progress toward cannabis reform  in the future. I look forward to working with Democrats and Republicans  to get something done this year.                                  H.R. 4346    Madam President, now on the chips bill, last night, I filed cloture  on a major piece of legislation that will help lower costs, boost  scientific innovation, and take direct aim at the national chips  shortage, which is hurting almost every single American.   Members of both sides know that America's chips crisis is sending  shock waves across the economy. It is endangering our national  security. According to an article by Bloomberg, China's top chipsmaker  has now likely advanced its tech by two generations, threatening U.S.  competitiveness.   To ignore the chips crisis means higher costs, squandered job  opportunities, and greater dependence on foreign chip producers.  Thankfully, the Senate is close to finally taking action.   In the long run, our bipartisan chips bill will ease semiconductor  supply chain woes, increase domestic inventory of chips, and thus help  lower costs on all sorts of products that rely on chips to work.   But because the vote earlier this week was so bipartisan, I amended  the bill to include one of the largest science packages the Senate has  considered in a long time.   As you know, I was the original author of many of the provisions in  the science section when I worked with Senator Young on the Endless  Frontier Act more than 2 years ago.   We will devote tens of billions of dollars to cultivate the next  generation of tech hubs all across the country, especially in regions  that have been overlooked. We will invest in new science jobs, and that  will keep America No. 1. It has always been America's cutting-edge lead  on innovation, in science and research, that has then created millions  and millions of good-paying jobs and kept our economy prosperous. In  the last decade, America seems to have forgotten that, and this bill  revitalizes that goal and that dream.   These scientific investments are crucial not just for innovation and  science jobs but for critical jobs that support these industries too.   I will keep working with my colleagues to get this bill done quickly.  With 64 votes in favor of moving forward earlier this week, there is no  reason to wait around.   The 21st century will be won or lost on the battleground of  technological innovation. Let me say it again because that is a crucial  sentence. The 21st century will be won or lost on the battleground of  technological innovation.   Our country now faces a moment of truth: Will American workers,  American tech, and American ingenuity shape the world over the next  hundred years in the same way we have shaped it in the last hundred? Of  course, I believe America will lead the way if this Chamber is willing  to do what is necessary for our economic and national security.                           Prescription Drug Costs    Madam President, now on prescription drugs, later today, Senate  Democrats and Republicans will meet with the Parliamentarian to start  the so-called Byrd bath on legislation to bring down the cost of  prescription drugs, cap out-of-pocket expenses, and make sure millions  of Americans do not see their premiums go up in the coming months. This  is an important step in the larger process of bringing a reconciliation  bill to the floor that can win the support of all 50 Democratic  Senators.   Ask any American on the street, and it is a guarantee that they will  agree the price of prescription medications is one of the most  frustrating and debilitating problems in our country.   It is a vicious pincer grip: On the one hand, Americans desperately  need their medicines to stay healthy, live a normal life, and stay  alive, in some cases, but on the other hand, that means many Americans  have to pay an arm and a leg at the pharmacy just to stay healthy.   Meanwhile, as Americans pay exorbitant prices for basic medications,  the Nation's largest pharmaceutical companies are feasting off record  profits because they face little accountability for jacking up prices  to consumers. This cannot continue.   Democrats are going to work in the weeks ahead on legislation that  will empower Medicare to negotiate the price of prescription drugs for  the first time ever. We will also cap out-of-pocket expenses at $2,000  a year. These changes will save Americans an incredible amount of  money, and it is one of the best things we can do to lower costs for  the American people.   Let me say again, lowering the cost of prescription drugs and capping  out-of-pocket expenses is one of the very best things we can do to  fight inflation and lower costs for the American people. So those who  talk about inflation, support this bill.   So in the coming weeks, the question before the Senate will be  simple: Who will take action in this Chamber to bring down the cost of  prescription drugs and make sure premiums don't go up in the future,  and who will defend the interests of Big Pharma that spikes the prices  of scores of crucial drugs?                                Tucker Carlson    Madam President, finally, on FOX News, earlier this week, FOX News  anchor Tucker Carlson once again used his enormous platform on prime- time television to spread the malicious, dangerous, and racist  conspiracy of ``replacement theory.'' It is far from the first time he  has done so. But in light of the recent violence in Buffalo inspired by  ``replacement theory,'' it is shocking and dangerous for Mr. Carlson to  keep propagating this message.   I am deeply disappointed--frankly, outraged--that FOX News has taken  no action to address the conduct of Mr. Carlson. It makes me sick to my  stomach to think that Mr. Carlson has been given a free pass to amplify  racist conspiracy theories to millions of Americans--theories that are  eerily similar to those cited by Buffalo's horrible shooter.  [[Page S3583]]    There is only one way to describe what Mr. Carlson is doing: He is  stoking racial resentment among his viewers with these vile and racist  conspiracy theories. I urge FOX News to compel him to stop at once.                            ____________________     Madam President, I understand that there is a bill at  the desk that is due for a second reading.
