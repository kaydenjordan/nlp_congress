 Mr. Speaker, while the President continues  to drone on about his southern border wall, a wall that he told America  Mexico would pay for--which, of course, they will not--a wall that the  Massachusetts Institute of Technology reports will cost Americans $40  billion, there is no discussion of a promised $1 trillion  infrastructure bill.   This week, a Reuters report named my hometown of Buffalo, New York,  as among the most dangerous lead hotspots in America. The lead  waterlines in places like Buffalo, New York, and Flint, Michigan, are  more than 100 years old, and they need to be replaced. Forty percent of  kids in lead hotspots could suffer from cognitive delays and other  neurological problems.   Mr. Speaker, the President needs to stop talking about an expensive  and ineffective wall and start taking action on removing the toxic  levels of lead from our Nation's drinking water systems, particularly  in places like Buffalo, New York, and Flint, Michigan.                            ____________________
