 Mr. Speaker, I thank our ranking member and our chairman.  When you consider what it takes to pass a farm bill, when you consider  how difficult the challenges are, think of the last three in total,  Chairman Peterson had to overcome two Presidential vetoes to get the  bill on the books, and I supported him.   In the 2014 farm bill, it took my friends here and me 2\1/2\ years to  get a farm bill on the books. And now, Chairman Conaway, he shouldn't  have had to go through some of the challenges that Collin and I went  through, but he did it, and he did it for the best interests of  America.   But what is a farm bill all about? Set the nuances of various  policies aside, it is to make sure that we have the safety net to  enable us, in this country, to raise the food and fiber we need at an  affordable, safe, and cost-effective rate to meet our needs and the  world's needs.                                time  1500    And what is the other part of the farm bill? It is making sure our  fellow citizens who have difficulty in overcoming their challenges have  access to enough of those calories.   Plain and simple, that is what farm bills have been about since 1933,  making sure we all eat cheap, well, and safe.   But they have gotten harder and harder because the tendency of this  body is for some folks on one side of the room to press for a  particular perspective, and other folks on the other side of the room  to press for the diametrically opposite perspective.   But ultimately, on the Agriculture Committee, under the leadership of  these fine gentlemen and their wonderful staffs and all of our  colleagues on the committee, we still do the right thing. We do policy  every 5 years that works. We do policy that meets the needs of our  fellow citizens and, for that matter, helps make sure the world has  enough to eat.   Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Mr. Ranking Member. Let's pass  this bill with the overwhelming intensity it deserves, because that is  what our neighbors back home deserve.
