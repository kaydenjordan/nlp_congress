 Madam Speaker, I rise in favor of Dreamers who call the  U.S. home. Dreamers are our neighbors, our colleagues, our classmates.  They are individuals that serve as essential workers, teachers, medical  personnel, that fully contribute to our country and make America  stronger. They pay taxes. They work. They have no criminal record. They  help us, and those are the type of individuals that we need.   Madam Speaker, my question is: Why are we afraid of a 7-year-old?    Madam Speaker, farm work is hard work. Both of my  parents, Odilia and Martin, were farmworkers. It is very hard work. It  is one of those type of jobs that is very necessary to make sure that  we bring food to the table.   I represent several areas that are rural, and my ranchers and my  farmers need an ag work program. It has to. They need it. I have always  said, if an American wants the job, let them have that job. But if they  are not going to fill that position, then we need to have a guest  worker plan, just like we did during World War II, where we did the  Bracero program. Therefore, we need to support this for our ranchers  and our farmers.   I will tell you this, it is not amnesty. What Ronald Reagan did in  1986, that was amnesty. This is not amnesty. And if you want to talk  about border security, this will help secure the border.   Let me explain. If you have people who will come into a secure system  to come work, and then they go back, then you can have Border Patrol  focus on the people who have the bad motives, the people who want to  bring in drugs, the people who want to smuggle or traffic people. So  this actually will help border security if we set this up right, like  they did in World War II.    Madam Speaker, I ask Members to support this program. It is needed by  our farmworkers. We need to do it.   Madam Speaker, I want to thank Chairwoman Zoe Lofgren and Mr. Nadler  for their work.
