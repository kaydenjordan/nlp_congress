 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the historic  grand opening of the Cincinnati Black Music Walk of Fame.   Thanks to the work of Hamilton County Commission President, Alicia  Reece, the Black Music Walk of Fame is a one-of-a-kind interactive  tourism attraction that will celebrate the untold stories and legacies  of artists from southwest Ohio, attracting families from across the  region, country, and globe.   Cincinnati is home to many transformational Black artists, from Otis  Williams to Bootsy Collins to Penny Ford. Thanks to the dedication and  tireless efforts of President Reece, these artists will forever be  honored on the banks of the Ohio River for all to see.   The Black Music Walk of Fame will inspire future generations of  artists as well as drive tourism and growth. It is my honor to  represent such talent and passion.   Madam Speaker, I congratulate President Reece and all of those who  have worked so hard to transform this vision of the Black Music Walk of  Fame into reality.                            ____________________
