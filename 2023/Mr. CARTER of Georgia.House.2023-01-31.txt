 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak in favor of H.R. 382, the Pandemic  is Over Act.   Mr. Speaker, to quote President Biden, ``the COVID-19 pandemic is  over.''   This is one of the few times I have agreed with him from this  Chamber. Now that the House is finally voting to end the public health  emergency, President Biden has suddenly decided to end it in May. It is  past time for us to act. That is why I will be voting for the Pandemic  is Over Act, and I urge my colleagues to do the same thing.   This is not just a symbolic gesture. It is critically important that  we vote to end the so-called emergency once and for all.   Mr. Speaker, this administration has maintained the emergency  declaration for 3 years. Americans have moved on from the pandemic.  Georgians in my district went back to work and back to school over 2  years ago, so why is our country still under a public health emergency?   The reason why is because it is the vehicle this administration has  used to implement mask mandates and other leftist policies. It is  nothing more than an excuse for Federal overreach that prohibits States  from making decisions for their constituents.   It is time to make it official. Let's end this COVID-19 public health  emergency and focus on reviving our economy.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Guthrie and Chairwoman Rodgers  for working together on this legislation, and I encourage my colleagues  to support this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak in favor of H.R. 497, the Freedom for  Health Care Workers Act. When President Biden, Mr. Speaker, admitted  that there is no Federal solution to COVID-19, he admitted that these  vaccine mandates are not about public health. They are about control.   Nowhere in America, especially in Georgia's First Congressional  District, should workers have to choose between a vaccine and their  job.   As a pharmacist, I trust patients to work with medical professionals  and their families to make the vaccine decision that works best for  them and their health.   Listen, Mr. Speaker, I chose to participate in the trials, in the  vaccine trials. I volunteered to do that because I trust the process.  But that was my decision, and no one else's, as it should be.   A decision to receive a vaccine is a personal one and should only be  done in consultation with a trusted healthcare professional. This  mandate has also exacerbated our healthcare worker shortages and could  cost patients' lives instead of saving them.   We need policies that empower workers to work, businessowners to  innovate, and patients to foster relationships with their healthcare  professionals, not one-size-fits-all mandates that are nothing short of  government overreach in its most tyrannical form.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Duncan and Chairman Rodgers for  working together on this legislation, and I encourage my colleagues to  support this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and  honor the life of my friend, my fellow mayor, Richard Davis.   Richard was first elected to Richmond Hill City Council in 1979. He  served there for 10 years. He then went on to be elected mayor in 1989,  and he served honorably for 31 years.   During his tenure as city councilman and mayor, the city grew at a  tremendous rate. When he first joined the city council, there were  around 1,800 people living in Richmond Hill. Today, there are almost  12,000.   Richard made invaluable contributions to his home city through his  passion for and commitment to public service. He is credited with  helping start the Great Ogeechee Seafood Festival and the building of  the J.F. Gregory Recreational Park.   Richard's name will always be synonymous with Richmond Hill, and our  district will forever be indebted to Richard for his leadership and  public service.   Our thoughts and prayers are with his family.                            ____________________
