 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me the  time.   A couple of weeks ago I stood in the Judea/Sumeria area in the West  Bank speaking with numerous out of thousands of Palestinians working in  factories, those who earn three times the salary that they would under  the Palestinian Authority. They don't want their proudly made products  boycotted. They don't want to lose their jobs. They don't want  disruptive Palestinian Authority leaders to always speak for them-- whose own area has 40 percent unemployment and no opportunity.    The Obama administration had 8 years to show their true colors. But  when they didn't get their way, they insecurely, naively, and cowardly  lashed out at our greatest and strongest ally in the Middle East.   Women, religious minorities, LGBT, and Jews would not have equal  rights, democracy, or peace in a Palestinian country. In fact, the  Palestinian Authority punishes Palestinians by death if they sell their  land to the Jewish people lawfully.   The current administration has used the United Nations to both  legitimize a profoundly flawed Iran deal and delegitimize Israel. To  think that settlements are the only thing that stands in front of peace  is dangerously naive.   I urge my colleagues to stand with the bipartisan Royce-Engel  resolution. I urge my colleagues to stand with Israel and to stand with  the Palestinians in the West Bank.
