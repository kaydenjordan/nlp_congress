 Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member for yielding  time.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to this so-called Schools  Not Shelters Act, which should be called the shutting out students act  to reflect what this cruel legislation actually does. It would punish  public schools and colleges and their students for showing humanity.   This is the second time in less than a month that the majority is  bringing legislation to the floor that discriminates against and  scapegoats vulnerable people based on their identity. It is the  continuation of a trend that, unfortunately, we have seen in this  Congress.   Republicans claim that there is a crisis in American education, but  their legislation on the floor today would deepen disparities rather  than improve public education.   I am disheartened by the continued attempts by my colleagues on the  other side of the aisle to delegitimize public schools, the only  schools that are required to serve everyone and turn no one away.   Mr. Speaker, public schools are often used as shelters. I hope this  bill does not become law, but if it did, what would public schools have  to do--check everyone for citizenship before offering shelter to those  in need?   I point out if this bill were to become law and schools lost Federal  funding because of it, that hurts students--not the people making the  decision; the students.   Title I funding, for example, is designed to help schools with high  populations of low-income students. Title II supports professional  development for educators. IDEA helps students with disabilities.  Losing any of that funding would be detrimental to students and  educators for showing humanity toward those in need. I urge my  colleagues to check their values before they vote on this.   Mr. Speaker, I came to Congress to improve public education and to  help all students succeed in school and in college and in life. I have  said repeatedly in committee hearings and in this Chamber, I am ready  to come to the table with my colleagues and work on serious solutions  to the challenges faced by students and their families.   Mr. Speaker, I know the ranking member talked about gun violence in  schools. When I was home in June, a student said to me, I only have one  more week of school, and then it means I got through the whole year  without getting shot. Mr. Speaker, that is what is on students' minds.  That is what they are concerned about.   Mr. Speaker, the so-called Schools Not Shelters Act is not a serious  solution. I urge my colleagues to reject this harmful legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I want to note that words matter. Presence in the United  States of America without proper documents is a civil offense, not a  criminal one, and I object to calling people illegal.   Mr. Speaker, again, this is not a serious solution to the challenges  facing our schools today. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the  aisle to reject this harmful legislation.                                time  1630
