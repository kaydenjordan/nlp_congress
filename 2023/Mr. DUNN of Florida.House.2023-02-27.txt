 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R.  1108, a bill to extend the FCC spectrum auction authority through May  19, 2023.   From internet connectivity to telephone services, spectrum auctions  are essential to the inner workings of the technologies that we use  daily in our lives.   The FCC's authority to use competitive bidding augments American  competitiveness by enabling our commercial providers to access the  spectrum they need to continue operating and innovating.   In less than 2 weeks, the FCC's spectrum auction authority is set to  expire. It is the duty of Congress to extend this authority, which has  never been allowed to expire to date. The expiration of FCC auction  authority would put U.S. wireless providers at a global competitive  disadvantage, leaving users across the United States in dire straits.   This bipartisan legislation provides a solution that works for  everyone, and I encourage my colleagues to vote in favor of H.R. 1108.
