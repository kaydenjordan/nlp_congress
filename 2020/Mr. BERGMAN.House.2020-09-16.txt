 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   There is no more important element of our society that the Founders  guaranteed us than safety and security. I rise today in strong support  of our Nation's law enforcement officers and join my colleagues in  strongly condemning the recent attacks on those who serve and protect  our communities.   Peaceful protests have been hijacked by malevolent radical  organizations like Antifa, while national political and media-driven  narratives have further incited violence against the very people who  patrol our streets, stop violent criminals, and keep our communities  safe. That is what the blue does.   It is imperative law enforcement have the means necessary to  investigate who and which organizations are funding, organizing, and  inciting these riots occurring in our country.   As Members of Congress, it is our sworn duty to defend our Nation  from enemies both foreign and domestic. While we must always protect  the right to peacefully protest, it is imperative that people or  entities funneling money to cause disruption and damage in peaceful  communities are held accountable for their actions.   Michigan's First District proudly stands with our law enforcement  community, and we honor the good work that so many brave men and women  do every day, keeping strong that thin blue line which defends against  chaos and anarchy threatening our society.   I fervently urge the Department of Justice and the FBI to take all  available further action to ensure that the rioters, and especially  those funneling money to them, are held accountable to the maximum  extent allowable by the law.
