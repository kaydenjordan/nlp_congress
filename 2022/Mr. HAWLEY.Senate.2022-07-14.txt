 Madam President, following my submission yesterday, I ask  unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the next part of an  investigation directed by the U.S. Central Command concerning the Abbey  Gate bombing in Afghanistan in August 2021.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:       ACTS-SCK-DO      Subject: Findings and Recommendation--Attack Against U.S.           Forces Conducting NEO at Hamid Karzai International           Airport on 26 August 2021        (5) 82nd Airborne Division and 1/82 IBCT.        (a) The 82nd Airborne and 1/82 IBCT, (as the designated       Immediate Response Force (IRF)), were notified for deployment       at the request of Gen McKenzie (exhibits 10, 13, 21). 1/82       IBCT and 2/504 Parachute Infantry Regiment (PIR) began the       flow of forces to HKIA on 15 August at 2200, and arrived with       approximately 300 personnel (exhibit 121). This force       coordinated with JTF-CR and occupied Camp Alvarado in the       northwest comer of HKIA (exhibit 121). During the period of       darkness on 16-17 August, 2/501 PIR arrived to HKIA (exhibit       123). Elements of the brigade's artillery battalion arrived       with the infantry battalion, making the total force about       1000 (exhibit 121). Shortly after their arrival, 2/504 began       securing the airfield, as civilians had breached the South       Terminal and were on the runway (exhibit 121). 2/501 were       immediately put into the line at the South Terminal when they       arrived a little over 24 hours later (exhibit 121). Both       units took up security positions on the South and West of       HKIA, and expanded to relieve Marines on the perimeter so       they could begin opening gates on 19 August (exhibits 121,       123). By 18 August, 1/82 had security responsibility for all       of the West side of HKIA. 2/501 had responsibility for       security from the perimeter at Abbey Gate westward to the       International Terminal (exhibit 123).        (b) The 82nd Airborne TAC, commanded by MG Donahue, arrived       on 18 August at approximately 1200 (exhibits 121, 125). Upon       arrival, MG Donahue conducted a leader's reconnaissance,       assessed the perimeter and gates, met with RADM Vasely to       shore up the task organization, and began initial planning       for withdrawal and JTE (exhibit 125). The 82nd started       clearing the HKIA road system to prepare for MASCAL events       and quick reaction force (QRF) movements (exhibit 125). As       part of their security task, the 82nd detained 40-50 people       each night who jumped the airfield fence (exhibit 125).       Additionally, 1/82 operated two gates and flowed in evacuees       via the South and West Gates (exhibit 121). From 19-25       August, 2/501 processed and directed convoys of evacuees the       Taliban had allowed to pass through the outer cordon at South       Gate (exhibit 121). 1/82 opened West Gate periodically to       allow precision evacuation passages of lines, which were       coordinated movements (exhibits 121, 125). During the latter       half of the NEO, South and West Gates accounted for a       significant number of daily evacuees, averaging greater than       200 daily from 24-30 August, with 1600 coming through on 26       August (exhibits 125, 143). The DoS Consular rarely worked       with 1/82 personnel at South Gate, so the convoys had to be       American citizens (AMCITs) or Lawful Permanent Residents       (LPRs) to get through (exhibit 123). Starting 19 August, MG       Donahue served as the primary coordinator with the Taliban       LNO, (TEXT REDACTED) and spoke with him on a near daily basis       (exhibit 23, 125). 1/82 IBCT subordinate unit commanders       coordinated directly with the Taliban local gate commanders       for security and to facilitate evacuee movements (exhibits       121, 123, 125).  [[Page S3305]]         (c) As part of withdrawal and JTE planning, the 82nd TAC       developed a plan for a relief in place (RIP) at the gates and       established timelines to facilitate withdrawal of the Marines       from HKIA (exhibit 125). U.S. and U.K. Forces negotiated the       timeline for closing Abbey Gate, and after changing the       timeline multiple times, eventually settled on 0900 on 27       August. While the U.S. Forces wanted to close the gate as       early as 24 August, the U.K. Forces needed more time to       finish processing their evacuees (exhibits 121, 125). On 25       August, Bravo Company, 2/501 PIR moved behind' Abbey Gate to       facilitate the RIP, however the timeline moved to the right       (exhibits 123, 124). (TEXT REDACTED) 2/501 PIR, attended a       meeting at 1600 on 26 August with the Taliban, the U.K., and       2/1 Marines to discuss the RIP and passage of lines for the       U.K. (exhibit 123). They agreed the U.K. would pass through       Abbey Gate in the early morning hours of 27 August, the       Marines would shut the gate, and Bravo Company, 2/501 PIR       would take over security of Abbey Gate (exhibit 124). Shortly       after the meeting, the attack on Abbey Gate occurred       (exhibits 66, 123, 125). (TEXT REDACTED) sent his QRF, Delta       Company, over to Abbey Gate, and dispatched his field litter       ambulances (FLAs) to assist in the casualty evacuation       (CASEVAC) (exhibit 123). Additionally, he set up his Role I       facility inside Abbey Gate to assist in treating the wounded       (exhibit 123). The Marines closed the gate immediately after       the attack and conducted the RIP with Bravo Company, 2/501       PIR at approximately 0500 on 27 August (exhibit 124). The       U.K. Forces passed through Abbey Gate at approximately 0700       on 27 August (exhibits 124, 127). Bravo Company maintained       security at Abbey Gate until their departure from HKIA at       approximately 2355 on 30 August.        (d) As part of JTE execution, 82nd Airborne took       responsibility for demilitarization efforts at HKIA (exhibits       125, 156, 157, 158, 159, 160, 161, 162). Millions of rounds       of ammunition, weapons, numerous military vehicles and       aircraft, and U.S. Government property had to be destroyed or       rendered inoperable (exhibit 125). The 82nd Airborne assigned       zones of responsibility to the various units occupying HKIA       to ensure they executed a methodical demilitarization plan       and no information or equipment was missed (exhibits 125,       156, 157, 158, 159, 160, 161, 162). Cyber element subject       matter experts ensured computer systems were corrupted or       destroyed, and engineers dug trenches to cover equipment with       cement and bury it before departure from HKIA (exhibits 125,       156, 157, 158, 159, 160, 161, 162).        (e) The 82nd Airborne departed HKIA and completed the JTE       at approximately 0002 local on 31 August (exhibit 246).        (6) 24th Marine Expeditionary Unit.        (a) The 24th MEU was a II Marine Expeditionary Force (MEF)/      Camp Lejeune based unit, aligned to U.S. European Command       (EUCOM) for the first half of their deployment (exhibits 100,       102). In June 2021, the Secretary of Defense Orders Book       realigned the MEU to CENTCOM in anticipation of a NEO       (exhibits 100, 102). Throughout May and June, the MEU       conducted NEO planning with JTF-CR, and executed a PDSS to       HKIA in July (exhibits 100, 102). The MEU postured Marines       ashore at Ahmed al-Jaber Air Base, Kuwait (Al-Jaber) in July       to prepare for the potential NEO (exhibits 100, 102).       Preparation included multiple rehearsals for a NEO, ECC       operations, airfield security, and gate operations (exhibits       100, 101). These rehearsals continued throughout July, into       August, until the MEU received notification they would deploy       to HKIA on 13 August (exhibits 100, 101, 102).        (b) The MEU originally planned to frontload its ECC forces       for deployment, but the dynamic situation at HKIA forced the       MEU to prioritize 1/8 Marines to ensure they had the       necessary combat power on the ground (exhibit 102). On 14       August at approximately 0200, one rifle company from 1/8       Marines, a 1/8 Marines HQ element, to include 1/8 Battalion       (TEXT REDACTED) and one logistics company from CLB-24 (CLB       from 24th MEU) arrived at HKIA (exhibit 102). The size of the       force on the ground increased with the arrival of two more       rifle companies, 1/8 Marines battalion enablers (snipers,       engineered, scouts), and some MEU CE personnel, to include       the MEU (TEXT REDACTED) that evening (exhibit 102). The 1/      8 Marines elements secured North Gate and sought to begin       processing evacuees through the ECG, but civilians came       through the South Terminal area and flooded the runway       (exhibits 102, 104). This MEU force rebuffed the breach of       the airfield on the night of 15 August and throughout the       day of 16 August (exhibits 15, 18, 100, 102, 104): Echo       Company, 2/1 Marines reinforced 1/8 early in the morning       of 16 August, and after they forced the crowds off the       runway, another breach occurred at a new opening in the       southern perimeter (exhibit 104). The Marines spent all of       16 August controlling crowds and clearing runways as more       forces, specifically Taliban and NSU, became available       (exhibit 104).        (c) On 17 August, 1/8 Marines began establishing security       at the North and East Gates and attempted to begin processing       evacuees (exhibit 104). North and East Gates had       approximately 3000-5000 people outside at any given time       starting on 17 August (exhibit 102). JTF-CR maintained TACON       of the MEU throughout the NEO, even after the change to       COMREL on 17 August (exhibits 10, 11). 24th MEU retained       TACON of 1/8 Marines, but only nominally had TACON of 2/1       Marines, whose Battalion Commander reported directly to the       JTF-CR Commander (exhibit 53, 77, 100).        (d) From 17 August until departure on 30 August, 24th MEU       managed tactical execution of the NEO, which primarily       included security and initial screening at North, East, and       Abbey Gates and processing evacuees at the ECC (exhibits 100,       104). 1/8 received nearly all of its combat power by the end       of 18 August (exhibit 104). CLB-24 established the ECC at the       PAX Terminal in North HKIA and was processing evacuees as       early as 15 August (exhibit 101). During the NEO, CLB-24       Marines also conducted various support activities to resupply       the gates, and assisted with base life support operations       (exhibit 101). CLB-24 planned for contractors, to continue       providing base support throughout the NEO, but many       contractors departed early on, forcing the CLB to absorb       those support responsibilities, in addition to operating the       ECC (exhibit 101). The SPMAGTF's Combat Logistics Detachment       assisted CLB-24 with providing combat service support to       units at HKIA (exhibit 101).        (e) BLT 1/8 Marines assumed responsibility for security of       North and East Gates, and the perimeter around the East side       of HKIA after the 82nd Airborne arrived (exhibit 104, 155).       Gate operations for North and East Gates were difficult and       sporadic (exhibits 100, 102, 104). North Gate was vulnerable       to attack due to a lack of standoff, an absence of obstacles       or barriers, and proximity to civilian roads (exhibits 100,       102, 104). North Gate quickly became the hardest gate to       control (exhibit 100). East Gate was a single gate, which was       always at risk of being forced open by the crowd, because       there was no standoff (exhibits 100, 102, 104). Marines at       East Gate dealt with crowds crushing people against the       perimeter wall, making it difficult to open the gate (exhibit       102). The Taliban provided support at both North and East       Gates, but the Taliban commander at North Gate was the least       helpful (exhibits 125, 146). North, East, and Abbey Gates       closed from 20-22 August due to a lack of flights and       capacity within HKIA. In total, there were 18000 evacuees       waiting to fly out, which created a humanitarian and security       problem (exhibits 102, 104). The JTF-CR Commander closed       North Gate from 23-25 August, except for some targeted       entries, because of the VBIED threat (exhibits 100, 102).       East Gate closed permanently on 24 August because of the       threat of mortars from the Taliban, and an inability to       process evacuees without losing control of the gate (exhibits       100, 102, 104). By 25 August, Abbey Gate was the only gate       operating in the MEU's sector of HKIA (exhibit 102).        (f) Aside from 1/8 Marines' rifle companies, additional MEU       elements supported gate operations. BLT 1/8's (TEXT REDACTED)       tasked his engineer platoon to support North, East, and Abbey       Gates (exhibits 103, 104). The engineers spent a       disproportionate amount of time improving East Gate, shoring       up gaps in the perimeter to prevent fence jumpers, and       removing towers on the exterior of the perimeter (exhibit       103). The engineers emplaced shipping containers to form the       obstacle at the southern end of Abbey Gate, later known as       the Chevron, on the morning of 20 August (exhibit 103).       Otherwise, support to Abbey Gate was limited (exhibit 103).       CLB-24 provided the bulk of the personnel assigned to the       Female Search Team (FST), and tasked them to support the       gates and the ECC (exhibit 101). The FST began with searching       women and children prior to DoS screening, then transitioned       to conducting initial searches outside the gates, escorting       rejected females out through the gates, and helping identify       eligible evacuees in the crowds (exhibit 107). The MEU       Commander re-task organized the 2nd Reconnaissance (Recon)       element to work directly for him later in the NEO,       specifically to conduct targeted recovery of privileged       personnel (exhibit 108). Recon element personnel were at the       gates constantly, working with 1/8 and 2/1 Marine leaders to       identify and pull specific people from the crowd for       processing (exhibit 108). The MEU also organized PSYOP and       cyber assets under the direction of the MEU (TEXT REDACTED)       for employment at the gates (exhibit 105). The PSYOP teams       employed capabilities at the gates to communicate with the       crowds, and provided updates on required documents or gate       closures (exhibit 105).        (g) On 26 August, all the gates in the MEU sector of HKIA       were closed, with the exception of Abbey Gate and occasional       targeted recoveries at North Gate (exhibits 102, 104). The       IED threat was well known across the MEU, but threats lacked       specifics on times and locations (exhibits 100, 102, 104,       105, 106, 107). MEU leadership ensured electronic       countermeasures (ECM) were active at the gates, dispersion of       personnel was enforced to the greatest extent possible,       snipers were in overwatch, PSYOP personnel communicated the       threat to the crowd and asked people to leave, and medical       assets were repositioned (exhibit 100). At the time of the       blast, only the PSYOP, FST, and Recon elements of the MEU       were at Abbey Gate (exhibits 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105,       106, 107, 108). The paragraphs below detail the actions of       these personnel. The MEU JOC immediately put additional       intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) assets       over Abbey Gate, scanning for additional threats (exhibit       102). Post-blast, 1/8 Marines shifted security elements to       Abbey Gate to help fill gaps, and provided numerous vehicles       for CASEVAC, assisting in movement to the HKIA Role 11-E.       CLB-24 also provided numerous CASEVAC vehicles to support the       MASCAL (exhibit 101).  [[Page S3306]]         (h) On 27 August, all gates were essentially shut in the       MEU sector and 1/82 IBCT secured Abbey Gate (exhibits 53, 56,       57, 100, 102, 104). CLB-24 continued to operate the ECC until       30 August, processing evacuees until two hours before their       departure from HKIA. The MEU retrograded back to Kuwait       primarily on 29-30 August, with the last elements departing       at approximately 1000 on 30 August (exhibit 100).        (7) Special Purpose Marine Air Ground Task Force, Ground       Combat Element (GCE), 2/1 Marines.        (a) 2/1 Marines were the GCE for the CENTCOM SPMAGTF,       located primarily in Camps across Kuwait and Prince Sultan       Airbase (PSAB) in Saudi Arabia (exhibit 53). In July 2021,       the SPMAGTF received notice it would potentially participate       in NEO in Afghanistan (exhibit 53). The SPMAGTF initially       task organized a ``NEO Light'' package, consisting of       elements of Combat Logistics Detachment (CLD) and the crisis       response company (Echo Company, 2/1) (exhibits 53, 54, 55).       The ``Light'' package elements executed two mission       rehearsals testing their ECC and gate operations, prior to       deployment to HKIA (exhibits 53, 54, 55). In August, the       SPMAGTF would task organize and deploy a ``Heavy'' package,       that included the rest of 2/1 Marines' rifle companies       (exhibits 53, 54, 55).        (b) 2/1 first arrived to HKIA at approximately 0100-0200 on       16 August (exhibits 53, 54, 55, 56, 57). The first flight       included the Battalion HQ, Echo Company leadership, and one       platoon from Echo Company (exhibits 54, 56). Upon arrival,       the unit found the airfield breached by civilians, who were       moving onto the runways (exhibits 54, 56). The Battalion       (TEXT REDACTED) immediately tasked Echo Company to assist       with clearing the runway, in hopes of resuming flight       operations (exhibit 54). Over the next 24 hours, Echo Company       was part of the line holding the southern perimeter with 3/10       IBCT, 1/82 IBCT, and 1/8 Marines (exhibit 56). There were       several breaches of the perimeter and crowds gained access to       the runway, attempted to board C-17s, and pushed towards the       North HKIA compounds (exhibits 56, 76). Forces pushed the       crowds back after NSU units joined the line, and the crowds       recognized there were no more flights to board (exhibits 56,       76). 2/1 Marines, specifically Echo Company, were part of the       security perimeter at HKIA from approximately 0600 on 16       August until 19 August, when they were relieved by units from       1/82 IBCT (exhibit 53).        (c) Force flow over the next two days brought in parts of       the 2/1 Battalion HQ, Fox Company (-), Golf Company, Weapons       Company, Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) teams, the Shock       Trauma Platoon (STP), and finally the remainder of Echo       Company (exhibits 56, 76, 65, 66). These units focused on       securing the southern perimeter from the Domestic Terminal to       Abbey Gate from 17-19 August (exhibit 76). Once 1/82's relief       of the perimeter began, Golf Company, Fox Company (-),       Combined Anti-Armor Team (CAAT) platoons, and Battalion       Snipers moved to Abbey Gate (exhibits 53, 76, 77, 81, 83,       89). U.K.'s 2 PARA were at the outer Abbey Gate, as well as       Air Force Pararescue (PJ) personnel and small partner nation       elements (exhibits 53, 76, 77, 89). After initially planning;       to push from Abbey Gate to Camp Sullivan, 2/1 Marines opted       not to execute due to the size of the crowds and lack of       Taliban support to extend the perimeter (exhibits 53, 76,       81). Instead, (TEXT REDACTED) tasked the battalion to open       the outer gate to begin processing evacuees (exhibits 53, 76,       81, 89). Opening the gate required an entire platoon,       sometimes reinforced, to keep the crowds from breaching the       outer gate and accessing the Abbey Gate's inner corridor       (exhibits 53, 76, 77, 81, 89). 2/1 Marines processed       approximately 750 evacuees through Abbey Gate on 19 August,       but only after tremendous effort to hold the gate (exhibits       53, 76, 77, 81, 89).        (d) In order to enable safe and efficient gate operations,       (TEXT REDACTED) Golf Company, 2/1 (TEXT REDACTED) decided to       push the crowds back to an area beyond the Barron Hotel       egress lane. This would ensure U.K. Forces had better access       to the gate from their evacuee staging area (exhibits 53, 77,       89). In the early morning hours of 20 August, platoons from       Golf and Fox Companies opened the outer gate, and       methodically forced the smaller crowd back nearly 200 meters       (exhibits 53, 76, 77, 81, 89). (TEXT REDACTED) coordinated       with U.K. Forces and MEU Engineers to emplace six shipping       containers in the main south to north roadway leading to       Abbey Gate to form a disrupting obstacle and aid in crowd       control (exhibits 53, 76, 77, 81, 88, 89). The Taliban agreed       to provide outer security beyond the containers, and the U.K.       Forces and 2/1 provided security inside the containers,       guarding the Barron Hotel egress route and canal areas       (exhibits 53, 76, 77, 81, 88, 89). The containers became       known as the ``Chevron' (exhibits 18, 21, 53, 76, 77, 81, 88,       89). The emplacement of the Chevron on 20 August established       the structural layout of Abbey Gate for the duration of the       NEO, as depicted in enclosures 12 and 13.                            ____________________
