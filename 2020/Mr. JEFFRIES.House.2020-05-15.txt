 Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished chair for her  leadership.   More than 80,000 Americans dead, 35 million unemployed, the economy  in recession--there is pain; there is suffering; and there is death  throughout the land. Congress must act to provide relief to the  American people.   We must support our State and local governments. We must strengthen  unemployment insurance. We must provide an additional round of direct  stimulus payments to everyday Americans. We must provide hazard pay to  our heroes and our essential workers. We must increase access to  testing, tracing, and treatment.   There is pain; there is suffering; and there is death throughout the  land. Congress must act with the fierce urgency of now--not tomorrow,  not next week, not next month, now. Vote ``yes'' on the HEROES Act.
