 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the patriotism of  West Lutheran High School in Plymouth, Minnesota, and their annual  Veterans Day celebration.   Every day, the students at West Lutheran recite the Pledge of  Allegiance, even when they did not have enough flags for their  classrooms. So the senior American Government class raised $1,200 to  purchase flags that will honor their alumni who have answered the call  to serve in uniform.   The West Lutheran Veterans Day ceremony is now a central part of life  in the Plymouth community, and every year they recognize contributions  and sacrifices made by those in uniform. This year, veterans will be  treated to breakfast, the music of the West Lutheran band, and remarks  by Tom Warren, Sr., a veteran of the U.S. Army and Operation Desert  Storm.   So, Mr. Speaker, I commend the West Lutheran community for keeping  this tradition alive, and I also thank our veterans for the selfless  acts of courage that keep our country safe.                            ____________________
