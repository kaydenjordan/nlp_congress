 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding and for  supporting my proposal to require the FAA to reassess the North Shore  helicopter route and address the noise impact on affected communities,  improve altitude enforcement, and consider alternative routes,  including an all-water route over the Atlantic Ocean.   The FAA will be required to hold a public hearing on the North Shore  route in impacted communities and open a public comment period, both of  which the FAA has refused to do while renewing the route without  consulting the public.   Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge a ``yes'' vote.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to urge passage of my bill, H.R. 6737, the  Protect Affordable Mortgages for Veterans Act, which is bipartisan  legislation that passed the committee with a unanimous vote of 49-0.   This legislation would provide a technical fix so that recently  issued loans refinanced by the Department of Veterans Affairs can  remain eligible for the secondary market.   This fix is essential to prevent a liquidity crisis in the veterans  home loan market and ensure that the brave men and women who have  served our Nation in uniform have access to affordable mortgages.   Through passage of this bill, we can ensure that VA home loans are  not adversely impacted by issues in the veterans mortgage market  created by the unintended consequences of S. 2155.   The Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act,  S. 2155, contained some very important bipartisan reforms to protect  veterans from predatory lending and deceptive marketing. These  provisions of S. 2155 are now the law of the land and essential to  protect the VA home market. But unclear timelines laid out in the  legislation and the way the Government National Mortgage Association,  also known as Ginnie Mae, chose to implement the requirements of the  new law have left an estimated 2,500 or more VA home loans boxed out of  the secondary market.   These mortgages are now considered orphan loans, because they are no  longer eligible for Ginnie Mae securitization, even though they met all  Federal requirements and are backed by the VA.   My bill would prevent a government-triggered liquidity crisis in the  VA mortgage market by fixing this problem and restoring eligibility for  these orphan loans.   Addressing this ensures that veteran homeowners or prospective home  buyers who have earned access to the VA home loan program through their  military service aren't harmed by a fluke in S. 2155.   Without this bill, potential damage to the overall VA home loan  market is  [[Page H9065]]  likely because VA lenders may have to sell or finance these orphan  mortgages at a loss. This would have a negative impact on the brave men  and women who have served our country and deserve a path to  homeownership and the American Dream.   If lenders aren't able to securitize VA home loans through Ginnie  Mae, closing costs and borrowing costs could go up and opportunities to  borrow or refinance could go down.   Mr. Speaker, veterans have some of the lowest default and foreclosure  rates in the Nation, and they have earned access to VA home loans  through their selfless service to our country.   As I mentioned earlier, it is estimated that 2,500 or more VA home  loans that were issued earlier in May or June of this year may now be  boxed out of the market due to a minuscule legislative error. Even one  VA home loan negatively impacted by a minor mistake is one too many  when it comes to giving our veterans access to homeownership.   That is why we must pass this bipartisan bill. I thank my lead  bipartisan cosponsors, Claudia Tenney of New York and Kyrsten Sinema of  Arizona. I also thank Chairman Hensarling, Ranking Member Waters, and  Housing and Insurance Subcommittee Chairman Sean Duffy for supporting  this important bipartisan reform.   I also thank the great staff of the House Financial Services  Committee for all their help throughout this process. They certainly  have shown a tremendous amount of care and compassion for our Nation's  veterans with this bill and so many others.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from Senator Tillis and  Senator Warren expressing the need to address the issue of these orphan  VA loans. I urge adoption of this important bipartisan bill.                                                     U.S. Senate,                                      Washington, DC, June 11, 2018.      J. Paul Compton, Jr.,      General Counsel, U.S. Department of Housing and Urban           Development, Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Compton: As you know, S. 2304--the Protecting       Veterans from Predatory Lending Act of 2018 (Act)--was       introduced and subsequently included in S. 2155, the Economic       Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act, which       President Trump signed into law on May 24, 2018. The Act was       introduced to protect veterans from targeted predatory home       loan practices by requiring lenders to demonstrate a material       benefit to consumers when refinancing their mortgage. As       such, the legislation included: (1) a fee recoupment       requirement; (2) a net tangible benefit test; and (3) a loan       seasoning requirement.        The aforementioned actions and subsequent signature of the       president were taken after witnessing some bad actors in the       U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Home Loan space       engage in the practice of ``churning''--the refinancing of a       home loan over and over again to generate fees and profits       for lenders at the expense of the consumer and taxpayers.       Upon enactment of the legislation, questions arose       surrounding whether Ginnie Mae (Ginnie) is statutorily       authorized to continue to accept previously guaranteed Ginnie       Mortgage-Backed Securities (MBS) as eligible multiclass       securities collateral under its multiclass securities       programs, given the requirements of the legislation--i.e. the       MBS are backed by a refinanced loan that is guaranteed by the       VA benefit program and do not meet the conditions required by       the Act.        Specifically, the Act requires that to be included as       eligible collateral for a Ginnie guaranteed MBS, a VA       refinance loan must be refinanced after the later of: (1) the       date that is 210 days after the date on which the first       monthly payment is made on the mortgage being refinanced, and       (2) the date on which six full monthly payments have been       made on the mortgage being refinanced. To implement the Act,       Ginnie revised its MBS pooling eligibility requirements and       amended its MBS Guide to specify how Ginnie MBS are affected       by this Act. Ginnie delineated that securities with an       issuance date of May 1, 2018 or earlier are unaffected even       if they do not meet the conditions of the Act, and that       Ginnie securities with an issuance dated June 1, 2018 or       later will comply with the new pooling requirements and       conditions of the Act. Ginnie also determined that given the       above-mentioned congressional reasons for enacting S. 2155,       there was never an intent by Congress to impact Ginnie's       ability to continue to guaranty multiclass securities that       are collateralized by Ginnie MBS guaranteed prior to the       enactment of the Act that may contain VA guaranteed       refinanced loans that do not meet the requirements of the       Act.        We recognize that there are a small number of loans that do       not conform with the Act's requirements that were either       originated or in the process of being originated before the       May 31st date of Ginnie's APM regarding new seasoning       requirements. It was not our intention to ``orphan'' those       loans, and we urge Ginnie and the VA to work with lenders and       other federal agencies to attempt to ensure that those loans       are not adversely affected by the enactment of the Act.        We support the steps that Ginnie has taken, and look       forward to working with Ginnie and the VA to further protect       veterans from loan ``churning.''            Sincerely,      Thom Tillis,        United States Senate.      Elizabeth Warren,        United States Senate.     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 6846, which would  create a new, unique ZIP Code for the hamlets of Flanders, Northampton,  and Riverside, located in Suffolk County, New York, in my district.  These three hamlets currently share the same ZIP Code with the nearby  town of Riverhead, where there are at least 18 identical street names  and 32 similar street names. This causes a number of issues, including  the delay of mail and packages, which can hold important goods like  medications. Shared street names can also delay the response for  emergency and medical personnel in situations where every second  counts.   This could all be avoided by assigning a new and unique ZIP Code to  Flanders, Northampton, and Riverside, which is why I have been working  closely with committee and House leadership to ensure this important  issue does not go unresolved.   Last Congress, I brought then-Oversight and Government Reform  Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz to my district to hear from my  constituents firsthand regarding how important this issue is to us. I  then worked with Chairman Chaffetz to secure House passage last  Congress, but, unfortunately, the Senate failed to act.   I urge my colleagues in the House to pass this bill tonight, and I  implore the Senate to take this bill up immediately. This legislation  will have an immediate, on-the-ground, positive impact on the lives of  so many of my constituents.   I would like to thank, especially, Ron Fisher, chairman of the  Flanders, Riverside, Northampton Citizens Advisory Council and  president of the Flanders, Riverside, Northampton Community  Association. I would also like to thank Vince Taldone and Vicki  Farruggia from the Flanders, Riverside, Northampton Community  Association.   I thank the chair of the House Oversight and Government Reform  Committee and his great staff. I appreciate their support and urge a  ``yes'' vote.
