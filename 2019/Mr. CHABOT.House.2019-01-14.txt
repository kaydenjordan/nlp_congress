 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 116, the Investing in Main  Street Act of 2019.   Small businesses across the country are reporting increased  confidence and heightened optimism. Despite these improving economic  conditions for the Nation's true job creators, many of them are still  facing hurdles when it comes to accessing capital to grow and expand  their operations.   To assist small businesses with their financing needs, the SBA, Small  Business Administration, offers the Small Business Investment Company  program, also known as the SBIC program.   While currently running on a zero-cost subsidy to the American  taxpayer, the SBIC program increases access to long-term capital  through a private equity financing model. SBICs are privately owned but  licensed and regulated by the SBA.   The Investing in Main Street Act of 2019 provides a simple and  commonsense solution to a limitation that is holding back growth within  the SBIC program.   Currently, financial institutions and savings associations are  prohibited from investing more than 5 percent of capital or surplus in  an SBIC. In order to assist small businesses as they seek capital, H.R.  116 increases the 5 percent limitation to 15 percent, subject to the  approval of the financial institution's regulator.   In the 115th Congress, an identical bill was favorably reported out  of the Small Business Committee, unanimously, and passed on the House  floor via voice vote.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Judy Chu)  and the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Norman) for continuing their  work on this legislation. As always, I thank the gentlewoman from New  York (Ms. Velazquez) the now-chairman of the Small Business Committee,  for advancing this bipartisan bill that will further improve the SBIC  program.   Small businesses, from Ohio to Texas to California, are transforming  towns and communities across the country. They are building the  Nation's newest products and offering the newest services, all while  constantly innovating. They are nimble, swift, and often very flexible.  We must work together to create an environment where they are free to  grow and create jobs.   Therefore, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, the Investing  in Main Street Act, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, so I am prepared  to close.   Mr. Speaker, again, I thank the gentlewoman for working with us on  this. The SBIC program invests in small firms across the country,  providing them with the working capital they need to create and  innovate new products and new technologies.   This bipartisan legislation passed the House, as we mentioned before,  unanimously last Congress, and it removes a restriction that has  hindered the growth of the SBIC program. It will allow it to grow and  support more firms all across America, from Portland, Maine, to  Portland, Oregon.   I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan legislation and yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 246, the Stimulating  Innovation through Procurement Act of 2019.   I would like to thank the gentleman from Utah (Mr. Curtis) and the  gentlewoman from Iowa (Ms. Finkenauer) for their efforts on this  important legislation.   This bill continues the committee's longstanding emphasis on the  commercialization of technologies developed in the Small Business  Innovation Research, or SBIR program.   The bill does this by incorporating acquisition personnel into the  SBIR and the Small Business Technology Transfer, STTR, programs where  appropriate. Under the bill, procurement center representatives, or  PCRs, would be required to coordinate and collaborate with Federal  agency small business advocates and are responsible for providing small  businesses with technical assistance as they navigate the bidding  process. Doing so would give small firms a better understanding of the  government contracting process and increases their chances of success.   The SBIR and STTR programs are often the first place innovative,  small firms look in order to contract with the Federal Government.  Unfortunately, it is often difficult for a firm, particularly a new  firm, to understand the ins and outs of working with the Federal  Government. It can be quite complex.   Providing a new avenue for counseling by utilizing the national  network of PCRs will help pioneering, small firms better prepare their  proposals for the SBIR and STTR programs.   Mr. Speaker, I urge support for the bill, and I reserve the balance  of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Utah  (Mr. Curtis), who is our chief sponsor of this legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from Utah again for his  leadership on this, and thank the gentlewoman from Iowa as well, and,  as always, thank the chairwoman, the gentlewoman from New York (Ms.  Velazquez).   This straightforward legislation directs PCRs and senior procurement  executives in agencies to assist small businesses in the SBIR and STTR  programs.   Such assistance could be in the form of researching applicable  solicitations, providing technical assistance when bidding for  contracts, or coordinating with appropriate agency procurement  officials.   The House passed identical legislation unanimously as part of a  larger package last Congress, and we recommend passage of this bill  again this year.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 206, the Encouraging Small  Business Innovation Act.   I want to commend Mr. Rouda on his work to improve the Small Business  Innovation Research program and the Small Business Technology Transfer  program, or SBIR and STTR as they are more commonly known.   These critical programs provide exceptionally innovative small firms  with the kick-start they need to develop the next big thing and turn  their companies from small businesses into large ones. These  innovations have saved lives on the battlefield, in the hospital room,  and made immeasurable advancements in communication technology and  countless other improvements to technologies we all use on a daily  basis.   Among other things, this straightforward bill updates and harmonizes  the definition of research and development in the Small Business Act,  providing an avenue for more experienced SBIR companies to mentor newer  companies, and improves oversight.   Furthermore, this bill encourages collaboration and sharing of best  practices among Federal agencies to enhance the efficacy of the SBIR  and STTR programs. Federal agencies housing these programs would be  required to meet annually to discuss potential data collection and  reporting process improvements, ideas to increase small business  participation, and will be required to update Congress on the outcomes  and recommendations arising from these meetings.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to  close.   Mr. Speaker, the SBIR and STTR programs are often the first place  small innovative companies come to do business with the Federal  Government. They are widely popular here on Capitol Hill, in the  administration, and in the industrial base as well. They provide that  initial kick-start of funding for ideas that could change the world,  literally, for the better.   Mr. Speaker, the reforms contained in H.R. 206 make it easier for  those ideas to become a reality. Therefore, I urge my colleagues to  support this bipartisan legislation, and I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 190, the Expanding Contracting  Opportunities for Small Businesses Act of 2019.   I want to commend the gentleman from Kansas (Mr. Marshall) and the  gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Schneider) for working in a cooperative  and bipartisan manner on this important legislation.   The bill we are considering today passed the House last September  because it is both good for small businesses and good for the Federal  Government. By raising the potential amount of sole source contract  awards, this bill encourages Federal agency contracting officers to do  more work with women-owned, service-disabled veteran-owned, HUBZone,  and socially and economically disadvantaged small businesses.   The bill will also strengthen the integrity of the sole source award  process by requiring the SBA to actively determine that a women-owned  or service-disabled veteran-owned small business is qualified and  eligible to receive the award before it is made.   Finally, the bill tasks the Government Accountability Office with  assessing Congress' ability to oversee proper spending through sole  source awards.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Kansas (Mr. Marshall), one of the chief sponsors of the legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close. I have no further  speakers.   Mr. Speaker, again, I want to thank Dr. Marshall as well as Mr.  Schneider for their work and their leadership on this important  legislation.   This bill brings the dollar amount of sole source awards in line with  the size of current contracts and strengthens oversight by instituting  a new eligibility determination check by the SBA before sole source  contracts are awarded.   Therefore, I would urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I rise this evening to celebrate the 200th  anniversary of the University of Cincinnati.   In 1819, roughly 70 students were enrolled in what was then called  the Cincinnati College. Today, nearly 46,000 students are enrolled at  UC.   None other than Thomas Edison once credited UC with being important  to the development of his education. President William Howard Taft, who  later became Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court and is, by the  way, the only American to hold both those offices, was educated at UC  Law, as was Nicholas Longworth IV, who went on to represent Ohio's  First Congressional District and later served as Speaker of this very  House.   On a personal note, my wife, Donna, is a UC grad, as is our daughter,  Erica, who graduated from UC's DAAP program.   We are fortunate to have such a tremendous, fine institution in our  community.   Congratulations to the University of Cincinnati for achieving this  significant milestone, and best of luck for another 200 years.                            ____________________
