 Mr. President, I am here to talk for a few minutes about  Major House and the work he has done in our office. We have benefited  for the last several years from a military detailee being on the  Intelligence Committee and on the Defense Appropriations Committee and  having significant military installations in our State, as many of us  do, but we certainly have those in Missouri. It has been valuable  having MAJ Aaron House with them.   Major House has been a great resource on a number of important  national security issues in our office. The knowledge and experience he  has gained as a U.S. Army Reserve officer have helped inform our  discussions on defense issues critical to Missouri and critical to the  country.   Aaron was born in Plattsburgh, NY, on the shores of Lake Champlain.  He joined the Army in 2001. He first served as an enlisted soldier for  3 years and then as a commissioned officer after that. He has served in  both the Engineer Corps and the Finance Corps. He deployed to Iraq,  where he conducted rapid crater repair, route clearance, and  construction operations. His most recent assignment before joining our  office was with the joint staff working as an analyst for the Office of  the Comptroller in Defense.   He is extremely well educated and holds a bachelor of science in  manufacturing management from Clarkson University in New York, a master  of science in human relations and business from Amberton University in  Texas, and he has both a master of business administration and a master  of public administration from Syracuse University in New York.  [[Page S7305]]    He comes with all of that background. Combining that with his  background in finance, he has been critically important to us as we  move through a number of important projects this year. He has been able  to devote a lot of time to gathering and analyzing data on historical  military construction projects as we move forward on those projects.   He has provided knowledgeable recommendations on a host of foreign  policy issues as well. He was very involved in the last year in  Colombia, where Senator Cardin and I cochaired an effort with the  Atlantic Council to look at moving Peace Colombia to Plan Colombia and  then looking at that again now that the Colombian Government has  changed. We have looked at some things that involved Australia and  China and Russia, just to name a few of the areas where Major House has  been helpful in our office.   On veterans issues, he has been helpful as we try to connect veterans  with the resources they need and the benefits they have every right to  have, but they sometimes have a hard time accessing those benefits.   Having him in the office has been an asset. It has been a pleasure  for me and our entire staff. I certainly wish him all the best in the  next chapter of his military career.   He and his wife Mindy have three daughters. They have a newborn son.  So even in that year he was with us, they added a fourth child at their  house. His family and friends who support him and the sacrifices he and  his family--his immediate family--make to serve are deeply appreciated  by us. He has been a real benefit to the country. He has been a  particular benefit to the Missourians whom I get to work for. I am  grateful to have had him this year and will again say that this is a  program that really is beneficial to the Senate.   I hear from our past detailees over the years that it was an  incredible opportunity for them to understand how the Congress works  from the perspective of each of our offices and makes a valuable  addition to what they take to their next assignment and every future  assignment.   I think the Chief of Staff for the President spent some substantial  time in this building representing the Army and said he was the most  knowledgeable guy in the Army when it came to talking about issues that  he learned right here and how to work with and provide information and  advice to Congress.   We are glad Major House has been with us, appreciative of the  program, look forward to welcoming our next detailee soon, and wish  Major House and his family great success as they move forward.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I have 2 requests for committees to meet  during today's session of the Senate. They have the approval of the  Majority and Minority leaders.
