 Mr. Chair, I rise to discuss the urgent need for  Congress to update the Violence Against Women Act and the lifesaving  programs it supports.   I have a great deal of respect for my co-chair of the Domestic  Violence Task Force, but we disagree very strongly on what this bill  does.   No woman, no child, and no family should fear for their life because  of domestic violence. Without updates and support for the critical  programs in VAWA, we are moving backwards. Good programs that are there  to help victims are now threatened, and it is one more stress being  added on to the pile of these victims, and one more fear that we just  add to them.   In one 24-hour period in Michigan, domestic violence programs  answered 408 hotline calls of people in immediate danger, and served  2,359 victims with emergency shelter, transitional housing, counseling,  and legal advice.   The bill before us today is landmark legislation that will respond to  our Nation's crisis of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual  assault, and stalking. It will equip our State and local partners to  provide compassionate care and support to women, families, and, yes,  men, too. We need to admit that sometimes they are victims who need to  rebuild their lives and heal.   VAWA also includes my Zero Tolerance for Domestic Abusers to close  the loopholes that make it easy for domestic abusers and stalkers to  purchase weapons without passing a background check.   This isn't a poison pill. This will save a life. Shouldn't we be  doing that?
