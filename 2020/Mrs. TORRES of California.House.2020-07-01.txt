 Mr. Speaker, while the Moving Forward Act  is not perfect, I am glad the bill includes my amendment, the American  Infrastructure Opportunity Bonds Act.   This amendment would take advantage of times when interest rates are  below the rate of inflation, making borrowing essentially free. The  amendment would direct the Treasury to issue government bonds, in  effect borrowing at these low interest rates. The amendment then  directs the proceeds to the Highway Trust Fund to support  infrastructure investment, creating jobs.   This amendment is a smart investment taking advantage of unique  interest rates to fund infrastructure in a responsible way. During  severe recessions, my amendment will provide crucial support for  necessary infrastructure projects helping both those who build and  those who rely on roads and public transportation.   Mr. Speaker, I urge its adoption.
