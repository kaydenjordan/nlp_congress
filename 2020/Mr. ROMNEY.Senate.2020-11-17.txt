 Senator Lee, thank you for your excellent remarks with  regard to Senator Orrin Hatch. I rise to second what you said and to  add a few words, some duplicative.   As you indicated, Senator Hatch dedicated his life to serving our  country and our State, and he served in this body for some 42 years--a  remarkable and extraordinary career of public service. And, of course,  he was one of the longest serving chairmen of the Senate Judiciary  Committee and, therefore, played a pivotal role in confirming many,  many current and now-retired Supreme Court Justices. And while serving  as chairman, he also helped shepherd hundreds of district and appellate  judges through confirmation, including the majority of Utah's Federal  judges.   His impact on the State of Utah is not just professional but also  personal. Virtually anybody who stopped Senator Hatch and asked his  opinion on a topic--he would stop, shake their hand, smile, and give  them a full rapt attention. He is a tall drink of water, so you have to  look up to Senator Hatch.   I came to him, following the crisis of 9/11, asking for his help in  securing essential security funding for the Olympic Winter Games of  2002. Senator Hatch immediately took me to meet with other Senators,  and he, along with others, was able to secure the funding necessary to  make sure that our games were safe and were ultimately produced  successfully in a way that made them the most successful Olympic Winter  Games in history. He was and is an honorable public servant who  continues to have tremendous impact on our State; therefore, it is only  appropriate that Utah's Federal courthouse be named in his honor, and I  am glad to support this legislation.    I yield my time back to Senator Lee.
