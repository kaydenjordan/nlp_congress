 Madam President, on May 21, 2019, the U.S. Postal Service  will release a series of postage stamps commemorating America's Wild  and Scenic River system. These are America's remarkable rivers and  streams unique for their free-flowing beauty, along with their  contribution to recreation, fish and wildlife habitat, and countless  other important benefits.   As we recognize the 50th anniversary of this landmark conservation  law, I want to make a point that Oregon has always been a leader in  protecting rivers and just this year added more than 250 miles of Wild  and Scenic Rivers designations, increasing our miles of protected  rivers from 1,916 to a grand total of over 2,170 miles. That gives  Oregon the State with the most miles of Wild and Scenic River  designations in the contiguous United States.   Three Oregon rivers are being recognized by the U.S. Postal Service  in this commemorative stamp edition: the Deschutes, the Owyhee, and the  Snake Rivers. Each is remarkable and unique in its own way, and  together, these rivers embody Oregon's tradition of providing habitat  for endangered salmon and steelhead, clean drinking water, and  recreation opportunities for countless outdoor enthusiasts from all  over the United States and the world.   One of these rivers, the Owyhee, carves its way through some of the  harshest and most arid and remote landscape of Oregon's high desert in  the easternmost parts of our State. The Owyhee River flows through a  steep, eroded canyon with cliffs towering hundreds of feet above. Added  to the Wild and Scenic Rivers system in 1984, this river is revered for  its remarkable cultural, geologic, recreational, and scenic values. It  is of particular historical significance to Tribes across Oregon,  Idaho, and Nevada. Beyond its significance as a Wild and Scenic River,  the Owyhee region is a critical lifeline to the rural economy of  eastern Oregon and the local ranching community.   Moving westward to central Oregon, the Deschutes River is an oasis  that winds through sandy, pumice-filled soils and sloping plateaus. A  Wild and Scenic River since 1988, the Deschutes is world renowned for  its fly fishing, rafting, and hiking opportunities. For centuries,  Native Americans have honored the cultural and fishing uses of the  river and venerated its historical value.   The final Oregon river honored in this series is back to the east in  Oregon but north of the Owyhee: the mighty Snake River. It flows  through Hells Canyon--the deepest gorge in North America--on the border  between Idaho and Oregon. First designated a Wild and Scenic River in  1975, the Snake River holds significant cultural value for the people  of the Shoshone and Nez  [[Page S2681]]  Perce Tribes. It also holds an important part of our State's history;  emigrant pioneers risked their lives crossing the Snake in search of  their future in Oregon. Pristine sections of this river and its  stunning landscapes provide bountiful opportunities for salmon fishing,  rafting, and exploration.   These Oregon rivers and others recognized by the U.S. Postal Service  in these stamps contribute to the most stunning landscapes in the  country and protect the very qualities that make America's and Oregon's  natural treasures so incredible.                            ____________________
