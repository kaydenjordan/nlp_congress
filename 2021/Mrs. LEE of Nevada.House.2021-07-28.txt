 Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my  time. One of the reasons that I oppose this amendment is because it  proposes to eliminate all funding for family planning.   Now, a woman's ability to thrive is dependent on her health and  participation in society. The House bill we are considering will  improve her opportunities.   Let me review what countless studies have already shown: reproductive  health services prevent unintended pregnancies, maternal deaths, and  abortions; reduce rates of infant and child mortality; empower women to  stay in school and join the workforce; create stronger and healthier  families; and improve economies.   But as we sit here today, more than 200 million women around the  world still lack access to modern contraceptives. If we want to build  on the self-reliance of countries, one of the most cost-effective  measures is to increase access to family planning.   Attacks on women's health must stop.   Now, to oppose family planning and contraceptives and birth control,  then to oppose abortions, that doesn't make any sense. Of course, my  colleague from Florida said it very clearly, that it is just downright  crazy.   Madam Speaker, I urge opposition to this en bloc amendment, and I  yield back the balance of my time.
