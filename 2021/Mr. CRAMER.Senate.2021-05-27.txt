 Mr. President, it is a great honor for me today to  recognize a North Dakota legend who is celebrating his 100th birthday  on June 4. Lynn Aas, of Minot, is one of our State's most treasured  residents. With his engaging personality and deep commitment to public  service, Lynn has experienced many great moments in our State's and in  our Nation's history.   Lynn was raised during the Great Depression on a farm near the town  of Benedict, 40 miles south of Minot. He earned law and business  degrees from the University of North Dakota, managed a medical clinic,  served in the North Dakota Legislature for 8 years, and was a delegate  to the State's 1972 Constitutional Convention. He and his late wife  Beverly raised four sons. To this day, Lynn remains active in his  community.   With all that has been so remarkable about Lynn's life, it is his  service during World War II that resonates the most with those who know  him. Like with so many other young North Dakotans, the Japanese attack  on Pearl Harbor in December of 1941 changed the course of Lynn's life.   In August 1942, Lynn had just finished his first year of college when  he enlisted in the U.S. Army. He began basic training in March 1943 and  became part of the 193rd Glider Infantry Regiment of the 17th Airborne  Division. Following intensive training stateside, he boarded a ship in  Boston in August 1944 heading to Liverpool, England.   Lynn's first combat experience was the Battle of the Bulge, one of  the costliest battles in American history, with more than 80,000 U.S.  casualties, including 19,000 American soldiers killed. His division and  unit were flown to France and transported by trucks to Bastogne on  December 24, 1944. His platoon entered combat on January 7, fighting in  deep snow, frigid cold, and heavy fog. Beginning with 55 troopers, Lynn  was one of only 5 survivors to leave the frontlines 3 weeks later.   The end of January brought his first 2 nights of sleep under a roof  in 5 weeks.   In February, his platoon fought along the Siegfried Line on Nazi  Germany's border.   Later in March, he participated in Operation Varsity, the last large- scale Allied airborne operation of the war. There, he was towed in a  glider and landed behind enemy lines near Wesel, Germany.   Lynn's combat days ended on March 25 when he was wounded in his left  arm by shrapnel. Following extensive recuperation back in America, Lynn  remained in the Army another 5 months until he was honorably discharged  on November 1, 1945.   For his valor and commendable 18 months of service during World War  II, he was awarded the Purple Heart and Bronze Star medals, in addition  to the Glider Badge, Combat Infantryman's Badge, Good Conduct Medal,  American Campaign Medal, European Campaign Medal with one Bronze  Arrowhead and three Bronze Campaign Stars, and the World War II Victory  Medal.   Later in his life, Lynn attend reunions of the 17th Airborne  Division. In 1999, he visited Europe with other 17th Airborne Division  veterans, visiting the locations where they had fought more than 55  years earlier.   In 2015, he visited Belgium again to commemorate the 70th anniversary  of the Battle of the Bulge. As one of the official representatives from  the United States to this observance, Lynn was greeted by many grateful  Belgians who had not forgotten what American soldiers did to liberate  them from Hitler's tyranny.   In 2017, the French Government awarded Lynn its highest honor, the  Knight of the Legion of Honor medal--an award created by Napoleon in  1802. It was my great honor to be at that commemoration. The letter  from the French Government notifying Lynn of this award carried these  poignant words:         73 years ago, you gave your youth to France and the French       people. Many of your fellow soldiers did not return but they       remain in our hearts. . . . You saved us. We will never       forget. For us, the French people, you are a hero. Gratitude       and remembrance are forever in our souls.    Mr. President, Lynn Aas was one of 60,000 North Dakotans to serve in  the U.S. Armed Forces during World War II. Of those, nearly 2,000 gave  their lives for our freedom in this largest and deadliest conflict in  world history. With only some 500 World War II veterans still alive in  North Dakota, the heroism of every single one of them is appreciated  more than ever.   Throughout his life, Lynn Aas has embodied the best of the ``greatest  generation.'' He has lived a meaningful life, sharing his history as a  World War II soldier throughout so the rest of us can better understand  and appreciate the selfless service and sacrifice of every veteran.   On behalf of all North Dakotans, I wish Lynn Aas a very happy 100th  birthday on June 4 and many more years of health and vitality. As he  celebrates with his large family and many friends in Minot, I honor him  as one of North Dakota's most exemplary citizens.   I yield back.
