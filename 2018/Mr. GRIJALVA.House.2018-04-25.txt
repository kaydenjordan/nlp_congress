 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, the bill we are debating today, I am sorry to say, is  yet another attempt by my Republican colleagues to accelerate the  extinction of our Nation's fisheries.   H.R. 3144 weakens protections for several runs of wild salmon and  steelhead in the Pacific Northwest, which are extremely important to  commercial, recreational, and tribal fishing interests.   This is the worst possible time for such an extreme approach. Last  year, for the first time, Federal scientists surveying the Pacific  Northwest salmon population came up with empty nets, and yet here we  are moving a bill that will only worsen the salmon crisis.   While disappointing, I can't say today's bill is entirely surprising.  In fact, this bill is just the latest attack by my Republican  colleagues in their broader war on salmon and the salmon fishing  industry.   We saw these same attacks on salmon when House Republicans jammed  H.R. 23, also known as the GROW Act, through the House recently.   This bill sought to eliminate protection for California salmon and  put California's native fisheries on the path to extinction, meaning  thousands of job losses across California, Oregon, and Washington  State.   House Republicans pushed the bill through even though estimates show  that 78 percent of California's native salmon will be extinct this  century under current trends.   Instead of trying to counter these trends, House Republicans decided  it was more important to help some of their big business buddies who  would rather drain our public rivers even further for private profit.   Now we are here today with another bill that harms our wild salmon  and the businesses that depend on their existence.   It is no surprise that our committee received numerous letters from  businesses and fishing industry groups opposed to H.R. 3144.   The committee also received several letters from guiding and outdoor  retail businesses, the food industry, and from many other businesses  that depend on functioning ecosystems and the Columbia Basin salmon.   Aside from being bad for many businesses, this bill also represents a  troubling attack on our Nation's bedrock environmental laws and the  legal process.   Since the early 1990s, Federal courts have found the Federal dam  operations at the Federal Columbia River Power System endanger the  existence of the Pacific Northwest salmon runs and violate our Nation's  laws, including the Endangered Species Act.   As a result, Federal agents have been ordered several times to  develop a new dam operation plan to recover the region's dwindling  salmon populations.   Instead of requiring Federal dam operations to finally come into  compliance with the law and develop a salmon recovery plan that works,  H.R. 3144 locks in an outdated, illegal plan until at least 2022 that  will cause great harm to wild salmon and struggling fishing  communities.   Furthermore, this bill blocks recent court orders requiring  additional salmon protection measures at Federal dams. It also bans  Federal agencies from even studying the possible changes to dam  operations that can improve salmon survival, such as increased spill.   In short, this bill causes great harm to wild salmon and many  businesses, Tribes, and communities that depend on it.   Mr. Speaker, for these reasons, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no,''  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Massachusetts (Ms. Tsongas), a member of the Natural Resources  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter of  opposition from Governor Kate Brown of Oregon, a letter of opposition  to the legislation from Governor Inslee of Washington, 140 undersigned  businesses from the region in opposition, the Nez Perce Tribal  Executive Committee in opposition to the legislation, and over 22  environmental and outdoor organizations in opposition to the  legislation.                                                   January 22, 2018.        As Governor of the State of Oregon, I write expressing deep       concerns with H.R. 3144. I am concerned this legislation       would thwart federal court direction to provide additional       spill at dams on the lower Columbia and Snake rivers and the       collaborative state, tribal and federal process that has       worked effectively to develop spill provisions for 2018.       These court-ordered collaborative efforts resulted in       consensus recommendations from all sovereigns, representing a       positive, and unprecedented, step forward in building       stronger consensus for recovery actions. H.R. 3144 would       negate this progress and our ability to implement and learn       from these consensus recommendations.        H.R. 3144 would also derail ongoing collaborative efforts       to examine a range of potential future dam operations and       salmon management options required by the National       Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). The State of Oregon has       engaged in good faith as cooperating agencies with federal       agency leads for this Columbia Snake River Operations study.       This process is vital to secure a sustainable path forward       optimizing power, commerce, agriculture and fish recovery       within a changing social and environmental landscape.        Through NEPA and the Endangered Species Act, Congress       established processes for federal decision-making that are       grounded in a robust analysis of alternatives in a systematic       and science-based manner. H.R. 3144 contravenes these       important principles and would disrupt the regional efforts       to engage in a full, accurate and transparent analysis of       salmon and dam management.        Washington Governor Inslee has expressed similar opposition       to H.R. 3144. Oregonians and Washingtonians share decades of       investment in recovering Columbia River salmon, and I join my       colleague in asking you to oppose H.R. 3144.            Sincerely,                                                        Kate Brown,                                                          Governor.  [[Page H3547]]                                          ____                                               State of Washington,                                          Office of the Governor,                                      Olympia, WA, December 5, 2017.      Hon. Rob Bishop,      Chairman, Committee on Natural Resources,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Doug Lamborn,      Chairman, Subcommittee on Water,           Power and Oceans,      Committee on Natural Resources,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Raul Grijalva,      Ranking Member, Committee on Natural Resources,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Jared Huffman,      Ranking Member, Subcommittee on Water, Power and Oceans,      Committee on Natural Resources,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairmen Bishop and Lamborn and Ranking Members       Grijalva and Huffman: As Governor of the State of Washington,       I write to express my deep concerns with H.R. 3144,       legislation which would freeze in place a 2014 biological       opinion (BiOp), or salmon management plan, for the dams       composing the Federal Columbia River Power System. While the       State of Washington believes the 2014 BiOp represented a step       forward for efforts to protect and recover 13 stocks of       threatened or endangered Columbia and Snake river salmon and       steelhead, H.R. 3144 would thwart constructive ongoing       efforts to improve future salmon and dam management. This       would not only hurt salmon but also the recreational and       commercial fisheries, tribes, and other species (such as       Puget Sound's southern resident killer whales) that benefit       from healthy salmon runs.        I am committed to preserving the benefits of our hydropower       dams in a manner that is in balance with protecting and       restoring salmon. While our dams and dam operations have been       modified to reduce their impact to salmon and steelhead over       the last 20 years, there is evidence that salmon may further       benefit from additional modifications to dam operations that       would help restore salmon populations. The State of       Washington is participating in productive regional       discussions about the best way to test the potential benefits       of additional ``spill,'' in 2018 and potentially beyond. This       discussion and learning opportunity would be blocked by H.R.       3144's prohibition on any studies or actions that restrict       electricity generation at any dams in the Federal Columbia       River Power System, even by a small amount.        Similarly, several Washington State agencies are engaged as       cooperating agencies in the Columbia Snake River Operations       study process currently being conducted, pursuant to the       National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). This process       promises to provide valuable information on a range of       potential future dam operations and salmon management       strategies. As with the discussion regarding increased spill       over the dams, H.R. 3144 would halt this learning process in       its tracks, preventing a constructive dialog among federal       and state agencies, tribes, and the public about how best to       manage Columbia and Snake river dams in a region that must       continually adapt to ongoing changes to its climate, salmon       habitat, and energy system.        For these reasons, I encourage the Subcommittee on Water,       Power and Oceans, the full Natural Resources Committee, and       the full House of Representatives to oppose H.R. 3144.        Thank you for your consideration of my input regarding       federal legislation that could have significant impacts on my       state.            Very truly yours,                                                        Jay Inslee,      Governor.                                   ____                                                     April 20, 2018.      Members of Congress,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Members of Congress: The 140 undersigned businesses       and business associations represent commercial and       recreational salmon fishermen and related businesses, guiding       and outdoor retail businesses and restaurants and food       industries based in the Pacific Northwest. Our businesses and       the thousands of jobs that they support regionally are highly       dependent on Columbia Basin salmon and steelhead. For this       reason we are very concerned about salmon conservation and       recovery efforts in the Columbia Basin.        We are writing to inform you of our strong opposition to HR       3144. This bill intentionally circumvents the public       processes guiding operations of the Federal Columbia River       Power System, application of the Endangered Species Act and       recovery of salmon and steelhead resources. HR 3144 would       also block recent court orders from the U.S. District Court       in Portland (OR) that require additional salmon protection       measures at federal dams and reservoirs on the Columbia and       Snake rivers.        HR 3144 requires Congressional authorization before any       additional changes or further study of changing dam       operations could be taken to reduce impacts on migrating       salmon. This removes the best scientific judgment of regional       biologists and engineers and replaces it with a political       process taking place in Washington D.C.        If passed into law, HR 3144 would prevent federal managers       from operating the dams with additional fish-saving spill.       Eliminating the additional spill would have negative impacts       on all Columbia Basin salmon, but would put wild Snake River       Brun steelhead at immediate risk of extinction; only 362 B-      run fish have passed the highest dam so far this year. The       additional spill recently ordered by the court is strongly       supported by regional salmon biologists. It has been shown to       be highly effective in increasing juvenile survival to the       Pacific Ocean and the number of adults returning. One can       look at the excellent returning runs of fall chinook in 2014       and 2015 and the resulting economic benefits to see why       increased spill is critical in the Columbia Basin. We support       the use of spill to increase salmon runs. HR 3144 caps spill       at levels already determined to be inadequate and detrimental       to the recovery salmon in the Columbia Basin.        We close by urging you to oppose HR 3144. Columbia Basin       salmon are critical to the health of the coastal and inland       economies and communities of the Pacific Northwest--including       California and Alaska. Our businesses are committed to       participating in processes that affect salmon and eager to       work with Northwest sovereigns and stakeholders to craft       lawful, science-based salmon strategies that meet the needs       of imperiled salmon populations and the communities of our       great region.        Thank you for your consideration of our perspective and the       effect of your policies on the culture and economy of the       Northwest.

Nez Perce Tribe's Statement in Opposition to H.R. 3144.  (``A Bill to Provide for operations of the Federal Columbia River Power   System pursuant to a certain operation plan for a specified period of                      time, and for other purposes.'')         The Nez Perce Tribe is committed to restoring salmon and       steelhead in the mainstem Columbia and lower Snake rivers to       healthy, harvestable populations for all citizens of the       Northwest and to fairly sharing the conservation burden,       consistent with the United States' 1855 Treaty with the Nez       Perce.        The Nez Perce Tribe opposes H.R. 3144 because it attempts       to short-circuit the federal judiciary and federal appellate       process with respect to providing additional spill to protect       fish. The Tribe also opposes H.R. 3144 because it attempts to       short-circuit the full consideration of all alternatives to       redress the impacts of the Federal Columbia River Power       System (FCRPS) dams on salmon and steelhead--including       breaching the four lower Snake River dams.        Congress, in the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA)       and in the Endangered Species Act (ESA), established federal       decision-making that is grounded in a full and complete       analysis of all alternatives in an orderly, methodical and       science-based process. Both NEPA and the ESA ensure that all       the citizens of this Nation will have a full, accurate, and       transparent analysis of the importance of salmon and       steelhead to the Pacific Northwest and the Nation, the impact       the FCRPS dams have on these iconic species, and the legacy       we want to leave our future generations. And, both NEPA and       the ESA contain mechanisms so that tradeoffs can be       considered, investments in local communities impacted by       decisions can be planned, and truly informed decisions can be       made. H.R. 3144 runs counter to these foundational principles       of sound, consistent and sustainable governance.                                   ____                                                    August 23, 2017.        Dear Policymaker: The undersigned conservation, salmon,       orca, and clean energy advocacy organizations and business       associations extend our deep gratitude for your decision not       to co-sponsor H.R. 3144--recently introduced by several       Northwest representatives. In contrast to sponsor claims,       this bill, if passed, would thwart efforts to deliver       critical near-term protections for endangered wild salmon,       derail the court-ordered NEPA environmental review and       increase uncertainty for Northwest citizens and businesses.       We ask you to actively oppose this harmful legislation to       ensure that it does not become law.        Wild salmon and steelhead are a Northwest birthright. They       are essential to the culture and economy of our region's       Native American Tribes and support tens of thousands of non-      tribal fishing jobs in urban and rural communities on the       West Coast and in Idaho. Salmon also play an irreplaceable       ecological role as an indicator species reflecting the health       of our rivers and watersheds. Their presence benefits more       than 130 other species, including critically-endangered,       prey-deficient Southern Resident Orcas.        H.R. 3144 is based on misinformation, fails to recognize       the important role wild salmon and steelhead play for       Northwest communities and ecosystems, and would severely       undermine ongoing and much-needed protection efforts. If       passed into law, H.R. 3144 would reverse the May 2016 U.S.       District court decision that found the federal agencies' most       recent plan for managing federal dams on the Columbia and       Snake Rivers violated the Endangered Species Act and the       National Environmental Policy Act and would not protect wild       salmon and steelhead from extinction. Three different federal       judges have now rejected five consecutive Columbia Basin       salmon plans over the past two decades. This failure has cost       regional energy consumers and federal taxpayers more than $10       billion without recovering a single endangered salmon       population.        H.R. 3144 would lock in the inadequate and illegal 2014       Columbia Basin Biological Opinion, fatally stifle the court       order to complete a full, fair NEPA environmental review, and       prevent an increase in spring ``spill'' (water releases over       the tops of dams to improve survival of out-migrating       juvenile salmon) beginning in 2018. Ordered by the court       earlier this year and being collaboratively planned by the       parties to the litigation this summer, spill is widely       recognized by experts as our most effective immediate tool to       help endangered salmon while our region develops a new,       legally valid, scientifically-credible plan.        Salmon and fishing advocates share the frustration of many       stakeholders with this history of costly and ineffective       plans to revive culturally and economically important salmon       populations in the Columbia-Snake Basin. We are ready to work       with others in the region to develop a plan that protects and       recovers endangered salmon and steelhead while also meeting       the needs of affected interests. H.R. 3144, however, will not       move our region in that direction; rather it will move us       away from a real opportunity to craft a durable, responsible       solution.        Thank you again for your decision not to sponsor H.R. 3144.       We hope that you will actively oppose it and do everything       you can to prevent this bill from becoming law.

Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  Oregon (Mr. Blumenauer).    I yield the gentleman from Oregon an additional 1  minute.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Lowenthal), the ranking member of the Natural Resources  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from California (Mr. Huffman), vice ranking member of the  Natural Resources Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I want to speak to another problem and issue with this  bill that one of my colleagues brought up in his statement, and that is  the great harm it will cause to the Tribal interests in the Pacific  Northwest.   Native people of the Pacific Northwest ceded most of their ancestral  homeland to the United States in exchange for the right to catch salmon  and steelhead at accustomed places.   The Federal Government has a long history of failing to protect these  fishing rights. If enacted, H.R. 3144 would further harm Tribal  fisheries which are a critically important source of food. They are of  great cultural and religious significance to the Tribes. Just this  week, the Nez Perce Tribe contacted our committee to urge us to reject  H.R. 3144. I think Congress should heed this call and reject this piece  of legislation.   Mr. Speaker, the concerns have been laid out by the people who have  spoken against this legislation. Essentially, this legislation, H.R.  3144, violates bedrock environmental laws. Those concerns have been  stated by Members who have spoken against the legislation. It harms  businesses. It hurts the Tribes in the Northwest. It is an attack on  the legal process, and, in the long term, it will hurt ratepayers.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote on H.R. 3144, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
