 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of  H.R. 51, the Washington, D.C. Admission Act--a bill long overdue and  exceedingly necessary.   This is a measure that I have supported since my inaugural term in  the House of Representatives, 27 years ago, when I cosponsored  Representative Holmes Norton's second-ever statehood bill. Her  continued leadership and tenacity on this issue as the Delegate from  Washington, D.C. is nothing short of extraordinary, and it is because  of her efforts that today we vote on a statehood bill for the first  time in almost three decades.   For too long, the over-700,000 residents of the District of Columbia  been denied voting representation while still paying taxes, serving in  our military, and adhering to federal laws. Think of that--here, in the  greatest legislative and deliberative body in the world, we routinely  prevent hundreds of thousands of our  [[Page H2542]]  citizens, half of which are African American, from having their voices  heard. The admission of D.C. as a state and redesignation as the  Douglass Commonwealth will not only extend rights and liberties to its  residents but, in doing so, honor the memory of the iconic abolitionist  and D.C. native Frederick Douglass.   Mr. Speaker, as over half of the Members of the House of  Representatives are already cosponsoring H.R. 51, I do not doubt that  it will pass. I urge those remaining who have not cosponsored this bill  to stand on the right side of history and support this bill.
