 Madam Speaker, I rise today to  recognize Bob Hudzik, a constituent in my district who has made a  profound difference in his community.   Bob, a world champion dart player and custodian at Mt. Olive High  School, began Darts for Kids, a nonprofit organization that hosts an  annual dart tournament. The proceeds go to families of children with  life-threatening illnesses, usually to contribute to the cost of  unforeseen medical expenses.   Their first tournament in 2013 raised about $10,000. To date, Darts  for Kids has raised almost $175,000 and helped over 90 families with  medical costs for children.   I recently cosponsored legislation that shines a light on individuals  like Bob. H.R. 276, the RISE Act, would establish the Recognizing  Inspirational School Employees Award Program within the Department of  Education to highlight the dedication of education support  professionals like Bob.   Bob is a perfect example of the people who make our communities  great. I could not be prouder of all that Bob has done to better the  lives of families in Mt. Olive, Illinois.   Keep up the great work, Bob.                            ____________________     Madam Chair, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   I thank my friend and chairperson of our committee, Ms. Lofgren. It  is great to be able to work together and show some bipartisanship.   As many who may have been paying attention yesterday to our long  debate on this bill know, that has been one of my chief complaints  about H.R. 1. We haven't seen the bipartisanship that the new majority,  the new Democratic majority, promised.                                time  1230    Every one of these amendments were offered by members of the  Democratic conference. While our amendments in the only markup process  that we had for this 622-page bill were all shot down on a partisan  roll call, I want the Record to show that Republicans believe in  bipartisanship and this en bloc group of amendments clearly shows that.   While individually I may not have supported every one of them, this  is what bipartisanship and good principle compromise leads to. It leads  to us spending a lot less time on the floor debating individual  amendments, but also saving time for the amendments that are that much  more important.   And I certainly hope that, unlike I have seen throughout the process  already, this en bloc of bipartisan amendments, this en bloc of really  Democratic amendments that have been accepted on a bipartisan basis,  could be the linchpin. As we move forward today, I certainly hope that  my friends on the other side of the aisle can accept some Republican  amendments because we have yet to accept one. So I hope this is a  goodwill gesture that will lead to more bipartisanship as the day goes  on.   Again, while I and many members of our conference may not have  supported these amendments individually, we felt it was a good faith  effort to be able to work together. And, again, I want to thank my  colleagues on the other side of the aisle, especially with the House  Administration Committee, a committee that has done its due diligence  in putting a massive, mammoth bill forward to the floor today. I still  have problems with the process, I still have problems with the overall  bill, but this en bloc amendment should not be one of those.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield back the balance  of my time.    Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to  this amendment.    Madam Chair, I thank the gentlewoman  from Massachusetts (Ms. Pressley), my new colleague, for participating  in the legislative process. This is why we are here. We are here to  debate the issues, whether we agree or disagree. That is what this  institution is all about. And it is great to see new Members be active  on very important issues.   I have to say, I think there might be a constitutional issue with  this amendment. The last time we lowered the voting age, in 1971, I  believe we had 18-year-olds fighting for our country in Vietnam.   It seemed wrong back then. The kids that were eligible for the draft.  Through no fault of their own, through no choice of their own, they  were asked to go fight for our freedoms in a foreign country. Being 1  year old at the time, I don't really remember that debate, but I can  tell you, it was the right thing to do.    However, for constitutional reasons--and, also, I am of the opinion  that we shouldn't arbitrarily lower the voting age just because, right  now, I believe Democrats think they will gain more votes.   H.R. 1 is bad enough because I believe it will institutionalize a  Democrat majority here in this House of Representatives, but to be so  brash and, possibly, unconstitutional to decide and lower the voting  age only for political reasons is something that I don't think this  institution should be doing.   I have two 18-year-old boys who got to cast their first vote this  year. There was some thought before election day. I didn't know if I  would get their votes, but since then, they told me they have voted for  me. And a close race like mine, it made a difference.   But this policy is not well thought out. It is not constitutional,  and it should not be part of this bill. I am going to urge a ``no''  vote.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, how much time is  remaining?    Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Green).    Madam Chair, it is a great debate to  have.   The problem we have here in this country, all 16-year-olds are still  legally minors. They can't be tried as adults in the court of law  unless, under special circumstances, of heinous crimes.   They can't join the military. They won't even be eligible for the  draft that took so many of our young men to Southeast Asia, where many  never came home, the last time the voting age was lowered.   In some States, 16-year-olds can't even drive their car alone. They  can't take out a loan. They can't take out a mortgage. They can't open  a credit card. And they can't even run for the offices that we would be  asking them to be allowed to vote for.   This is an amendment that has political reasons behind it. It is the  reason that I believe the Democrats are pushing it. It is because they  believe they will be able to increase the number of Democrat votes that  are put forth in the next election.   This institution should not be used for that. This bill is political  enough. This bill, as a whole, is nothing more than a charade to make  permanent the Democratic majority that just came into existence just a  few months ago.                                time  1300    That is why I believe H.R. 1 is a bill that should be voted against.  Please vote ``no'' on H.R. 1, and please vote ``no'' on this amendment  for the reasons that I put forth.   Again, I thank my colleague from Massachusetts and my colleague from  New York for being here and participating in this process.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Madam Chairman, I claim the time in  opposition, although I am not opposed to the basis of the amendment.    Madam Chairman, I am not opposed to  what this amendment does, although I would point out, once again, this  is another unfunded mandate. This is another cost that the CBO has  already said, from what they can score, this bill is going to cost  taxpayers $2.8 billion with a potential for billions more for what they  couldn't even offer a congressional budget score for. So I have some  issues with that, although I appreciate the direction my colleague is  going with this.   I think providing voter registration materials at schools is  something that is probably being done now. I would hope that local  county clerks--I know mine are--are already doing that. But I am not  opposed to that language.   However, I disagree with my colleague from Texas that H.R. 1 is a  bill by the people and for the people. Frankly, I believe every single  American who is eligible to vote should have their vote counted and  they should have their vote protected.   We all, as Americans--Republicans and Democrats--want every vote to  count. We want to make sure everyone can get registered to vote. At a  time in our country when registration turnout is exceedingly high  compared to previous generations, we are doing that.   Make no mistake about it. This bill is not by the people. H.R. 1 is  not for the people. H.R. 1 is for the Members of Congress who sit in  this institution who are going to eventually get tax dollars to pay for  their own campaign ads. That is why this bill is a bad bill. I  appreciate the amendment that my colleague is offering, but by no means  is H.R. 1 going to ensure that we have the protection to ensure that  every eligible American voter has their vote counted and protected.   Madam Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I would like to thank my  colleague and friend from Texas (Mr. Green). Again, I agree with what  Chairperson Lofgren said about the excitement of students in high  schools being able to understand what it means to be able to register  to vote and participate in the political process. That is why I visit  high schools throughout my district on a regular basis each time we are  back from Washington, off this floor and in our districts for our  district work period.   I am going to, again, extend the olive branch of bipartisanship to  ensure that I am not going to oppose this amendment. I want this  amendment to pass through, but I will note to many of my colleagues on  the floor, Madam Chairman, we just had two Republican amendments  offered, and not one passed. The olive branch of bipartisanship has to  work both ways. I am, again, reaching out, and I will continue to do so  throughout the day, but it is not without frustration that that olive  branch has not yet been returned.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I claim the time in  opposition.    Madam Chairman, I have a couple of  questions. One question, in particular, is: If the gentleman from  Arizona, Chairman Grijalva, has this information, I would like to know.  This is already the process that we follow in my home State of  Illinois.   Are there any States that don't allow this already that the gentleman  is aware of?    I yield to the gentleman from Arizona.    Madam Chair, I will reclaim my time,  but let the Record show it is not a process, it is illegal in the  State, my colleague's home State.   I am not against this process happening because it happens in my home  State right now. The problem we have is we don't want somebody who is  eligible to cast a ballot, who got that vote-by-mail ballot, and they  decided on election day to fill it out. We want them to be able to go  to their polling place and not have to wait in line, and we want them  to be able to turn it in.   The problem we have on our side of the aisle is it is ballot  harvesting. It is the process in North Carolina where a Republican is  likely going to jail, if convicted. But that same process that will  likely send that person to jail, if convicted, is legal in California.  We have a problem with somebody besides that voter taking absentee  ballots unwatched, not a bipartisan effort, not any control mechanisms,  bringing it to the polling place or to the county clerk on election day  or after election day. Those are issues that we are concerned about in  the bill.   I don't oppose this amendment because, again, it is already the  process we follow in my home State.   Madam Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chairman, I yield myself the  balance of my time.   Madam Chairman, again, I don't oppose the process. It is already in  existence in my home State to ensure that every eligible American voter  has their vote counted and protected.   There are legitimate concerns about the ballot harvesting process;  otherwise somebody might not have to face a trial in North Carolina.   I certainly appreciate the author coming to the floor to, once again,  talk  [[Page H2528]]  about the bill and some of the changes that were made since it was  introduced on January 3, the first day of Congress, cosponsored by  every Member of the other side of the aisle, a 571-page bill. I  certainly hope everybody had a chance to take a look at that bill  before signing their name on the dotted line, because the provision  that the author put in place, if he would have reached out to any of  the three Republicans on the House Administration Committee, we would  have gladly discussed some of our priorities, but there was no olive  branch of bipartisanship whatsoever.                                time  1330    The sheer fact that somehow the bill has been changed to now create  this fine that is going to be corporate malfeasance dollars, it is  never going to be able to get the amount of money in that candidates  are going to expect when running for Congress. Candidates, even like  the neo-Nazi who ran against my good friend  Dan Lipinski in the last  race, will now be eligible for this corporate malfeasance money.   Everybody on that side of the aisle knows, when candidates for  Congress, including Members of Congress on the other side of the aisle,  aren't going to get what they expect into their campaigns from this  corporate malfeasance fund--which is corporate dollars that we weren't  supposed to be able to take as Members of Congress in our campaigns  anyway but now somehow it is a good idea to do--you know what is going  to happen? They are going to say, ``I don't have the money in my  campaign to run a race,'' and they are going to ask the taxpayers to  bail it out.   Everybody on that side of the aisle knows that is going to happen,  and the shell game they are playing right now is very frustrating.   The CBO couldn't even score this new provision. We don't even know  how much this is going to cost beyond the possible $3-plus billion.   This is a bill designed to keep a Democratic majority in this  Congress so that we don't have a chance to preside over these hearings  anymore.   That is not the way to run elections. That is not what our  Constitution wants. That is not what anybody should support.   Madam Chair, again, I am not opposed to this amendment, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, as the designee of the  gentleman from Florida (Mr. Yoho), I have an amendment at the desk,  amendment No. 28.    Madam Chair, it is great to have many  conversations with you today. This is what is great about the  institution: Our forefathers set up a legislative branch to debate, to  cast votes, and then to legislate.   We won't always agree on every issue. There are times we will  vehemently disagree with each other. But, Madam Chair, after the debate  is over, we all move on and look forward to working with each other.   Madam Chair, today, I rise in support of amendment 28 because Members  of Congress, all of us in the legislative branch, are, appropriately,  held to stringent ethical standards that are designed to prevent  financial or material gain for actions taken while we are legislating  in this institution. We should ensure all branches of government are  held to high ethical standards, too.   This commonsense amendment would require the Judicial Conference of  the United States to implement a judicial code that is at least as  stringent as the requirements placed on Members of Congress. This  amendment would be a step in the right direction for providing  transparency in government, which the American people expect and  deserve.   Again, I gave the olive branch to my colleagues on the other side of  the aisle on the last two amendments, and I certainly hope that that  olive branch can be returned on this Republican amendment, and I will  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I thank my colleague from  Georgia for debating this amendment with me.   There are a lot of what I believe are constitutional issues with H.R.  1, legislative overreach that defies the equal branches of government.  This one does not. All we are simply doing with this amendment is  asking the Judicial Conference of the United States to implement a  judicial code up and down the judicial spectrum.   Maybe it will actually help ensure that, as judges go through the  confirmation process in the Senate for whatever level of Federal  judgeship he or she may be nominated, it might help us understand who  these judges are.   This is a very commonsense amendment. We are not saying Congress is  going to legislate judicial conduct. We are just saying that we are the  lawmakers. Why don't we ask the Judicial Conference to do it for the  judges, just like our standards are set by Congress and the executive  branch standards should be set by the executive branch.   These are small things that make a big difference in a big bill.  Again, I have extended the olive branch of bipartisanship this entire  day, yesterday, and I would certainly hope that that would be extended  back to us because we have yet, in this entire process of H.R. 1--being  a 622-page bill yesterday and added pages upon pages yesterday and  today--not one single Republican amendment has been accepted. Not one.  Maybe this is it.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I rise this time in  opposition to this amendment.    Madam Chair, I was a strong supporter  of the First Step Act, and I continue to support criminal justice  reform efforts.   As a matter of fact, just last week, a former czar in the Obama  administration, Van Jones, said that, ``The conservative movement in  this country, unfortunately,'' from his point of view, ``. . . is now  the leader on this issue of reform,'' talking about criminal justice  reform.   We need to make sure that we don't have petty drug users spending  more time in Federal prison than Jared the Subway guy who was a  pedophile, but we have to review this amendment very carefully.   We still haven't figured out the processes and procedures of an  amendment that passed, part of H.R. 1 that is in the underlying bill  that would allow felons to vote without any determination of whether  that felon may be like Jared the Subway guy.   Who is to say he doesn't live near a polling place where his polling  place is a school? How in the world can we move forward on getting  voter registration materials to felons without understanding who is  eligible to go to the exact polling place they are supposed to vote at  or not?   I don't want pedophiles, sex offenders, going into a polling place in  many rural areas that the only place they have is a school with  children.   The provision in the bill needs to be changed, needs to be vetted  very carefully. We need to have some certainty here.   I certainly do not support this amendment because I still am not sure  that a felon who is not allowed around children won't be forced to cast  his or her vote around children.   That is why this bill needs to be put back into our committees of  jurisdiction, where almost 40 percent of the jurisdiction was never  marked up in the first place.   This is a rush. I don't blame my colleagues who are here today. I  think Chairperson Lofgren and the members of the House Administration  Committee have done an excellent job putting a bill that is terrible  forward, but the only reason we are here on the floor this week is  because Speaker Pelosi and the Democratic leadership team are forcing  this issue.   The American people and the American taxpayers aren't going to stand  for the provisions that are in this bill.   I don't know why we are rushing it, and I certainly wish there was  more bipartisanship. I certainly wish there was clarification on  whether or not a former convicted felon who is a sex offender is going  to be allowed in a polling place that happens to be a school, where  they can't go into or can't get within a certain amount of yardage to,  outside of election day.   Madam Chair, I can't support this amendment, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I certainly wish that the  underlying piece of legislation actually addressed our concerns, which  is why I would urge both sides of the aisle to send this back to  committee to ensure that, while it doesn't specifically say that State  laws can't be followed when it comes to allowing sex offenders into  polling places, it also doesn't prevent it. That is the problem with  this top-down overreach.   There is nothing in this bill, H.R. 1, that would prevent a sex  offender from walking in and demanding his or her right to vote while  surrounded by children that he or she is not allowed around because of  a previous conviction or a sex offender registration status.   I appreciate my colleague from Wisconsin's work on the First Step  Act, also; and I also have to offer a correction.   The First Step Act was actually to get nonviolent offenders out of  our prisons, petty drug users who have been put away because maybe they  didn't have the information that the assistant U.S. attorney wanted and  then, all of a sudden, they are ratcheted into a long jail sentence  because of mandatory minimums. These are the issues that have  bipartisanship.   By no means does the First Step Act, or any act of criminal justice  reform that I support or that anybody else I know would support, want  murderers out of prison. That is not the case.   If that is the case, we have some more questions about this amendment  and we have some more questions about this bill. We want to make sure  those jail cells are reserved for the people who are the most hardened  criminals.   We have got to work together on criminal justice reform to take the  next step in the First Step Act. We need to make it better, but it is  all for nonviolent offenders.  [[Page H2530]]    I have some serious concerns when sex offenders get out of prison or  maybe they don't even go to prison for that long, like Jared, the  Subway guy, because he may have had a lot of money, may have had the  ability to hire a good lawyer; but so many petty drug offenders who are  going to be the beneficiary of the First Step Act didn't.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I claim the time in  opposition to the amendment, although I am not opposed to it.    Madam Chair, I am not opposed to this  amendment. I think we should work together to ensure that all those who  have disabilities have access to be able to cast their vote, and I know  my home State of Illinois is doing yeoman's work, our local county  clerks are doing yeoman's work to ensure that all those who need  reasonable accommodations get them. So I thank the gentlewoman from  Wisconsin for offering it.   Before I reserve, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Montana  (Mr. Gianforte).    Madam Chair, again, thank you to my  colleague from Wisconsin (Ms. Moore). I support this amendment, and I  am going to ensure that we have no opposition over here.    But I do have a problem with the bill, and I appreciate the author of  the bill being here. If I had that much time dedicated to authoring a  571-page bill with the help of outside special interest groups that  were commended at the opening press conference, I would be here to  defend it, too. But there are so many problems, so many unanswered  questions.   The sheer fact that the shell game of corporate fines is supposed to  fund upwards of billions of dollars to congressional campaigns--my  district alone would have been eligible for $6 million-plus just by  using the last campaign. Multiply that times 435 and add some extra  candidates in there, like the neo-Nazi candidate who would be eligible  for this funding who ran against Democrat  Dan Lipinski. These are  issues that we don't have questions answered because the CBO hasn't  scored.   CBO has already said $2 billion-plus for sure, possibly another $1  billion to the taxpayers under this fund, but how much is going to be  raised from this corporate malfeasance?   And until this day, until this week, I had no idea that the  Democratic majority is okay with putting more corporate money into  their own campaign coffers. Corporate dollars are not allowed in our  campaigns now, as you know, Madam Chair, but we are going to use  corporate fines at a level we don't know what it amounts to? We are  going to use those to fill campaign coffers of Members of Congress?  Seriously? That is why the bill needs to go back to committee.   I would love to work with the author. I am one of the most bipartisan  Members of Congress, according to The Lugar Center, but I never got a  call. I would love to help write this bill.   We tried to make that bill better. This is another olive branch to  the other side on an amendment. I am going to continue to show  bipartisanship that has yet to be reciprocated from the author and from  the committee.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to  the amendment.    Madam Chair, I appreciate the gentleman  from Wisconsin's interest in redistricting and gerrymandering.   Coming from the State of Illinois, I like the independent  redistricting provisions of H.R. 1.   I have some concerns as to why one State's redistricting plan is now  part of the bill when it was supposed to be a nationwide approach, but  we will get to that later.                                time  1445    Gerrymandering is a process like in my home State of Illinois that  can poison the political process. We have Democrat supermajorities in  the House of Representatives in Illinois. We have Democrat majorities  in the Illinois State Senate, supermajorities. We have a Democrat  Governor. I certainly hope we get redistricting reform by the time 2021  rolls around.   But this amendment is about gerrymandering. This amendment is about  the census, and my biggest concern goes back to, again, this bill was  not even marked up in the Oversight and Reform Committee. This issue  was not even brought up during a single hearing that the Oversight and  Reform Committee held on H.R. 1.   This amendment also could upend a foundational principle of the  census. Since 1790, the census has been counting people at their usual  residences on census day. I guess, when Charles Manson was alive out in  the 21st District of California, he got counted at the maximum security  Federal prison.   All alternatively housed populations are actually counted the same  way, or are supposed to be. Who is to say that somebody who lives at  Charles Manson's old home, a relative, doesn't write him down on the  census form, too. I have some concerns about double counting that this  amendment does not address. But prisoners have been counted at their  prison, college students have been counted at their dorms. I remember  in 1990, I filled out a little census form in Mills Hall at Millikin  University in Decatur, Illinois, to be counted as part of the census.   I didn't check with my mom to see if she counted me at home too.  Military servicemembers are counted at their U.S. station base.  Counting one population differently than other similarly situated  populations only serves to decrease the accuracy of the census. The  census count is actually about apportionment that State legislatures  use to draw new lines, or independent commissions use to draw new  congressional lines, State legislative lines. Hopefully, they don't  gerrymander. This is not about redistricting.   The Census Bureau works with States to provide detailed data about  prison populations that would allow the States to redistrict however  the State chooses. That is why I am opposed to your amendment. I do  respect you being here to participate in the process. I certainly wish  that we could have sat down and maybe worked out a better amendment  that would have addressed all of our concerns, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Will the gentleman yield?    Why would the gentleman criticize one  of the greatest bands of the nineties?    Madam Chairwoman, I stand here to say  that my colleague from Wisconsin, I know he did not mean to offend the  many thousands, upon thousands of Nickelback fans in his district in  Wisconsin. I will stand here to save you from doing that and having to  face the political consequences at the ballot box.   Madam Chair, I enjoyed debating back and forth and it is always good  to have some good humor on the floor of the House. And, yes, I actually  do have a Nickelback song on my running playlist that I listen to on a  regular basis.   I was ridiculed for that when I posted my playlist one time, and I  know some in this Chamber--even up at the dais--are still laughing  about that.   But this amendment is a bad amendment. I wish we could have worked  together on it. I hope we can work together on any gerrymandering in  this Nation together as we know it, and I look forward to working with  the gentleman in the future.    I do have to recommend a ``no'' vote on this amendment because it  does not address the underlying issues with gerrymandering, and the  underlying issues that I have with this bill. I yield back the balance  of my time.    Madam Chairwoman, I rise in opposition  to the amendment.    Madam Chair, I thank my good friend  from Wisconsin. I didn't know if he wanted to mention Creed this time  or not, but we can have a great debate on nineties music, if you like.  But I do want the gentleman to come over and see my playlist after this  is done. We will have some fun.   I am opposed to this amendment because American manufacturing employs  more than 12 million men and women, contributes $2.25 trillion to the  U.S. economy annually, has the largest economic impact of any major  sector, and accounts for more than three-quarters of all private-sector  research and development in the Nation. I support American  manufacturing wholeheartedly.   However, my good friend's amendment is not about American  manufacturing. It is about the many complaints that I have had  regarding H.R. 1--and I have already stated--about Federal overreach in  mandating States to comply with a requirement that is within their  jurisdiction.   This bill continues to burden the American taxpayer by adding  programs that would be footed by everyday Americans and would have to  be paid for by county governments, by local governments, and  municipalities that already have budgets that are stretched too thin.  It is another unfunded mandate. It is another unfunded mandate from the  Federal Government.   Unnecessary regulations of election equipment also present an undue  burden on the States who administer these elections. This requirement  gives State and local officials less options. This is ultimately a  federalism issue. We believe that our State and local governments can  maintain safe, secure elections that allow every one of their  constituents, our constituents, to vote, and also ensure that every  single American who is eligible to vote has their vote counted and has  their vote protected. That is our goal.   H.R. 1 doesn't accomplish this goal, and much to my chagrin, I say to  my friend from Wisconsin, I am opposed to this amendment, although I am  not opposed to him.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chairwoman, again, this  amendment, I am opposed to because I believe it is Federal overreach,  but I do want to address an issue. As we can see, this would require  American manufacturers to begin producing even more pieces of equipment  that would then have to comply by the standards of this amendment,  which is fine.   I am all for creating American jobs, but we also have a problem with  the underlying bill. I tried to pass an amendment in the only markup  that happened on this now almost-700-page bill. The amendment would  have made sure that anyone who helped craft this bill, especially the  special interest groups who were recognized on the day this bill was  introduced and announced at a press conference, people who helped write  this bill should have to sign a document that says that they will not  profit from this.   What doesn't happen is, if somebody who helped craft this bill  decides to open a manufacturing facility and make money off of the  legislation, we need to know that. Because that amendment did not pass  during the markup process, we won't know if that happens.   I would love to work with my colleague from Wisconsin to put a  provision in place like that, and at that point in time this may be an  amendment I could support.   Before we talk about any more nineties music, I am going to yield  back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to  this.    Madam Chair, I thank my friend and  colleague from Florida and fellow 2012 election year classmate.   We want to make sure every vote is counted. We want to make sure that  every eligible voter in this country is registered, casts their votes,  and that their vote is protected.   I have a lot of faith in the American people, and I have a lot of  faith in the American voters. I think simple sets of instructions  under, above, or below a race may or may not be a consideration in  whether or not somebody decides to vote.   I find it ironic that most of the time my colleagues on the other  side of the aisle will blame ballot design, but only when they lose.  The fact that a Republican won in Florida meant that there is obviously  a ballot issue. The fact that a Republican won in the 2000 Presidential  race, it has got to be a ballot issue.   Let's address ballot issues throughout the country. Let's make sure  that we have the ability to plan ahead, and that is what this bill  doesn't do. It doesn't plan ahead and allow us to look at what is the  next best, safest voting technology in the future. This bill will  require paper marked ballots when we don't know what may or may not be  safer in the future, but we are going to limit ourselves now.   Now, my biggest concern with this amendment is it is another example  of this bill being rushed. If this were a well-thought-out piece of  legislation, then we wouldn't need amendments clarifying the bill's  intent.   This amendment in particular shows how we should have taken more time  in the markup, and we should have had more committees that had  jurisdiction mark this bill up instead of the vague language that is  scattered throughout the bill.   If Members had more than 15 minutes of questioning--which I had in  the one hearing as the ranking Republican on the committee, the only  committee that marked this bill up--then we could have gotten to the  bottom of this vague language.   Madam Chair, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman  from Georgia (Mr. Collins), my colleague.    Madam Chair, Mr. Collins is showing,  once again, that in the immortal words of the best-selling band of the  2000s, Nickelback, if today was your last day, I would always yield to  my good friend from Georgia (Mr. Collins).   Vote ``no.''   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I rise in opposition.    Madam Chair, I appreciate my colleague  from Virginia offering this amendment. I know he misspoke when he said  $25 is being authorized in this amendment. It is actually $25 million  that is being authorized.   That is my biggest hang-up with the bill. We have got a lot of  pressing things in this country that $25 million can be spent on:  infrastructure projects, pediatric cancer research, and putting it  towards curing Alzheimer's, ALS, what have you, a lot of other  priorities. We don't need a Federal program that is going to  potentially cost $25 million to do what States, localities, and local  organizations are doing right now.   I commend the gentleman for wanting to get more young people  involved. I have got 18-year-olds. I sometimes wish they were a little  more interested in what was happening at all levels of government, but  that comes with time.   It is interesting the gentleman talks about being around the dinner  table with family talking about what it means to serve and what it  means to enact policy. That is how I got here.                                time  1515    I am the son of a 16-year-old who walked into a fast-food restaurant  and then never left and is going to celebrate 60 years with the same  company this year. Because he had a dream to own his own restaurant one  day, my dad was able to move us to Illinois and achieve the American  Dream.   He and my mom, a high school dropout, taught me around the dinner  table how decisions in Washington and in Springfield, Illinois,  affected their ability to hire people at their local McDonald's in  Taylorville, Illinois.   That is what got me interested in politics. That is what got me  interested in government. Much to the chagrin of some on the other side  of the aisle and some on my own side of the aisle, that is probably why  I am here.   We want to encourage young people, but that encouragement happens  around the dinner table. It happens already, and it shouldn't cost $25  million.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, may I inquire how much  time I have left.    Madam Chair, I appreciate the  chairperson offering her support for this amendment. She mentioned it  is tough to put a price on democracy. That is exactly what H.R. 1 is  doing.   The price of democracy in every single congressional district, for  every single candidate running for Congress, is now, according to this  bill, $4.5 million in corporate money and, eventually, taxpayer  dollars. That is the price of democracy that my Democratic colleagues  have put into every Member of Congress' campaign coffers if this bill  goes through.   The price of democracy should be the freedoms that we enjoy on the  floor of this great institution to be able to debate back and forth.  The price of democracy should not be legislated at $4.5 million for  each and every Member of Congress who is blessed enough to serve in  this institution.   Madam Chair, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman  from Georgia (Mr. Collins), my good friend.    Madam Chair, I yield back the balance  of my time.    Madam Chair, I claim the time in  opposition.    Madam Chair, personally, Sunday  mornings are sacred for me and my family and for a lot of other people,  too, including those public servants who work the polls on early  voting.   But this isn't about Sunday or any other day. It is about my  colleagues dictating to States and local officials on how they should  run their elections.  [[Page H2543]]    State and local election officials know their voters best and what  works for them. This amendment is yet another example of the Federal  Government trying to push a one-size-fits-all standard on States and  localities.   I don't believe the Federal Government should be mandating to States  how to run their elections, even to the minute details such as polling  hours, especially because, I guess, in my home State, it already  happens.   When you look at my district, they have early voting hours on  Sundays, so I don't know how widespread the problem is since it already  happens in Illinois. It seems like another top-down approach that could  adversely affect some communities, especially rural communities, that  may not be able to afford to have a polling place open on Sundays.   It is a problem with the entire bill. The costs keep going up and up  and up on our local officials without a lot of certainty that funds are  going to flow to help them with that.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I have kind of said all I  need to say about this amendment, so while I have a few extra minutes,  I understand the chairperson has received an estimate from a joint  committee regarding how much this new corporate funding program for  congressional campaigns will bring into the Federal Government over the  next 10 years.   First, I would love to see a copy of that, now that we are only 1 day  away from voting on this bill. This is eerily similar to the games that  my colleagues across the aisle played with the Congressional Budget  Office score. I will remind them once again that we still don't have a  figure of how much this section of H.R. 1 will cost American taxpayers.   Second, if we look at the potential cost of the 6-to-1 government  match program and the Presidential campaign matching program, these  together could represent billions and billions of dollars every  election cycle.   Now, what you will hear from the other side is that, if they don't  have the funds for these programs, the caps for these programs would  uniformly be lowered. What that means is that either the programs will  die or my counterparts across the aisle are going to turn to taxpayer  dollars to ask us to fulfill what they have claimed as absolutely  necessary programs.   What does this sound like to you, a well-thought-out public policy  proposal or a shell game with American tax dollars?   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, how much time do I have  left, if I may inquire?    Madam Chair, this is another clear  example of why this bill needs to be voted down or put back, preferably  put back to committee.   I am the ranking member of the House Administration Committee, and I  stood across this floor from my colleagues who now use the excuse and  say, Well, it was submitted into the Record yesterday.   There has been a lack of communication, a lack of bipartisan outreach  from the Democratic side of the aisle, and this is another example of  the ``Keystone-coppish'' behavior of the folks that have introduced now  an upwards of 700-page bill that has not been marked up, has not been  discussed, debated by 40 percent of the committees that have--by nine  other committees that have jurisdiction over 40 percent of the bill.   So when I hear the chairperson talk about jurisdictional issues as to  why she couldn't discuss this with me in our markup process, I am  wondering why she couldn't turn and tap me on the shoulder, since I was  about 6 inches away, and say, Hey, we don't have jurisdiction, but here  is what we estimate this is going to cost.   It just goes to show that this is a shell game. This is a game that  is going to cost taxpayers billions. This is a game that we, and the  American taxpayers, are going to have to pay for; and it is offensive  that we have zero communication.   I have shown time and time again--we Republicans have offered and  supported bipartisan--supported Democrat amendments. We have offered  the olive branch of bipartisanship throughout this process to try and  make this bill better, and we have been shut down by the Democrats  every single time we have and every step of the way.   This bill is not going to guarantee that every single American voter  who is eligible to vote has their vote counted and has their vote  protected. What this is going to guarantee is that this bill is going  to be rammed through on a partisan roll call tomorrow.   This bill is going to cost taxpayers billions, and we are not going  to have the price tag because the Democrat majority, who is trying to  enrich themselves and their own campaigns, the Democratic majority, who  is trying to keep themselves in a permanent majority, are going to  obfuscate, put new programs, and plans, and charades, and shell games  in place, that are going to end up costing taxpayers, put more  corporate money into congressional campaigns and, in turn, break the  American taxpayers under the guise of election reforms.   Madam Chair, this process is not what the Democratic majority  promised when they took over. This process has been riddled with a lack  of bipartisanship, a lack of transparency, and special interests  helping write this  [[Page H2544]]  mammoth, now 700-page bill that is going to nationalize our election  systems and put billions of dollars into the campaign coffers of  Congressmen and Congresswomen throughout this Nation.   That is not what the taxpayers of this country want. That is not what  we are demanding. And it is an affront. I hope everybody votes ``no''  on this amendment and this bill.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I claim the time in  opposition.    Madam Chair, I am proud to be a  champion for open and fair elections, and encouraging all American  citizens to participate in their fundamental right to cast their vote.   My challenge to this amendment is similar to my larger challenges to  the underlying bill. What this amendment seeks to do is already a  Federal requirement and is updating its specific requirement.   This is a great example of when the Federal Government steps into  legislating something that is outside of its jurisdiction, and is  forced to update its own legislation.   State and local election officials are charged with determining how  to best administer fair elections and open elections for all of their  citizens. This includes notifying them of their polling place, and of  any changes. Federally mandating details is unnecessary and, really,  not the role of the Federal Government.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I again thank my friend  and colleague from the great State of Maryland for offering the  amendment. Unfortunately, I have to be opposed to this amendment for  the variety of reasons I mentioned.   I believe in the greatness of America. I believe we have a great  system where other countries from around this globe only wish they  could choose their own leaders, like Americans get the opportunity to  do so.   We have a system of federalism. We have a system that, I believe,  works best from the bottom up; and I believe a top-down approach, that  this 700-page mammoth bill will provide for our local election  officials, will hinder them, and cost them, and stop them from being  able to administer the best, most open elections they possibly can.   I have a lot of faith in the county election officials that are  operating in my district, in central and southwestern Illinois. I  believe they run a very fair election process. I want to give them the  tools and the flexibility to meet the needs of my constituents and our  constituents; and the Federal Government doesn't need to be the voice  to do so. Our local officials can do that better.   I am ready to close, so I will just reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield back the balance  of my time.    Madam Chair, I claim the time in  opposition to the amendment.    Madam Chair, I have said the same thing  about previous amendments. I think this is an overreach issue. I don't  think the Federal Government should be involved in the minute details  of early voting hours.   States aren't asking us to set our hours here in Congress; we  shouldn't, as the Federal Government, ask our State and local election  officials who know better how to run free, fair, and a lot less costly  election processes.   We have got a problem in this country, Madam Chair, with a shortage  of election day workers. We have got a problem with poll workers.   In my home State of Illinois, every other year it is a holiday. It  hasn't helped us get more election workers. It hasn't helped us get  more poll workers. What it has done is it has created a holiday and a  day off where many people can come vote or they can enjoy the already  open early voting processes that States like mine have in place and the  opportunities to cast their votes in a wide variety of ways.   This is another example of a Federal top-down approach that obviously  shows there is a distinct difference between my Democrat colleagues and  me and all of us on this side of the aisle. We believe in a bottom-up  approach of governing; they believe in a top-down approach.   The bottom-up approach, I believe, leads to more efficiencies, leads  to fairer and better and freer elections, and a top-down approach is  nothing but costly to the taxpayers in unfunded mandates.   One thing that really frustrates me is, if you are going to impose  Federal mandates, you cannot leave States open to the potential  liability because the mandate is so broad. And that is exactly what  this bill does. That is exactly why I am opposed to this amendment.   Madam Chair, I am ready to close. I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I thank my colleague from  Maryland.   You know, like some of the legislation we pass here, it has to go  through the rulemaking process later. That is no different than our  forefathers and our Founders of the Constitution.   If you read Alexander Hamilton, he responds to the concerns that the  power of the national government to determine the time, places, and  manner of elections of the Representatives of the House might actually,  at that time, result in the elevation of the wealthy over the mass of  citizens.   The fear seems to have been that the national government may conspire  to hold elections in only parts of the States populated by the wealthy.  That would presumably prevent lower income citizens from voting.   Hamilton rejected that fear on several grounds, including the fact  that such places do not exist, but that the rich are scattered  throughout the States.   Hamilton argued that every member of this country should have the  right to vote, but the Federal overreach should not be something we are  actually encouraging right now.   Let's look at what our forefathers actually said about the provisions  in the Constitution, just not using them to put forth a political  agenda.   Madam Chair, I am urging a ``no'' vote on this amendment, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to  the amendment.    Madam Chair, this amendment would have  the effect of the Federal Government compiling statistics without  context and without vetting on very serious criminal matters. Unless  there was some sort of follow-up on the reports, it could actually do  more harm than good.   I am also afraid that certain partisan organizations could take  advantage of this. So bear with me. Let's talk through this and let's  see how this would work.   People call into this hotline, submit allegations of serious crimes,  and then it is sent to the State and now the Federal Government.  Partisan groups who helped author this bill would then use statistics  from the hotline to then bring unverified lawsuits under the new third- party actions that are allowed in this bill.   This is a recipe for disaster. The stated purpose of H.R. 1 is to  increase transparency in politics, but instead, unfortunately, this  provision would only invite corruption.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I believe the EAC,  Election Assistance Commission, is supposed to track this information.   The key point, too, that I made earlier is that there is no  verification, and that is a problem with this amendment. It is a  problem with the bill. There are no protections for bad behavior.   This is why we tried to get rid of ballot harvesting. It was why the  amendment was offered in committee. I mean, we have already seen what  bad actors can do.   It cost taxpayers hundreds of thousands of dollars in North Carolina,  and they have to run a new special election, but that is okay because  that may not have been a crime in California. But that is all right.  The Democrats didn't want to accept that because they might like the  process somewhere else.   I think what is wrong is wrong and we ought to be able to have  protections. I am not convinced that the American people have the  protections that they need and that they deserve to stop what happened  in North Carolina from happening somewhere else.   This is another example of overreach, another example of something  already happening, already existing agencies that should be compiling  this information; and there are no safeguards and there will be no  verification of allegations, and that is unfortunate.    Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, we would love to take up  ballot harvesting today, too, but, unfortunately, we are not given the  chance to. The Democrats voted it down in the only markup that we had,  the smallest committee in Congress, 5 hours last week, with 40 percent  of the bill not going through regular order, not going through the  committee process.   This is not a process that has been open. It is not a process that  has been transparent. It is not a process that has been bipartisan.   Clearly, we have accepted many Democrat amendments on our side. Not  one single Republican amendment has been accepted by the Democrat side.   Madam Chair, I urge a ``no'' vote on this amendment, and I yield back  the balance of my time.  [[Page H2547]]     Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to  the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Meuser), my good friend, one of our  newest Members, and a great guy.  [[Page H2561]]         Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for participating in the process,  and I would like to ask the gentleman a question about the amendment.   I know you have been here before. We haven't had the chance to really  meet, but congratulations. I look forward to working with you.   Is this just raising the limit that political parties can give from  $5,000 to $10,000?    I yield to the gentleman from Hawaii.    Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for  the clarification. I appreciate that.   I am still opposed to the amendment because, unfortunately, these  incentivization programs that are code word incentivized are part of  H.R. 1, and instead I think they are going to be gamed by many of the  same people who are gaming the system right now.   Many of my colleagues on the Democratic side of the aisle said they  want to get money out of politics, and we are talking about putting  more in. The amendment here is just a small part of a big problem of  what this bill is about.   Mr. Meuser talked about how bad this bill is going to be about  getting money back into politics. If the goal is to take money out of  politics, then H.R. 1 clearly is not the answer. This amendment, while  great intentions to my colleague from Hawaii trying to do what we can,  I would love to sit down with the gentleman in a bipartisan way to talk  about how we can make campaign finance reforms work.   But the clear fact is we have been shown zero consideration as  Republicans over here to try and work out solutions in this bill. We  weren't asked to even be considered to help write provisions in this  bill. No one was even called, none of us, no one on our side. As a  matter of fact, I guess we didn't know the special interest groups who  helped write this bill and who were touted in the press conference when  this bill was announced.   We got zero Republican amendments passed during our markup in only  one committee, which left 40 percent of the bill out from being marked  up. That is not the regular order that the Democrats promised when you  took the majority. That is what we get.   Today, the olive branch has been extended numerous times. I have  accepted Democrat amendments, and do you know what? Not a single  Republican amendment has passed, even one during the last round of  votes that all it did was give a sense of Congress that we like free  speech.   Seriously? You have got to be kidding me. You couldn't even accept  that amendment? How partisan can this new Democrat majority be?   This is why this bill is terrible. It is the biggest terrible bill I  have ever seen in my time here in Congress.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Will the gentleman yield?    Real quick, I was not referring to the  amendment. It was the bill itself.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to  this amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, it is great to have you in the chair again tonight.   I rise to oppose this amendment; although, again, I want to  compliment my new colleague, Ms. Houlahan, for coming down here and  being a participant in the legislative process. It has been great to  get to know the gentlewoman and work with her, and I look forward to  working together on a bipartisan basis as we move forward during this  term.   I have got to oppose this amendment because I have opposed others  that are just like it.   We want every American to be able to cast their vote, to be  registered to vote, and to be able to have their vote counted and their  vote protected. My issue is with a top-down approach from the Federal  Government versus the State and local governments. This amendment,  though well-intentioned, just, again, infringes on our State and local  officials' ability to determine how best to run their elections.   Additionally, this mandate increases the cost of all election  offices, as it is tasked to recruit, train, and deploy additional poll  workers, where we already know we have a shortage.   I would love to work with my colleague, Ms. Houlahan, moving forward  to address many issues involving election reform. Unfortunately, I just  don't think H.R. 1 is the answer, and I don't think it is going to be  passed into law, so there are going to be opportunities for us to work  together. Again, my bipartisan olive branch is reaching out, once  again, to the gentlewoman's side, and I certainly hope we can do so.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the comments from the author of this bill.  He and I have had some spirited discussions over the last day and a  half, but I appreciate his willingness to want to address issues. I  just don't think this bill is the answer.   To respond to the author of the bill, there is a big difference  between offering best practices to our State and local officials about  how best to run their elections, there is a big difference between best  practices and suggestions versus mandates, and that is clearly what  H.R. 1 is. It is going to be a mandate.   It is so nebulous. We get answers one day that change the next. There  is zero bipartisanship. We haven't been included. All of a sudden, we  get a new shell game: Move over; we are going to fund it by doing this  and put corporate money now into congressional campaigns, which is  illegal now, but I guess it is a solution for getting money out of  politics to the majority.   I don't understand this. This has got to be one of the most  discombobulated processes that I have ever been a part of. I can't help  myself to think there is no way that every Democrat who cosponsored  this bill on day one thinking they were going to talk about election  reform had any idea of so many of the terrible, terrible provisions for  taxpayers that are in this bill.    Again, Mr. Chairman, if you vote for this bill, you are putting  corporate cash into congressional campaigns. There is no way the  billions upon billions of promises that are made to congressional  candidates and incumbents are going to be able to be fulfilled with  this new, nebulous corporate malfeasance fund that we haven't even had  scored by the CBO.   Billions of dollars of taxpayer money are going to fund a revamp of  how public money goes into congressional campaigns. This is the worst  of the worst of the worst of what the D.C. swamp is all about.   I am going to lightly oppose this amendment because I really respect  Ms. Houlahan and her efforts. I just have a big problem with the bill,  as I think you can tell.   Mr. Chairman, I will give Ms. Houlahan, likely, the last word. I  reserve my right to close, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I think every American  who is eligible to vote deserves to have the right to vote, to have  their vote counted, and to have their vote be protected.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, once again, I claim time  in opposition.    Mr. Chair, the language of the  amendment is pretty innocuous. The problem I have is the portion of the  bill that it is amending, the sheer fact that, in this now almost 700- page, mammoth bill that anyone thinks it is a good idea to weaponize  the FEC by making it partisan. It is the furthest thing from where we  should be as an institution.   This amendment is going to do nothing to address this partisan FEC  that the bill establishes.   The biggest threat to our elections is actually partisanship, and a  partisan FEC will undermine the neutrality that voters expect of an  agency that oversees Federal elections, especially when the billions  upon billions upon billions of new dollars come in from the programs  that are created in this bill.   A partisan FEC is going to give enhanced powers to the chairman to  make decisions on behalf of the commission that have been reserved for  years for the full commission.   I fully expect a lower standard of protection of free speech to be  embraced by a partisan FEC.   As a former chairman of our own Franking Commission here in the House  of Representatives, I think bipartisan agencies can work together,  bipartisan commissions can work together.   Heck, we are not even allowed to send a bulk mail piece out of this  institution without Republicans and Democrats signing off on it. If we  can't send bulk mail out without it being bipartisan, why in the world  would we want to make the FEC partisan?   Do the Democrats really want the Trump administration to have a  partisan FEC? I don't want any party to have a partisan FEC. I want it  to remain an institution where it takes bipartisanship to get results.   I would urge my good friend, Mr. Phillips, if he hasn't, to sit down  with some of the FEC commissioners and talk to them about their opinion  of why the FEC is bipartisan, and I would urge the gentleman to work  with them.   This bill is not going to pass. The amendment, likely, will get ruled  by the chairman to be a part of this bill. The bill is not going to  become law. It is going to go die in the Senate. But I would urge the  gentleman to work with the FEC, talk with them on the reason why, why  it is bipartisan.   We don't want our Ethics Committee here in the House to have a  partisan edge. We don't want our Franking Commission to have a partisan  edge.   Why in the world do we want the FEC to have a partisan edge?   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, again, I have a problem with  the underlying bill and the FEC issue.   It is not that hard to be bipartisan when we send bulk mail in the  House. It may take a little longer. It may be a little more difficult.  But, you know what, bipartisanship works. There is a reason for it  here.   Frankly, if the FEC isn't working, if the FEC is such an agency that  has zero credibility in the mind of the majority right now, then why in  the world are we spending time marking up a 700-page, mammoth bill in  the House Administration Committee when we ought to just reauthorize  the FEC?   I certainly hope that our committee can work toward making that  happen. And that is something that has not been done that we should be  able to get bipartisanship on. I look forward to working with  Chairperson Lofgren when that day comes over the next 2 years.   Mr. Chair, I am going to oppose the amendment because of the  underlying language regarding the FEC.  [[Page H2564]]    I commend Mr. Phillips for being here to legislate. I welcome the  gentleman to Congress, and I look forward to working with him and  appreciate his opportunity to be a part of the process. I thank the  gentleman for letting me be a part of it with him.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I am going to rise in  opposition to this amendment, although I am not opposed.    Mr. Chair, I am not opposed to this  amendment.   I just want to take the time to welcome our new colleague, the  gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Levin), and I would like the gentleman to  give my utmost thanks to his dad, who we stood on this floor, with  these same microphones, and I was able to work in a bipartisan way with  him to pass the EACH Act that allowed for a religious exemption from  the individual mandates of ObamaCare, of the Affordable Care Act.   That is now law, and that is a sign of bipartisanship that I hope to  be able to continue while we work together.   Give him my best. The Christian Scientists that are in my district at  Principia College, one of the largest Christian Science institutions in  the Nation, are very thankful that they are not now being penalized by  the Tax Code for a religious exemption from seeking medical care from  doctors and medical professionals.   So my thanks to the gentleman's father, and I thank the gentleman for  being here.   Mr. Chair, I am not going to oppose this amendment. I will reserve  just in case somebody wants to come up and talk about something else  and I can rebut them, but I am ready to close if the gentleman is.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I am going to be bipartisan  once again. I urge a ``yes'' vote on this amendment, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in  opposition, although I am not opposed to the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I thank my colleague from  Massachusetts. It is great to see her, and I thank her for putting this  amendment forward.   I have a problem with the underlying provisions of the bill. I  actually support redistricting reforms.   I am from Illinois. I am a Republican. We are not going to have a  single say in how the Democrats in the supermajority Illinois House and  the supermajority Illinois Senate, and our newly elected Democratic  Governor, we are not going to have a say in how these maps are drawn.   I certainly hope we can get an independent redistricting commission  because, since this bill is not going to pass the Senate, it is not  going to become law. I certainly hope that we could come together and  work on some independent redistricting issues.   Mr. Chair, I will, again, not oppose the amendment.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I am highly concerned  with the redistricting provisions in this bill now. It seems that now,  as part of the bill, that one State is going to be exempted out.   At what point, then, do we not question why everyone doesn't have the  same ability to opt out of provisions of this bill, just like the State  of Iowa has done in an amendment that was accepted.   The sheer fact that if Iowa's independent redistricting commission is  better and, thus, we shouldn't have to apply the same standards as the  other 49 States in this great Nation, then why don't we use Iowa's  independent redistricting commission standards for everyone? Why don't  we make the whole bill about Iowa?   I mean, I have been talking about federalism and States having to  follow top-down Federal mandates, in most cases, that are going to be  unfunded or nebulously funded because we really don't know how they are  going to get those funds to our States and localities. But the sheer  fact that we are debating a bill that has a provision about independent  redistricting that could have been very, very bipartisan, now we have  exempted one State out, it basically tells all of us that is a better  commission.   I hope that when we come back, after this bill passes the House,  unfortunately for many of my colleagues who are going to vote for it on  the other side of the aisle, I hope we can come together and have the  debate on whether Iowa's commission is better than what was proposed in  this bill.   You cannot have a 700-page bill that talks about how gloriously good  for the people it is, for all of the provisions that are this top-down  approach, and then, all of a sudden, you exempt one State out of what  could have been one of the most bipartisan provisions, and that is  independent redistricting.   If you are serious about governing, the majority ought to offer an  amendment, ought to offer a change, to make Iowa's independent  commission the language of this bill. Make it work in States, even  where they have independent commissions.   I would sure like it to work in Illinois. Maybe California would want  to use Iowa's commission because clearly it is better than what you  have in the bill, or we wouldn't have had to take an amendment on it.    Well, I think I got my point across.   I say to the gentlewoman from Massachusetts (Mrs. Trahan), your  amendment is a good amendment. I apologize I had to use this time to  address an issue that is very frustrating, but the gentlewoman is  talking about redistricting.   I appreciate what she has done. I welcome her to the floor of the  House, and I look forward to working with her.   Again, my offer to the gentlewoman is the same as others. When this  bill fails in the Senate, let's come together on some provisions. I  will continue to throw the bipartisan olive branch out toward that side  of the aisle, and I look forward to working with the gentlewoman.  Congratulations. I won't oppose the amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in  opposition, although, once again, I am not opposed to the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, this is a great  amendment. I commend Mrs. Trahan because it is vitally important that  we protect the families of our Nation's military. It is very important  we remember those who sacrifice everything to serve us, and we should  ensure that they are able to weigh in to whomever represents them in  government.   I am going to vote ``yes'' on this amendment, again, an olive branch  to the other side of the aisle.   I appreciate the gentlewoman's willingness to legislate. It is great  to work with her, and I will be supporting this amendment.   Since I see the chair up, in case she says something I have to rebut,  I will reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, let the Record show that  I liked the amendment first. I liked it before the chairperson.   Listen, it is a great amendment, and I look forward to voting for it.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in  opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chair, I don't know if I have had a  chance to formally meet Mr. Kim. I welcome him and thank him for being  here to participate in the process.   Mr. Speaker, I guess I would like to have some details on what  percentage of ballots that are used in the United States right now are  not printed in the U.S.   The issue I have is not with United-States-made printing materials,  it is with the sheer fact that we are having a top-down approach once  again.   I mean, there is always going to be extenuating circumstances. Some  of our territories may raise the cost of importing paper to be able to  now live up to the paper ballot marking whatever requirements that are  in this 700-page bill.   We can work together on these provisions, but we also might want to  work together as this bill fails in the Senate.   Mr. Chair, if this is something Mr. Kim wants to work on together, I  am willing to work on it with him, but let's have some room in there  for some exceptions.   I mean, let's say it is almost election day, you have got wildfires  roaring all over California and there is a paper shortage in the  country. We can't stop the election, so maybe we need some exceptions.  We can't stop the election, maybe we need an exception.   So let's work together, let's do something like that so that nobody  loses a chance to be able to cast their vote on election day, to have  their vote counted, and even just as importantly, to have their vote  protected.   Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman for his amendment. I have got to  oppose this, because there are no exceptions in here, but I appreciate  the gentleman's willingness to work together after this is done.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.  [[Page H2567]]         Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman from  New Jersey.   Look, I am all for increasing American manufacturing, I am all for  building new paper plants, but I would urge my colleagues on the other  side of the aisle to remember they are probably going to burn more  fossil fuels. You know, if we are going to have to cut down more trees,  maybe we will get some bipartisanship when it comes to deforestation,  which could help cut down on forest fires that may cause the problems  that would need the exceptions that we talked about earlier.   So I certainly hope this fits into the New Green Deal provisions that  are going to be voted on in the Senate.   There is a lot of talk about paper in this bill. And in this bill,  actually the paper keeps growing. It is upwards of 700 pages now.   Mr. Chair, I just got a very important piece of paper with the new  CBO score, so I assume we are going to be talking about that soon.    I yield to the gentlewoman from  California.    Mr. Chair, I am all for more paper  production. Those paper plants that exist in my district, you know,  they use recycled materials, too. I am more than happy to have more  trees be deforested out of areas that are caught up in wildfires on an  annual basis.   If we could have the paper that is going to work, if the other side  is okay with burning more fossil fuels to make this happen, hey, maybe  we won't need those exceptions I talked about, maybe we will have  enough American manufacturing and paper jobs. Some of the best paying  jobs in my district are at the paper mills.   Mr. Chair, I am certainly looking forward to working with the  gentleman when this bill fails. Especially after seeing some of the  preliminary numbers out of this new CBO score. I don't know how many  cosponsors of this bill are going to actually be able to cast a vote  for it, but I will reserve judgment until I see the board tomorrow.   Mr. Chair, I am ready to close, but since I have the right to close,  I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of  my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in  opposition to the amendment, even though I am not opposed to it. I  think this is a darn good amendment.    Mr. Chair, I am going to support this  amendment.   Mr. Chair, it is great to work with Ms. Spanberger, and I thank her  for her service as an intelligence officer for our great Nation. This  is an issue that she knows better than me and she knows better than  most of us here in this institution. I look forward to supporting this  amendment, and I welcome the gentlewoman to the U.S. House of  Representatives and look forward to working with her.   Mr. Chair, I would love to work with the gentlewoman on issues like  this when this bill does not pass the Senate and is signed into law and  we can work together in a bipartisan way. I will continue to show  bipartisanship. I congratulate and welcome the gentlewoman.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, again, let the Record  show I was for the amendment once again before the chairperson. I  should get kudos.   Listen, this is a good amendment. I congratulate the gentlewoman on  her election, being a Member of Congress, and helping to legislate and  participate.   I also want to use a few seconds to really highlight the work of our  intelligence officials in the administration and our Department of  Homeland Security, especially Secretary Nielsen and her team, working  with our local officials in Illinois before the last election to ensure  that there was no nefarious activity that could have come about in our  home State.   Our home State election officials got a lot of accolades from the  Department of Homeland Security, and I think the Department of Homeland  Security and their team, especially Secretary Nielsen, deserve the  accolades, also.   So, with that, I am ready to close. I congratulate Ms. Spanberger.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    May I reclaim my time?    Mr. Chair, how much time do I have  left?    Mr. Chair, I am having a lot of fun  down here, but I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I claim time in opposition,  although I am going to do the right thing and not oppose this  amendment.    Mr. Chair, I know our time together  tonight is winding down. This, I think, is the last amendment we are  going to debate tonight.   I thank Ms. Slotkin for her amendment and thank her for her service  to our country. It is a pleasure to be able to serve in this great  institution with the gentlewoman.   As I said, I am not going to oppose the gentlewoman's amendment.  Congratulations. I certainly wish this would be part of something that  could go into law, because this bill is not going to go into law. I  certainly look forward to working with her to address these issues as  we move forward.   Congratulations, and I thank the gentlewoman again for her service  here now.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time    Well, I would be remiss to not thank my  colleague from Maryland (Mr. Sarbanes) for being a cosponsor of this  amendment. We have had some lively discussions back and forth. My  apologies. I thank the gentleman for his efforts on this amendment,  too.   I am ready to close, but congratulations once again to Ms. Slotkin.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I include in the Record a  list of groups such as the Hispanic Leadership Fund, The LIBRE  Initiative, Americans for Tax Reform, Coalition to Reduce Spending, the  National Right to Life, Heritage Action for America, and the Chamber of  Commerce and several  [[Page H2570]]  letters in opposition to H.R. 1, obviously, or I don't think I would be  entering them into the Record.         The following organizations oppose H.R. 1:        ACLU        U.S. Chamber of Commerce along with over 300 Chamber's of       Commerce and industry groups        Freedom Works        National Right to Life        Heritage Action for America        Republican National Lawyers Association        March for Life Action        Conservative Action Project        Club for Growth        Americans for Tax Reform        National Taxpayers Union        Coalition to Reduce Spending        Americans for Prosperity        The LIBRE Initiative        Concerned Veterans for America        Faith and Freedom Coalition        Hispanic Leadership Fund        National Association for Gun Rights        Goldwater Institute        American Bankers Association        Agricultural Retailers Association        American Petroleum Institute        National Grocers Association        Associated Builders and Contractors        National Association of Manufacturers        Insurance Associates, Inc.        Airlines for America                                   ____                                              National Right to Life                                                  Committee, Inc.                                      Washington, DC, March 5, 2019.      Re H.R. 1, the so-called ``For the People Act of 2019''.         Dear Representative: The National Right to Life Committee       (NRLC), representing state right-to-life organizations       nationwide, urges you to oppose the so-called ``For the       People Act of 2019'' (H.R. 1), introduced by Rep. John       Sarbanes.        This legislation has been carefully crafted to maximize       short-term political benefits for the dominant faction of one       political party, while running roughshod over the First       Amendment protections for political speech that have been       clearly and forcefully articulated by the U.S. Supreme Court       in a series of landmark First Amendment rulings, culminating       in FEC v. Wisconsin Right to Life, 551 U.S. 449 (2007) and       Citizens United v. Federal Election Com'n, 558 U.S. 310       (2010).        Because this legislation would severely impede the exercise       of our organization's constitutional rights, and the rights       and privacy of our donors and supporters, NRLC intends to       include any roll call that occurs on H.R. 1 in our scorecard       of key roll calls of the 116th Congress:        Enactment of H.R. 1 would not be a curb on corruption, but       is itself a type of corruption--an abuse of the lawmaking       power, by which incumbent lawmakers employ the threat of       criminal sanctions, among other deterrents, to reduce the       amount of private speech regarding the actions of the       lawmakers themselves. Further, this legislation would add a       commissioner to the Federal Election Commission (FEC),       causing a partisan takeover by significantly increasing the       likelihood that the agency could make decisions benefiting       the political party in power.                         The true purposes of H.R. 1         Our organization's name and contact information always       appear on our public communications, and we openly proclaim       the public policies that we advocate. But there is very       little in this bill, despite the pretenses, that is actually       intended to provide useful or necessary information to the       public. The overriding purpose is precisely the opposite: To       discourage, as much as possible, disfavored groups (such as       National Right to Life) from communicating about       officeholders, by exposing citizens who support such efforts       to harassment and intimidation, and by smothering       organizations in layer on layer of record keeping and       reporting requirements, all backed by the threat of civil and       criminal sanctions.                   Speech-restrictive provisions of H.R. 1         The bill would codify, in Section 324, a vague and       expansive definition of ``the functional equivalent of       express advocacy,'' that applies to communications that       ``when taken as a whole, it can be interpreted by a       reasonable person only as advocating the election or defeat       of a candidate for election for Federal office.'' There is       little that an organization could say by way of commentary on       the votes or positions taken by an incumbent member of       Congress that would not fall within this expansive       definition, in the eyes of some ``reasonable person''--most       often, an annoyed incumbent lawmaker or his operatives.        The time periods over which the government would have       authority to regulate speech about those who hold or seek       federal office--so-called ``electioneering communications''--      would be dramatically expanded under H.R. 1.        H.R. 1 also contains additional provisions that would place       an unacceptable burden on the exercise of First Amendment       rights. H.R. 1 mandates burdensome disclaimers on television,       radio, and online advertisements that are likely to bury the       substantive message and make some advertising, especially       online, functionally impossible.                         Partisan Takeover of the FEC         In title VI, H.R. 1 would destroy the FEC's long-standing       bipartisan structure. Proponents claim that the provision is       aimed at ending ``frequent deadlocks,'' but this is a sham       argument leading down a dangerous road.        In the excellent piece by the Institute for Free Speech       (IFS), titled ``Establishing a Campaign Speech Czar and       Enabling Partisan Enforcement: An Altered FEC Structure Poses       Risks to First Amendment Speech Rights'' issued on January       31, Brad Smith comments,        But, in fact, tie votes have always been a small percentage       of FEC votes. Historically, they have totaled approximately       one percent to four percent of Commission votes on       enforcement matters. . . . Although critics claim that tie-      votes sap the FEC's ability to enforce campaign finance laws,       in fact, it is assuredly the opposite. The only reason that       the FEC has any legitimacy is its bipartisan makeup.       Particularly in the current environment, it is inconceivable       that an agency empowered to make prosecutorial decisions       about the legality of campaign tactics, communications,       funding, and activities on a straight party-line vote would       have any legitimacy.                             Disclosure of Donors         Our members and supporters have a right to support our       public advocacy about important and controversial issues       without having their identifying information posted online,       exposing them to harassment or retribution by those who may       disagree with their beliefs.        In an additional piece from the IFS, titled ``For the       People Act'' Replete with Provisions for the Politicians, by       Eric Wang, issued on January 23 he writes,        The right to associate oneself with a nonprofit group's       mission and to support the group financially in private is a       bedrock principle of the First Amendment that the government       may not abridge casually. This is particularly true when the       cause is contentious, such as abortion, gun control, LGBTQ       rights, or civil rights, and association with either side on       any of these issues may subject a member or donor to       retaliation, harassment, threats, and even physical attack,       as recent events have tragically reminded us. The potential       divisiveness of these issues does not diminish their social       importance and the need to hash out these debates in public       while preserving donors' privacy.        It should be self-evident that the real purpose of such       burdensome requirements is not to inform the public, but to       deter potential donors from financially supporting the work       of groups such as National Right to Life in the first place.        We strongly urge you to oppose this pernicious,       unprincipled, and constitutionally defective legislation. In       our scorecard and advocacy materials, the legislation will be       accurately characterized as a blatant political attack on the       First Amendment rights of National Right to Life, our state       affiliates, and our members and donors.            Sincerely,      Carol Tobias,        President.      David N. O'Steen, Ph.D.,        Executive Director.      Jennifer Popik, J.D.,        Legislative Director.                                   ____                                                      March 5, 2019.      House of Representatives,      Washington DC.        Dear Representative: On behalf of March for Life Action and       the millions of pro-life Americans who march to end abortion,       I am writing to voice our opposition to H.R. 1, the       misnomered ``For the People Act of 2019.'' Many aspects of       the bill seek to put an undue burden on organizations and       individuals who speak out for the unborn--discouraging these       people from participating in the political process. When H.R.       1 reaches the House floor March for Life Action will score a       ``yes'' vote negatively in our scorecard for the First       Session of the 116th Congress.        H.R. 1 would regulate a new category of speech--      communications that ``promote,'' ``attack,'' ``support,'' or       ``oppose'' (``PASO'') federal candidates and elected       officials. Under this broad and vague standard, groups that       merely speak about federal legislation or policy issues could       be forced to file FEC reports that they did not have to file       before. This is conflicting to Supreme Court precedent       limiting the regulation of speech to communications that       could have no reasonable meaning other than to advocate the       election or defeat of a candidate.        The main beneficiaries of H.R. 1 would be incumbent       politicians and campaign finance attorneys while those who       would suffer most would be grassroots activists. The       legislation would greatly increase the already onerous legal       and administrative compliance costs, liability risk, and       costs to donor and associational privacy for public groups       that help inform citizens speak about policy issues and       politicians. Instead of being able to inform the public       organizations will have to divert resources away from their       advocacy activities to pay for compliance staff and lawyers.       Some groups will not be able to afford these costs or will       violate the law unwittingly. Less speech by private citizens       and organizations means politicians will be able to act with       less accountability to public opinion and criticism.        When our great nation's founders articulated the rights of       Americans, they not only included the right to life but also       the right to free speech. As those who speak up for the       unborn, we uniquely combine those two rights. H.R. 1 would       take away one of those rights, the freedom of speech, making       it almost impossible for us to speak up for those  [[Page H2571]]       who cannot speak for themselves. For these reasons, March for       Life Action will score against the legislation our annual       scorecard for the First Session of the 116th Congress.            Sincerely,                                                   Thomas McClusky,      President, March for Life Action.                                   ____                                      Heritage Action for America,                                                      March 6, 2019.           KEY VOTE: ``NO'' ON THE ``FOR THE PEOPLE ACT'' (H.R. 1)     Heritage Action opposes the For The People Act (H.R. 1) and will           include it as a key vote on our legislative scorecard.         This week, the House will vote on H.R. 1, the ``For The       People Act.'' Lawmakers should not let this legislation's       misleading name fool them--it is comprised of       unconstitutional and ill-advised policy mandates that the       Democratic Party would use to hijack America's election       processes. H.R. 1 is a very long, complex bill that is a       liberal wish list of ``reforms'' ranging from voter       registration and elections to campaign finance, lobbying, and       judicial ethics.        Free and fair elections are the bedrock of American       government. They are fundamental to our way of life and       confidence in our representative system. H.R. 1 cloaks itself       in the guise of transparency and fairness but in reality is a       partisan scheme to choke off dissent and squelch Republican       candidates and conservative political voices. This bill is       aptly ``renamed'' by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell       as the ``Democrat Politician Protection Act.'' It is an       unprecedented attempt to seize control of elections through       federal government power.        This fundamentally flawed legislation establishes a new       taxpayer-funded bailout of political campaigns, weaponizes       the Federal Elections Commission by destroying the current       bipartisan makeup, and creates a new, subjective category of       ``campaign-related'' speech that is regulated by Washington       bureaucrats who are empowered to enforce these regulations       with penalties and censorship.        According to The Heritage Foundation, H.R. 1 would       implement the following changes:        1. Makes it easier to commit fraud and promotes chaos at       the polls through same-day registration, as election       officials have no time to verify the accuracy of voter       registration information and cannot anticipate the number of       voters, ballots, and precinct workers that will be needed to       ensure a safe and secure election process.        2. Degrades the accuracy of registration lists by       automatically registering individuals from state databases,       such as DMV and welfare offices, which provides an       opportunity to register large numbers of ineligible voters,       including aliens as well as multiple or duplicate       registrations of the same individuals.        3. Constitutes a recipe for massive voter registration       fraud by hackers and cyber criminals through online voter       registration not tied to an existing state record, such as a       driver's license.        4. Requires states to count ballots cast by voters outside       of their assigned precinct, overriding the precinct system       used by almost all states that allows election officials to       monitor votes, staff polling places, provide enough ballots,       and prevent election fraud.        5. Prevents election officials from checking the       eligibility and qualifications of voters and from removing       ineligible voters. This includes restrictions on using the       U.S. Postal Service's national change-of-address system to       verify the address of registered voters; participating in       state programs that compare voter registration lists to       detect individuals registered in multiple states; or ever       removing registrants due to a failure to vote.        6. Cripples the effectiveness of state voter ID laws by       allowing individuals to vote without an ID and to merely sign       a statement in which they claim they are who they say they       are.        7. Expands regulation and government censorship of       campaigns and political activity and speech, including online       and policy-related speech. H.R. 1 imposes onerous legal and       administrative compliance burdens and costs on candidates,       citizens, civic groups, unions, corporations, and nonprofit       organizations.        8. Requires states to unconstitutionally restore the       ability of felons to vote the moment they are out of prison.       Section 2 of the 14th Amendment gives states the       constitutional authority to decide when felons who committed       crimes against their fellow citizens may vote again. Congress       cannot override a constitutional amendment with a statute.        9. Transfers the right to draw congressional districts from       state legislatures to``independent'' commissions whose       members are unaccountable to voters. H.R. 1 makes it a       violation of federal law to engage in ``partisan''       redistricting and mandates inclusion of alien population,       both legal and illegal, in all redistricting. This is an       anti-democratic, unconstitutional measure that takes away the       ability of the citizens of a state to make their own decision       about redistricting.        10. Violates separation of powers and directly interfere       with the President's constitutional duties. H.R. 1 bans his       political appointees, such as the Attorney General, from       participating in, directing the defense of, or assisting in       any matter (including lawsuits against a President's       policies, programs, executive orders, or his enforcement of       the law) in which the President is named as a party.''        Although Democrats are promoting H.R. 1 as a bill that       would ``strengthen our democracy and return political power       to the people'', it is an anti-democratic bill that would       wreak havoc on our election system by manipulating election       rules in favor of Democrats. It is nothing but a progressive       power grab and Heritage Action urges all House Members to       vote against it.        Heritage Action opposes the For the People Act (H.R. 1) and       will include it as a key vote on our legislative scorecard.     I am not going to oppose this  amendment, and it has been great debating with the other side tonight.  I look forward to a livelier debate tomorrow.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent  that the Committee on the Judiciary be discharged from further  consideration of H.R. 962, the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection  Act, and ask for its immediate consideration in the House.    Madam Speaker, for the sake of innocent  lives, I urge the Speaker to immediately schedule this important bill.
