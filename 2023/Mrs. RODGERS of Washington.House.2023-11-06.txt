 Mr. Chair, I rise in support of my  amendment to recognize Washington State University and celebrate the  success of their ASCENT program. This program is the primary  university-based education and research vehicle for the FAA, and it is  laser focused on developing new and exciting technology we need to meet  the challenges of the 21st century.   By working with stakeholders and industry leaders, students and  faculty at WSU are showing the world what is possible. Their research  is revolutionizing the way we think about sustainable aviation fuel,  and it is helping secure a cleaner future.   Today, we have the opportunity to ensure the work continues. We can  fully fund the ASCENT program and make sure America continues to lead  the way to usher in a new era of innovation and win the future.   Mr. Chairman, this program will help America keep its competitive  edge, and I strongly urge my colleagues to support this amendment.
