 DAVIS of Illinois asked and was given permission to  address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)    DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to  a friend of mine who passed away a few days ago. His name is Dennis  Hood.   Dennis lived in public housing and has been a fierce advocate for  implementation of the Section 3 program. Despite the many illnesses  that Dennis had, he developed himself a small contracting business,  worked it well, but unfortunately passed away.   Mr. Speaker, I salute Dennis for his efforts to advocate for those  low-income residents who live in public housing.                            ____________________
