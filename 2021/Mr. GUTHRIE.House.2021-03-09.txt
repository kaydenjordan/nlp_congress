 Mr. Speaker, sadly, Kerry McDaniel passed away in  February at just 65 years of age from COVID-19 complications.   Kerry was described as ``can't be replaced,'' ``top-notch in every  regard,'' and ``an exemplary model of generosity and selflessness.''   Kerry loved serving his community and did so in various positions  throughout the years. For almost three decades, Kerry worked for the  Kentucky Department for Environmental Protection, and most recently, he  was the Hart County Emergency Management Director and Solid Waste  Coordinator.   As a frontline responder, he worked hard to obtain personal  protective equipment and protect Hart County from COVID-19. Throughout  the county, Kerry was known for his service and generosity to others.   Kerry is survived by his dear wife, Vicki; his son, Curtis; his  daughter-in-law, Tara; his grandson, Briar Allen, and many other family  members he loved so dearly.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to have known Kerry; he was an exemplary  citizen. Kerry was a great friend, and he will be missed by all who  knew him.                            ____________________
