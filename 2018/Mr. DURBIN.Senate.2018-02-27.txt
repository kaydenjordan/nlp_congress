 Mr. President, a few years ago, an author named Malcolm  Gladwell wrote a book titled ``The Tipping Point.'' He spelled out that  in the course of history, when something occurs that changes people's  thinking and actions, it is a precipitous moment where what has been  done for so long stops, is reevaluated, and a different course is  followed. The clear question we have in America today is whether we  have reached a tipping point when it comes to gun violence.   It has only been 13 days since the tragedy in Parkland, FL. Look at  what has happened since. Of course there is outrage, sadness, and  mourning for the families who lost these wonderful students, teachers,  and administrators, but beyond that, these high school students--17, 18  years old, some even younger--have become a national voice, a powerful  voice on the issue of gun safety in schools.   I often wondered when this moment might occur or whether it would  occur. There has been such a long litany and string of mass shootings  and massacres. It is sad to say that there was a numbness setting in.  When terrible things occurred in places like Las Vegas, Texas, and  other States, you wondered, is that the event? Will the killing of  those innocent children in Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut  be the tipping point? Will America finally say ``enough''? It appears  that on this day, 13 days after the tragedy in Florida, we are near or  at a tipping point when it comes to gun safety.   Some of it is very personal. Two weeks ago, after this occurred, my  6-year-old granddaughter said to her mother that she had been warned in  her first grade classroom that if a shooter should turn up at school  firing a gun, first, she should stay away from the windows, and second,  she should lie down on the floor. I can't tell you what a profound  impact that had on me as a grandfather to think that my little first  grader, this beautiful little girl, was worried about the moment when  somebody would walk in her classroom and wantonly try to kill the  students and teachers who are there.   I cannot believe that any sane person believes that the Second  Amendment to the Constitution--the right to bear arms--envisioned that  possibility. I am sure it didn't. I am sure our Founding Fathers--and  we can debate for the rest of the day what their words actually meant-- never envisioned that an American citizen's right to bear arms could  somehow translate into violence against so many innocent people, as it  has over and over again.   Last week, I was in Chicago. I was joined at a press conference by  gun safety advocates at the Martin Luther King Jr. Community Center on  the South Side. We stood together, victims of gun violence and I, at a  press conference. With me were advocates from Hadiya's Promise and the  Illinois Council Against Handgun Violence, who have been working  together for years to combat the scourge gun violence in Illinois. I  also stood with Patrick Korellis, who was wounded on February 14 10  years ago at a mass school shooting at Northern Illinois University in  DeKalb, IL.   A new voice came to join us, a graduate from Marjory Stoneman Douglas  High School in Parkland, FL, named Francyn Brown. She graduated from  Stoneman Douglas in 2009. She is currently a law student at the  Chicago-Kent College of Law. She is one of dozens of Stoneman Douglas  graduates in the Chicago area--which include, incidentally, the first  baseman for the Chicago Cubs, Anthony Rizzo--and hundreds, if not  thousands, nationwide who joined together in the aftermath of the  February 14 mass shooting that killed 14 Stoneman Douglas students and  3 staff. These young men and women have come together to speak up and  urge their lawmakers to do something about the Nation's epidemic of gun  violence. The message is starting to resonate.   When Francyn Brown was speaking last Wednesday, students at schools  across the Chicagoland area were walking out of class in solidarity  with Stoneman Douglas students. They are all calling for commonsense  gun reform. These students don't have time or patience for political  games in Washington or Springfield. They have seen their friends, kids  just like themselves, get shot in their classrooms and neighborhoods.  They have had enough.   Francyn Brown said:         It's not supposed to matter what side of the aisle a       politician sits. We are supposed to all protect the future of       our children.    I couldn't agree more.   These students and young people across the country are changing the  debate about gun violence. They are making it clear how absurd it is  for lawmakers in this Chamber, across the rotunda, or in State capitals  to do nothing when Americans get shot every day in their homes, their  neighborhoods, their churches, nightclubs, concerts, and schools. They  are fed up with politicians in Washington who ignore the overwhelming  majority of Americans who want commonsense gun safety and listen  instead to paranoid, bullying gun sales lobbyists.   Remember, the National Rifle Association and its allies oppose  virtually anything that hurts gun sales. They fight against proposals  that might reduce gun sales, and they try to roll back laws on the  books that limit them. That is their agenda. But it is not America's  agenda. Corporate America is starting to walk away from the NRA. It is  no longer a source of pride that they are doing business with the  National Rifle Association--just the opposite. We are seeing company  after company end relationships with the NRA because of its  increasingly unhinged and hysterical rhetoric on the issue of gun  safety. Corporate America--some of the biggest corporations in our  Nation--realize that the NRA no longer speaks for responsible gun  owners. When will Congress realize this?   We know we need to act to keep our children safe. There is no single  reform that can stop every shooting, but we know there are gaps in our  gun laws that make it easy for criminals, abusers, troubled children,  and mentally unstable people to get guns, even military assault weapons  with bump stocks and high-capacity magazines.   We need to close these gaps, and that requires the Republicans who  control Congress to stand up to the NRA and do something that the NRA  might not like. For starters, my Republican colleagues could take up  legislation that the leader of their party, President Trump, proposed  last Thursday. Here is one of the President's infamous tweets:         I will be strongly pushing Comprehensive Background Checks       with an emphasis on Mental Health. Raise age to 21 and end       sale of Bump Stocks! Congress is in a mood to finally do       something on this issue--I hope!    And I hope as well.   There are proposals that Americans broadly support. Let's do  something. Of course, the NRA is opposed to most of these. We expected  that. These proposals might have some negative impact on gun sales, but  is the gun sales lobby now in charge of writing bills for the Senate  and the House? Deferring to the NRA is the reason we have reached this  moment in history.   Remember, the Senate has held one gun vote since President Trump came  to office, and it was a vote to prevent mental health records from the  Social Security Administration from going into the FBI's gun background  check system. That is the only vote since the Trump administration took  office. It is the only thing we have done here--roll back a law on the  books on mental health and background checks. That was a giveaway to  the gun lobby, which claims to support enforcing the laws on the books  but actually tries to roll  [[Page S1226]]  back those laws if it means helping to lift their sales.   Let's show the students at Stoneman Douglas and across the country  that we hear them. I hope we show that reducing gun violence is a  priority.   I call on my Republican colleagues to join the Democrats in a  bipartisan effort to treat the issue of gun safety with the sense of  urgency that the American people believe is necessary. If Republicans  gave a fraction of the effort to gun safety that they have to other  issues, we could get this done--and done quickly. There are plenty of  reforms we could pass that are completely consistent with the Second  Amendment and would save lives. Even President Trump, for the time  being, has said that he supports them.   So let's get started. Not on a giveaway to the gun lobby--let's work  on closing loopholes. Let's have universal background checks. Over 90  percent of the American people believe we should keep guns out of the  hands of convicted felons and mentally unstable people. I also believe  that those who are subject to protective orders for domestic violence  should be disqualified from buying a gun. I would say that those who  are on the terrorist watch list, whom we do not allow to fly on  airplanes because of fear that they could do harm to others, shouldn't  be allowed to buy guns in the United States. I want to add a provision  that straw purchasers--the girlfriends with no criminal record who buy  the weapons to give to the boyfriends with a long criminal record-- ought to have the book thrown at them. Let's get to work.   I want to thank the victims and advocates who have worked for many  years to help reduce the epidemic of gun violence. I want them to know  we stand with them, and I hope we can all stand with them on a  bipartisan basis.   I yield the floor.    I announce that the Senator from Alabama (Mr. Jones) is  necessarily absent.    I announce that the Senator from Alabama (Mr. Jones) is  necessarily absent.    Mr. President, last week, rainstorms and melting snow  caused flooding across Illinois, with more than 20 counties throughout  the State placed under a flood warning. As the water level of rivers  continued to rise, several communities had to evacuate their homes for  their own safety. Sadly, these storms were so severe that flooded  roadways claimed the life of an Illinois resident after her car rolled  into a rain-filled ditch. Multiple communities were evacuated, and in  some areas, residents had to be rescued by boat.   Some of the worst impacted areas were in Iroquois, Kankakee, and  Vermilion Counties. The Governor declared a State disaster for these  counties, and the American Red Cross established shelters for evacuated  residents.   These floods were not just limited to communities in east central  Illinois. Counties in western and downstate Illinois were also among  the most impacted. In Ford Heights, a suburb of Chicago, at least 100  homes were impacted and seven residents were rescued by boat. In north  central Illinois, a nursing home in LaSalle County had to be evacuated,  and the next day, parts of the county were placed under mandatory  evacuation order.   Downstate, rain continued through the weekend, and crews from the  Department of Corrections worked to install flood gates in Hardin  County, and the Department of Transportation delivered pumps, hoses,  and sandbags to aid in recovery. The Illinois Department of Natural  Resources also provided boats to aid with flood patrols.   Some of the areas that experienced heavy rains and flooding  throughout last week, like Freeport in northwestern Illinois, were also  impacted by flooding just last year. Freeport was flooded in July 2017,  and on Friday night, the Red Cross once again opened an emergency  shelter there. Situations like this are the reason that communities  that often experience flooding need more assistance, both to plan for  emergencies and to quickly mitigate the aftermath.   With extreme weather conditions like these becoming more frequent and  more severe, I have heard from many Illinois constituents who are  concerned about their ability to recover from repeated flood events  like these. I stand ready to assist at the Federal level to help these  communities rebuild and recover in a way that will allow them to be  more resilient when the next flood occurs.   As is often the case when a disaster like this occurs, I was so  impressed with the residents, first responders, and local officials who  worked tirelessly to protect their communities. I want to thank our  local law enforcement--firefighters and police--who always do the best  job to keep our communities safe and work long hours because of it.   I also want to recognize the hard work of the State and Federal  employees that have pitched in at every level, including the Army Corps  of Engineers, the Department of Natural Resources, and the Illinois  Emergency Management Agency.  [[Page S1238]]    Our thoughts are with the family and friends of the Illinois resident  who lost her life and with all those who have experienced damage to  their homes and other property. We will rebuild--as the people of  Illinois always do--and will once again be stronger for it.                            ____________________
