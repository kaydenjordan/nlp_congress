 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the  life of Laura Lynn McCorkle Miller of Shellman Bluff and Savannah.   Laura Lynn was raised in Valdosta and graduated from both Valdosta  High School and Valdosta State University.   She began her career as a social worker with the Georgia Department  of Family and Children Services but left for the joy of being a mother.  While raising her daughter, she began working part time with Eldercare  of Valdosta, providing home care to the elderly and physically  disabled.   Within 2 years of starting with Eldercare, she and her husband  purchased the company. They rapidly expanded it into all corners of the  State as well as the Southern region. The Miller family's impact on the  home healthcare industry cannot be understated. Through her work with  the elderly community, she led the charge for State licensing of home  healthcare in 1993.   She remained active in the community by serving her synagogues in  Valdosta and Savannah.   Laura Lynn is survived by her husband of over 50 years, Martin  Miller; her daughter, Maura Miller; and two grandchildren.   My thoughts and prayers go out to the entire Miller family during  this difficult time.                          Congratulating Kevin Exley     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate Kevin  Exley, who was recently elected city councilman for the city of Rincon  on September 21, 2023.   The city of Rincon opened polls up for a special election to fill an  empty city council seat following Damon Rahn's departure in June. Now,  thanks to Kevin Exley, that seat is occupied.   Exley has made it known that he wants to focus on updating  ordinances, adjusting term limits, and adding some neighborhood safety  measures.   Rincon's special election was indeed special. September 19 started  out with only a few voters but quickly grew to hundreds showing up to  cast their ballots.   This is a story of redemption for Exley. He served on the council  from 2019 to 2020 but vacated his post soon thereafter. The road back  to city council was just the beginning. Exley plans to run for mayor in  the 2025 election again.   I congratulate Kevin. I know he will serve the city of Rincon well.                           Remembering Hubert Ginn     Mr. Speaker, I rise today in remembrance of  Hubert Ginn, who passed away on September 21 at the age of 76.   Hubert played college football at Florida A&M University, and after a  successful career was drafted into the National Football League. He was  a two-time Super Bowl champion, playing as a running back for the  legendary 1972 undefeated Miami Dolphins as well as the Baltimore Colts  and Oakland Raiders.   His family and friends remember him as an amazing father, brother,  son, and man with so much love for his community and people around him.  Hubert will be remembered by many for being an upstanding role model  and for his talents on and off the football field.   My deepest sympathies go out to his family and friends.               Guyton Elementary Awarded Literacy Leader Banner     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate  Guyton Elementary on being awarded the Literacy Leader banner. Guyton,  an Effingham County elementary school, has been recognized for their  strides in increasing literacy among its students.   To be awarded the banner, a school's literacy test scores must be  above 90 percent, or it must rise by more than 15 percent. Only around  200 of Georgia's 2,300 schools are being given this award.   One of the main drivers of Guyton's increased literacy rates comes  from its third graders, whose reading scores jumped by more than 16  percent. We are so proud to see such a great improvement for the  students at Guyton Elementary, and I cannot think of a more deserving  group.   I look forward to seeing continued growth and more accomplishments  from our amazing students at Guyton Elementary.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of  the Honorable Herbert ``Herb'' Jones, Jr.   On September 16, Herb passed away peacefully at the age of 93. He was  a devoted Christian who taught Sunday school and volunteered on mission  trips across the U.S.   He was a statesman, as well. Herb served in the Georgia House of  Representatives for 14 years and spent 6 of those years being the House  minority leader.   His accomplishments are too numerous for one speech, but some of them  include casting electoral college votes for President Reagan, working  to expand the Georgia ports, and helping to secure crucial funding for  Memorial Medical Center.   Herb was humble, gracious, loving, loyal, and kind, always putting  others before himself. He was also an inspiration to me as he was there  with me when I first went into the Georgia House of Representatives.   I will always appreciate his counsel. He will be remembered by all  for his years of selfless service to the State of Georgia.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding and for hosting this Special Order hour.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and to remember the life of the  late First Lady Rosalynn Carter, a trailblazer, a great American, a  strong Christian, and an icon in the State of Georgia.   Born in 1927 in Plains, Georgia, like her husband, Mrs. Carter came  from very humble beginnings. She was the valedictorian of Plains High  School, and soon after a proud graduate of Georgia Southwestern  College.   She married the future President, Jimmy Carter, in 1946, whom she  remained dutifully married to until her passing this past November.   Rosalynn Carter wasn't just any Georgian. She was one of the best.  Her entire life exemplified what it means to be selfless, to serve  others and her community. She dedicated herself to improving the lives  of those around her, the lives of Georgians, and the lives of  Americans.   She became a pioneer in the mental health space, helping to found The  Carter Center with the mission of alleviating human suffering and  advancing human rights. She was also active in Habitat for Humanity,  building homes for the less fortunate members of our community.   Throughout her entire life, Rosalynn Carter lived with the mission of  leaving the world a better place than when she got here.   I want to pay particular attention to her work in the mental health  space. Rosalynn Carter was a trailblazer in mental health issues at a  time when mental health issues were something that weren't accepted in  this country. She led. For that I think she will always be thanked.   Through her entire life, she lived with the mission of leaving the  world a better place than when she got here. I can confidently say she  accomplished that mission. Though she is no longer with us, her legacy  and her impact have been felt by millions and will be felt by millions  in the future.   I had the pleasure of serving with her grandson, Jason, in the  Georgia State Senate. I remember how proud Jason was of his  grandparents. I remember the love that he expressed for his  grandmother.   Mr. Speaker, in our lives there are people and places we remember.  For the State of Georgia, we always will remember Rosalynn Carter, an  inspiration to all of us.   My prayers are with her family, with former President Carter, and the  millions of Americans affected by her loss. I thank my colleague from  Georgia, again, for inviting me to speak today and giving me this  opportunity to honor one of the truly great Georgians of our time.                                time  1530
