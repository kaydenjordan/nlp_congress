 Mr. President, I have 11 en bloc motions at the desk,  and I ask that they be read and considered en bloc.    Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined by a host of my  colleagues. The motions we are proposing are very simple and should  attract wide support.   Senators on both sides have said this must be a bipartisan process,  but so far, it isn't. Not once did any of the 11 Senate subcommittees  with jurisdiction over relevant aspects of this legislation meet to  consider it--not once. What is the purpose of the Senate's system of  expert committees if, as we consider one of the largest bills ever  before this body, we are just going to act as if the committees never  existed?   We are for pandemic relief. What we are not for is a decade-long  spending spree, rushed through this body, much of which has nothing to  do with pandemic relief. Our motions would simply  [[Page S1254]]  send this legislation back to committee for 3 days so it can be  reviewed in a bipartisan manner. These motions would ensure that the  legislation supports proven bipartisan programs before launching new  programs or spending more money on programs that are already flush with  cash. By midweek, we would have bipartisan legislation with committee  input that is targeted to timely pandemic relief for those in need.   I urge my colleagues to support these motions.    I ask for the yeas and nays.
