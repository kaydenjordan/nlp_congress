 Mr. President, I wish to take a moment this morning to  discuss events in southeastern Kentucky. Because of heavy rainfall over  the weekend, residents are enduring widespread flooding in several  counties. Homes have been evacuated. A number of people have been  forced to relocate to temporary shelters. Even where the floodwaters  have begun to recede, a number of roads remain blocked because of water  or mudslides. We are thankful that no injuries have been reported at  this point. My staff in Eastern Kentucky is working closely with local  officials, and I am monitoring the situation and receiving updates.   As always, we are deeply grateful to the emergency responders who  rescued a number of people from their homes or their cars. Helping  their fellow Kentuckians through this hardship, they have again earned  our thanks.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on an entirely different matter, the  Senate took an initial step toward considering proposals to address  DACA, border security, and other immigration issues. This week's debate  comes as no surprise to my colleagues. For a month now, I have  repeatedly stated my intention to bring these issues to the Senate  floor following a government funding agreement. Senators have had  plenty of time to prepare. There is no reason why we should not reach a  bipartisan solution this week, but to do this, we need to get the  debate started, look past making political points, and focus on  actually making law.   Making law will take 60 votes in the Senate, a majority in the House,  and a Presidential signature. Yesterday, a number of my colleagues  announced a reasonable proposal that I believe is our best chance to  actually make law. It attends to my Democratic colleagues' stated  priority: a compassionate solution for 1.8 million illegal immigrants  who were brought to the United States as children. In exchange, it also  delivers on the President's stated conditions. Their solution provides  funding to secure the border, reforms extended-family chain migration,  and recalibrates the visa lottery program.   This proposal has my support. During this week of fair debate, I  believe it deserves the support of every Senator who is ready to move  beyond making points and actually making a law. If other proposals are  to be considered, our colleagues will have to actually introduce their  own amendments, rather than just talk about them.   I made a commitment to hold this debate and to hold it this week. I  have lived up to my commitment. I hope everyone will cooperate so that  this opportunity does not go to waste.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on another matter, last week, as part  of our bipartisan funding agreement, the Senate approved much needed  disaster relief for communities hit by last year's devastating storms.  This was an important accomplishment, but it isn't the only way this  Congress has helped Americans begin to rebuild.  [[Page S890]]    Recently, Florida Power & Light, the State's largest utility,  announced that their savings from tax reform will completely cover the  costs of rebuilding critical infrastructure in the wake of Hurricane  Irma. Absent tax reform, consumers would have paid for much of the  repairs in the form of higher rates. Now the utility can cover the cost  itself, saving Florida families an average of $250.   In other States, from Montana to Massachusetts to my home State of  Kentucky, utilities are planning to directly pass along their savings  by cutting consumers' monthly bills.   Of course, lower utility rates aren't the only way tax reform is  helping middle-class Americans. Week after week, the headlines are full  of more bonuses, more pay raises, and more new benefits for hard- working Americans as a direct result--a direct result--of tax reform.  With all of this good news pouring in, it is easy to forget how hotly  the debate over tax reform was contested.   Republicans argued that letting middle-class families keep more of  their own money and giving American job creators a 21st-century tax  code would unleash prosperity and directly help American workers.   Our Democratic colleagues gambled on a different prediction. Every  single House Democrat voted in lockstep with their leader. She  predicted tax reform would bring about Armageddon. Every single  Democrat in the Senate rallied behind their leader, my friend from New  York. He declared that there was ``nothing about this bill that suits  the needs of the American worker.''   We always knew one side would be proven wrong. Either tax reform  would benefit middle-class families and help reignite the economy or it  would not. The early results speak for themselves. In the great State  of Missouri, 20 companies, and counting, have already announced tax  reform bonuses, raises, or benefits. That includes thousand-dollar  bonuses for 2,500 workers at Central Bank of St. Louis and at Great  Southern Bank in Springfield and more bonuses at Mid-Am Metal Forming  in Rogersville. One of the Senators from Missouri voted for the policy  that made all this happen. Their other Senator tried to block it.   In Ohio, tax reform has already led Jergens to double employees'  annual raise. It has enabled Sheffer Corporation, a cylinder  manufacturer, to give workers four-figure bonuses. Here is how  Sheffer's CEO responded to Democrats who have been trying to talk down  these bonuses: ``Some people have said that's `crumbs,' but for the  Sheffer people, we consider that fine dining.''   Remember, these bonuses and pay raises are just the tip of the spear.  The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act also directly helps families by cutting tax  rates and expanding deductions. In every paycheck, American workers  will keep more of what they earn.   Only one Senator from Ohio voted to put all this middle-class  progress on the menu. Every single Democrat in the Senate and the House  voted to stop tax reform. Fortunately, for middle-class families in  Missouri, in Ohio, in Kentucky, and across the Nation, Republicans  overcame the obstruction and passed this historic bill.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, for months, Senators have been  clamoring for a floor debate on DACA, border security, and other urgent  issues pertaining to immigration. We have certainly had ample time to  prepare.   The week we set aside for this debate has arrived--the week my  Democratic colleagues insisted that we dedicate to this issue. The  clock is ticking, but the debate has yet to begin. That is because our  Democratic colleagues have yet to yield back any of their postcloture  time so we can begin this important debate. If we are going to resolve  these matters this week, we need to get moving. In my view, the  proposal unveiled yesterday by Senator Grassley and a number of other  Senators offers our best chance to find a solution.   I have committed that the amendment process will be fair and both  sides will have the opportunity to submit ideas for debate and votes.  For that to happen, our colleagues will have to actually introduce  their own amendments, rather than just talk about them.   My colleague, Senator Toomey, for example, has done just that. He put  forward an amendment to address one of the most glaring aspects of our  Nation's broken immigration system--sanctuary cities. I see no reason  to further delay consideration of this and other substantive proposals.  Let's start by setting up a vote on his amendment and an amendment from  my Democratic colleagues--an amendment of their choosing, not mine,  with their consent. With their consent, we can start the debate and  have the first two amendment votes.   Mr. President, consistent with that, I ask unanimous consent that at  2:15 p.m. today, the motion to proceed to H.R. 2579 be agreed to. I ask  unanimous consent that Senator Toomey, or his designee, be recognized  to offer amendment No. 1948 and that the Democratic leader, or his  designee, be recognized to offer an amendment; further, that the time  until 3:30 p.m. be equally divided between the leaders or their  designees and that following the use or yielding back of that time, the  Senate vote on the amendments in the order listed, with 60 affirmative  votes required for adoption, and that no second-degree amendments be in  order prior to the votes; finally, that if any of the amendments are  adopted, they become original text for the purpose of further  amendment.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the motion  to proceed to H.R. 2579 be agreed to; that Senator Toomey or his  designee be recognized to offer amendment No. 1948 and that Senator  Coons or his designee be recognized to offer amendment No. 1955;  further, that the time until 8 p.m. be equally divided between the  leaders or their designees and that following the use or yielding back  of that time, the Senate vote on the amendments in the order listed,  with 60 affirmative votes required for adoption, and that no second- degree amendments be in order prior to the votes; finally, that if any  of the amendments are adopted, they become original text for the  purpose of further amendment.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to executive session for the en bloc consideration of the  following nominations: Executive Calendar Nos. 155, 261, and 469.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  vote on the nominations en bloc with no intervening action or debate;  that if confirmed, the motions to consider be considered made and laid  upon the table en bloc; that the President be immediately notified of  the Senate's action; that no further motions be in order; and that any  statements relating to the nominations be printed in the Record.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  resume legislative session for a period of morning business, with  Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 10 a.m.,  Wednesday, February 14; that following the prayer and pledge, the  morning hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved  to date, the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later  in the day, and morning business be closed; I further ask that  following leader remarks, the Senate resume and vote on the motion to  proceed to H.R. 2579.    Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned  under the previous order, following the remarks of Senator Moran.
