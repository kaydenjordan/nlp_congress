 The Chair now recognizes the president of the U.S.  Association of Former Members of Congress, the Honorable Cliff Stearns  of Florida, to address the Members.    Now, I would like to ask the Clerk to call the roll.   The Clerk called the roll and the following former Members answered  ``present'':   Mr. Boustany of Louisiana   Mr. Buechner of Missouri   Mr. Carnahan of Missouri   Mr. Clement of Tennessee   Mr. Davis of Tennessee   Mr. DioGuardi of New York   Mr. Frost of Texas   Mr. Gingrey of Georgia   Mr. Hochbrueckner of New York   Ms. Kennelly of Connecticut   Mr. Konnyu of California   Mr. Kramer of Colorado   Mr. Moran of Virginia   Mr. Murphy of Pennsylvania   Mr. Nethercutt of Washington   Mr. Neugebauer of Texas    =========================== NOTE ===========================        June 26, 2018, on page H5658, the following appeared: Mr. Murphy  of Pennsylvania Mr. Neugebauer of Texas      The online version has been corrected to read: Mr. Murphy of  Pennsylvania Mr. Nethercutt of Washington Mr. Neugebauer of Texas    ========================= END NOTE =========================     Mr. Payne of Virginia   Mr. Rahall of West Virginia   Mr. Stearns of Florida   Mr. Walsh of New York   Mr. Weller of Illinois    The Chair announces that 21 former Members of Congress  have responded to their names.    I would ask that the gentleman suspend for just a moment.  I know he is near the end of his report. We have been joined by the  Speaker of the House.    He will come back.   We have been joined by the Speaker of the House, Speaker Ryan. I  don't know how busy your schedule is, Mr. Speaker. I know you have a  lot of demands on your time.   I will let Charles finish, and then we will call you up.   Charles, go ahead.    Thank you, Charles.   It is my privilege, at this point, to recognize the Speaker of the  House, the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Ryan), who will be joining the  ranks of the former Members at the end of this year.    Does anyone have any questions for the Speaker?    Any other questions?    The gentleman from Tennessee has a brief comment, because  the Speaker has to go.    Mr. Speaker, thank you for your time and for your service.  We need to let you get on to your meeting of your Conference. Thank you  very much for being with us.    Hearing no opposition, the slate has been elected by the  membership.    Hearing no opposition, the slate has been elected by the  membership.    Hearing no opposition, the slate is elected.    I don't know how many of you know the amount of time that  Cliff has devoted to this organization. It is very, very impressive. He  has a full-time job and has been an excellent president, has attended  many, many of our functions, has taken great interest in everything we  do, and from time to time makes comments and suggestions to Pete about  how we can do even better, and his comments are always on point and  usually followed.   So I would like to, at this time, Cliff, present this little token of  our appreciation. Hopefully, it will find a place on your desk in your  office. Thank you for all you have done for us.    Now, those of you who know me know that I don't give long  speeches. I do recall when Newt Gingrich became Speaker and he was  asked to give his acceptance speech, he spoke for an hour. That was  very unusual. Most new Speakers just say: ``Thank you, and I look  forward to working with you.''   You know, there is a time and a place for everything, and in my case,  things have all come together, I believe, at the right time for me  personally and for this organization. I retired from my law firm about  1\1/2\ years ago. While I still have some volunteer activities, I  intend to devote a great deal of my personal time to this organization.   I particularly enjoy working with the staff. And Cliff has already  recognized Pete and Sabine who just do an extraordinary job. Also, many  of the other members of the staff are here today. We have a cross  section of younger people and more mature people who are working with  us, and I could not be happier than the staff that I will have the  opportunity to lead in the next 2 years.   I want to thank you for entrusting this job to me. You will be seeing  me around, and I will play the same role that Cliff did. I will be  making suggestions to Pete and to the staff from time to time. I think  they will listen carefully, and I expect that they will follow my  suggestions from time to time.   Thank you very much for the honor you have given me.    The Chair again wishes to thank the former Members of the  House and Senate for their presence here today.   Before terminating these proceedings, the Chair would like to invite  those former Members who did not respond when the roll was called to  give their names to the Reading Clerk for inclusion in the roll.   The meeting stands adjourned.  [[Page H5666]]                                ____________________
