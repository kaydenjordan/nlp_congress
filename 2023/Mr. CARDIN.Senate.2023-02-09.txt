 Mr. President, I rise today to honor the lives lost  during the tragic earthquake that shook southern Turkey and  northwestern Syria and to reaffirm the American commitment to provide  assistance to recover from this disaster. In the early morning hours of  February 6, a magnitude 7.8 earthquake, one of the strongest quakes in  the region's history, struck near the city of Gaziantep, causing the  deaths of thousands of innocent individuals and wreaking disaster and  destruction on many communities that were already struggling from the  effects of war.   I am devastated by the growing loss of life and injuries in Turkey  and Syria. As of today, the earthquake has left more than 20,000 dead  in Turkey and Syria and over 50,000 injured. Rescue missions continue  to search for scores more that remain missing. In this great time of  sadness for their countries, the United States will stand in  humanitarian solidarity to provide relief, recovery, and efforts to  build back even stronger.   Within hours, the U.S. Agency for International Development activated  a Disaster Assistance Response Team--DART--to lead the U.S.  Government's humanitarian response to the disaster. The DART is working  closely with Turkish authorities on the frontlines and will continue  provide search and rescue support and identify priority humanitarian  needs in the days to come.   Globally, the outpouring of support in resources and rescue workers  has been encouraging. The White Helmets, a volunteer organization that  has assisted in the rescue of the many civilians suffering from attacks  by the Syrian regime, has sprung into action. The internationally  renowned group is currently working around the clock and has sent out  over 300 search and rescue teams--several times their normal operating  capacity.   Over 20 NATO allies and partners have provided more than 1,400  emergency response personnel, including firefighters, engineers,  search-and-rescue and medical teams. I am heartened by the generosity  of individuals, countries, and organizations, which include the  Catholic Relief Services--CRS--a humanitarian agency based in  Baltimore, MD. CRS is supporting emergency relief efforts by local  partners in Turkey and Syria, including partner organizations Caritas  Turkey, Caritas Syria, and Caritas Anatolia.   Today, we honor those lost and injured in this week's disaster. We  will continue to provide rescue support, and send our thoughts and  prayers to the people of Turkey and Syria.                            ____________________
