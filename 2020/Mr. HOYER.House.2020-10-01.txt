 Madam Speaker, since the beginning of this Congress, House  Democrats have fought for the people. From lowering healthcare costs to  raising wages by rebuilding America, to cleaning up corruption and  strengthening democracy, House Democrats have passed major legislation  and shown the American people what our priorities are.   At the same time, sadly, Republicans have also made clear what their  priorities are, priorities the American people, in my view, do not  share, for example, and particularly, on healthcare.   For years, Madam Speaker, President Trump and Republicans have been  telling the American people that they have a plan that is better than  the Affordable Care Act which will cover more Americans. As a matter of  fact, the President said he would cover everybody at a lower cost and  higher quality. Not a single Member of this House can rise and say, ``I  know what the President's bill is,'' because they have never seen it  after 3 years and 8 months.   But after years with no plan being put forward, it is clear exactly  what their plan really is: Eliminate the Affordable Care Act and offer  nothing in return. They continue to tell the American people, ``You are  on your own.''   They tried to repeal or undermine the Affordable Care Act more than  65 times in Congress and failed. Now they are trying to overturn the  law in court, and they are attempting to ram a Supreme Court nominee  through in order to do what they failed to do through the legislative  process, of course, after saying that we ought not to consider a  Supreme Court nominee in an election year because we ought to let the  people speak.   In fact, the people spoke in 2016 and voted for Hillary Clinton by  over a 3 million disparity. Republicans didn't care. They wanted to  know what the electoral college said. And, of course, that is our  Constitution, but it is not the people speaking.   The fight over this nominee is very much about the ability of  Americans to access quality, affordable healthcare.   When Democrats came into the majority, we took immediate action,  Madam Speaker, to defend the Affordable Care Act in court and stand up  for its protections for more than 130 million Americans with  preexisting conditions.   What can we expect if Republicans succeed in ending the Affordable  Care Act?   Free preventative screenings and services, gone.   The guarantee of coverage for those with preexisting conditions  without higher premiums, gone.   The ability to get covered under your parents' plans if you are  younger than 26, gone.   The ban on lifetime and annual limits of coverage, gone.   That is what we are defending for the people and what we will  continue to protect.   Madam Speaker, we also took real action to lower prescription drug  costs with the passage of H.R. 3 and other legislation--not a gimmick  like President Trump's meaningless executive orders or his illegal  coupon cards that endanger the future of Medicare, but real action to  benefit those who need more affordable prescription drugs.   And when an unprecedented, deadly pandemic swept across the globe and  on to our shores, House Democrats led the way with swift action,  enacting four bipartisan laws and passing a fifth bill, the Heroes Act,  4\1/2\ months ago. No action in the United States Senate for 3\1/2\  months, and then a lame effort, which was not supported by Republicans  in the Senate and certainly no Democrats in the Senate.   President Trump and the Republican Senate, however, have blocked the  Heroes Act so necessary for those on unemployment, so necessary for  those who are trying to feed their families, so necessary for family  support, so necessary for small businesses, so necessary for hospital  workers and those who are administering testing, and so necessary for  the States and localities that are hiring police, firefighters,  sanitation workers--the critical personnel necessary to help confront  this virus.   Where Democrats have said we are in this together, President Trump  has said it is what it is.   Let me say to the American people: What it is does not have to be.   House Democrats have shown that there is a better way to lead and a  more responsible way to govern in this crisis.   Democrats have also been fighting to make our economy work, Madam  Speaker, for the people while Republicans fight to make our economy  work for the wealthy. That is why they are fighting about the tax  provision that they put into the CARES Act, which we think ought to be  deleted because it is for the wealthy, not for those who are  struggling.   In 2017, President Trump and Republicans enacted an unpaid-for $1.5  trillion tax cut where 83 percent, more than 8 out of 10 Americans who  got relief in that tax act were some of the wealthiest people in  America, the top 1 percent. That bill also raised taxes on 86 million  middle-class households.   In contrast, Madam Speaker, House Democrats have used our majority to  benefit working families and grow our economy. We voted to raise the  minimum wage and ensure equal pay for equal work for women. It lies  unattended in the United States Senate. Senator McConnell will not  bring it up.   We invested in new infrastructure and clean energy innovation that  drives growth of new, high-paying American jobs. It sits untended in  the United States Senate.                                time  1115    House Democrats have been working to make government more transparent  and accountable to the people.   Our majority moved swiftly, Madam Speaker, to pass the strongest and  most comprehensive government reform legislation in decades, the For  the People Act.   That bill will hold government officials more accountable, increase  transparency and ethical standards, and increase voter protections  while instituting national redistricting reforms.   Where is it? In the Senate left untended, unconsidered by the United  States Senate, because it is on McConnell's desk and he will not move  it.   While this President and Republicans continue to make it harder for  Americans to vote, and sow confusion and uncertainty about balloting,  House Democrats passed H.R. 4 to restore the John Lewis Act, to restore  the protections in the Voting Rights Act that so many fought for,  demonstrated for, and died for.   But unfortunately, too many in this country are trying to make it  more difficult, not easier, to cast that central facet of being a  citizen in a democracy, the right to vote.  [[Page H5122]]    That is one of the 340 bipartisan bills that are languishing on  Senator McConnell's desk. He will not call them up before the Senate  for a vote, muzzling democracy.   That is 340 important bipartisan bills blocked, stalled, or ignored.   Madam Speaker, let's not forget that we began our majority in the  middle of a damaging and irresponsible government shutdown, the longest  shutdown that I have experienced in the 40 years I have been here.   We moved swiftly to end that shutdown and prioritize the passage of  funding bills last year and this year before the end of July in order  to prevent another shutdown of our government.   So last year we passed 8 of the 10 appropriation bills by June 26.  This year, we passed 8 of those 10, notwithstanding COVID, by July 26.   The Senate has not passed out of committee a single appropriation  bill, not one, Madam Speaker.   What have they been doing? Judge after judge after judge after judge.  That is what they are doing, to serve their ideological agenda, hoping  that they can control through the courts that which they cannot control  in the democratic process.   We have shown, Madam Speaker, what it means to govern for the people,  and over the next few weeks, Americans will have a chance to choose the  direction our country follows in the years ahead. They know that  Republicans have failed them: no healthcare bill, no infrastructure  bill that the President talked about in the campaign, ``I am going to  invest in infrastructure.'' No bill has been presented by the President  to do that, no healthcare bill.   They know that our Republican colleagues have failed them through  their inaction and irresponsibility.   And they know, Madam Speaker, that Democrats have offered a serious  agenda of leadership, have demonstrated the capacity to govern  responsibly, and have shown ourselves always to be for the people.   Madam Speaker, today we will be considering a bill. We are in  negotiations. I hope those negotiations work. Frankly, Speaker Pelosi  and Secretary Mnuchin reached four bipartisan deals. Mr. Meadows was  not chief of staff, of course, at that point in time. Let us hope that  we can reach a bipartisan deal.   We were supposed to consider our Heroes 2 bill, our offer, our  proffer, our statement of what we think is necessary to uplift the  American people, to let them know they are not on their own, we are  with them, we are together.   We will consider that bill today if there is not an agreement. I hope  there is an agreement. I hope we have a bipartisan piece of legislation  that we can pass in the near future, because the American people need  it, and that is what we have done in the past. Let's hope we can do it  today.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, we live in an interesting age.   I rise in strong support of this legislation.   I have heard my Republican friends lament the fact that we have  things in this bill that they don't like and apparently that the Senate  doesn't like. I have been here long enough to know and to serve when  the Republicans were in charge.   They passed bill after bill with partisan provisions that they knew  President Obama wouldn't sign and that could not pass the United States  Senate because they couldn't get enough Democrats to get to 60 votes.  They knew that.   So both sides pass legislation that they think is good,  notwithstanding the fact that the other side does not agree with some  of the provisions in the bill.   But, Mr. Speaker, this bill responds to the needs of the American  people at a time of crisis. The House passed the Heroes Act more than  4\1/2\ months ago.   Normally what would happen is when a bill goes to the Senate, they  would pass a bill of their own unless they believed: Ladies and  gentlemen of America, you are on your own. And States, as Senator  McConnell said, you can go bankrupt.   The minority leader of this House said: Let's wait and see what  happens.   And we waited and we waited and we waited, and 120,000 additional  Americans have died since May 15.   How long are we going to wait?   The House did its job in May for the American people, yet the  Republican Senate and President Trump have still not done theirs.   They talk about compromise on that side of the aisle and working  together. So what did the Republican leader of the Senate do? There was  a trillion-dollar offer on the table, so he came back with a compromise  and cut it in half to $500 billion. And the only reason that bill got a  majority of Republicans in the United States Senate--it didn't get a  majority of the United States Senate; it did, because there are enough  Republicans--is because they thought it wouldn't go anywhere, it was a  message bill. That is the only reason it passed with 51. It didn't  pass, of course, because it needed 60.   Now, let me tell you what John Boehner did and what Paul Ryan did  when the Freedom Caucus wouldn't give them the votes, Mr. Speaker, for  the Republicans to pass legislation that they knew was needed, the debt  limit, fiscal bills. They knew they were needed. So what did John  Boehner do? He walked across the aisle, talked to the Speaker, talked  to me, and said, ``We need some votes,'' and we made a deal.   The ranking member of the Appropriations Committee is one of those  people who wants the House to work. I am a friend of hers and I respect  her, because she is a Member that I have experienced who wants to make  it work.    But Senator McConnell doesn't walk across the aisle and say, Let's  make a compromise.   So don't preach at us, Mr. Speaker. Don't preach at us about reaching  across the aisle. We have seen tax bills that slam bam, there it goes,  and so you come up with a bill.   Negotiations are ongoing right now. And I want to congratulate the  Speaker of the House. She has been in Washington more than any of the  rest of us in the last 6 months--I know that, because I talk to her on  a regular basis--trying to get this to work, trying to make a deal.   Mr. Speaker, I applaud Secretary Mnuchin. There are some others who  don't make deals, and who have a history of not making deals and have a  history of undermining deals that Paul Ryan wanted to make or that John  Boehner wanted to make. Not Democrats.   But negotiations are continuing, and I hope we will reach a  bipartisan agreement.   Frankly, if we had reached a bipartisan agreement yesterday, we would  not have this bill on the floor. If we had reached it the day before or  the day before, we wouldn't have this bill on the floor, because we  know we want a bill signed.   But we also know we want to let the American people know where we  stand, not for just one bill that helps this group or that group or the  other group, but all Americans who are suffering and are at risk. So we  believe that this bill is a reasonable compromise.   That is why today we will pass a bill that achieves the goals of the  Heroes Act and represents a reasonable compromise.   Some people, Mr. Speaker, are saying to themselves, This isn't  reasonable.   Remember, McConnell goes from $1 trillion down to half a trillion,  which clearly did not cover the needs. Every economist tells us that.   Notwithstanding the passage of this bill, House Democrats will  continue to negotiate to reach the kind of bipartisan agreement that we  believe is necessary to help Americans get through this crisis. The  airlines need the money now, and we ought to be that close.   But our position is clear. The Federal Government cannot shirk its  responsibilities to the people it serves, not just some of the people.   We have in this bill the help for small businesses that people on  that side of the aisle have been talking about. We are talking about  it. They need it.   It includes support for State, local, Tribal, and territorial  governments.   I have a letter here--and letters can be sent from the National  Governors  [[Page H5428]]  Association only if they are unanimous--which says: ``Every major  economist, regardless of party or ideological bent, came to the same  conclusion after the 2007-2009 financial crisis: The lack of support  for State and local governments slowed the Nation's economic growth for  more than a decade. As we begin to recover and rebuild from the COVID- 19 crisis''--unanimously, Republican and Democratic Governors--``we  cannot afford to repeat the mistakes of the past,'' i.e., not giving  aid to State and local governments.   That is what the Governors are saying, all of them, Republican and  Democrat.   My Governor is a Republican. His name is Hogan. His father served  here in the House of Representatives. He is one of those who came up,  with Mr. Cuomo, with the amount of money that was needed by State and  local governments.   Why do we aid State and local governments? Because they hire police.  We hear about defunding police. They are hemorrhaging revenues and they  cannot support the personnel they have, the police, fire, emergency  medical response teams, sanitation workers, nurses at public hospitals.  All of these State and local governments are critical if we are going  to solve the economic problem and the COVID-19 problem.   While the Heroes Act provided the level of fiscal support unanimously  recommended by the National Governors Association--I want to repeat  that. This is not a Democratic idea. Unanimously, the Governors of our  States, red and blue States, said we need this money--this bill  recognizes the reality that--faced with a Senate Republican leader who  suggested that the States go bankrupt--that level might not be  possible.   So we reduced that sum in half, cut out $1 trillion of the proposal  we thought had merit; actually, $1.2 trillion.   So we offer a compromise: 1 year of funding, cutting in half that  which was in the Heroes Act, yet still sufficient to get us into next  year.   This legislation renews the expanded emergency unemployment insurance  benefits that millions of people are relying on.   And by the way, it goes to them, but what do they do with it, Mr.  Speaker? They spend it in the economy at those small businesses that  Republicans are worried about, that all of us are worried about.   When we give a family the sustenance that they need to support  themselves and the family, they go spend it where? Small businesses and  large businesses.   We give that $600 a week through the end of January 2021, which will  help small businesses and the general economy.   It will provide another round of direct payments to Americans of  $1,200 for each individual adult and $500 to eligible dependents to  help families make ends meet.                                time  1830    I think all of you have voted--it might have been a voice vote on the  CARES Act, but everybody voted for it. And we are making sure college  students aren't left out.   Our bill offers a second round of the Paycheck Protection Program to  help small businesses remain viable through the pandemic and includes  additional support for workers in the airline, restaurant, and live- entertainment industries. It covers a whole lot of folks who need help.   For 4\1/2\ months after we passed the bill, the Senate has not sent  us a single piece of legislation, not a single piece because Senator  McConnell will not compromise so he can get votes from the Democrats,  which he needs to pass a bill, just as John Boehner and Paul Ryan  crossed the aisle because they needed the votes for bills they thought  were critically important for our country.   To help reopen the economy safely, the bill also includes $75 billion  for testing, contact tracing, and other public health initiatives.   And it provides a lifeline to the Postal Service. Now, I know that  may be objectionable to some people because they may want to see the  mail delayed, for whatever reasons.   I want to thank Chairwoman Lowey of the Appropriations Committee and  all the other chairs and members of all of our committees who worked  hard on this legislation. It includes input and contributions from many  Members, including many of our outstanding freshmen.   This bill represents a substantial reduction, a 35 percent reduction.  I tell my friends who served on the Appropriations Committee with me,  if I was in charge and we wanted to make a deal and I said, ``Well, I  will come down 35 percent,'' they would have taken it like that.   It is approximately the level of funding--somebody mentioned $2.2  trillion. The CARES Act was $2.2 trillion, and all of you voted for it.  It was a voice vote, unanimous. I don't know specifically whether you  were here or whether you would say, ``No, no. Silently, I voted no.''  Nobody voted against it, $2.2 trillion.   It is extraordinary the amount of money we are spending, Mr. Speaker.  But then again, no one in this body, of whatever age, has experienced  the crisis that America has found itself in over the last 8 months--no  one.   Every economist said it required that kind of response, and that is  why we voted for four bills in a bipartisan way. But then the  leadership on the other side of the aisle, Mr. Speaker, said: Let's  wait and see what happens.   And, as I said: 120,000 people have died. That is what happened.   We passed an emergency supplemental appropriations bill, 415-2. We  passed the Families First Act, 363-40. We passed the CARES Act by voice  vote. Nobody voted against it, at least audibly. And the Paycheck  Protection Program and Healthcare Enhancement Act was passed by the  House on April 23 by a vote of 383-5.   What has changed? The politics have changed.   The needs, Mr. Speaker, have not changed. All four of those bills  passed the Senate and were signed into law. Some passed by unanimous  consent by the United States Senate.   I urge President Trump and Senate Republicans to work with us to  reach bipartisan agreement without further delay.   Yes, we have differences. But we have great needs, and I agree with  those on the other side of the aisle and on this side of the aisle who  said we must meet those needs if we are going to keep our economy  going, keep our families intact, and make sure that we have jobs for  the future.   Millions of American families, workers, and small business owners are  looking to Congress for help.   Let us, Mr. Speaker, come together, as we have four times came  together overwhelmingly and said--not this is a lot of money. It is a  lot of money. I am boggled by the figures that we are dealing with. But  I am also boggled by the challenge that we confront.   This bill represents a significant compromise, while addressing the  priorities we share.   Mr. Speaker, I hope we can show the American people that we can come  together to govern responsibly in this crisis and provide much-needed  relief to the people we serve.   People pick out individual items in this bill and, unfortunately,  deeply mischaracterize some of them. Fake facts are being debated on  this floor, Mr. Speaker. I don't have the time to go into all those  fake facts.   One of them, though, was that we are defunding the police. There was  $600 million in the COPS program in the Heroes bill. Then,  subsequently, we passed an appropriations bill at $343 million.   By the way, the Senate hasn't passed a single bill to fund anything-- anything--Mr. Speaker.   What did the President do? The President zero-funded--if you will  check your budget--zero-funded the COPS program. Zero-funded it. Check  it out.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote for this bill, and I  guarantee you that we are going to continue tomorrow and tomorrow and  tomorrow to try to get an agreement that we can pass in the House and  the Senate, and that the President will sign, because we understand the  American people are in need. That is what this bill does, responds to  them.   If the Senate doesn't like it, have them pass a bill. Let us go to  conference. Let's get it done. We will be here to do it every day.
