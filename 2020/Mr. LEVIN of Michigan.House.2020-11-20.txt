 Mr. Speaker, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Speaker, first, let me thank Chairman  Scott for his leadership and for bringing this exceptional  reauthorization to the floor today.   Before I begin speaking about this amendment, I would like to  acknowledge the important role that labor unions have played in  building the national apprenticeship system.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from the AFL-CIO in  support of H.R. 8294.                                                        AFL-CIO,                                  Washington, DC, November 19, 2020.        Dear Representative: The AFL-CIO urges you to support the       National Apprenticeship Act of 2020 (H.R. 8294), scheduled       for floor consideration later this week. R.R. 8294 recognizes       that Registered Apprenticeship programs are the `gold       standard' in our nation's workforce development system, and       we welcome this effort to modernize a law that has not been       meaningfully updated since it was enacted 83 years ago.        Unions and our signatory employers have a long history of       establishing joint labor-management partnerships to design       and implement Registered Apprenticeship programs, so we have       a deep interest in maintaining and strengthening our nation's       Registered Apprenticeship system. These programs provide good       jobs with good wages and benefits that increase as       apprentices build their skills. They provide a valuable       credential that can help secure future employment and       advancement along a rewarding career path, and the       opportunities they provide are particularly important for       women, people of color and veterans.        H.R. 8294 authorizes significant new funding to expand       registered apprenticeships, preapprenticeships, and youth       apprenticeships in the United States. It would codify and       streamline existing standards that are vital to support       apprentices, and would, for the first time, include youth       apprenticeship and pre-apprenticeship programs. The House       Education and Labor Committee estimates that H.R. 8294 will       create over 1 million Registered Apprenticeship opportunities       over the next 5 years.        H.R. 8294 would also codify the role of the Office of       Apprenticeship at the Department of Labor, and provide       funding streams to ensure oversight and technical assistance.       Importantly, it would expand Registered Apprenticeship       opportunities into new sectors of the workforce. The bill       also establishes standards for state apprenticeship agencies,       including a requirement that they develop a state plan to       support Registered Apprenticeships and provide technical       assistance. Finally, the bill strengthens the National       Advisory Committee on Apprenticeship, ensuring that experts       from industry and labor have a role in improving the program.        Registered Apprenticeships are America's most successful       federally authorized workforce development program, employing       94 percent of those who complete a program. H.R. 8294 will       help ensure that these programs meet the highest possible       quality standards and support family sustaining jobs.        We urge you to support H.R. 8294 including Representative       Levin's amendment, which encourages partnerships with labor       and labor-management organizations in Title II grant       programs, not as a requirement, but to the extent       practicable, and to oppose any amendments that would weaken       the bill approved for consideration by the full House.            Sincerely,                                                    William Samuel,                                      Director, Government Affairs.     Mr. Speaker, I wish to emphasize the  importance of apprenticeship standards that safeguard apprentices'  welfare with unions who have helped negotiate and protect them for  many, many years.   These standards are critically important to the success of the  national apprenticeship system, which is why I introduced the  Strengthening Training and Accessibility for New and Diverse  Apprenticeships through Relevant and Dependable Standards Act, or the  STANDARDS Act for short.   I am pleased that the National Apprenticeship Act of 2020  incorporates my bill, which protects the rights of workers who  participate in apprenticeships.   The language of this amendment is perfectly clear. It says that grant  applicants should partner with an industry or sector partnership and a  labor or joint labor-management organization to the extent practicable.   Yet, interests hostile to unions are once again using scare tactics  to claim, falsely, that my amendment will prevent industry  organizations from securing apprenticeship grants under the legislation  unless in all cases they partner with unions, even when there are no  unions in the geographic area or part of an industry partnership.   This is not what the amendment says.   Opponents of this amendment are bending the truth for ideological  reasons. They know, and a plain reading of the text makes crystal  clear, that this amendment does not mandate that every applicant  partner with a union to access grant funding, full stop. It is asking  them to make reasonable efforts to include unions in the sectors and  areas where they are carrying out an apprenticeship program, again, to  the extent practicable.   The National Apprenticeship Act of 2020 includes the PARTNERS Act,  led  [[Page H5994]]  by Representatives Suzanne Bonamici, Drew Ferguson, Susan Davis, and  Brett Guthrie. That bipartisan legislation--again, included in this  act--is built around industry or sector partnerships, which include  unions.   Despite this, opponents are zeroing in on this amendment, saying it  discriminates against apprenticeship programs that don't have union  partnerships.   Trade associations are arguing the term ``to the extent practicable''  is legally ambiguous or could be interpreted incorrectly by the  incoming Biden administration.   Let's set the record straight. The term ``practicable'' has been used  in major legislation for decades. It is in the bipartisan Workforce  Innovation and Opportunity Act, or WIOA, which was introduced by the  ranking Republican on the Education and Labor subcommittee that has  jurisdiction over it. It is used 10 separate times in the bill we are  considering. We all know what it means.   The attack on this amendment isn't about the requirements for a grant  program. It is about the inclusion of the word ``labor'' in a bill to  be carried out by the U.S. Department of Labor.   Anyone who reads this amendment can see clearly what it does and that  this fearmongering is about a problem that simply does not exist.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote for this amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, this week, we learned that one of  the biggest offshore wind developers in the world entered into an  agreement with North America's Building Trades Unions of this country  to develop apprenticeships and training programs for all the offshore  wind development that they are going to undertake in the oceans off of  our East Coast, creating thousands of new jobs and fantastic  opportunities for our young workers to learn the latest technology and  the energy production of the future.   It is such a great example of how apprenticeships and partnerships  between unions and companies, the biggest companies in the world with  the latest technology, and the whole way the economy is moving, is an  important part of our future.   This amendment facilitates those efforts. This bill will help our  workforce zoom into the future, earning while they learn and securing  jobs that, on average, start at $70,000 or more.   Mr. Speaker, with great enthusiasm, I hope everyone votes for this  amendment.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I would inquire if I have time  remaining or has my time expired.
