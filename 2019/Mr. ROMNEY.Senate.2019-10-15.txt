 Madam President, I wish to congratulate Mr. Russ  Cowley, a man of remarkable achievement and character, on a career  dedicated to public service for the great State of Utah. After three  decades with the Six County Association of Governments, including 22  years of service as its executive director, Russ is passing the torch  of leadership. He leaves behind a distinguished legacy and big boots to  fill.   The Six County Association of Governments is instrumental in  facilitating economic and community development in Juab, Millard,  Piute, Sanpete, Sevier, and Wayne Counties. Six County AOG brings local  voices to the table to oversee State and Federal programs as well as a  wide range of services in an efficient and impactful manner for rural  Utah.   As executive director, Russ has demonstrated an extraordinary ability  to bring together the right people and resources to achieve results for  the Six County region. His commitment to fostering development is  evident in his hiring of staff who are dedicated to accessing resources  for local governments.   Russ has advocated on behalf of rural Utahns by bringing together  important stakeholders and decisionmakers. He pioneered an annual  leadership summit, which focuses on rural Utah's economic growth, and  the Natural Resource Summer Meeting, which highlights critical public  lands and natural resource issues for the region. Additionally, the  congressional briefing highlights specific pressing topics for Members  of Congress and their staffs, and the Six County Legislative Day  connects local elected officials and State legislators to set  legislative goals on these critical issues.   The legacy of Russ Cowley will shape rural Utah for generations to  come. Our great State owes him a debt of gratitude for three decades of  selfless public service. We wish the cowboy from Venice the best in his  next chapter.   Thank you, Russ, for your service to our State.                            ____________________
