 Mr. President, I rise today to honor the life and legacy  of Mr. Richard ``Rick'' Graham Hill, revered leader of the Oneida  Nation of Wisconsin, whose tireless work on behalf of all Native  peoples will be honored, admired, and emulated for generations to come.   Rick's work and accomplishments throughout his lifelong dedication to  Tribal service were as dynamic as Rick himself. Grandson of Dr. Lillie  Rosa Minoka-Hill--only the second indigenous female doctor in America-- Rick was destined to live an exceptional life.   Early on, Rick proved to be an elite athlete, earning the title of  West De Pere High School Athlete of the Year in 1971. In keeping with  Wisconsin tradition, his favorite sport was football. He would later  serve as executive producer of a film still in production, entitled  ``Bright Path: The Story of Jim Thorpe,'' honoring the NFL Hall-of- Famer and America's first Native athlete to win an Olympic Gold Medal.  His natural strength and enduring achievements in athletic competition  were precursors to the successes that would eventually define his true  legacy: his tireless, unbeatable, loving dedication to the advancement  of Native communities.   At age 23, influenced by his time spent attending Tribal meetings  with his father, Rick became the youngest person to serve on Oneida's  Tribal Council. He would serve two terms as chairman of the Oneida  Nation, from 1990 to 1993 and from 2008 to 2011. His first term brought  the first gaming compact between the Oneida Nation and the State of  Wisconsin, a major milestone that would reshape the economic future of  the Oneida. Gaming to Rick was more than a business venture or a path  to profit--the advancement of gaming was the continuation of the fight  for the sovereignty, empowerment, and advancement of all Native peoples  from coast to coast. Gaming brought revenue for healthcare, employment,  education, and a host of other basic services crucial to independence.   Not surprisingly, in 1993, while still serving as chairman of the  Oneida Nation, Rick became chairman of the National Indian Gaming  Association, NIGA, a position he would hold until 2001. Rick flourished  in this role: he rallied and unified other Native Tribes to the cause,  tirelessly traveling to promote Indian gaming both inside the courtroom  and in discussions with Governors and U.S. Senators.   Even outside of his official service in the Oneida Nation and the  NIGA, Rick's entrepreneurial efforts to lift up and diversify Native  economies made history. His unique ability to unify Tribes in pursuit  of common goals was best exemplified by the creation of Four Fires,  LLC. This four-Tribe partnership, the first inter-Tribal economic  undertaking of its kind in history, culminated in the creation of a $43  million development located a short walk from our Nation's Capitol and  only three blocks from the Smithsonian National Museum of the American  Indian. This is the first Tribally owned enterprise in Washington, DC.   Rick's memory will be kept alive by his three sons, Richard Graham  Lo'nikuhliyo'stu, Jr., aka Lotni; Sage McKinney Lolihwaka.te Hill; and  Dakota Grahame Tehokahtlu'.ni Hill, as well as the countless many whose  lives he touched in immeasurable ways. To all who knew him, Rick will  be remembered as a visionary, full of brilliance and fortitude, with  the resolve possessed by the few, true champions of our times. He will  also be remembered as a calm, quiet presence, generous with his  laughter and jokes, with a heart full of devotion to those he served. I  will be forever grateful that Rick's legacy will live on in the pride  of the Native peoples he championed and forever honored to call him my  friend.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise today to honor a distinguished  citizen of Wisconsin, Ronald Alan McCrea, who passed away in Madison on  Dec. 14, 2019. McCrea's career included praiseworthy journalism,  architectural scholarship on Frank Lloyd Wright, and gay activism.   Ron McCrea came from a family of journalists. His grandfather, Archie  McCrea, was editor of the Muskegon Chronicle in Michigan, and his  father was an editor for the Saginaw News and Toledo Blade. Ron began  his journalism career editing his high school paper, the Arthur Hill  News. He would also edit the Albion College Pleiad. He worked at the  Boston Globe, the Washington Post, the Washington Star, the Long Island  Newsday, and the San Jose Mercury News. Ron was one of the outstanding  journalists in Madison, where he served as an editor and reporter at  the Capital Times from 1970 to 1977 and again from 1998 to 2008. While  in Madison, he was also an editor of the Press Connection from 1977 to  1980, the paper that emerged from a newspaper strike that he helped  lead.   Ron graduated from Albion College in 1965 with a B.A. in political  science. He was awarded an M.A. from the Fletcher School of Law and  Diplomacy at Tufts University and did further graduate work at the  Medill School of Journalism at Northwestern University.   His gay activism began in the early 1970s when he joined the  Wisconsin's first gay rights organization, the Madison Alliance for  Homosexual Equality, MAHE, which was founded in the fall of 1969 after  the Stonewall Riots. Ron participated in panels that the early Gay  Center sent out to classes on the University of Wisconsin-Madison  campus. In line with his labor activism, he successfully lobbied for  the Newspaper Guild to include nondiscrimination on the basis of sexual  orientation in its model contract used throughout the Nation.   When elected in 1982, Governor Anthony Earl asked Ron to serve as his  press secretary. Because of his advocacy, one of the State's major  papers headlined the appointment of an ``Avowed Homosexual.'' Earl  refused McCrea's offer to withdraw the appointment as too  controversial.  [[Page S433]]    During his journalism career, Ron McCrea became the chronicler of  some unique LGBT history in the Madison area. One of his earliest  efforts included stories on the hidden 1962 Gay Purge at the UW- Madison. He also contributed many unique items to the LGBT Collection  of the UW-Madison Archives.   Ron loved a good story and entertained many of his friends with his  delightful skill in presenting a tale. He had a deep love of music and  was known for singing with Madison choral groups and tripping the  ivories at the piano bar at Going My Way.   Ron is survived by his wife of 26 years, Elaine DeSmidt, and his  stepson, Benjamin DeSmidt. Elaine, described as his partner, passion  and love, was also involved in public life as an elected member of the  Dane County Board of Supervisors.   Ron McCrea was an accomplished storyteller, a humorous character, and  a courageous pioneer. He leaves behind a legacy of humble but bold  encouragement of the gay community. I am proud to honor his unflinching  advocacy, personal kindness, and steadfast leadership.                            ____________________
