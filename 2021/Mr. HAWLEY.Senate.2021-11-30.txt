 Madame President, LTC John Meyer joined my office as our  defense fellow this past January. It is hard to overestimate in the  months since just how much he has contributed.   Time and again, John has drawn on his rich background and his  experiences in the Middle East, the Pacific, and with some of the  Army's most elite units to inform our work on defense and national  security.   More than that, he has consistently stepped up, even when he didn't  have to, to help those in need--from veterans and servicemembers at  home in Missouri to those affected by the bombing in Kabul over the  summer.   For all of these reasons and more, it has been a real privilege to  have John as a part of our team this year. We are going to miss him  when he goes all too soon here, but I am confident he will continue to  serve our Nation with the utmost distinction wherever his career takes  him.   I want to take this opportunity, in light of all of that, to request  floor privileges for John as a small gesture of my gratitude for his  service to my office, to Missouri, and to our Nation.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Lieutenant  Colonel John Meyer be granted floor privileges for the remainder of the  Congress.
