 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   During debate on this legislation in committee, a number of our  Members expressed concerns on the merits of the settlement achieved  under S. 216. Ultimately, this bill authorizes a settlement to the  Spokane Tribe for damages as a result of the construction of the Grand  Coulee Dam.   As stated in the findings section of the legislation, after  construction of the dam, the Federal Government recognized that the  Colville and Spokane Tribes should be compensated for their losses.  Negotiations commenced, and settlements were reached between the  Federal Government and both Tribes independently. No further claims  were brought forward by the Spokane Tribe, and, as a result, the  Tribe's claims were deemed fully settled.   Now, nearly 50 years later, Congress is granting a settlement to the  Tribe that will entitle them to a share of revenues from hydropower  sales by the Bonneville Power Administration in perpetuity.   The main concern raised by our Members was the potential of this bill  as precedence to resettle claims between an entity and the Federal  Government that have already been deemed settled.   In addition, concerns have been raised that this legislation leaves  the door open to off-reservation gambling.                                time  1715    During the last 18 years, most House-passed bills addressing Tribal  land use issues have contained express restrictions on off-reservation  gambling. S. 216 seems to be one of the few that does not.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I do have one more.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  Colorado (Mr. Lamborn).    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 722, the Miracle  Mountain Designation Act. This bill would designate a mountain near Elk  Ridge, Utah, as Miracle Mountain to recognize the providential events  that took place in early September 2018 during the Pole Creek and Bald  Mountain fires.   These massive wildfires burned roughly 120,000 acres in Utah. The  fires and their smoke were visible to the majority of Utah's residents  in the greater Salt Lake City area.   Two northern Utah cities located in Congressman Curtis' district, Elk  Ridge and Woodland Hills, narrowly escaped these fires barreling  towards their communities. Evacuations were ordered for these  communities, and families were forced to abandon their homes and pray  for the best. Swift winds and severe drought conditions fueled the fire  which was on a direct path towards these small towns.   On September 13, a miracle happened. As the fire reached the base of  a lone mountain standing between the fire and Elk Ridge, the winds  inexplicably shifted, and the fires were thrown off their deadly path.  These communities were miraculously spared.   Since the fire, the unnamed peak has been referred to as Miracle  Mountain by many Utahns.   Two weeks ago, Elk Ridge Mayor Ty Ellis testified before the Natural  Resources Committee about the miracle he had witnessed. At the hearing,  Mayor Ellis stated: ``As I drove towards that mountain, I said to  myself, it truly is a miracle that that mountain remains green, and  behind it is nothing but ash.''   Mayor Ellis reached out to Congressman Curtis soon after the fire had  been contained to see if the peak could be named ``Miracle Mountain.''   We are all grateful to the courageous Federal, State, and local  firefighters who worked tirelessly to battle the blaze.   Naming the peak Miracle Mountain is a fitting acknowledgement of  divine intervention and a gesture of gratitude to all those who came  together to save these towns and help those who were forced to  evacuate.   Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of this measure, and I reserve the  balance of my time.  [[Page H10301]]         Mr. Speaker, I have one speaker.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  Colorado (Mr. Lamborn).    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, this bill will help ensure that certain Columbia River  Tribes have meaningful access to usual and accustomed fishing areas and  related fishing facilities as established by treaty.   Due to the construction of dams in the 1930s and 1950s along the  Columbia River, the lands of these Tribes were flooded. Congress  authorized the Federal Government to acquire and replace lost Tribal  fishing areas along the river, including the construction of  improvements. However, in recent years, there have been continued  reports that the conditions at these fishing sites have deteriorated  significantly.   S. 50 directs the Department of the Interior to assess current  sanitation and safety conditions on lands that were set aside to  provide affected Columbia River Treaty Tribes access to traditional  fishing grounds. The Bureau of Indian Affairs would also be authorized  to execute improvements at the sites in coordination with the four  Tribes that the sites serve.   While this legislation is intended to address safety and basic  maintenance needs, it is not the intent of Congress for these fishing  sites to become permanent residences but to continue their existing  purpose as traditional fishing access sites.   With this caveat, we see no issues with this bill that was favorably  reported by unanimous consent by the Committee on Natural Resources  last Congress.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians is a relatively  small Tribe located in the Great Smoky Mountains of western North  Carolina. The Tribe was opposed to the construction of the Tellico Dam  and, after its completion in 1979, worked with the Tennessee Valley  Authority regarding impacted areas that were of historic significance  to the Tribe. The Tribe currently manages most of these properties  under permanent easements granted in the mid-1980s as a result of an  informal agreement with TVA.   This bill would permanently transfer these properties, totaling  approximately 96 acres along the Little Tennessee River and the Tellico  Reservoir, in trust status for the Tribe.   Gaming, pursuant to the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, would be  prohibited. Most of the parcels to be placed in trust under the bill  will be used for memorializing and interpreting the history of the  Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians. The remaining parcels will be used  for recreational trails.   I commend the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Fleischmann) for his  continued hard work on this legislation, which passed the House last  Congress by an overwhelming vote of 383-2. I hope the Senate will take  the opportunity to pass this worthy legislation this Congress.   Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the measure, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have one speaker.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  Tennessee (Mr. Fleischmann).    Mr. Speaker, I again commend the gentleman from  Tennessee for his work on this bill. The Trail of Tears passes through  my district in Arkansas. Again, this is a long-overdue bill.   I urge passage of it in the House, and I urge our friends in the  Senate to take up the bill and pass it, as well.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
