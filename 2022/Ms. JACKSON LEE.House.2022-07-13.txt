 Mr. Speaker, let me thank the chair very much for  yielding.   Let me acknowledge both my good friend, Mr. Cicilline, and my good  friend, Mr. Upton, for their thoughtfulness.   Let me provide a response and relief to my good friend from Florida.  First of all, I champion the heroes who run into burning buildings, law  enforcement that save persons who are under attack, and the outstanding  heroes of natural disasters and manmade disasters. They are valuable.   But I do want to answer the question that we have seen, i.e., Uvalde  a lot of good guys with guns and nothing happened. And so this active  shooter legislation is common sense. Let me dispel your fears. There is  modern-day technology that experts run by FEMA under the DOJ will, in  fact, be able in this active shooter legislation pinpoint where the  active shooter may be.   I have here a list of shootings that have gone on in Uvalde; Buffalo;  Boulder, Colorado; Atlanta; Dayton; El Paso; Virginia Beach; Thousand  Oaks; Pittsburgh; Parkland; Sutherland; Las Vegas; Orlando; Oregon;  Rosenberg; and Oak Creek.   I can assure you that the active shooter legislation would have been  effective.                                time  1300    Individuals had gotten the guns legally, allegedly, but no one gave  notice to those people that a shooting was going on.   In recent weeks and months and years, we have mourned the loss of  life resulting from an ever-increasing number of active shooters.  Communities in every corner of this country are suffering.   For instance, eight people were killed roughly 30 miles apart in  three spas. No active shooter alert. If that had been done, someone  could have been prepared that an active shooter that had a propensity  to go into spas was killing people. He ran around creating havoc.   We know what happened in Uvalde, Texas--no notice that there was  havoc going on in Robb Elementary School. Tell that to the parents.   Highland Park, Illinois, a Fourth of July parade ended abruptly as  the shooting came. If we had had that, there might have been relief.   Please realize that we are here trying to save lives. In saving  lives, yes, we want a ban on the assault weapons, but we would hope  that you would join us on a bipartisan bill that will simply notify  people what is happening, not deny them their due process rights.   H.R. 6538 is an important bill that would authorize the Department of  Justice to coordinate an active shooter alert network. We will be  listening to law enforcement and those with technology to ensure that  the system works.   AMBER Alerts, for those of us in disaster territory and storm  territory, work.    Mr. Speaker, I will not leave the floor without  trying my best to give the names from Uvalde: Makenna, Layla, Maranda,  Nevaeh, Jose, Xavier, Tess, Rojelio, Eliahna, Eliahna, Annabell,  Jackie, Uziyah, Jayce, Maite, Jailah, Irma, Eva, Amerie, Alexandria,  and Alithia; and those of this great community of Buffalo: Roberta,  Margus, Andre, Aaron, Geraldine, Celestine, Heyward, Katherine, Pearl,  and Ruth. These are people who have died. Highland will have their list  of names added to this.   Support the AMBER Alert that makes the difference in an active  shooting so that even though there are good guys out there, you can  tell the people to save their lives. For the little 2-year-old that we  will hear about soon, support the legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 6538, the ``Active Shooter  Alert Act of 2022.''   In recent weeks, months, and years, we have mourned the loss of life  resulting from an ever-increasing number of active shooter incidents  where perpetrators committed mass shootings in multiple locations.   Communities in every corner of this country have been subjected to  the fear and uncertainty created by active shooters in their midst.   Last year, there were 61 active shooter incidents in the United  States. Approximately 27 of those incidents involved an active shooter  moving from one location to another.   For instance, 8 people were killed roughly 30 miles apart at three  spas in the metro Atlanta area last year. The gunman was later  apprehended some 150 miles south of Atlanta.   In May this year, as we all know, 19 fourth graders and two teachers  in Uvalde, Texas were slaughtered in a mass shooting that began when  the perpetrator shot his grandmother in the home they shared, drove  away, and crashed his vehicle outside Robb Elementary, where he entered  and committed unspeakable acts.   And just a week ago in Highland Park, Illinois, a Fourth of July  parade ended abruptly when a shooter opened fire on spectators, then  fled the scene, prompting a citywide search.   While the actions of these individuals and other active shooters are  unacceptable and require Congress to enact measures to put an end to  such evil acts, we must also be prepared if these situations occur, and  do all we can to help law enforcement save more lives.   Law enforcement's response to an active shooter is a dynamic  situation--oftentimes chaotic--that involves many variables, requires  swift, consequential decision-making, and places great strain on law  enforcement command staff and their officers on the ground.   Their goal is to save the lives of victims and prevent others from  unknowingly entering the area or walking into the line of fire--at all  times focusing on containing, neutralizing, and apprehending the  shooter.   We all saw the video of the band members in Highland Park who  continued to march along the parade route as shots rang out above their  heads. We saw the confused looks on the faces of the spectators as they  tried to determine if the loud bangs were gunshots or fireworks.   An Active Shooter Alert could have helped those people fully  ascertain the danger they were in and get to safety faster. An Alert  might have saved the life of the woman who unknowingly walked directly  into the line of fire of the Buffalo Shooter in the Tops parking lot.   Centers of higher learning and primary education, businesses, local  jurisdictions, and law enforcement agencies have already implemented  some systems to alert students, employees, patrons, and community  members of the presence of an active shooter, and to help manage the  response, and provide updates about the ongoing crisis via text message  and/or social media.  [[Page H5997]]    Many of these systems face low enrollment and messaging delays that  sometimes contribute to confusion around the incident. In the case of  social media--insufficient account visibility means fewer people are  made aware of an existing threat to their safety.   Law enforcement needs a reliable method of communication to rapidly  notify as many people as possible within the vicinity of an ongoing  active shooter incident; provide instructions to avoid the area or  shelter in place; and announce when the area has been restored to  safety.   H.R. 6538, the Active Shooter Alert Act of 2022, would authorize the  Department of Justice to coordinate the creation of an Active Shooter  Alert Network, enabling law enforcement to send active shooter alerts  to mobile devices within their communities using the same system that  issues AMBER Alerts, severe storm and extreme weather events warnings,  and other emergency situations.   This legislation would ensure that an advisory panel--comprised of  law enforcement officers, public safety experts, and emergency response  officials experienced in responding to active shooter situations--has  input in the development of best practices for issuing alerts  effectively.   DOJ would oversee establishment of the advisory panel; establish and  promote adoption of the best practices; and coordinate with FEMA, the  Department of Transportation, and the FCC to issue alerts for the  network and to provide a report to Congress on the effectiveness of the  network.   Although this system would be available to law enforcement agencies  to use on a voluntary basis, I expect many agencies will elect to  participate based on the many endorsements received from law  enforcement agencies.   I thank ACAL Subcommittee Chairman Cicilline for his leadership on  this lifesaving, bipartisan legislation that I am proud to cosponsor  along with Representatives Deutch, Spartz, Upton, Thompson, Meijer, and  Mace.

The amendment I want to highlight, among others, is the amendment  that calls for the Secretary of Defense to evaluate and report to  Congress the extent of threat to national security posed by domestic  terrorist groups and organizations motivated by a belief system of  white supremacy, such as the Proud Boys and Boogaloo.   We know that those organizations certainly found themselves roving  around during January 6 and were actually called and motivated to come  to Washington by the former President of the United States.   We also know that Director Wray has indicated that domestic terrorism  is one of greatest threats to the United States. As reported in the  media and government intelligence reports, coupled with recent arrests  and successful violent attacks carried out by the Boogaloo Bois and  militia extremists, these representations are very troubling.   My concern is that as the Nation moves toward a historic national  election, the activity of violent influences, like the Boogaloo Bois  and Proud Boys, will increase and lead to attacks becoming more  frequent. I ask my colleagues to continue to support the amendments en  bloc 2 for that amendment.    I also want to highlight my amendment that asks for $10 million to  increase funding for increased collaboration between the DOD Office of  Health and the National Institutes of Health  [[Page H6331]]  for research to combat triple-negative breast cancer.   As a breast cancer survivor myself, I can tell you the enormous  impact that triple-negative breast cancer has. It is a particular form  of breast cancer that metastasizes very quickly. It accounts for  between 13 to 25 percent of all breast cancer in the United States, the  onset is at a younger age, and it is more aggressive and more likely to  metastasize. This work will help young women in the United States  military and young men, who also are sometimes diagnosed with breast  cancer.   Let me also ask for support for post-traumatic stress disorder. I  have worked on this for many, many years, even developed a center in my  district off campus from the veterans' hospital.   PTSD was first brought to public attention in relation to war  veterans, but it can result from a variety of traumatic incidents. The  increase, I believe, reaffirms the importance of helping those with  PTSD and restoring their lives.   I want to make sure as well that my amendment dealing with requiring  the chief of the National Guard, in coordination with the Secretary of  Defense, to submit to Congress and other entities a report identifying  personnel training and equipment required by the non-federalized  National Guard to prevent, mitigate, respond, and recover from natural  and manmade disasters.   Houston is hurricane prone. I cannot tell you the kind of work and  leadership that the Texas National Guard has done on behalf of my  constituents and the entire State when we have been in trouble. The  huge trucks that have come in with MREs and the help during the  flooding has been enormous.   Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to support all of my amendments  and to highlight those that I have just highlighted.    Madam Speaker, I will just emphasize that the  National Guard has been enormously effective in helping us during  disaster.   But let me finish quickly with the amendment dealing with young  people in the academy, in particular a young cadet that had a  stuttering issue. My amendment says that cadets should be diagnosed  with whatever disability they may have, be assessed, do their 4 years,  and when it comes time for a command, don't push them out like this  young cadet was, but to ensure that they have the ability, with their  talents, to be able to accept a command. They want to serve their  Nation.   Madam Speaker, I ask support for the amendments en bloc 2 and all of  my amendments.   Thank you, Madam Speaker, for this opportunity to express my support  for H.R. 7900, the ``National Defense Authorization Act for FY 2023.''   Congress has the solemn duty to ensure that those who wear the  uniform of the United States--and those civilians who provide  logistical and operational support--have the equipment, training, and  resources needed to carry out and complete their mission.   And we must never forget that a grateful nation has a sacred  obligation, in the words of President Lincoln, ``to care for him who  has borne the battle, and for his widow and his orphan.''   Many of my amendments were made in order by the Rules Committee. I  would like to summarize them, two of which were included in En Bloc 1:   First, amendment 59 recognizes that Black men and women have played  an integral role in our nation's defense from the bravery of Crispus  Attucks, an escaped slave, during the Boston Massacre, to the present  day. The amendment would address the historical and current barriers to  Black Americans' participation and equal treatment in the Armed  Services.   I would like to elaborate on the importance of Amendment 59, about  the lessons that can be learned about the social, cultural, legal, and  logistical impacts, as well as the advances made, by the integration of  African Americans into the warfighting capacity of our nation.   The racial inequality and mistreatment of Black men and women that  has historically permeated our military continues to this day, with  more than 750 complaints of racial or ethnic discrimination from  service members in fiscal year 2020 alone.   But discrimination doesn't exist just within the military rank-and- file, as in that same fiscal year, civilians working in the financial,  technical and support sectors of the Army, Air Force and Navy also  filed 900 complaints of racial discrimination and over 350 complaints  of discrimination by skin color, data from the U.S. Equal Employment  Opportunity Commission shows.   According to a report by the Defense Department's Diversity and  Inclusion Board, while the enlisted ranks of the active and reserve  military were ``slightly more racially and ethnically diverse than its  U.S. civilian counterparts,'' the opposite was true for the officer  corps.   We owe it to those brave men and women who have proven time and time  again to be an integral part of our military to examine the Armed  Services' history of discrimination and to determine the necessary  steps to repair the harm caused by these inequities.   Second, my amendment 28 directs the Secretary of Defense to evaluate,  and report to Congress, about the extent of the threat to national  security posed by domestic terrorist groups and organizations motivated  by a belief system of white supremacy, such as the Proud Boys and  Boogaloo.   In the past and with greater intensity, I have raised concerns over  the role that Boogaloo and Proud Boys have played in bringing an  element of violence into the otherwise peaceful protests following the  death of George Floyd.   The violence seen during the recent national movement to end the  deaths of unarmed black men while in police custody is not the start of  these violent activities associated with Boogaloo movement or Proud  Boys activity.   The threat posed by accelerationists and militia extremists--a range  of violent anti-government actors, movements, and organizations, some  of which branch out of decades-old ideologies and others which are  relatively new has led to violent engagement of law enforcement.   These varied threats range from decentralized and leaderless  accelerationist networks using social media platforms, such as the  Boogaloo movement, to more structured, far-right militia extremist  groups.   The ideologies undergirding these movements or groups have some  similarities to other anti-government and white supremacist beliefs but  are often not tied to a single, monolithic ideology.   In addition, in many cases, their adherents' decentralized and coded  use of digital tools poses unique challenges for law enforcement and  government officials to identify and track their activity.   These developments in domestic terrorism, as reported in the media  and government intelligence reports--coupled with recent arrests and  successful violent attacks carried out by ``Boogaloo boys'' and militia  extremists--are troubling.   My concern is that as the nation moves toward a historic national  election, the activity of violence influencers like Boogaloo Boys or  Proud Boys will increase and lead to attacks becoming more frequent.   In 2018, we saw too many instances of violent extremist searching for  opportunities to sow violence and disrupt democratic processes.   Boogaloo and Proud Boys are targeting constitutionally protected  activity for cooption or to provide cover for attacks.   This amendment will result in a report that will provide valuable  insight into activities associated with Boogaloo and Proud Boys.   Under the guidance that produced this report, there should not be any  activity directed at groups that are not known for violent activity or  have a history of engaging in violence directed at the United States  government.   My next amendments were adopted in En Bloc 2:   Amendment 194--Provides authorization for a $10 million increase in  funding for increased collaboration between the DoD Office of Health  and the National Institutes of Health to research and combat Triple  Negative Breast Cancer.   As a Member of Congress, a mother, a sister and a spouse, and a  breast cancer survivor, I feel a special responsibility to do all I can  to ensure every American can win in the fight against all types of  breast cancer but especially triple negative breast cancer (TNBC).   About 10-20 percent of breast cancers test negative for both hormone  receptors and HER2 in the lab, which means they are triple-negative.   What is Triple Negative Breast Cancer? The term triple negative  breast cancer refers to the fact that this form of breast cancer will  test negative, which means that each of the test will return negative  results for the presence of breast cancer for three types of breast  cancer tests:   Estrogen receptor;   Progesterone receptor; and   human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 or the HER2 test will be  negative.   To understand triple-negative breast cancer, it's important to  understand receptors, which are proteins found inside and on the  surface  [[Page H6332]]  of cells. These receptor proteins are the ``eyes'' and ``ears'' of the  cells, receiving messages from substances in the bloodstream and then  telling the cells what to do.   Hormone receptors inside and on the surface of healthy breast cells  receive messages from the hormones estrogen and progesterone. The  hormones attach to the receptors and provide instructions that help the  cells continue to grow and function well.   Most, but not all, breast cancer cells also have these hormone  receptors.   Roughly 2 out of 3 women have breast cancer that tests positive for  hormone receptors.   In 2013, the American Cancer Society Surveillance and Health Services  Institute estimated that 27,060 black women would be diagnosed with the  illness.   The rate of breast cancer is 10 percent lower in African American  women than white women--it is the type of breast cancer (Triple  Negative) that African American women contract that is alarming.   Because African American women are diagnosed in greater numbers with  Triple Negative Breast Cancer we have a five year survival rate of 78  percent after diagnosis as compared to 90 percent for white women.   The incidence rate of breast cancer among women under 45 is higher  for African American women compared to white women.   Triple Negative Breast Cancer:   Accounts for between 13 percent and 25 percent of all breast cancer  in the US;   Onset is at a younger age;   Is more aggressive; and   Is more likely to metastasize.   Currently, 70 percent of women with metastatic triple negative breast  cancer do not live more than five years after being diagnosed.   African American women are 3 times more likely to develop triple- negative breast cancer than White women. African-American women have  prevalence TNBC of 26 percent vs. 16 percent in non-African-Americans  women.   The key to beating this cancer is not just early detection--but  detection period.   A 2007 study of more than 50,000 women with all stages of breast  cancer found that 77 percent of women with triple-negative breast  cancer survived at least 5 years, versus 93 percent of women with other  types of breast cancer.   Another study of more than 1,600 women published in 2007 found that  women with triple-negative breast cancer had a higher risk of death  within 5 years of diagnosis, but not after that time period.   The recurrence and survival figures in these and other studies are  averages for all women with triple-negative breast cancer.   The DoD needs to be prioritizing this very real and lethal condition  to ensure women are being protected.   Amendment 195 directs the Secretary of Defense to audit current  practices regarding administration of sexual harassment claims and  submit a report no later 180 days after passage detailing efforts to  prevent sexual harassment and protect service-members, and compiling  data and research on sexual harassment prevalence in the military,  cases reported, legal proceedings, and convictions.   Sexual assault is endemic in our military, especially for female  armed service members.   Streamlining and auditing the process of reporting sexual assault  protects victims and is a necessary step in weeding out abusers.   Amendment 191 provides authorization for $2.5 million increase in  funding to combat post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).   According to the NIH, an estimated 3.6 percent of U.S. adults had  PTSD in the past year.   PTSD was first brought to public attention in relation to war  veterans, but it can result from a variety of traumatic incidents, such  as torture, being kidnapped or held captive, bombings, or natural  disasters such as floods or earthquakes.   People with PTSD may startle easily, become emotionally numb  (especially in relation to people with whom they used to be close),  lose interest in things they used to enjoy, have trouble feeling  affectionate, be irritable, become more aggressive, or even become  violent.   They avoid situations that remind them of the original incident, and  anniversaries of the incident are often very difficult.   Most people with PTSD repeatedly relive the trauma in their thoughts  during the day and in nightmares when they sleep. These are called  flashbacks. A person having a flashback may lose touch with reality and  believe that the traumatic incident is happening all over again.   My amendment recognizes that these soldiers are first and foremost,  human. They carry their experiences with them.   Ask a veteran of Vietnam, Iraq, or Afghanistan about the frequency of  nightmares they experience, and one will realize that serving in the  Armed Forces leaves a lasting impression, whether good or bad.   My amendment will help ensure that ``no soldier is left behind'' by  addressing the urgent need for more outreach toward hard to reach  veterans suffering from PTSD, especially those who are homeless or  reside in underserved urban and rural areas of our country.   Amendment 199 directs the Secretary of Defense to promulgate  regulations to ensure that candidates granted admission to attend a  military academy undergo screening for speech disorders and be provided  the results of the screening test and a list of warfare unrestricted  line (URL) Officer positions and occupation specialists that require  successful performance on the speech test.   Academy students should have the option of undergoing speech therapy  to reduce speech disorders or impediments.   Amendment 188 directs the Secretary to submit to Congress within 180  days a report on the recognition of African Americans who have served  in the Armed Forces and opportunities for their inclusion in DOD naming  practices and conventions for military installations, infrastructure,  vessels, and weapon systems.   In every war waged from the Battle of Lexington to the Battle for  Fallujah, African Americans have honorably answered the call to duty,  and served with valor and distinction in America's armed forces.   At decisive moments in our nation's history, the United States  military and its citizen warriors, were there and made the difference.   Our thanks to the military for being always ready to answer the call  of duty--whether that call comes in the dead of night or the light of  day--we know that we can count on you.   The fact that military bases have been named after Confederate  military leaders or soldiers is hard to imagine given that they were  fighting to end the United States. The Confederacy was not something  that should be held up for honor by the United States or our nation's  military.   There is no shortage of honorable replacement candidates to receive  the honor of having a military base, installation or facility named in  their honor.   Amendment 198 requires the Chief of the National Guard Bureau, in  coordination with the Secretary of Defense, to submit to Congress and  other entities in 2023, 2024, and 2025 a report identifying the  personnel, training, and equipment required by the non-federalized  National Guard to prevent, mitigate, respond to, and recover from  natural and man-made disasters.   Hurricane Harvey's impact in Texas is still being felt more than 30  months later. The storm's footprint covered over 9,000 square miles,  including the city of Houston. Hurricane Harvey dropped over 52 inches  of rain in the Houston area and over 60 inches were recorded elsewhere  in the state.   At its peak on September 1, 2017, one-third of Houston, our nation's  fourth largest city, was underwater leaving 34,575 evacuees in shelters  across Texas. Before the flood waters had receded in Houston two other  monster Hurricanes were bearing down on citizens living in the U.S.  Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico.   The scope and magnitude of these dueling disasters tested the  National Guard and Reservists in ways that were new.   This amendment requires a readiness report by the National Guard and  Reservists to make sure they have what they need to assist communities  in need of disaster assistance during future Hurricane Seasons.   Many Texans are still recovering from Hurricane Harvey, and the same  is true of residents of many other areas hit hard by disasters.   My amendment will help the National Guard help communities prepare  for disasters, respond to them, and rebuild from them.   It will improve the ability to support the important mission of the  National Guard and Reservists to engage in disaster response.   Amendment 197 requires the Secretary of the Navy, not later than 180  days after enactment of this Act, to submit to Congress a report on  desalinization technology's application for defense and national  security purposes to provide drought relief to areas impacted by sharp  declines in water resources.   In 2010, the United States consumed about 355,000 million gallons of  water per day.   Worldwide, some 700 million people do not have access to enough clean  water.   In 10 years the number is expected to more than double to 1.8  billion.   Two-thirds of the Earth's surface is water, but in fact less than 1  percent it is available for human use.   The rest of the water on our planet is either salt water found in  oceans, fresh water frozen in the polar ice caps, or too inaccessible  for practical usage.   While population and demand on freshwater resources are increasing,  supply will always remain constant.   And although the water cycle continuously returns water to Earth, it  is not always returned to the same place, or in the same quantity and  quality.   I offered this amendment because we must plan for the future water  needs of our nation and our defense facilities and operations  worldwide.  [[Page H6333]]    There are serious water shortages in some regions of the country and  the prospects that sustained water shortages due to regional growth and  climate factors may make it necessary to develop alternative sources  for water intended for human and agricultural uses.   If we can harness the technology to convert ocean water into fresh  water the future of cities and rural communities that depend on water  can be much brighter.   Amendment 190 requires a report to be submitted to Congress within  240 days following enactment on the risks posed by debris in low earth  orbit and to make recommendations on remediation of risks and outline  plans to reduce the incident of space debris.   Man-made objects in Earth's orbit that may no longer serve a useful  function can include nonfunctional spacecraft, abandoned launch vehicle  stages, mission-related debris and fragmentation debris.   Space debris travels at speeds up to 17,500 miles per hour is fast  enough for a small piece of man-made debris to damage to a satellite or  a spacecraft.   There are 500,000 pieces of debris the size of a marble or larger.   There are many millions of pieces of debris that are so small they  can't be tracked.   The Jackson Lee Amendment seeks a report from the Secretary of  Defense on the risks posed by man-made space debris, solutions for  reducing risks and strategies for reducing the incidence of more man- made space debris being introduced into space.    Amendment 193 condemns the actions of Boko Haram and directs that  the Secretary of State, in consultation with the Secretary of Defense  and the Attorney General, submit a report on efforts to combat Boko  Haram.   Amendment 189 requires a report to be submitted within 220 days  following enactment on Capacity to Provide Disaster Survivors with  Emergency Short Term Housing.   Amendment 196 directs the Secretary of Defense to report to Congress  in not less than 180 days the actions taken to protect U.S. armed  service personnel from armed attacks conducted by militants and  terrorists in pursuit of bounties and inducements the agencies,  organizations, or entities aligned with the Russian Federation.   Finally, amendment 192 requires the Secretary of Defense to report to  Congress programs and procedures employed to ensure students studying  abroad through Department of Defense National Security Education  Programs are trained to recognize, resist, and report against  recruitment efforts by agents of foreign governments.                              ____________________
