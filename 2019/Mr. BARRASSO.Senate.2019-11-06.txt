 Mr. President, I come to the floor to talk about the  work we have been doing in the Senate this week and the work we have  been doing in the Senate the last 3 years, and that is the work of  confirming a record number of judicial nominees.   I want to specifically focus on our record on circuit court judges.  As you know, these are the courts just one layer below the Supreme  Court, and their decisions have enormous consequences for the country.  We have confirmed 45 highly qualified circuit court judges. We have  done it across all 12 appeals courts nationwide. These judges will  decide 99 percent of the Federal cases in America.   President Trump has nominated each of these judges. Senate  Republicans confirmed each of these judges. These judges now hold a  full one-quarter--one out of every four--circuit court seats in  America. All of these judges have lifetime appointments. These circuit  court judges are ruling right now, and they are doing it on major cases  all across the country.   How are they making a difference in people's lives? No. 1, by  protecting Americans' constitutional rights, by upholding our  individual freedoms, by putting a check on government power, and above  all, these judges are applying the law as written, not legislating from  the bench.   Based on the 45 circuit court judges we have seated and the judges we  will continue to seat, Senate Republicans have delivered conservative  judges who will serve our Nation for decades to come.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
