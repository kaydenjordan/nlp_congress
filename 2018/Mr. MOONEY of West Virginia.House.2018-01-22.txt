 Mr. Speaker, for 3 years, I have waited  for the moment here where I want to commend my colleagues in the  Senate, the majority party, for exposing the fallacious argument that  you can hold hostage unrelated bills before you pass spending bills.   Frankly, we call upon them to pass the appropriations bills to fully  fund the government through September.   We in this body, last year, had passed all 12 separate appropriations  bills, fully funding the military and other government functions all  the way through September of this year. That needs to happen in the  next 3 weeks, because we have only a 3-week extension that we voted  for.   I am proud that the American public saw the false arguments that are  being used, particularly on the other side of the aisle, where the  minority party holds hostage funding bills and demands concessions on  other nonrelated legislation.   If they want to filibuster stuff over there, first of all, make them  do it so the American public can see it, which happened over the last  few days, and make it related to the bill on the floor at the time.                            ____________________
