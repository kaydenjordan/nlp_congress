 Madam President, today I would like to remember in the  Record former U.S. Senator Kay Hagan of North Carolina.   Senator Hagan and I served together on the Senate Committee on  Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions, where she served both North  Carolina and the United States well during her years in the Senate. We  also worked together closely on housing issues affecting Americans as a  result of the 2008 economic downturn and housing crisis.   Kay and I served as Senate coleaders of the annual Congressional  Civil Rights Pilgrimage to historic sites of the civil rights movement  in Alabama in 2013. I was honored to have her by my side along with  U.S. Representative John Lewis of Georgia during this moving event,  which culminated with an emotional crossing of the Edmund Pettus Bridge  in Selma, where Congressman Lewis was beaten during the 1965 march he  led there. Upon return, Senator Hagan wrote about the moment Montgomery  chief of police Kevin Murphy personally apologized to Congressman Lewis  on behalf of the Montgomery Police Department for the department's  failure to protect the Freedom Riders while removing his police badge  and presenting it to Congressman Lewis. She shared how this experience  served as an emotional reminder to her of the oath she took to protect  and serve the people of North Carolina.   That was how Kay worked. That trip, along with our legislative  efforts together in Washington, cemented the high respect I have had  for her and her work on many issues affecting the Southeast.   I honor of Kay Hagan, I was proud to cosponsor a Senate resolution  saluting her life and service.   I also hope she would have appreciated our vote to advance the Kay  Hagan Tick Act in the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee.  My older sister died at a very young age from the fatal results of a  tick bite, and it was tragic to see Senator Hagan succumb to  complications of the tickborne Powassan virus. This legislation was  named for her to improve research, prevention, diagnostics and  treatment for tick-borne diseases.   I appreciate her service to the country, and my prayers are with  Chip, her family and all those who loved her. Her legacy will live on.                            ____________________
