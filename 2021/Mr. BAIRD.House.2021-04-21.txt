 Madam Speaker, today I rise for the concerns over the  President's $2 trillion infrastructure plan. One concern is the steep  price tag, but my bigger concern is what the administration is trying  to classify as infrastructure.   We are to the point of changing the definition of what that is. We  are throwing everything in except the kitchen sink and the kitchen  table and calling it infrastructure. I think that is irrational and I  think that is irresponsible.   How can you call this an infrastructure bill when less than 6 percent  of it goes to roads and bridges, 5 percent goes to broadband  infrastructure, and less than 2 percent goes to the waterways, locks,  dams, ports, and airports?   Less than 2 percent of our waterways and ports is unacceptable. This  type of infrastructure is critical for Hoosiers in transporting our  manufactured and agriculture exports to the global market.   If we are going to ask the American taxpayers to make these critical  and substantial investments, it is our duty to make sure our dollars  are spent wisely and efficiently on true infrastructure.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague from Louisiana for  yielding. I appreciate the opportunity to be here.   Madam Speaker, this evening I really rise to voice my concerns over  the President's $2 trillion infrastructure plan.   One concern is the steep price tag, but a bigger concern is what the  administration is trying to classify as infrastructure. These attempts  from some on the other side of the aisle to classify their partisan  priorities as infrastructure, is inexcusable and it is irresponsible.   The President is asking American taxpayers to fork over $2 trillion.  If the President is asking Americans to make a substantial investment,  it is Congress' responsibility to ensure that these tax dollars are  spent wisely.   Unfortunately, the President's proposed bill doesn't do this. How can  it be infrastructure legislation when less than 6 percent goes to roads  and bridges and less than 5 percent goes to broadband infrastructure?   There is a true need for infrastructure. For instance, in my  district, our rural communities need help getting their last mile of  broadband. This pandemic has proven that high speed broadband must be  addressed.   Madam Speaker, I hope we can remove the partisan approach to this  bill and solve the real infrastructure challenges of our country.
