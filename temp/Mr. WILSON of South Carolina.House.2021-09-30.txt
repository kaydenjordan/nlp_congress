 Madam Speaker, we are at an  extraordinary time in history where inflation is threatening every  family.   ``At some point, all of us, regardless of party, must ask the simple  question--how much is enough? What I have made clear to the President  and Democratic leaders is that spending trillions more on new and  expanded government programs, when we can't even pay for the essential  social programs like Social Security and Medicare, is the definition of  fiscal insanity. Suggesting that spending trillions more will not have  an impact on inflation ignores the everyday reality that America's  families continue to pay an unavoidable inflation tax. Proposing a  historic expansion of social programs while ignoring the fact we are  not in recession and that millions of jobs remain open . . . . ''   Thank you, Senator Joe Manchin, for your courage. You and WVOC radio  talk show host Gary David have exposed insanity.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, who successfully protected  America for 20 years as the global war on terrorism continues moving  from Afghanistan to our neighborhoods.                            ____________________
