 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this resolution.   On September 30, while the House considered crucial legislation to  avoid a government shutdown, Representative Jamaal Bowman pulled a fire  alarm to disrupt proceedings, a crime for which he pled guilty. Let me  repeat that again. A crime for which he pled guilty.   As a career firefighter, who served for 25 years in the city of  Miami, 9 years of which I served as its chief, I know just how serious  this is. Every time a firefighter responds to an alarm, they are  placing themselves and the public at risk.   While that is a risk that we are willing to take to protect life and  property, we should never put our first responders and the public at  risk by pulling a false alarm. In fact, in 2021, over 40 police and  firefighters died and were killed while responding to an alarm.   While Representative Bowman initially claimed that he pulled the  alarm thinking it would open a locked door, we know that that was a  blatant lie.   After pulling the alarm, Representative Bowman can be clearly seen on  camera ripping down the emergency exit signs and fleeing the scene. He  had every opportunity to alert Capitol Police to his mistake but chose  not to.   Had it been a simple mistake, I wouldn't be here. It wasn't a simple  mistake.   It is disgraceful that a Member of Congress would go to such lengths  to break the law and put first responders and the public at risk to  prevent the House from voting to keep government open so our Federal  workers can receive their paychecks.   For obstructing the House, putting first responders and the public at  risk, and breaking D.C. laws, Representative Bowman should be censured  before the House.
