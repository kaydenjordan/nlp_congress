 Madam Speaker, this Women's History Month, I rise to  recognize Ruth Weakley of Arroyo Grande on her 100th birthday today.   During World War II, with many of America's young men serving  overseas, U.S. jobs traditionally held by men began to open their doors  to women.   While Ruth's husband, Harry, was away serving in the Army Air Force,  Ruth stepped up to serve, and became one of a handful of women driving  rural postal routes. She drove a route in Los Angeles County for nearly  2 years during the war, resigning when her husband returned from his  military service in December 1945.   Contributions like hers were both critical to our Nation's war effort  and to reshaping the role of women in our workforce and society.   Today, over 70 years after Ruth's time with the Postal Service and on  her 100th birthday, I recognize and thank her for her service to our  Nation and to women everywhere.                            ____________________
