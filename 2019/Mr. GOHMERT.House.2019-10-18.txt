 Madam Speaker, at this time, I yield to the gentleman  from Texas (Mr. Hurd), my friend.    Madam Speaker, first, I want to pay tribute to a  colleague, Congressman Elijah Cummings.   We had political disagreements, but in working together to help an  Army sergeant who was unfairly, inappropriately prosecuted while  serving and being heroic in Afghanistan, I developed a great  appreciation for Elijah Cummings' desire to see justice done.   It was an honor to work with him in successfully helping Sergeant  Derrick Miller. I am proud to have Sergeant Derrick Miller now working  with me and those of us that have started a caucus, the Congressional  Justice for Warriors Caucus.   That arose out of sincere, worthy, and quite able efforts by Elijah  Cummings. I had not been on a committee with him, but it gave me an  opportunity to see the heart of the man. He will be sorely missed here  in Congress, and I am grateful to have had the chance to have worked  with him.   Madam Speaker, I also felt it was important to pay tribute to one of  our fallen soldiers. That is Master Sergeant Mark Allen.   This is Master Sergeant Mark Allen, his wife, and child.   I think this article from David Aaro is very helpful in reminding  people who Master Sergeant Mark Allen was.   First of all, to become a master sergeant, with all the stripes above  and below, it takes many, many, many years of devoted service.   Just for a little background, when I was finishing college at Texas  A&M with a 4-year obligation of Active Duty coming up in the Army, I  was told by an officer: Look, Louie, the best thing you can do when you  get to your post is find a master sergeant that you like and feel  comfortable with, and make him your confidant, because if he is a  master sergeant, he has been around and has seen everything. You can  trust him, and he is one of the best we have in the military.   It was very wise advice. That is the kind of guy Mark Allen was.   This article says: ``Retired Army Master Sergeant Mark Allen died . .  . 10 years after he was shot while looking for a missing soldier in  Afghanistan back in 2009.'' He has died at the age of 46.   Master Sergeant ``Allen was unable to walk or speak since being shot  in the head by a sniper in July 2009 during his attempted search for  Army Sergeant Bowe Bergdahl, who walked off his base in Afghanistan.''   The article doesn't say it, but basically, Bowe Bergdahl was a  deserter. He betrayed his country. Even worse than betraying his  country, he betrayed his fellow soldiers who have to rely on each other  in a combat theater. He simply walked away and went over to the enemy.   This heroic master sergeant, Mark Allen, dutifully went out into  harm's way, looking for what they hoped was not a deserter. They hoped  that something happened, that the enemy may have gotten him. They went  looking. He was leading, looking for what turns out to have been a  deserter.   In his service to his country, and in his service to what he was  afraid was a fellow warrior who had befallen an enemy's tactics, he got  shot in the head by an enemy sniper.   Master Sergeant Allen died 10 years after he was shot while looking  for Bowe Bergdahl, the article says, who went missing in Afghanistan.  He deserted.   ``Bergdahl later pled guilty and was dishonorably discharged, reduced  in rank from sergeant to private and fined $1,000 per month over a 10- month period for deserting his post and endangering the lives of fellow  soldiers, including Allen.''   In other words, we can thank Bowe Bergdahl's desertion for getting  this man maimed, paralyzed for 10 years, and killed.    ``When Bergdahl was traded for five Taliban prisoners''--those are  the enemies. Those are people who were killing Americans, and the Obama  administration thought it wise to give five people who had killed  Americans, who were enemies of America, give those back so that they  could go on killing other Americans so that we could get our deserter  back from our enemy.   ``When Bergdahl was traded for five Taliban prisoners and brought  home, Shannon Allen, Mark's wife, didn't hold back her feelings for how  he changed their family forever.   `` `Meet my husband,' she wrote on Facebook, `injuries directly  brought to you by the actions of this traitor.' ''   Our President, Donald Trump, ``also expressed his disdain toward the  prisoner transfer of Bergdahl, calling the decision `a complete' and  `total disgrace to our country and our military.'   ``During the trial of Bergdahl, Shannon testified that it took 90  minutes to get her husband out of bed, showered, and dressed each  morning. She had to use a pulley system, which was attached to the  ceiling to move him, according to Task & Purpose.''   Master Sergeant Allen's ``young daughter also enjoyed climbing into  his wheelchair and sitting on his lap, Shannon told the outlet.   ``U.S. Veterans' Network posted a tribute, calling Allen `a true  American hero.'   `` `Master Sergeant Mark Allen, a true American hero. Thank you for  your service, brother.'   ``His service will be held in Loganville, Georgia.''                                time  1300    May he rest in peace and may something that we do here give comfort  to the family of this American hero that was betrayed by a man who the  Obama administration traded five of our enemies to get back. That is a  hero. If we were going to trade enemies for anybody, it would have been  a guy like this.   We thank Mark Allen for his service and his incredible wife and  daughter for standing by our hero for the last 10 years.   I was here in the Chamber the last couple of hours and heard the  exchanges during the colloquy between   Steve Scalise and Leader Hoyer.  I heard the comment that Adam Schiff is fair and judicious. And I hope  the Parliamentarian won't get nervous, because I am going to adeptly  avoid violating the rules.   Congressman Adam Schiff, back in 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, we were on  the Judiciary Committee together, and we had two Federal judges who  needed to be impeached. They needed to be eliminated from their  official positions as Federal judges. One had committed a sexual  assault, and the other had trouble understanding that bribes were not  appropriate for judges.   Congressman Schiff was put in charge, basically, of a temporary  committee to deal with the impeachment of those two judges, and during  those  [[Page H8255]]  efforts, it was quite bipartisan. Republicans had just gone into the  minority for the first time in many years. We were in the minority, and  Democrats were in the majority.   I found Adam Schiff very easy to work with. I found that when he gave  his word on something, it could be trusted. I found that he was a  person who was a pleasure to work together with.   I have had trouble melding those experiences with what I am seeing in  the effort to eliminate a duly elected President from his position.   I heard our majority leader say he is fair. So I would ask a  hypothetical question, not pointed directly at an individual, but just  hypothetically: Is it fair if someone lies for 2 years saying they have  overwhelming evidence that a President is guilty of being a traitor to  his country and that there is no question, the evidence is just  overwhelming and it is not just circumstantial, and it turns out there  was never such evidence?   Hypothetically speaking, I would think that such a person's fairness  would come into issue.   Hypothetically, is it fair to conspire and collude with gossipmongers  loyal to President Obama, people like Clapper and Brennen who use  potentially third-, fourth-, fifth-, sixthhand hearsay, to try to  convict a President in public opinion while remaining anonymous?   By the way, I heard reference to a whistleblower who had no direct  information--he is a gossipmonger--that there was fear for his safety.  As an old history major who has never stopped studying history, I think  we can take a look at history.   If you look at this President's time as President, and even before  being President, people who have spoken out against President Trump or  candidate Trump or businessman Trump, they seem to still be around and  talking.   I read about an Italian individual who may have colluded with the  Democratic National Committee or the Hillary Clinton campaign in  helping try to set up candidate Trump so that our intelligence, with  the cooperation, potentially, of Britain, maybe Australia, corruption  in Ukraine, corruption in Russia, trying to set President Trump up. He  was concerned for his life in Italy and was asking security.   That is what brought the question to my mind: Well, gee, who is he  afraid of? The people who have things to say--even complete lies--about  President Trump are still alive and well and kicking and lying, and  they are out there just spreading more gossip and lies. They seem to be  plenty healthy.   So the question arises: Who the heck are they--people like the person  who was involved in the conspiracy to bring down Donald Trump, who is  he afraid of? It shouldn't be Donald Trump, because the people against  him are still out there.   Could it be that fear of safety could be from those whom such a  witness could identify as conspiring to bring down Donald Trump?   There are plenty of people who are no longer alive who had been  potential witnesses against others in the Democratic Party, but it  doesn't seem that there are potential witnesses against Donald Trump  who are dead.   So who would this gossip-mongering, so-called whistleblower--he is  not a whistleblower. He is a gossipmonger. He didn't have any direct  evidence. He just wanted to create a problem for President Trump.   People with whom he colluded knew that President Trump, if they said:  Oh, he conspired in this phone conversation. He threatened Ukraine's  President. He did a quid pro quo in that conversation, it is very  clear--we even had a chairman represent from the chairman's position  that a number of times in that conversation that President Trump made  clear that he was threatening the Ukrainian President to either get  dirt on Vice President Biden or else you are not going to get help.   Well, we know Joe Biden did that. He is on video. The President  doesn't want to talk about that, at least not the mainstream.   Anyway, they knew that President Trump could not afford to release a  transcript of the conversation, so they knew whatever they were going  to say about what was in the conversation, that would be the mantra.  But it turns out President Trump did release the transcript of the  conversation, so it kind of messed up the strategy there.   They were already talking about the President doing a cover-up  because that was the strategy: Look, first, we will have this  gossipmonger call him a whistleblower. We will change the rules by  other Obama loyalists still in the intelligence arena in our  government. We will change the rules because it has always been a rule,  and a good one, you couldn't be a whistleblower unless you had direct  evidence. So they had to change the rule.   The inspector general, the new one--not the one who was there  previously; he was a very honorable person--the new one, not so  honorable. And that is why he dishonestly changed the rule for  whistleblowers so that you could be a whistleblower and not have any  direct information at all. And he backdated that so that it would go  back to the time that this gossipmonger was actually coordinating and  colluding with the majority staff on the Intelligence Committee.    We still don't know if the Intelligence Committee staff helped  prepare this so-called whistleblowing complaint.   So when we hear the so-called whistleblower, the gossipmonger is  concerned for his safety, well, it sure couldn't be from President  Trump, because none of his enemies have been harmed.   So who is he afraid of? Is he afraid of the people that he colluded  with to try to bring down President Trump? He has no basis being afraid  of Trump.   As a former judge, sometimes you have to sign protective orders. If  somebody came in with the facts that we know so far about this  gossipmonger, my question would be: Who is he afraid of? He shouldn't  be afraid of President Trump in this situation. So who is he afraid of?  And that is a really good question, I think.   So we have this Star Chamber proceeding attempting to remove a  properly elected President.   We never had proceedings like this trying to take out a President-- never. Since the Judiciary Committee was formed, any time there was any  effort toward impeachment, it went through the Judiciary Committee,  which I am a part of.   Apparently, the powers that be have not been pleased with the  Democratic performance in the Judiciary Committee, so somebody figured  out we are better off politically--no matter the damage it may do to  our country, we are better off politically having a Star Chamber  proceeding where we are the only ones who go out and leak what we want  to be out. That way all of the exculpatory evidence, evidence that  shows the President didn't do anything wrong, that doesn't get to come  out, because, if it does, then we will demand prosecution. So we will  be the only ones that leak information.   And we can legally make things available to the press, so we will  only make those things available that are taken out of context that  help us accomplish our goal of trying to make President Trump look bad.   I heard the Speaker on television say that she was tasking six  committees with investigating President Trump, and one of those, the  Judiciary Committee, I am on.                                time  1315    Sometimes we have things that are so important to keep secret that  they are handled only by the Intelligence Committee only in a SCIF, so  it is secured. But even then, as a member of the Judiciary Committee,  many times I have gone to the SCIF to review classified information.   I remember on one occasion back when the Democrats were in the  majority previously, I think it was the first closed session we ever  had here at Congress, because it was desired to discuss something that  was classified, and I came down here, was speaking right here, and I  was stopped by the majority leader.   And he said: Wait a minute. We are authorized to have this classified  discussion, but the gentleman from Texas is getting into areas that are  above the classified area. He is authorized to have information that  everybody here is not allowed to have. So I was not allowed to continue  talking on that subject.   The point being, as a member of the Judiciary Committee, we get into  things that are of a more secret nature, classified information, that a  majority  [[Page H8256]]  of our body here is authorized to know and discuss and learn about.   So it has been quite surprising to be locked out of hearings. And we  know that they are not so sensitive that only the Intelligence  Committee could hear them, because they lumped in two other committees,  Foreign Affairs and Oversight and Reform, so it is not about just  keeping it confined to the Intelligence Committee.   But I specifically heard the Speaker say that six committees would be  investigating, and I am on one of those, and, yet, I go into the SCIF,  into the hallway outside of the secure area, and I am not allowed to go  in.   I wanted to know who gave the order, and the Democratic staff said:  Well, you know, that is the order.   Who gave the order?   Well, our boss told us.   So an unelected staffer tells two other staffers that you are to  prevent a duly elected Member of Congress from doing their job.   I wanted to know who gave that order. Is it in writing somewhere? Who  gave that order? Who is it that is undermining the election of over  half of the Members of Congress to prevent them from being able to do  their job? Who gave that order?   They couldn't say. They send out more staff; not a Member of  Congress. It seemed a little cowardly to me. Nobody would come out. I  was there with friends like   Andy Harris,   Andy Biggs, and others. I  went ahead and went through the first door--there is another door  there--and they went apoplectic.   I am authorized to hear classified information. I am authorized to  hear the classified information that they were supposedly listening to.  But the truth is, it is not classified. There is no reason for it to be  classified.   This is all a political show. That is why there is no written order.  That is why there has been no vote in here to proceed with impeachment,  and it is just wrong.   I don't remember who said it, but there was some historian that noted  there are many different--not many, but there are a number of different  phases of a civil war, and only the last phase involves guns.   But this sure feels like this coup attempt is setting this country up  for civil war. I won't participate in a civil war, but our job here,  our oath here is to protect and defend the Constitution of the United  States.   I took that oath as a prosecutor. I took that oath in the United  States Army--Active Duty for 4 years, inactive Reserve for 2 more  years. I took that oath as a judge, as a felony judge. I took that oath  as a chief justice, and I take that oath every 2 years, right here.   And that is what a lot of us are trying to do. But what is going on  around here is not fair. It is not just. It is against the House rules.  The House rules are very clear: If there was not a specific rule in  ``Jefferson's Manual and Rules of the House of Representatives,'' as  adopted every 2 years, then the precedence is what is the rule in that  case.   And the precedence on impeachment, it goes through the Judiciary  Committee, and it doesn't happen anything like what is happening now.  It is true. The majority could come in here and have a vote and amend  the rules so they could defy all precedent on impeachment. But for some  reason, they prefer to break the rules rather than simply come in and  do what they can as majority. They can change the rule any time they  get ready. They have got enough votes to do that.   They won't do that. For some reason, they prefer to break the rules.  This is not good. Kids across America see what is going on.   They are not taught history like they once were. Why? Because since  we have the Department of Education and it mandates the Federal test-- oh, yeah, you can come up with your own test, but here is what has to  be on there. And if a child fails that, then you don't get any of your  money back for that child's year in school. So everybody is scared.  Many schools drop history, drop civics.   That is why a survey in recent years indicated college students could  name The Three Stooges in greater numbers than they could name the  three branches of government.   So they don't know as much as they used to about what goes on here.  But when they see that if you are in the majority, you can break the  rules any time you want, if you dislike some other elected official-- like a President--and just try to eliminate him from office, then it is  okay.   In other words, the new Constitution for America, apparently, based  on what we are seeing going on here on Capitol Hill, is that if you are  in the majority, then the ends justify the means.   Since I have been here, there were times we were in the majority when  there were Republicans--thank God they were in a small number--but they  thought the ends justified the means. It didn't for them, and it  doesn't for anybody else.    This little experiment in self-government, we know won't last  forever. Anybody that studied history at all knows, no country, no  government lasts forever. And we are on borrowed time right now,  because we are setting records every day as the Nation that has  functioned the longest under one founding document, our Constitution.  The Romans didn't make it that long as a republic. We are setting  records every day.   We know it won't last forever, but my commitment is to do everything  I can to perpetuate our freedom, and what was given to us, as the  greatest country in the history of the world, more opportunity, more  individual assets than any country, even more than Solomon's Israel. We  are an anomaly. And we have broken the record on how long we can exist  with the freedoms we have.   It is time we come together and stop playing political games so that  years from now, future generations will not be rising up and cursing  our names. We need to come together and abide by the rules and the  Constitution so that we have a shot some day of our children rising up  and calling us blessed.   That ought to be our goal. I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 1 o'clock and 24 minutes  p.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until Monday,  October 21, 2019, at noon for morning-hour debate.                            ____________________
