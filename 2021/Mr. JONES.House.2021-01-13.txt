 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the impeachment of  Donald J. Trump, the disgraced, defeated President of the United  States. There must be consequences for last week's treason and  sedition. Hundreds, if not thousands, of Donald Trumps in today's  Republican Party aim to run for higher office; and we must send a  message that no one in the United States of America is above the law.  The world is watching, Madam Speaker.
