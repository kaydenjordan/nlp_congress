 Mr. Speaker, I rise today as middle Tennesseans struggle to  afford record-high gas prices caused by the Biden administration's  antienergy prices.   If you recall, in April of this year, President Biden announced he  would be raiding the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to help ``ease the  pain American families are facing at the pump.''   Since then, the average price of a gallon of gasoline has risen from  $4.20 a gallon to over $5 a gallon, while putting our national security  at risk as the Strategic Petroleum Reserve is now at its lowest level  since 1985.   What is even more alarming is a new press report stating that 950,000  barrels of the oil Mr. Biden took from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve  were sold to a state-owned Chinese company. If this is true, it is  difficult to find the words to adequately describe how utterly  outrageous it is.   President Biden must do better, and he must answer questions  associated with this apparent sale of oil from our Strategic Petroleum  Reserve to our most dangerous geopolitical adversary, China.                            ____________________
