 Mr. Chairman, I thank the ranking member for her strong  leadership in this fight against the ``Wrong'' CHOICE Act.   The bill before us is broken. I was Governor of Florida when the  financial crisis and foreclosure crisis rolled through my State like a  hurricane. Unrestrained greed on Wall Street caused a preventable  disaster because at no point did anyone say: This is simply wrong.   I remember 2008 and 2009: the bailouts, the foreclosures, and the  long, painful road to recovery. The financial crisis exposed a broken  regulatory system, allowing Wall Street to gamble with Main Street's  future.   With this bill, Members are being asked to again trust the very  people who brought us to this financial crisis. Don't put them back in  charge. Do not let them do it again. Please vote ``no.''    Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize Clearwater,  Florida's Calvary Christian High School Warriors boys baseball team on  their impressive State championship win. Coach Greg Olsen and the  Warriors clinched an 11-1 victory against Pensacola Catholic High  School to lead them to the Class 4A title, clinching the school's first  State championship and capping off a perfect season of 30 wins and no  losses.   Such an achievement takes more than skill and talent. It takes steely  determination, unwavering focus, and perhaps, most importantly, the  ability to work together. These skills are invaluable both on and off  the field. What they have learned as teammates will enable their  success not just as athletes, but as good citizens. Our entire  community is proud of their outstanding sportsmanship and achievements.   On behalf of Pinellas County, congratulations Warriors.                            ____________________
