 Mr. Speaker, the United States was born out of  disobedience. It was disobedience to a tyrannical government that led  to the founding of our Constitution and our American ideals. Today,  patriots still sometimes disobey, even at the cost of great personal  hardship.   Twenty-year veterans of law enforcement agencies have turned in their  badges because they refuse to bow the knee to vaccine mandates.   Nurses have worked and studied for years, only to have their jobs  stripped away because of a virus that they themselves committed to  defeating.   Servicemembers, firefighters, EMTs, are all sacrificing their careers  to stand for their convictions and for freedom.   Unconstitutional mandates sacrifice freedom on the altar of safety.  Mask mandates are dying because patriots have fought back. Let's do it  again with vaccine mandates. This is not a matter of health; it is a  matter of liberty.   These heroes will not go away quietly, and we will defend them  because they have defended us.   Mr. Speaker, it is time to end medical tyranny, end Federal  Government overreach, and end vaccine mandates.                            ____________________
