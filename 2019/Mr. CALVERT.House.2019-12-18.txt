 Madam Speaker, my friends on the other side of the aisle  have been clamoring for this day since President Trump was elected.   The refusal to accept the election results and, later, the findings  of the Mueller investigation have brought forth Articles of Impeachment  that are negated by two simple facts, namely, the military aid to  Ukraine was provided, and no investigation was ever started.   The real offense is that the President won the election, and their  fear is that he will win again, despite all of their efforts.   I will vote against the partisan attempt to overturn the election.
