 Madam Speaker, today, ahead of Memorial Day, I am  thinking about the 49,000 veterans in my district whose VA benefits  hang in the balance due to the risk of debt default.   It is incredibly disappointing that we would leave Washington before  this important holiday without resolving the default crisis.   Our veterans who have given so much deserve much better than this.  They deserve our unwavering dedication and commitment not just in words  but in action. They don't deserve partisan political games.   As we prepare to honor the memory of those who made the ultimate  sacrifice, let's also honor the veterans still with us by staying true  to our duty. Let's remember the debt we owe to them and the  responsibility that we bear.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to get back to work and  prioritize the needs of our veterans. Let's stay. Let's get to work.  Let's find a solution.                            ____________________
