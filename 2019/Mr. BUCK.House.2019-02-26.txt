 Madam Speaker, I thank my friend from Arizona for yielding,  and I thank him for his leadership on this important issue.   Madam Speaker, we have $22 trillion of debt, over $22 trillion of  debt now. We are accumulating debt at approximately $1 trillion a year.  America is financially bankrupt, and if we continue to place this  burden on our children and grandchildren, we are also morally bankrupt.   We are threatening our ability to react to world affairs, our ability  to deal with the dynamic threats that we face in this world, not just  land, not just sea, not just air, but space also.   We need to balance the budget, but it requires us to make difficult  decisions today, to ensure a prosperous future. And it requires us to  make significant cuts to our discretionary spending.   One of the amazing, unique characteristics of this place, of  Congress, is that for some reason, we make a distinction between  discretionary spending and mandatory spending.  [[Page H2224]]    My grandchildren don't care if they have to pay back a debt that was  created by mandatory spending or a debt that was created by  discretionary spending. They don't care. A dollar is a dollar to them,  and it should be to us, and we should take control of mandatory  spending, just as we take control of discretionary spending.   Since I was elected to Congress, I have fought hard against our  country's out-of-control spending, and I have advocated for a balanced  budget amendment to the Constitution that would force Congress to pass  a balanced budget every year.   For the economic well-being of our country, I am proud to join my  colleagues in cosponsoring this important resolution, and I would like  to thank my dear friend and colleague, Mr. Biggs, for recognizing our  country's serious spending problem before it's too late.
