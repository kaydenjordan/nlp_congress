 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the  House resolution calling for the immediate censure of Representative  Paul Gosar. Posting an edited video on social media depicting violence  against another Member of this body is reprehensible.   Make no mistakes, violent speech breeds violent actions. On my third  day of Congress, I learned exactly how dangerous words of leaders in  this country can be. Allowing this type of dangerous messaging to go  unchecked puts all of our lives at risk. Following the January 6  attacks, my family had to get security for our safety. I never imagined  having to drop my kindergartner off at school with security in tow.   This routine brand of violence against women in politics is a direct  attempt to silence us. We can hold different opinions and disagree, but  violent hate speech is unacceptable in any party. Leaders in Congress  must be held accountable for their actions.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this basic standard of  conduct and join me in holding my colleague accountable.                            ____________________
