 Mr. President, I pay tribute to Jeff Wrase, the U.S.  Senate Finance Committee's deputy staff director and chief economist,  who recently left the committee after more than 11 years of service.   For more than 20 years, Jeff served in what many consider to be the  ``wonkiest'' committees in Congress: the Senate Finance, Banking, and  Budget Committees, the Joint Economic Committee, and the House Budget  Committee. Jeff's strong background in economics and career in  academics made him a natural fit for each committee, with a unique  skill set for thoroughly briefing and advising members on everything  from macroeconomics, to international finance, to Federal debt  management.   As a member of the Finance, Banking, and Budget Committees, I have  had the opportunity to work closely with Jeff on many issues for more  than a decade. When I became ranking member of the Senate Finance  Committee at the onset of the 117th Congress, I knew I needed Jeff  Wrase on my team. This decision proved invaluable over the next 2  years, as Jeff spent much of his time fighting to protect the pro- growth tax and regulatory changes that had been implemented by the  Finance Committee in recent years.   Jeff was instrumental in reducing the scope and damage posed by  multiple tax-and-spend packages proposed during the 117th Congress.  From arguing before the Senate Parliamentarian about arcane budget  rules or helping to educate members or the American people about  pitfall-laden policy proposals, Jeff immersed himself in each issue,  asking the tough, smart questions about the feasibility, purpose, and  practicality of each proposal. He crafted several important pieces of  legislation to protect hard-working taxpayers, usually countering  edicts and government overreach from the executive branch. One  provision would have stricken a directive included in the American  Rescue Plan Act that forbids States from using relief funds to provide  any form of tax relief. Jeff picked apart the vague, unenforceable  nature of the legislation, noting its interference in a State's ability  to provide tax relief to citizens to reduce the burden on hard-working  families. It was a strong argument, as several lower courts have  agreed.  [[Page S995]]    Another Jeff-authored provision proved powerful in pushing back on  Internal Revenue Service--IRS--overreach. When the Inflation Reduction  Act of 2022 was being debated, a key funding mechanism was to provide  the IRS with a bloated, $80 billion 10-year budget to squeeze more  money out of American taxpayers to finance Green New Deal priorities.  Jeff knew the estimated revenue from additional enforcement would have  to include taxpayers making less than $400,000 per year, thus breaking  a campaign pledge from the Biden administration to not ``raise taxes  one penny on anyone earning less than $400,000 a year.'' Congress's  nonpartisan scorekeepers confirmed that individuals making under that  amount would be swept up in new audits, and Jeff crafted legislation to  prevent the IRS from using any new funding to increase audits on anyone  under that threshold. While the legislation did not pass in a Democrat- controlled Senate, it sent a clear message that the President's pledge  was bound to be broken.   One last example: Jeff may be single-handedly responsible for  preventing the IRS from being able to snoop into the bank accounts of  every American. Democrats proposed a new bank monitoring scheme to help  track inflows and outflows on financial accounts, collecting more data  on taxpayers in yet another effort to squeeze more funds out of them.  Jeff helped to shine a spotlight on this idea before it could ever even  become legislative language. Thanks to an aggressive educational  campaign, Americans rightly rejected the idea before it could ever  become law.   Even while Jeff was fighting these reconciliation battles, he managed  to simultaneously perform diligent oversight of the executive branch,  Departments, and Agencies within the committee's jurisdiction, from the  Social Security Administration to the U.S. Department of the Treasury  and Internal Revenue Service. Jeff never missed a deadline, and each  Agency knew it, whether it was the issuance of the Social Security  Trustees Report, the President's budget, or responding to a letter by  the requested deadline.   Jeff's Senate career stretches beyond the tumultuous years of the  117th Congress, with many accomplishments to count. In 2009, Jeff was  working on the Senate Banking Committee when then-President Obama and  Senate Democrats undertook an effort to overhaul the U.S. financial  regulatory system--or what later became known as the Dodd-Frank Act.  During Senate negotiations, Obama administration officials, the Federal  Reserve, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation--FDIC--launched  an all-out campaign for blanket bailout authority that would have  allowed them to bail out large financial institutions and insert  greater Federal control over our Nation's private financial system.  Jeff worked to ensure that provisions in Dodd-Frank covering section  13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act did not allow unfettered bailout  authority for unelected government officials, but instead provided a  role for Congress and its elected officials if ever the Federal Reserve  and others in government acted to battle ``unusual and exigent  circumstances'' and required the Fed to be accountable for whatever  emergency activities it pursued during such circumstances. Having those  provisions in the Federal Reserve Act to provide a role for Congress  and to provide transparency in government turned out to be very  valuable when the Fed was called to react to the economic shutdowns  accompanying the COVID-19 pandemic.   In 2015, after years of short-term funding patches, Jeff worked to  secure critical long-term funding for a bipartisan multiyear highway  bill, the Fixing America's Surface Transportation Act, providing much- needed stability and certainty to our country's highway and transit  programs. That same year, he developed legislative strategy and text  for the Social Security provisions of the Bipartisan Budget Act of  2015, which included the most significant changes to Social Security in  more than 30 years.   When the coronavirus pandemic shook the world in early 2020, the  Senate Finance Committee not only led on tax and health policy  responses, but also key provisions to help those who were suddenly out  of work, largely due to factors beyond their control. Jeff was  instrumental in developing policy to provide much-needed temporary  support for American workers impacted by the pandemic. Creating a  temporary enhanced unemployment program that could be implemented  quickly--and work across all 50 States--was no small feat. Jeff's work  on the unemployment provisions included in the Coronavirus Aid, Relief,  and Economic Security Act provided a lifeline to the self-employed, gig  workers and other Americans who could not work due to the coronavirus.  Jeff remained engaged in implementation and oversight of these  provisions in ensuing years, making sure the government acted as a good  steward of taxpayer dollars.   The Finance Committee also has jurisdiction over the Federal debt  limit, and Jeff has been directly involved in some of the toughest debt  ceiling battles over the years. From 2011-2012, Jeff was the chief  economist for the Budget Committee and the Finance Committee and  successfully helped to prevent the United States from going over a  ``fiscal cliff'' in 2013. While each effort by Congress to increase the  debt limit involves contemplating staggeringly higher and higher  numbers, Jeff was committed to pushing every administration to be more  transparent and provide greater consultation with Congress about their  debt management approaches. As conversations about how the United  States will continue to pay its bills on time and how we should budget  for the future, dominate the halls of Congress, I expect Jeff is  experiencing a bit of deja vu. Unfortunately, for Jeff, we know where  to find him.   Perhaps most consequential in Jeff's Finance Committee career is  passage of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the most comprehensive tax  overhaul in more than 30 years. This tax reform package delivered on  Republicans' promise of creating and advancing pro-growth policies that  lift the economy and build a better future for the American people. It  created a tax code based in simplicity and fairness. It lowered rates  across the board for all Americans. It ensured businesses of all sizes  could better compete, bringing jobs and investment back to our shores.  Prior to the pandemic, we were experiencing the strongest economy in  many of our lifetimes, in no small part due to this landmark  legislation. Jeff played an instrumental role in coordinating between  the Budget and Finance Committees while this package came together, and  I am not sure we would have succeeded without his prowess using  Microsoft Excel, which was--and remains--a mystery to many of his  colleagues. Sincerely, because of Jeff and many other's tireless  efforts, tax reform did a lot of good for a great number of people  throughout the country.   Jeff has been described by many as ``an institution,'' not just of  the Finance Committee, but of the Senate. He is well-liked and  respected by colleagues on both sides of the aisle, and those who have  worked with him can attest to his indispensable mentorship, good humor,  and friendship. He will be missed in the halls of the Senate, but  fortunately, he has not gone far. I thank him for his outstanding  counsel and guidance and wish him all the best.                            ____________________
