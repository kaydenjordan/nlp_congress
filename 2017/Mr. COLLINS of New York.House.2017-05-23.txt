 Mr. Speaker, I thank Eagle Scout Pete  Sessions for yielding. I am very honored to be standing with him today  as the co-chair of the Scouting Caucus, along with Eagle Scout Jim  Cooper from Tennessee.   There are, in fact, 33 Eagle Scouts--23 from the House of  Representatives and 10 from the Senate--currently serving in the United  States Congress. But just as importantly, there are 150 Members of  Congress who experienced Scouting, whether as a youth, and, perhaps, in  the case of 33 progressing to the rank of Eagle Scout, or, currently as  myself does, serving as an adult Scout leader.   Scouting was important to many of us growing up. I think when a lot  of us look back on our lives and say what was one of the larger impacts  we had, I can tell you, in my case, it was Scouting.   And the same is true for my 24-year-old Eagle Scout son. I can't tell  you how many different camping trips my son and I enjoyed together-- what a great bonding experience for a father and a son coming right up  through Cub Scouts.   So for all of those Scouts today, as Eagle Scout Pete Sessions  indicated, who are currently involved in Cub Scouts and Boy Scouts and  Explorers, Scouting is changing their lives, and it is changing their  lives for the better.   We have all heard the 12 points of the Scout law. That is a compass  for the youth of America today, when they are faced with tough  decisions, to look at those 12 points and remind themselves that a  Scout is trustworthy, loyal, helpful, friendly, courteous, kind,  obedient, cheerful, thrifty, brave, clean, and reverent. Those 12  points of the Scout law are a compass for them to live their life and  make the right decisions.                                time  1800    Many cases I referred to the first three words of the Scout Oath, and  we can't talk about them enough, those first three words, ``on my  honor.'' That is so important today for our youth to have a compass, to  understand what honor is, and Scouting introduces them to that.   But I will also tell you what Scouting is. It is young men, young  boys having fun outdoors. Some say today the problem with youth in  America is they have and they suffer from nature deficit disorder: They  don't get outside enough; they don't know how to play outdoors; they  are stuck with their electronic devices.   Well, Scouting gets the youth of America outside. It is healthy. They  get to enjoy themselves, learn all kinds of skills, but just the  friendships that they get within Scouting that, over a lifetime, will  help them as they become the future leaders of America.   There are a disproportionate number of leaders in America today who  were Scouts and, in fact, Eagle Scouts. Today, in President Trump's  Cabinet, we are honored as a country to have four Eagle Scouts: Eagle  Scout Rex Tillerson, Secretary of State; Eagle Scout Rick Perry,  Secretary of Energy; Eagle Scout Jeff Sessions, our current Attorney  General; and Eagle Scout, Ryan Zinke, our Secretary of the Interior.   I will tell you, in most of their cases, they would identify Scouting  as a major part of them growing up and, maybe they didn't know it at  the time, but giving them the life skills that have served them to the  point today they are serving our Nation.   We have 27 Members in the bipartisan Scouting Caucus; many, but not  all, are Eagle Scouts. I think all of us are proud to talk about our  past as an Eagle Scout, but we also remind people, to this day, we are  Eagle Scouts.   Once a year, our Chief Scout Executive, Mike Surbaugh, comes to  Washington, D.C., to present a report on the status of Scouting in the  Nation today. We have a great reception for our Chief Scout Executive  once a year to welcome him and Scouts from around the country as they  present to us the status of Scouting in America today.   I would be remiss if I didn't recognize the last four presidents of  the Boy Scouts of America. Our current president, Randall Stephenson,  is the current CEO of AT&T. He followed Bob Gates, who was our  Secretary of Defense; Wayne Perry, the vice chairman of AT&T and our  own Secretary of State, Rex Tillerson, when he was CEO of Exxon, was  the president of the Boy Scouts of America.   So I think all of us today understand the importance of Scouting in  our lives and, in many cases, just reflect back on the fun that we had  as young kids and young adults.   Once every 4 years, all the Scouts in America gather, with some from  around the world as well, at our national Scout jamboree. We currently  have a permanent Scout High Adventure site in West Virginia at the  Summit.   Eagle Scout Pete Sessions and I, as well as others, 4 years ago, went  to the Summit. And you know what? We just had fun. We went down the zip  line. We went on some of the other obstacle courses. Even as adults, it  was reliving our youth. And we intend to go back later in July for,  every 4 years, as I said, they have the national Scout jamboree.  Somewhere in the neighborhood of 40,000 Scouts from around the United  States will gather for approximately 1 week and just have a lot of fun,  get to meet others from around the country.   So that is what Scouting is. I can't think of a more healthy activity  for young men to be involved in, and, I think, in many cases,  certainly, the moms of this world understand the important values that  their sons are getting, as well as the dads.   I can just tell you, I am happy to stay involved in Scouting. As the  co-chair of the Eagle Scout Caucus, I am proud to remind people I am  today an Eagle Scout. And we also have fun shaking hands with our left  hand. That's how Scouts do it, the hand closest to our heart.   I was with our Secretary of State in Alaska a week ago and went to  introduce myself. He put out his right hand to shake hands, as adults  do, and I said: ``No, sir, Mr. Secretary. As one Eagle Scout to  another, we are going to shake hands the right way, with our left  hands.'' He got a big smile on his face because he knew exactly what I  was talking about.   So Eagle Scout Pete Sessions, I want to thank you for giving me the  [[Page H4491]]  opportunity to talk a little bit about Scouting today in our Congress.  Thank you for your leadership in our Special Order tonight, and I look  forward to hearing from our other Members of Congress, fellow Eagle  Scouts. I know it impacted their life.   Thank you again for your leadership tonight.
