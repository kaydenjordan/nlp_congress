 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to offer my support of the  bipartisan Jackie Walorski Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home  Visiting Reauthorization Act, or MIECHV.   This legislation represents not only a commitment by me to the  mothers, children, and families in my district, but it also reflects a  sincere love and respect that this committee has for our late, great,  wonderful colleague, Jackie Walorski, and the work that she did on the  Ways and Means Committee as chair of this amazing subcommittee.   Currently, over 1,800 pregnant women and new mothers throughout my  district in Alabama receive services from the MIECHV program. The  actions taken today by the House will ensure that these families will  have access to the essential early childhood care that they so  critically need for proper growth during a mother and child's early  developmental years.   Increased access to home visitation services, including postnatal  care and screening for postpartum depression, will guarantee that  women, especially those women of color in my district, can continue to  have regular access to medical professionals, thus giving them the  opportunity to have the highest form of care offered.   Specifically, in my district, the women, children, and families of  Dallas, Lowndes, Montgomery, Perry, and Wilcox Counties are poised to  benefit from this reauthorization.   I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting this. What a wonderful  tribute to an amazing public servant. It was an honor not only to work  with her but to call her my friend. Let's vote ``yes'' to reauthorize  this amazing program.
