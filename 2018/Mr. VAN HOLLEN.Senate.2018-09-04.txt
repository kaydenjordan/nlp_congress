 Mr. President, today I wish to express my opposition  to the confirmation of Lynn Johnson to become Assistant Secretary for  Family Support at the Department of Health and Human Services.   Time and again, this administration has shown a complete lack of good  judgement on immigration policy. Most recently, the Trump  administration implemented their family separation policy, which caused  the cruel separation of thousands of children from their parents, a  number of whom have still not been reunited.   The sheer inhumanity of a policy that involves forcibly separating  children from their families has traumatized these children. Experts  have said that this trauma will compound the trauma many of these  children have already experienced fleeing their violent home countries,  exacerbate learning difficulties, increase depression and post- traumatic stress disorder, and may make some children more prone to  substance use disorders.   These traumatized children have then gone into the care of facilities  overseen by the Office of Refugee Resettlement, which Ms. Johnson will  oversee. There have been a number of concerning reports about  facilities caring for these separated children, including medical  neglect, physical and sexual abuse, overzealous restrictions on phone  contact with their parents, and inappropriate use of psychotropic drugs  without parental consent.   While I understand that Ms. Johnson was not in charge of the agency  when this policy was implemented, I could not in good conscience vote  to confirm a nominee who will be charged with carrying out this  administration's misguided policies.   Thank you.                            ____________________
