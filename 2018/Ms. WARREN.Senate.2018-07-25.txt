 Madam President, this week, we hit a milestone, but not  the kind of milestone you celebrate. Nearly 1 year ago, the Commission  appointed by President Trump to examine the opioid crisis recommended  that the President declare a national public health emergency to help  combat the epidemic.   The Commission, led by former Republican Governor Chris Christie,  said:         The first and most urgent recommendation of this Commission       is direct and completely within your control. Declare a       national emergency.    Yet the President dragged his feet. While he twiddled his thumbs,  thousands of Americans continued to die from drug overdoses--over 115  people a day. Finally, in October of 2017, the President formally  declared what we already knew--that the crisis was a public health  emergency worthy of Federal action.   The first declaration the President issued lasted for 90 days, but  during those 90 days, nothing changed. The President didn't take  action. Americans continued to suffer, and more people died day, after  day, after day. On January 24, 2018, the first emergency declaration  expired. So the President had his HHS Secretary sign a second one.  Then, before another 90 days ran out, on April 24, the administration  signed a third one.   Yesterday, another 90 days later, on July 24, 2018, we began the  fourth consecutive period of public health emergency due to the opioid  crisis--9 months since the original declaration, 9 months during which  more than 30,000 people have likely overdosed and died, all while the  President and his administration have given us a lot of talk but no  action.   Our communities are on the frontline of this epidemic, and they are  working hard to fight back, but they can't do it alone. They need  funding, support, and new tools. I have worked with my Democratic  colleagues to make sure that communities have what they need in this  fight.   Time and again, we have pressured congressional leadership for  additional funding to help States and local communities address this  epidemic, and the pressure has worked. I have secured millions of  dollars, not just for opioid addiction and prevention and treatment but  for increased mental health services, including the biggest increase in  funding for the community mental health services block grant in  history.   I have passed bipartisan legislation to reduce the number of unused  opioids that sit in medicine cabinets. Since that legislation has  become law, I have continued to work across the aisle, with Senator  Capito, to make sure it has actually been implemented, and we are still  working on that today.   I have also introduced legislation to send $100 billion in extra  resources to fight this epidemic--right to the communities and Tribes  that need the help the most.   I am in this fight because communities in Massachusetts and all  across this country deserve it. Yet President Trump is not in this  fight. The President has made a lot of promises about the opioid  crisis, but time and again, this President has broken his promises.  Take the first time he declared the crisis an emergency. The President  held a big event and talked a big game. Then he produced no tangible  plan and no new commitment of Federal money beyond meager funds that  were left over from responding to other public health emergencies and  disasters.   Declaring the crisis a national emergency was the top recommendation  of the President's opioid commission, but it was not the only  recommendation. The Commission's final report included 56  recommendations that it asked the administration and Congress to  implement as soon as possible. Nearly all of those recommendations  required the administration's involvement and leadership.   So what has come of those 56 recommendations?   Who knows. At best, maybe a few have been implemented. The majority  seems to have just been ignored.   Even members of the Commission itself have called out this  administration's shameful lack of action. Former Congressman Patrick  Kennedy stated that the Commission's work has been turned into a  ``charade'' and a ``sham.''   Why is the Trump administration refusing to take this crisis  seriously? Why?   To start, it doesn't help that the administration has put people in  charge of addressing this emergency who lack the relevant experience in  public health or addiction. Apparently, Kellyanne Conway is running the  show, but she is also, apparently, running multiple other shows at the  same time. Not only is the opioid crisis not Ms. Conway's full-time  responsibility, but she has also reportedly pushed aside drug policy  experts and made comments about addiction that are not evidence-based.  James Carroll, President Trump's nominee to run the Office of National  Drug Control Policy, or ONDCP, also appears to have no experience in  public or behavioral health policy.   Let's not forget that the ONDCP is the agency that President Trump  has, essentially, proposed to eliminate by cutting 95 percent of its  funding. This is also the agency with such a high staff turnover that,  earlier this year, a 24-year-old with no public health experience was  promoted to Deputy Chief of Staff while the position of Chief of Staff  remained unfilled. This is also the agency that has not released its  required annual drug strategy for the last 2 years running.   That is a lot, but as if that is not enough, the Trump administration  has taken repeated steps to undermine the very programs that are  critical to fighting the opioid crisis.   The President has tried to slash the healthcare coverage for millions  of Americans who have preexisting conditions--conditions like addiction  issues. He has tried to cut hundreds of millions of dollars out of  Medicaid, which provides coverage for two out of every five non-elderly  adults who have opioid addictions. He has proposed slashing funding for  health workforce programs, for the Prevention and Public Health Fund,  and for mental health programs--all critical in addressing the  epidemic.   Time after time, I have asked the administration to explain the work  it is supposedly doing on this crisis. I have asked John Kelly for  clarification about Kellyanne Conway's role--no response. I have asked  Ms. Conway directly about her role--no response. I have asked the  administration about its progress on implementing the opioid  commission's recommendations--no response. To me, it looks like a whole  bunch of nothing--just empty words and broken promises.   While the President plugs his ears and closes his eyes, Americans are  dying. There were 42,000 people who died of drug overdoses in this  country in 2016. From July 2016 to September 2017, across the country,  emergency room visits for opioid overdoses, on average, jumped 30  percent, but only 1 in 10 individuals in need of specialty addiction  treatment is actually able to access it.  [[Page S5327]]    There is no shortage of steps we could take right now in tackling  this crisis. We have confronted large-scale public health crises  before, and we have made a difference.   Back in the 1980s, the death toll from a poorly understood and  stigmatized disease grew larger and larger. For years, the Federal  Government refused to act as Americans died. That disease was HIV/AIDS.  Yet activists and their loved ones demanded action, and in 1990 the  Federal Government finally made a meaningful investment by passing the  Ryan White Comprehensive AIDS Resources Emergency Act. The AIDS  epidemic isn't over, but HIV is no longer a death sentence. Thanks to  the Ryan White CARE Act, all who need treatment and support can get it  regardless of their ability to pay.   With Representative Elijah Cummings, I have introduced legislation  that is modeled on the very successful Ryan White CARE Act, and we will  apply it to fighting the opioid epidemic. The Comprehensive Addiction  Resources Emergency Act would invest $100 billion over the next 10  years to ensure that every single person who deals with addiction can  get the help they need, period.   If President Trump wanted to prioritize this problem and make a  difference in the opioid epidemic, he could do it. He has the power. He  could implement his own Commission's recommendations. He could send  meaningful budget requests to Congress. He could appoint qualified,  hard-working people to tackle the problem. Yet he will not do any of  those things as he is all talk, no action. While he keeps extending  meaningless emergency declarations, Americans are dying.   People with addictions--and their families--deserve more. Our  communities demand more. It is time to stop nibbling around the edges  and to get to work on this problem.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
