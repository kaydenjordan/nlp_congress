 Madam Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules,  I call up House Resolution 781 and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 781         Resolved, That upon adoption of this resolution it shall be       in order to consider in the House the concurrent resolution       (H. Con. Res. 83) directing the President pursuant to section       5(c) of the War Powers Resolution to terminate the use of       United States Armed Forces to engage in hostilities in or       against Iran. All points of order against consideration of       the concurrent resolution are waived. The amendment printed       in the report of the Committee on Rules accompanying this       resolution shall be considered as adopted. The concurrent       resolution, as amended, shall be considered as read. All       points of order against provisions in the concurrent       resolution, as amended, are waived. The previous question       shall be considered as ordered on the concurrent resolution,       as amended, to adoption without intervening motion or demand       for division of the question except two hours of debate       equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking       minority member of the Committee on Foreign Affairs.        Sec. 2.  Section 7 of the War Powers Resolution (50 U.S.C.       1546) shall not apply during the remainder of the One Hundred       Sixteenth Congress to a measure respecting Iran.     Madam Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield  the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Burgess),  pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During  consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose  of debate only.                                General Leave     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  be given 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Madam Speaker, yesterday, the Rules Committee met and  reported a rule, House Resolution 781, providing for consideration of  H. Con. Res. 83 under a closed rule. The resolution also provides 1  hour of general debate, controlled by the chair and ranking minority  member of the committee on Foreign Affairs.   Madam Speaker, the question before us today is very simple: Should  President Trump be allowed to send the United States hurtling toward  war with Iran without prior congressional approval?   It is a question we must wrestle with following the President's  actions last Thursday. That is when he ordered the lethal drone attack  on Iraqi soil that killed Iranian General Soleimani. The outgoing Prime  Minister has said the strike was carried out without Iraqi permission  or knowledge. It was done without any plan for the consequences in the  region or the world. And, more troubling still, it was carried out  without any input from the people's Representatives here in Congress.   Think about that.   Madam Speaker, just a month ago, Iran was staring down some of the  most intense antigovernment protests in a decade. Thousands took to the  streets of Tehran to express growing frustration and anger with their  leaders.   But what a difference a month makes. Protestors--men, women, and  children--have again taken to the streets of Tehran. Only this time,  their anger wasn't directed at their own leaders; it was directed at  the United States of America--all because of the President's unilateral  decision.   Madam Speaker, that is what happens when monumental decisions of war  and peace are made in a vacuum with no regard for the consequences.  Things usually don't go very well.   Rather than protect our national security and stabilize the region,  President Trump's reckless decision to strike Soleimani united Iran. It  has led to retaliatory strikes on two bases used by U.S. and coalition  forces in Iraq, and it has put our troops and diplomats serving  overseas in greater danger.   Now, make no mistake: This decision has endangered all Americans  everywhere. Hardliners are emboldened; 4,000 more U.S. troops have been  deployed to the region; operations against ISIS have been suspended;  the Iraqi Parliament has voted to kick American troops out of Iraq--all  because of the brash decision of one man: the President of the United  States.   Madam Speaker, there was no question that Soleimani was a ruthless  military commander. He had American, Syrian, Lebanese, Iraqi, and  Yemeni blood on his hands. But that is not up for debate today, nor is  the question of whether or not killing him was a good or bad idea.   The President of the United States assassinated a high-level foreign  military commander without asking or even notifying Congress  beforehand.   Madam Speaker, with little evidence, the President claims his actions  prevented an imminent threat, but the American people have heard that  one before. We remember the stories about weapons of mass destruction  in Iraq. We remember the tens of thousands of American soldiers who  paid the price for that deception.   Madam Speaker, is this Congress going to sit by and allow that to  happen in Iran, or are we going to ensure that this body acts before a  war begins that could continue long after President Trump leaves  office?   Now, the Constitution is clear; it is crystal clear. Article I,  Section 8 gives Congress the power to declare war, but President Trump  treated Congress as if it were an afterthought in a decision that has  destabilized the region and shaken the world.   More than 4,000 of our brave men and women are now being sent to the  Persian Gulf, all without any input from the people's Chamber.   We represent the brave young men and women who are deploying to  Kuwait; we represent those deploying to Iraq; and we represent those  deploying elsewhere across the Middle East. Each of us speaks for them,  and we speak for their families, who are scared sick as their loved  ones receive orders to deploy.   Madam Speaker, we must summon the courage to be their voice.   Now, I am glad that the United States and Iran have taken a step back  from the brink of war, but what we heard from the President yesterday  was more of the same bluster. It is clear, even after the briefing by  the administration yesterday that many of us attended, that he has no  clue at all--none--about what could come next.   Now, make no mistake: The world is less safe because of Trump's  chaotic foreign policy. The impacts of his strikes are still  reverberating in the region and across the world, and we cannot sit  silently by.   The Constitution makes the President Commander in Chief, but it gives  only Congress the power to declare war. The Founders knew that  decisions of this magnitude required consultation between the branches  of government, no matter who is in the White  [[Page H79]]  House, no matter who controls the majority on Capitol Hill.   Our Democrats don't want war with Iran; most Republicans don't want  war with Iran; and the American people certainly don't want a war with  Iran. I think that would be catastrophic. We should be stopping costly,  endless wars, not creating new ones.   But whatever you believe, have the courage of your conviction, have  the courage to vote, and that is what the underlying War Powers  Resolution is all about. Congress needs to authorize any additional  hostilities with Iran.   Madam Speaker, these decisions aren't easy. I understand that. There  is no more consequential vote than deciding whether to send men and  women off to war and into harm's way. We weigh that decision knowing  that, despite our hopes and prayers, lives are lost in combat.                                time  1245    Mothers and fathers could lose their children. Kids could be forced  to grow up without a parent.   But when we were sworn in, each of us took an oath to defend the  Constitution, and that means wrestling with this very tough decision  when necessary. The only question now is whether we have the guts to  uphold that oath.   Madam Speaker, with the Middle East held captive to the whims of a  reckless President, and with the Commander in Chief without a clue, I  pray that we, in Congress, have that courage.   On behalf of our troops, their families, and the American people, I  urge my colleagues to support this rule and the underlying resolution.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Let me just respond to the gentleman when he says that this is a  concurrent resolution here in the House and it is nonbinding and merely  symbolic. Let me point out to him that the law states clearly that this  sort of resolution reins in the President. The War Powers Resolution  requires the President to stop using American forces and hostilities if  Congress so directs by concurrent resolution.   Moreover, the Constitution gives war powers to the Congress, not to  the President. And if both Houses pass this resolution, it is a clear  statement that Congress is denying the President the authority to wage  war, and that the President must come to Congress for an authorization  prior to further hostilities.   And by the way, we are not just pursuing a concurrent resolution.  Senator Kaine of Virginia, over in the Senate, is pursuing a joint  resolution; so we are covering all bases here because we are deeply  concerned that we may end up in a war inadvertently here, and that  Congress will have no role in it.   Again, I would urge the gentleman to read the War Powers Resolution.  I have a copy here, and the accompanying report when this resolution  was signed into law. The report, with regard to consultation, is  crystal clear that consultation is meant prior to introducing our  forces and engaging into hostilities, which is something the President  didn't even notify us of.   And in terms of the President's exercising this remarkable restraint,  I just have a very different opinion. Have you read his Twitter  account? Have you been listening to him on TV as he brags about the  shiny, expensive weapons we have that he would love to use? The  rhetoric, the threat to bomb cultural sites, which is a war crime? I  mean, the gentleman may be totally at ease with all of that, but I am  not; and most of the American people are scared as hell of this  President's rhetoric when it comes to a potential war with Iran.   All we are saying here is that we ought to stand up for this  institution, and stand with the Constitution, and make it very clear  that if the President wants to go to war in Iran, that he needs to come  to Congress to get that declaration, to get that authorization.   Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms.  Shalala), a member of the Rules Committee.    Madam Speaker, let me say to the gentleman from  Oklahoma that I look forward to working with him on the war powers and  other issues related to the executive branch encroaching on legislative  powers in the future. I hope we can work in a bipartisan way and make  some progress here.   I include in the Record a January 4 New York Times article entitled  ``As Tensions With Iran Escalated, Trump Opted for Most Extreme  Measure.''                  [From the New York Times, Jan. 4, 2020]   As Tensions With Iran Escalated, Trump Opted for Most Extreme Measure       (By Helene Cooper, Eric Schmitt, Maggie Haberman and Rukmini                                Callimachi)         Washington.--In the chaotic days leading to the death of       Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani, Iran's most powerful commander,       top American military officials put the option of killing       him--which they viewed as the most extreme response to recent       Iranian-led violence in Iraq--on the menu they presented to       President Trump.        They didn't think he would take it. In the wars waged since       the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, Pentagon officials have often       offered improbable options to presidents to make other       possibilities appear more palatable.        After initially rejecting the Suleimani option on Dec. 28       and authorizing airstrikes on an Iranian-backed Shiite       militia group instead, a few days later Mr. Trump watched,       fuming, as television reports showed Iranian-backed attacks       on the American Embassy in Baghdad, according to Defense       Department and administration officials.        By late Thursday, the president had gone for the extreme       option. Top Pentagon officials were stunned.        Mr. Trump made the decision, senior officials said on       Saturday, despite disputes in the administration about the       significance of what some officials said was a new stream of       intelligence that warned of threats to American embassies,       consulates and military personnel in Syria, Iraq and Lebanon.       General Suleimani had just completed a tour of his forces in       Syria, Lebanon and Iraq, and was planning an ``imminent''       attack that could claim hundreds of lives, those officials       said.        ``Days, weeks,'' Gen. Mark A. Milley, the chairman of the       Joint Chiefs of Staff, said on Friday, when asked how       imminent any attacks could be, without offering more detail       other than to say that new information about unspecified       plotting was ``clear and unambiguous.''        But some officials voiced private skepticism about the       rationale for a strike on General Suleimani, who was       responsible for the deaths of hundreds of American troops       over the years. According to one United States official, the       new intelligence indicated ``a normal Monday in the Middle       East''--Dec. 30--and General Suleimani's travels amounted to       ``business as usual.''        That official described the intelligence as thin and said       that General Suleimani's attack was not imminent because of       communications the United States had between Iran's supreme       leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and General Suleimani showing       that the ayatollah had not yet approved any plans by the       general for an attack. The ayatollah, according to the       communications, had asked General Suleimani to come to Tehran       for further discussions at least a week before his death.        Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Vice President Mike       Pence were two of the most hawkish voices arguing for a       response to Iranian aggression, according to administration       officials. Mr. Pence's office helped run herd on meetings and       conference calls held by officials in the run-up to the       strike.        Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper and General Milley declined       to comment for this article, but General Milley's       spokeswoman, Col. DeDe Halfhill, said, without elaborating,       that ``some of the characterizations being asserted by other       sources are false'' and that she would not discuss       conversations between General Milley and the president.        The fallout from Mr. Trump's targeted killing is now       underway. On Saturday in Iraq, the American military was on       alert as tens of thousands of pro-Iranian fighters marched       through the streets of Baghdad and calls accelerated to eject       the United States from the country. United States Central       Command, which oversees American military operations in the       Middle East, said there were two rocket attacks near Iraqi       bases that host American troops, but no one was injured.        In Iran, the ayatollah vowed ``forceful revenge'' as the       country mourned the death of General Suleimani.        In Palm Beach, Fla., Mr. Trump lashed back, promising to       strike 52 sites across Iran--representing the number of       American hostages taken by Iran in 1979--if Iran attacked       Americans or American interests. On Saturday night, Mr. Trump       warned on Twitter that some sites were ``at a very high level       & important to Iran & the Iranian culture, and those targets,       and Iran itself, WILL BE HIT VERY FAST AND VERY HARD.''        The president issued those warnings after American spy       agencies on Saturday detected that Iranian ballistic missile       units across the country had gone to a heightened state of       readiness, a United States official said on Saturday night.        Other officials said it was unclear whether Iran was       dispersing its ballistic missile units--the heart of the       Iranian military--to avoid American attack, or was mobilizing       the units for a major strike against American targets or       allies in the region in retaliation for General Suleimani' s       death.        On Capitol Hill, Democrats voiced growing suspicions about       the intelligence that led to the killing. At the White House,       officials formally notified Congress of a war powers       resolution with what the administration said was a legal       justification for the strike.        At Fort Bragg, N.C., some 3,500 soldiers, one of the       largest rapid deployments in decades, are bound for the       Middle East.        General Suleimani, who was considered the most important       person in Iran after Ayatollah Khamenei, was a commanding       general of a sovereign government. The last time the United       States killed a major military leader in a foreign country       was during World War II, when the American military shot down       the plane carrying the Japanese admiral Isoroku Yamamoto.        But administration officials are playing down General       Suleimani's status as a part of the Iranian state, suggesting       his title gave him cover for terrorist activities. In the       days since his death, they have sought to describe the strike       as more in line with the killing of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the       Islamic State leader, who died in October in an American       commando raid in Syria.        Administration officials insisted they did not anticipate       sweeping retaliation from Iran, in part because of divisions       in the Iranian leadership. But Mr. Trump's two predecessors--      Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama--had rejected       killing General Suleimani as too provocative.        General Suleimani had been in Mr. Trump's sights since the       beginning of the administration, although it was a Dec. 27       rocket attack on an Iraqi military base outside Kirkuk, which       left an American civilian contractor dead, that set the       killing in motion.        General Milley and Mr. Esper traveled on Sunday to Mar-a-      Lago, Mr. Trump's Palm Beach resort, a day after officials       presented the president with an initial list of options for       how to deal with escalating violence against American targets       in Iraq.        The options included strikes on Iranian ships or missile       facilities or against Iranian-backed militia groups in Iraq.       The Pentagon also tacked on the choice of targeting General       Suleimani, mainly to make other options seem reasonable.        Mr. Trump chose strikes against militia groups. On Sunday,       the Pentagon announced that airstrikes approved by the       president had struck three locations in Iraq and two in Syria       controlled by the group, Kataib Hezbollah.        Jonathan Hoffman, the chief Pentagon spokesman, said the       targets included weapons storage facilities and command posts       used to attack American and partner forces. About two dozen       militia fighters were killed.        ``These were on remote sites,'' General Milley told       reporters on Friday in his Pentagon office. ``There was no       collateral damage.''        But the Iranians viewed the strikes as out of proportion to       their attack on the Iraqi base and Iraqis, largely member's       of Iranian-backed militias, staged violent protests outside       the American Embassy in Baghdad. Mr. Trump, who aides said       had on his mind the specter of the 2012 attacks on the       American compound in Benghazi, Libya, became increasingly       angry as he watched television images of pro-Iranian       demonstrators storming the embassy. Aides said he worried       that no response would look weak after repeated threats by       the United States.        When Mr. Trump chose the option of killing General       Suleimani, top military officials, flabbergasted, were       immediately  [[Page H82]]       alarmed about the prospect of Iranian retaliatory strikes on       American troops in the region. It is unclear if General       Milley or Mr. Esper pushed back on the president's decision.        Over the next several days, the military's Special       Operations Command looked for an opportunity to hit General       Suleimani, who operated in the open and was treated like a       celebrity in many places he visited in the Middle East.       Military and intelligence officials said the strike drew on       information from secret informants, electronic intercepts,       reconnaissance aircraft and other surveillance tools.        The option that was eventually approved depended on who       would greet General Suleimani at his expected arrival on       Friday at Baghdad International Airport. If he was met by       Iraqi government officials allied with Americans, one       American official said, the strike would be called off. But       the official said it was a ``clean party,'' meaning members       of Kataib Hezbollah, including its leader, Abu Mahdi al-      Muhandis. Mr. Trump authorized the killing at about 5 p.m. on       Thursday, officials said.        On Friday, missiles fired from an American MQ-9 Reaper blew       up General Suleimani's convoy as it departed the airport.     Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  New York (Mr. Morelle), a member of the Rules Committee.    Madam Speaker, I include in the Record a January 8  Vanity Fair article entitled ``There Is No Strategy: Diplomats React to  Trump's Erratic, Narcissistic Iran Policy.''                      [From Vanity Fair, Jan. 8, 2020]       ``There Is No Strategy'': Diplomats React to Trump's Erratic,                          Narcissistic Iran Policy                             (By Abigail Tracy)         After the American drone strike and Iran's measured       retaliation, some State vets worry that Trump is a wild card,       the biggest danger: ``From a political standpoint,'' says       one, ``they have behaved a hell of a lot more rationally and       predictably than we have.''        In the aftermath of Iran's strike against two airbases, in       retaliation for the drone strike that killed Qasem Soleimani       last week, a sigh of relief was breathed, but for what? That       there had been no casualties from Iran's cruise missiles was       a huge reason to be thankful. (U.S. officials have since       suggested this was intentional.) But there was also a sense       of relief that Trump had stepped back--as if he were the wild       card. The developments laid bare what diplomats I spoke with       identified as a discomforting reality in the Trump era. ``Up       is down and down is up,'' a former U.S. ambassador in the       region told me, noting Iran's decision to notify the Iraqis       ahead of the attack on Tuesday and Mohammad Javad Zarif's       message of detente in the face of Trump's bluster. ``Who       would've imagined that it's the American president who is a       crazy person gunning for war and the mullahs who are being       careful and deliberate and cautious . . . . They have done       terrible things--I am not going to defend the fact that the       country holds hostages and has absolutely supported terrorist       groups and those sorts of things--but from a political       standpoint, they have behaved a hell of a lot more rationally       and predictably than we have,'' this person added. ``Do you       take comfort in the fact that Iran is the rational actor or       does that scare the bejesus out of you even more?''        A former Foreign Service Officer who worked on Iran under       Barack Obama echoed the point. ``I think it is interesting       that [Iran has taken] every opportunity to show that they're       actually more responsible than the U.S. president in       executing this conflict,'' this person said. ``It boggles the       mind to me that we are almost more concerned, I think, about       our own president than we are about the way others may       retaliate, which is really scary.''        Diplomats I spoke with are clear-eyed in their belief that       Iran's retaliation for Soleimani is not complete; they are       bracing for--if not further military attacks--subsequent       responses, such as cyberattacks or even kidnappings. To a       fault, they, too, are not defending Iran's past malfeasance.       And Trump's position on the wake of the attacks is welcomed       by veterans of Foggy Bottom.  [[Page H83]]       ``President Trump made the right decision not to respond to       Iran's missile attacks. There were no American casualties and       the Iranians are clearly signaling they don't want a war,''       Nicholas Burns, the former ambassador to NATO, told me. The       problem is that Trump has thus far failed to chart a path       forward with Iran. Instead, he has shuttled between slamming       Iran, slighting his predecessor's signature Iran nuclear       deal, and patting himself on the back for the death of       Soleimani and Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the former leader of the       Islamic State whom the United States killed in October. ``His       speech was confusing about his strategy. It is not at all       clear if he intends to contain Iran through deterrence or to       weaken its government and seek regime change,'' Burns added.       ``He owes the American public, the Congress, and our allies a       much more specific and consistent game plan. Otherwise, it       will be difficult for him to gain domestic and allied       support.''        As I reported in the aftermath of the Soleimani's killing       last week, a chief concern within the diplomatic ranks was       that the Trump administration, still lacking a coherent       foreign policy, had failed to adequately contemplate and       prepare for the international and Iranian response to the       airstrike against the top Iranian general. Indeed, the Trump       administration certainly appeared to be caught flat-footed       when the Iraqi parliament voted to expel U.S. troops from the       country over the weekend. While asserting that the killing of       Soleimani left Americans safer, Secretary of State Mike       Pompeo and Defense Secretary Mark Esper have yet to detail       the imminent threat they claim the Iranian general posed to       U.S. interests. And Trump's remarks on Wednesday arguably       raised more questions than they answered. As the former       ambassador in the region put it, ``There is no strategy. It       is satisfying Trump's ego at every step. It's all it is for       us, there is zero strategy and it's all strategy on Iran's       side.''        Beyond his ``America First'' tagline, Trump has failed to       formulate anything resembling a coherent foreign policy.       Rather, he has a domestic policy that influences American       posturing abroad. The clearest through line in Trump's       various foreign policy decisions can largely be summed up as       ``the opposite of what Obama did.'' But this lack of       coherence is particularly troubling in the Middle East and is       amplified by the reality that he's surrounded by hawks with       hard-ons for toppling the Iranian regime, like Pompeo. ``The       most frustrating thing is that this is entirely of his own       making. You think about where we were less than five years       ago, when we got to the deal. Things certainly weren't       perfect by any means. They were still causing a lot of harm       and doing things against our interests in the region, but       compare that to where we are today and it is so entirely       avoidable,'' the former Foreign Service officer told me.       ``The lack of a strategy continues to be the most dangerous       thing we can do in the Middle East.''        A former high-ranking State Department official expressed       similar dismay. ``Foreign policy isn't well-done on impulse.       Because so much is intertwined . . . . It requires the       ability to understand the trade-offs and possible longer-term       impacts. Never easy. But this team has no ability to do       that,'' they told me. ``If I were a military family member,       I'd really worry that our troops are being sent out with no       clear plan or mission. Not a comforting thought.''        If Trump really does have an appetite for diplomacy, that's       undeniably a positive development. Diplomats stress that now       is the time for it, and the Iranians do seem to be signaling       a desire deescalate. ``Now we're in the time of intense       diplomacy, where around the world leaders are figuring out,       `If you do this, I do that' and 'What will be the response of       X if we do Y,' '' a former senior U.S. official told me. But,       this person added, ``The only ones not taking part are the       Americans.'' Instead, ``America is content with a two-      dimensional policy: We take this act, we stand still and       watch what happens. The other countries are at least trying       to be three-dimensional, adding the element of time,       projecting to the not-too-distant future which advantages are       to be gained.''        In an ideal world, Burns said, Trump would open a reliable       diplomatic channel to Tehran. ``We should want to be able to       deliver tough and clear messages to its government. And it       would be smart to offer Iran a diplomatic off-ramp so that we       can end the possibility of a wider war that is in neither of       our interests,'' he said. ``Trump's disinterest in real       diplomacy is a significant disadvantage for the U.S.''        Confronting a president who has repeatedly demonstrated a       desire to dive into military conflict before diplomacy,       Congress is grappling with how to restrain Trump. California       congressman Ro Khanna told me the attacks on Tuesday increase       ``the urgency for Congress to act. We need to engage in de-      escalation and a cease-fire to end the cycle of violence.''       Currently on the table are a few measures House Democrats       hope can curb Trump's authority to attack Iran. Among them       are a War Powers Resolution and a bill drafted by Khanna and       Senator Bernie Sanders that would defund any offensive action       in Iran and require any such action to have Congressional       authorization.        Khanna told me that the Democratic caucus is unified and       that he has been in talks with Speaker Nancy Pelosi about       timing and process. The House is expected to vote on a War       Powers Resolution, after which they would push his bill with       Senator Sanders. Currently, House leadership is figuring how       to craft a War Powers Resolution in a way that would prevent       Republicans from attaching a Motion to Recommit, which could       prevent it from reaching the Senate floor--as was the case       with the War Powers Resolution on Yemen. ``That is why it is       taking some time,'' Khanna explained. ``It is taking time to       figure out the procedural mechanisms with the parliamentarian       in the House and the Senate so that what we send over to the       Senate doesn't lose its War Powers privileged status. If it       loses its privileged status, then [Mitch] McConnell would       never call it up.''     Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume to respond to the gentlewoman. I urge the gentlewoman, who read  a couple of lines from the resolution, as I urge all of my colleagues,  to read the entire resolution.   This is pretty simple. Basically, it says that if we go to war with  Iran, Congress ought to have a say in it. Congress ought to do what the  Constitution requires us to do.   I don't know why that is a radical idea, but if my friends want to go  to war with Iran, they have to have the guts to come to the floor to  debate it and vote on it.   Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms.  Jackson Lee).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume to respond to the gentleman from Georgia, who I have a great  deal of respect for.   Let's be honest here. Many of us, contrary to what the gentleman just  said, have been outspoken against unilateral interventions by the  executive branch without notifying Congress, without seeking our  approval on military authorization under Obama. I, for one, was  critical of his drone attacks. I raised issues about our involvement in  Syria.   I include in the Record a statement that I made, saying that Congress  should reconvene and debate and vote on a resolution with regard to  what the Obama administration was doing in Libya.                      [Press Release, March 23, 2011]                  Congressman McGovern Statement on Libya         Washington, DC.--For several weeks now I have been calling       for an internationally-enforced no-fly-zone over Libya in       order to prevent Colonel Qadaffi from slaughtering his own       people. I agree with President Obama that U.S. ground troops       should not be committed to this effort, and that our       international partners should soon take the lead. Whether or       not Qadaffi remains the leader of Libya must, in the end, be       up to the Libyan people. I am troubled about pressure to       expand the military operation and the many unanswered       questions about Libyan opposition forces. I urge the House       leadership to call the Congress back into session as soon as       possible so that Congress can exercise its constitutional       responsibility to clearly spell out the mission and limits of       U.S. military engagement in Libya. And I urge the Obama       Administration to consult with Congress and to engage us at       every possible opportunity as this crisis continues to       unfold.    Madam Speaker, some of us have been consistent on this  through Democratic and Republican administrations. I take great  exception when anybody tries to say that we are raising this issue just  purely for political purposes.   For me, it is not. For me, I have been consistent on this through  Democratic and Republican administrations.                                time  1315     Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Oregon (Mr. Blumenauer).    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 15 seconds to the  gentleman.    Madam Speaker, I would just urge my colleagues to read  the resolution. This is about the future and it is about whether or  not, if we go to war with Iran, whether or not Congress upholds its  constitutional responsibility.   Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Vermont (Mr.  Welch).    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 15 seconds to the  gentleman.

Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms. DeLauro).    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from  Connecticut an additional 30 seconds.    Madam Speaker, I am proud to yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Raskin), a distinguished member of the  Rules Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield the gentleman from Maryland an  additional 30 seconds.    Madam Speaker, I include in the Record a January 3 CNN  article, entitled, ``Trump's Huge Iran Gamble Will Have Lasting  Impact.''                          [From CNN, Jan. 3, 2020]             Trump's Huge Iran Gamble Will Have Lasting Impact                           (By Stephen Collinson)         (CNN) President Donald Trump's targeted killing of Iran's       ruthless military and intelligence chief adds up to his most       dangerous gamble yet with other peoples' lives and his own       political fate.        By killing Qasem Soleimani in Iraq, Trump committed the       United States to a risky open conflict that at best could       stop short of all-out war with Iran that could cause national       security and economic shocks in the United States and across       the globe.        The administration argues that it has taken one of the       world's worst mass murderers and terrorists off the       battlefield. But given Iran's easy access to soft targets,       the Middle East and even Europe suddenly look a lot less safe       for Americans, including US troops Trump may be even more       tempted to haul home.        Two days into his re-election year, Trump--who rails       against Middle Eastern entanglements--has plunged the United       States into another one, with vast and unknown consequences.       It challenges a presidency that is already alienating half of       his country, following his impeachment and unrestrained       behavior in office. Trump may find it impossible to rally the       nation behind him to weather the crisis. He has also       scrambled strategic and moral expectations of the United       States--ordering the killing of a senior foreign leader of a       nation with whom the US is not formally at war--albeit an       official regarded by Washington as a terrorist.        Reflecting the strike's potential for escalation, a US       defense official said the administration would deploy a       further 3,000 troops to the Middle East, including 750 who       have already deployed to protect the US embassy in Baghdad.        The reverberations of his act on Thursday will last for       years.        ``Iran never won a war, but never lost a negotiation!''       Trump wrote on Friday morning in a tweet that will do nothing       to calm critics who worry about the depth of his strategic       thinking.        It is too early to know whether Soleimani's death will       significantly weaken Iran and improve the US strategic       position, whether it will ignite a regional conflagration and       how it will eventually affect Trump's political prospects and       legacy. It is also unclear how it will change the political       position inside Iran where the regime is besieged by an       economic crisis and recently crushed mass protests.        But Iran will surely regard the killing of one of its most       significant political leaders as an act of war, so its       revenge is likely to be serious and long lasting.        ``There are definitely going to be unintended consequences,       and for starters I think we better have our embassies pretty       well buttoned down,'' former US Ambassador to Iraq       Christopher Hill told CNN.        ``Iran simply cannot sit on its hands on this one. I think       there will be a reaction and I'm afraid it could get bloody       in places.''        Trump supporters are celebrating their hard man commander-      in-chief. They note that Soleimani orchestrated the deaths of       hundreds of US soldiers in militia attacks during the Iraq       War. But recent history is marked by spectacular US shock-      and-awe opening acts of conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan       that cause short-term gloating and long term military and       political disasters. A full-on conflict with Iran would be       far more complicated than those two wars.        Trump's strike may be the most significant calculated US       act in a 40-year Cold War with revolutionary Iran. It's the       biggest US foreign policy bet since the invasion of Iraq.        Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told CNN's ``New Day'' that       killing Soleimani ``saved American lives'' and was based on       ``imminent'' threat intelligence about an attack in the       region. Trump echoed his secretary of state later Friday       morning, tweeting that Soleimani ``was plotting to kill many       more'' Americans.        But Pompeo refused to give further details. The political       bar for an administration that has made a habit of       disinformation and lying is going to be far higher than that       in such a grave crisis. Eliminating the most powerful       political force in Iran short of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali       Khamenei also destroys the chimera that this White House is       not committed to a regime change strategy.        Given Soleimani's frequent travels to Iraq, Syria and other       areas in the Middle East this is not the first time that he       will have been in US crosshairs. But previous presidents,       perhaps cognizant of the inflammatory consequences, chose not       to take the shot. In the coming days, the administration will       have to explain why it acted now.        The act also likely eliminates possibly for a generation,       any hope that the United States and Iran can settle their       differences by talking. There will be no desire nor political       capital for even Iranian officials often misleadingly       described as moderates to sit down with US counterparts.        When Trump took office, there was no immediate crisis with       Iran. The Islamic Republic was honoring the Obama       administration's nuclear deal though it had not stepped back       from its missile development and what the US says is       malignant activity in its own neighborhood.        But by ripping up the deal, strangling the Iranian economy       and now killing Soleimani, Trump now owns however the       confrontation turns out. It's a huge gamble because history       suggests that Presidents who bet their careers on the jungle       of Middle East politics always lose.        The strike displays Trump's growing infatuation with       wielding military power, exacerbates a trend of unchecked       presidential authority and forges the kind of ruthless       vigilante image he adores.        The question is now whether Trump--an erratic,       inexperienced leader who abhors advice and rarely thinks more       than one step ahead--is equipped to handle such a perilous,       enduring crisis.        And is his administration, which seems bent on toppling       Iran's regime but cannot publicly come up with a plan for the       aftermath, ready to handle an Iranian backlash in the region       and beyond?        Trump's hubristic tweeting of a US flag following       Soleimani's death in a drone strike in Iraq but failure to       explain to Americans what is going on may be a bad sign in       this regard.        But despite a stream of instant Twitter analysis from       pundits suddenly expert in Iranian affairs, no one can be       sure what will happen next. That's what makes Trump's strike       so unpredictable and potentially dicey.        With the vast network of proxies from Hezbollah to Hamas,       Iran has the capacity to strike fast and hard against US       allies like Israel and Saudi Arabia and US assets and       personnel in its region. It could hammer the global economy       by attacking oil tankers in the Strait of Hormuz. US       officials and top military officers may be more exposed when       they travel abroad. Iran could explode Lebanon's fragile       political compact and causes region-wide shocks.        US troops in Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan look especially       vulnerable to action by Iranian-allied forces. Politically,       the Baghdad government may have no choice but to ask American       forces to leave after the attack in a scenario that could       effectively deliver the country to Iran's influence or       retrigger its terrible civil war.        The killing of Soleimani is a massive symbolic blow to       Iran. He was the Godfather of the Middle East who       masterminded the country's huge regional influence.        Pompeo claimed that his demise will be greeted by Iraqis       and Iranians as a blow for freedom and a sign the United       States is on their side. But developments in Middle Eastern       politics rarely mirror the optimistic pronouncements of US       officials.             Did the US inflict a serious strategic blow on Iran?         Analysts will be looking to see whether the death of       Soleimani robs the Quds force of the Iranian Revolutionary       Guards Corps of its coherence and dims its regional power at       least at first.        Tehran's strategic response is unclear. While it could lash       out, a wave of attacks against US soldiers or terrorist       strikes elsewhere may draw it into a direct conflict with a       more powerful rival, the United States that it does not seek.        It is not certain that it will strike back quickly. It may       have more to gain from making life intolerable for the United       States and its citizens in the region in a slow burn       approach.        Trump could be especially exposed to a such a military or       economic backlash by Iran that casts doubt on his judgment       given his quickening reelection race.        His move against Iran could also reshape the dynamics of       the presidential election race at home, by opening a lane for       Democrats to run as anti-war candidates against him--a       position that helped the last two presidents--Trump and       Barack Obama--get elected.        Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders on Friday released a       video vowing to do everything he can ``to prevent a war with       Iran.''        ``Because if you think the war in Iraq was a disaster, my       guess is that the war in Iran would be even worse,'' the       Vermont senator said.        And Democratic front-runner Joe Biden immediately swung       into sober commander-in-chief mode, positioning himself to       profit politically if Trump's Iran venture backfires.  [[Page H89]]         The former vice president offered testimony to Soleimani's       record of fomenting bloodshed and instability but added:       ``President Trump just tossed a stick of dynamite into a       tinderbox.''    Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from Rhode Island (Mr. Cicilline).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Madam Speaker, I think what the President did was a grave  miscalculation, but we can't change the past. We can only shape the  future.   I have raised concerns about executive overreach during the Bush  administration; I raised them during the Obama administration; and  today, I am here to raise those concerns about the Trump  administration.   I hope there is no war with Iran, but we have seen that developments  can change day by day, hour by hour. Should tensions escalate again,  Congress should have a say before hostilities are launched. It is  really that simple.   This should be the easiest vote in the world for Members of Congress.  Regardless of what you think about what the President has done,  regardless whether you agree with his policies or not, and regardless  of your political affiliation, this is about ensuring that we have a  say about what may come next.   There is nothing radical about this. The Constitution gives only  Congress the ability to declare war. Let's reclaim our power and let's  do our jobs.   My friends say they want to honor our troops. Well, talk is cheap.  How about honoring our troops by doing our job, by living up to our  constitutional responsibilities. War is a big deal. We ought to take it  seriously here. I and some of my Republican friends over the years have  raised issues with Democratic and Republican administrations about the  ease in which they commit our troops to hostilities. Enough is enough.  [[Page H90]]    No more endless wars. Congress has to live up to its constitutional  responsibility. Let's reclaim our power. Let's do our job.    Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and  I move the previous question on the resolution.
