 Mr. President, on behalf of myself and Mr. Reed, as the  chair and ranking member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, as  well as the cochairs of the Senate Army Caucus, it is our honor to pay  tribute to a great leader, an exceptional officer, and a senior  executive of the U.S. Army, Mr. Bernard P. Ingold. Mr. Ingold is the  principle deputy chief of legislative liaison for the Office of the  Secretary of the Army, and as he prepares to leave this position for a  well-deserved retirement, we commend him for his outstanding  leadership, advice, and sound professional judgment on numerous  critical issues of enduring importance to the Army, Congress, and this  Nation.   Bernie Ingold has served our Army and our Nation for more than 40  years as an Army officer and a Department of the Army civilian. A  native of Michigan, Mr. Ingold was commissioned in 1979 as a judge  advocate general officer upon earning a degree in law from the  University of Arkansas. His service to the Nation included roles as a  deputy staff judge advocate for U.S. Army Berlin, as a legislative  counsel for the office of the chief of  [[Page S5597]]  legislative liaison, and as the deputy director for legal policy in the  Office of the Secretary of Defense.   After serving 20 years on Active Duty, Mr. Ingold retired and  continued his service as a civilian in the Department of the Army. From  1999 to 2010, he served as the deputy chief legislative counsel for the  Army's office of the chief of legislative liaison. In 2010, he entered  into the senior executive service and began his role as the principle  deputy for the office of the chief of legislative liaison. For the past  10 years, Mr. Ingold has implemented and enhanced strategic  partnerships with Congress. He has assisted seven Army chiefs of  legislative liaison and helped the Army significantly advance its  relationships with both legislative Chambers and improved and broadened  congressional support for Army priorities. Mr. Ingold managed complex  issues through multiple legislative cycles, enabling the Army to  receive the necessary resources to improve readiness, accelerate  modernization, and reform processes to support combat operations,  sustain the all-volunteer force, and improve the quality of life for  soldiers, Army civilians, and their families. Throughout his career, he  has been a true professional, dedicated soldier, leader, officer, and  senior executive.   On behalf of the Senate, we thank Bernard P. Ingold, his wife Lolita,  and their entire family for their continued commitment, sacrifice, and  contributions to this great Nation. We join our colleagues in wishing  him future success as he transitions into retirement.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I am pleased to recognize Mr. Dan  ``Ohno'' Ohnesorge on the occasion of his retirement. In his 11 years  as the Enid Woodring airport director, Dan has been a fixture in the  Oklahoma aviation community, even serving as president of the Oklahoma  Airport Operators Association for the 2012-13 term. In recognition of  his passionate service to the Woodring Airport, Dan was awarded the  Oklahoma Airport Manager of the Year in 2016, the same year that Enid  Woodring Regional Airport was recognized as the Oklahoma Airport of the  Year by the Oklahoma Airport Operators Association.   Dan has been a passionate advocate for aviation since 1975. After  graduating from Florida State University with a BS in meteorology, he  earned a masters of aero science from Embry-Riddle Aeronautical  University. In his time in the U.S. Air Force, he flew F-16s with the  307th Fighter Squadron, and his dedication to serving the country has  continued to the present.   In his time as president of the Oklahoma Air Force Association, Dan  has worked tirelessly to ensure the men and women training to become  pilots at Vance Air Force Base are able to augment their training by  using the runway at Woodring Airport. He was instrumental in the  decision to locate a memorial honoring the men and women who gave their  lives in service to their country during the Vietnam war at the  Woodring Airport. It is a testament to his vision for this memorial  that Oklahomans from across the State regularly visit this memorial.   Under his leadership, Enid Woodring Regional Airport expanded the  main runway which enhanced the safety and capability of Vance Air Force  Base's pilot training program and built a new terminal building which  will more efficiently serve the general aviation and military pilots  and other users of the growing airport.   I am thankful that I have gotten to know Dan through his passion for  aviation and his commitment to the men and women who serve in our  Nation's Armed Forces. I know that I join his family, the Enid Woodring  Regional Airport, Vance Air Force Base, and the city of Enid in  thanking Dan for his years of service and contributions to the aviation  community.   Congratulations on your retirement.                            ____________________
