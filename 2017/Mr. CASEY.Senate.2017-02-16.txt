 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.    Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to speak in  opposition to the nomination of the Oklahoma attorney general, Scott  Pruitt, to be the next Administrator of the Environmental Protection  Agency which we all know as the EPA.   My concern--I have a number of them, but the principal concern of Mr.  Pruitt's nomination is rooted in his record, which I believe is totally  inconsistent with the mission of the EPA. That mission is to protect  human health and the environment. We know the EPA achieves this core  goal through the development and enforcement of standards to protect  children and families from exposure to dangerous pollutants in our air  and water.   Protection of human health means ensuring that our children have  clean air and clean water, tackling climate change, which leads to the  kind of food insecurity that causes malnutrition in children throughout  the world.   I have to say that as a Pennsylvanian, I think I have an obligation  to not only speak about these issues but to fight on behalf of policies  that will advance the knowledge and mission of the EPA but will be  consistent with the directive I am obligated to follow in my State's  constitution. In Pennsylvania, if you go back to the founding of  Pennsylvania forward, we had many generations, especially through the  beginning of the Industrial Revolution, throughout most of the 1800s  and into the 1900s, until about the midcentury point, where we didn't  do a very good job of protecting our air and water and human health  because we let one or another industry pretty much do whatever they  wanted until the modern era. Fortunately, since that time, Pennsylvania  has made a lot of progress. One of the measures of that progress and  something I am bound by is a provision of the State's constitution,  article I, section 27, that says people shall ``have a right to clean  air, pure water, and to the preservation of the natural, scenic,  historic, and esthetic values of the environment.''   That constitutional provision goes on to talk about each of us as  citizens of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania being trustees of the  environment--especially and ever more so if you are a part of State  government, and I would argue the Federal Government as well. To say I  feel an obligation is a major understatement. I think I am bound by  that, and that enters into my determination and analysis of Mr.  Pruitt's record.   We know in recent years the EPA, acting under the authority it is  granted through laws like the Clean Air Act and Clean Water Act, has  developed a number of important standards to advance these priorities-- rules like the mercury and air toxics standards, the cross-state air  pollution rule, the ozone rule, the new source performance standards  for the oil and natural gas industry, the Clean Power Plan, which is  meant to obviously focus our policy on climate change, and other  policies to reduce exposure to pollutants like methane, volatile  organic compounds, mercury, and carbon pollution itself.   According to the American Lung Association's ``State of the Air  2016'' report, these rules reduce the likelihood of premature death,  asthma attacks, lung cancer, and heart disease. I would hope that if  you have a series of measures in place that reduce the likelihood of  asthma attacks, lung cancer, heart disease, and premature death--I  would hope we would not only advance those policies but make sure they  are not destroyed, undermined, or compromised. It is just common sense  to make sure we regulate pollutants like lead, mercury, arsenic, and  acid gases, just by way of example.   Yet Mr. Pruitt, who is the attorney general of Oklahoma, filed 14  lawsuits against the EPA to halt the regulation of these pollutants  that threaten our children's health. Mr. Pruitt has stood up for the  interests of oil and gas companies but has failed to defend, in my  judgment, the most vulnerable members of our society, or at least not  defend them to the extent that I would hope he would, not only as  attorney general of Oklahoma but as the EPA Administrator were he to be  confirmed.   When asked during his confirmation to name one clean air or clean  water regulation he supported, he couldn't name one.   I believe his record is clear. He fought to dismantle the Clean Air  Act, the Clean Water Act, anti-pollution programs to target ozone and  mercury in the air, the agreement to clean up the Chesapeake Bay--which  I will get to in a moment--and has even denied the science of climate  change. Suffice it to say, I have a number of basic concerns about his  record and what he would do were he to be confirmed.   One example of the concerns I have involve the Chesapeake Bay with  regard to impact in Pennsylvania. Although Pennsylvania doesn't border  the Chesapeake, the Pennsylvania Susquehanna River is the bay's largest  source of freshwater. Improving the health of the Chesapeake Bay  requires a sustained, coordinated commitment from all of the States in  the watershed. I have repeatedly written to the U.S. Department of  Agriculture for increased funding and technical assistance for farmers  in Pennsylvania so Pennsylvania can continue to improve the health of  the Susquehanna River and the bay.   Pennsylvania has made great strides in addressing the issue of  nutrient and sediment runoff into the Chesapeake Bay, but there is more  to be done, and Pennsylvania is far from meeting its 2005 Chesapeake  Bay pollution reduction goals.   Ensuring that all States in the watershed are coordinated and meeting  their commitments is exactly the type of role the EPA should be  filling. Mr. Pruitt called the EPA's Chesapeake Bay TMDL standard ``the  culmination of the EPA's decade-long attempt to control exactly how  States achieve federal water quality requirements under the Clean Water  Act, and marks the beginning of the end of meaningful state  participation in water pollution regulation.''   Well, I disagree. We don't have time to outline all the reasons, but  I strongly disagree with that assessment of the EPA's actions with  regard to the Chesapeake Bay, but we do have a long way to go to make  sure that we keep it clean. So on clean water, I think we have to  insist that neither the EPA Administrator nor anyone in Congress does  anything compromising when it comes to clean water.   Climate change. This fall I had an opportunity to spend time in  Pennsylvania with Senator Whitehouse of Rhode Island, one of the  leaders in the Senate on the issue of climate change. We did a tour,  and one of the places we went was the John Heinz National Wildlife  Refuge. It is America's first urban refuge named after one of my  predecessors, Senator Heinz, who tragically died in 1991, but his work  on the environment is remembered in places like this wildlife refuge.  This is a public space that allows us to enjoy wildlife, outdoor  recreation, and environmental education opportunities right outside of  a major city--in this case, Philadelphia. And this refuge also plays a  vital role in climate change resiliency.   Marshes help to filter pollutants from water and can absorb water  during heavy rain events, thus helping to reduce the magnitude of  flooding. However, the refuge is facing a number of environmental  stressors.   Sea level rise could have serious consequences for this fresh water  marsh. Not only would rising sea levels lead to the loss of undeveloped  dry land and habitat for wildlife, but increased salinity could change  the plant makeup of this marsh at the wildlife refuge.   According to EPA, Pennsylvania's climate has warmed more than half a  degree Fahrenheit in just the last century. Sea level has also risen  nearly 1 foot over the past century, according  [[Page S1253]]  to NOAA, measured by the tidal gauge in Philadelphia. That means that  significant portions of the city of Philadelphia could be underwater,  including the Philadelphia International Airport, if we fail to act.   We know that 2016 was the warmest year on record for a third year in  a row. Also, climate change is not some distant possibility in  Pennsylvania or throughout the Nation; it is real, and we are already  feeling the effects of climate change.   I will close with one story from one mother who talks about air  quality, or the impact of bad air quality and the issue of climate  change itself. Jacqueline Smith-Spade, a mother from Philadelphia,  recently wrote to me about her 6-year-old son Jonas's struggle with  asthma and the emotional and financial toll it takes on her family:         Every time there is an extreme or irregular climate shift,       I can pretty much predict that my son is going to end up in       the emergency room due to the effect of air quality.    She goes on to say later in the letter:         I routinely check the air quality to help predict what type       of day my son and my family might have: With or without       nebulizer?        The physical toll on Jonas also creates a financial burden       on my family. The emergency visits cost $100 each time we go;       $30 copays for each specialist visit; $15 copays for each       pediatrician visit.    She goes on to say:         This is not cheap; however, my insurance greatly helps to       reduce the costs.    She worries, of course, about what might happen on healthcare, but I  will not read all of those portions.   She concludes this part of the letter this way:         A reduction in air pollution and climate change will make       life for my 7-year-old son, Jonas, much easier. His reactions       to those changes will be reduced. It will also save my family       countless dollars, stress, and panic attacks.    So said one mom about her son Jonas.   What we must do, and especially what Mr. Pruitt must do, were he to  be confirmed, is to answer her questions--to answer her questions,  Jacqueline's questions, and the concerns she has about her son Jonas.  She is not only a taxpayer, but she is someone who will be impacted  directly by the actions and the policies that come from this  administration as well as the EPA itself.   So I believe that Mr. Pruitt, if he were to be confirmed, must meet  the expectations of Jonas and his mother. He works for them, or will  work for them, were he to be confirmed.   I know I am out of time. I will just conclude with this: There are a  long series of reasons, some of which I wasn't able to get to today,  that undergird and form the foundation of my decision not to support  the nomination of Scott Pruitt as the next EPA Administrator.   With that, I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority whip.
