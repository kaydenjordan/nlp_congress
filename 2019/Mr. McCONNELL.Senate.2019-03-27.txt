 Madam President, yesterday, my Democratic colleagues  in this body offered the American people a crystal-clear picture of  what the Democratic Party stands for in 2019 and whom it represents.  Nearly all of our Democratic colleagues wrapped their arms around the  radical policy they have marketed to the public as the Green New Deal.   I am sure we will be hearing carefully crafted spin about the  transparent political maneuvering behind voting present instead of  voting yes. Not exactly ``Profiles in Courage.'' Not exactly ``Profiles  in Courage.''   I am also certain that we will hear more indignant claims that I  somehow sabotaged the legislation they said they support by actually  bringing it to a vote. That is a fascinating sight in the Senate--the  cosponsors of a policy complaining bitterly that they actually had to  go on record to actually vote for a bill they supposedly support, but  go on record they did. They can call it voting present. They can call  it voting yes. But when every single Senate Democrat running for  President has signed on as a cosponsor, when all of the energy and  momentum in the Democratic Party is behind this, when just a tiny  handful of Democratic Senators could bring themselves to vote against  it on the floor, what we have is a Democratic Party that is fixated on  satisfying the far left, even at the cost of crushing--crushing-- working-class and middle-class American life as we know it.   Yesterday, the vast majority of Senate Democrats could not dismiss  something as crazy as ending the production of American oil, coal,  natural gas, and nuclear energy within a decade. They couldn't vote  against that.   Senate Democrats could not dismiss something as absolutely ludicrous  as a federally mandated overhaul of every building in America to meet  the greenness--greenness--standards of Washington bureaucrats.   Senate Democrats could not reject a plan to take more control over  where Americans choose to live, how they  [[Page S2012]]  choose to get around, and how they earn a living.   Senate Democrats could not even reject a plan that, according to  rough estimates, could raise families' utility bills by hundreds of  dollars a month and cost the U.S. Government more than the entire 2017  GDP of the whole world. They couldn't vote against that.   American manufacturing, American agriculture, industries, jobs,  houses, farms, buildings, and cars that make up daily life for millions  of working Americans--Democrats want Washington, DC, to declare war on  all of that because it doesn't comply with the latest fashions in  Brooklyn or San Francisco. They want to march the entire country toward  extreme environmentalist goals that even President Obama's former  Secretary of Energy has dismissed as impossible. That is what the  Democratic Party of 2019 apparently has become.   Remember, their last Presidential nominee bragged, after her loss,  that at least she had won all the places in America that are  ``optimistic, diverse, dynamic, [and] moving forward.'' We can fill in  the blanks and see how they view all the other places that millions of  Americans call home, those places that just aren't enlightened enough  to vote for Democrats, places where farm jobs and factory jobs really  matter, places where expensive high-speed rail and electric cars and  trucks simply will not get the job done, places where soaring electric  bills represent a kitchen-table crisis and not just a minor  inconvenience, and places that are actually home to the workers who  would be, as the resolution breezily puts it, ``affected by the  transition''--in other words, jobs shipped overseas and workers out in  the cold. In Democrats' eyes, all of us in these places are just  backward and out-of-date. People who live in those areas are just  backward and out-of-date. Our lives need to be transformed by  Washington, DC, bureaucrats, whether we like it or not.   The disruption isn't limited to just environmental and energy issues;  there are so many more things Washington Democrats want to get their  hands around.   Democrats are pushing Medicare for None, a scheme that would make it  unlawful to provide the private health insurance policies that American  families rely on and force everyone into a brandnew government scheme  designed, of course, right here in Washington. It is ironic that this  approach would mean long waiting lists for people with preexisting  conditions and cause over 180 million Americans to lose the coverage  they choose and rely on. Republicans are dedicated to protecting  Americans with preexisting conditions. Republicans are the ones  fighting for American families as they try to navigate the unaffordable  wreckage of ObamaCare.   The story is the same on every issue: Democrats aren't interested in  security and stability for American families; they are interested in  Washington redesigning middle-class Americans' lives from scratch so  they can conform better to leftwing dreams.   Forty-plus--forty-plus--of our Democratic colleagues, including all  of their Presidential candidates, could not even bring themselves to  vote against the obviously absurd socialist wish list we considered  yesterday. This is what the modern Democratic Party wants to be. These  are their plans for the country. At least the American people are  certainly offered a very, very clear contrast.                               Disaster Funding    Madam President, on an entirely different matter, in recent months,  natural disasters have occupied an outsized share of headlines across  our country. We have seen counties in Alabama and Georgia bear the  blows of a vicious tornado, and we support the loved ones of those 23  people whose lives it claimed. We have seen a spate of powerful  hurricanes tear across the shores of Florida and the Carolinas, leaving  tens of billions of dollars in damage behind. Flooding has repeatedly  caused damage in my home State of Kentucky, and, of course, it is  currently at major disaster levels in communities across the Midwest.   In some places, the process of rebuilding has already dragged on for  months. Families have faced the daily struggle of getting things back  to normal.   Others are still literally--literally--underwater. Residents are  wading through the wreckage of homes and businesses. Normal seems a  long way away.   From the gulf coast to the heartland, there are Americans calling for  our help. Here in Congress we must have their back. We must take swift  and comprehensive action. I am pleased to say, a number of our  colleagues have crafted legislation that would allow us to answer these  calls for help from our people.   The supplemental funding measure advanced by the Senate yesterday  would deliver over $13 billion to help American communities recover and  rebuild following recent natural disasters. It would mean more help for  victims of tornadoes in our Southern States, victims of hurricanes from  North Carolina to Puerto Rico, and the families in Iowa, Nebraska,  Missouri, and Kansas, who are still, as we speak, waiting for the  waters of a truly catastrophic flood to recede. The legislation before  us would equip the Department of Defense to conduct urgent repairs to  bases and installations damaged by storms. It would help America's  farmers and ranchers cover storm-related losses, and it would help get  local schools, healthcare facilities, and major infrastructure back on  track more quickly.   I am proud of the work put in by many Members to prepare this latest  package so swiftly and thoroughly on behalf of our communities in need.  We owe thanks to the leadership of Chairman Shelby, along with the  efforts of Senator Perdue, Senator Isakson, Senator Scott, Senator  Rubio, and others who made this effort possible. Thanks to them, the  Senate can take action soon on a comprehensive measure to support our  fellow citizens.    Madam President, reserving the right to object. As I  mentioned yesterday, when a similar unanimous consent proposal was  propounded, I have consistently supported the proposition that the  special counsel should be allowed to complete his work without  interference, and I have consistently supported the proposition that  his report ought to be released, to the greatest extent possible,  consistent with the law and with the need to protect sources and  methods and the need to preserve the integrity of ongoing  investigations, including investigations the special counsel has  referred to others.   The Attorney General has committed to as much transparency as  possible in the release of the report, and he is working with the  special counsel toward that end. I think we should be consistent in  letting the special counsel actually finish his work and not just when  we think it may be politically advantageous to one side or the other  for him to do so.   Therefore, Madam President, I object.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  be in a period of morning business, with Senators permitted to speak  therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, as in executive session, I ask  unanimous consent that at 1:30 p.m. on Thursday, March 28, the Senate  proceed to executive session and consideration of Executive Calendar  No. 9; further, that there be 15 minutes of debate equally divided and  that following the use or yielding back of time, the Senate vote on the  nomination with no intervening action or debate; that if confirmed, the  motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table, the  President be immediately notified of the Senate's action, and the  Senate resume legislative session.    Mr. President, I understand there is a bill at the  desk, and I ask for its first reading.    I now ask for a second reading and, in order to place  the bill on the calendar under the provisions of rule XIV, I object to  my own request.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs be discharged from  further consideration of S. 590 and the Senate proceed to its immediate  consideration.    I ask unanimous consent the bill be considered read a  third time and passed and the motion to reconsider be considered made  and laid upon the table.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  now proceed to the en bloc consideration of the following Senate  resolutions which were submitted earlier today: S. Res. 125, S. Res.  126, and S. Res. 127.   There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the  resolutions en bloc.    I ask unanimous consent that the resolutions be agreed  to, the preambles be agreed to, and the motions to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table, all en bloc.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 10 a.m.,  Thursday, March 28; further, that following the prayer and pledge, the  morning hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved  to date, the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later  in the day, morning business be closed, and the Senate resume  consideration of the motion to proceed to H.R. 268.    Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask that it stand adjourned under the previous  order.   Thereupon, the Senate, at 6:33 p.m., adjourned until Thursday, March  28, 2019, at 10 a.m.
