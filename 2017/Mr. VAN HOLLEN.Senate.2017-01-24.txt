 Mr. President, in 1945, at the close of World War II,  the 50 Allied nations formed the United Nations to help prevent another  world war. Since its founding, the U.N. has grown to 193 nations. While  it has many serious flaws, it has been an important tool for promoting  peace, protecting human rights, providing humanitarian assistance, and  safeguarding the environment.   U.S. Ambassadors to the U.N. have included some of America's leading  figures, including Henry Cabot Lodge, Jr., Adlai Stevenson, Arthur  Goldberg, George H.W. Bush, Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Andrew Young,  Madeleine Albright, Bill Richardson, and John Danforth. President  Eisenhower raised the ambassadorship to cabinet rank. Although both  Presidents Bush removed the position from Cabinet level, President  Obama restored it to that level. I am pleased that President Trump has  decided to keep it there.   The U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. must advance principles that the  United States has promoted over the years--the rule of law, individual  liberties, and human rights. Our ambassador must not only maintain, but  strengthen our relationships with our allies.   Unlike many past ambassadors to the U.N., Governor Nikki Haley has  little experience in foreign policy. But as Governor, she developed  important experience building coalitions, and that skill should serve  her well as ambassador to the U.N.   Some positions that Governor Haley took during her confirmation  hearing give me pause. For example, Governor Haley made some statements  about the 2015 Iran nuclear agreement that indicated unfamiliarity with  the joint comprehensive plan of action. I am pleased, however, that  Governor Haley distanced herself from some of President Trump's most  divisive positions, and I will support her nomination.
