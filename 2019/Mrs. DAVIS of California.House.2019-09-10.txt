 Mr. Speaker, it is hard to believe that  some have already forgotten the lessons we have learned from the BP oil  spill disaster. It was only a few years ago that we saw millions of  gallons of oil being spilled into the Gulf of Mexico, and, sadly, many  areas are still recovering.   In California, we have seen the disastrous effects offshore drilling  can have on our oceans and the lives that depend on it. We had our own  disaster in Santa Barbara exactly 50 years ago.   Night after night, we saw images of birds and sea otters drenched in  oil and pictures of dead seals and dolphins. It was heartbreaking. And  this is why we say never again.   Offshore drilling is not the answer to our country's energy  challenges. We can and we must invest in clean, renewable energy.   California, as everybody knows, has one of the most beautiful  coastlines in the world, and we have to keep it that way. So I urge my  colleagues, vote to keep our oceans clean and reject more offshore  drilling.                            ____________________
