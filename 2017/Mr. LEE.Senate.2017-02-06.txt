 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I rise today to speak in support of the  nomination of Senator Jeff Sessions to be the next Attorney General of  the United States.   I enthusiastically support this nomination, because I know Senator  Sessions to be an independent-minded man of great integrity. He is  someone who understands and respects the rule of law. He values it  deeply, in fact. He is someone who understands the difference between  making law and enforcing the law. He understands the difference between  setting policy and enforcing laws that contain policy, and he is  someone who understands that, as a lawyer, the very best way to serve  your client often involves offering honest, independent advice--honest  independent advice of the sort that might not always occur to the  client on the client's part.   I have listened to the remarks of some of my colleagues, and I have  to state that I have served with Senator Sessions for the last 6 years,  ever since I first became a Member of this body, and I don't recognize  the caricature that has been painted of him over the last 24 hours. So  I want to address head-on several of my colleagues' expressed concerns  about his nomination.   Some of my colleagues have expressed and relied upon what really  amount to policy concerns--policy disagreements between themselves and  Senator Sessions--as a reason to oppose his nomination.   As I explained it in our Judiciary Committee markup last week, I have  disagreed with Senator Sessions not just 1 or 2 times but on many, many  occasions and not just on a few isolated issues that are only  tangentially related to something important to me but on circumstances  and issues that are very important to me and that are at the center of  my legislative agenda. We have disagreed, for example, about sentencing  reform. We have disagreed about immigration reform, and several  important national security issues implicating constitutional law, and  constitutional policy. All of these issues are very important to both  of us--to me and to Senator Sessions. They can be emotional issues, and  they happen to be issues on which Senator Sessions and I disagree, not  just a little bit, but we happen to disagree taking almost  diametrically opposed positions in many of these areas.   Notwithstanding these disagreements--disagreements that I have seen  in every one of the 6 years I have served in this body so far--I have  never seen Senator Sessions raise his voice in anger against a  colleague. To be sure, Senator Sessions makes his arguments vigorously,  passionately, and forcefully, and yet he does so in a way that ensures  that he will always treat his colleagues, even though he disagrees with  them, with dignity and respect. You may not persuade him that your  position is right and his is wrong, but he always gives you the  opportunity to make your case. I think Members of this body know that.  Those Members of this body who have actually taken the time to get to  know Senator Sessions and actually have the opportunity to work with  him, even the opportunity to disagree with him know that. Senator  Sessions interacts with his colleagues in a way that demonstrates a  degree of respect for differences of opinion that are seldom seen here.  In fact, I can't think of a colleague who better exemplifies the  principles of collegiality to which we aspire in this body than does  Senator Sessions.   Perhaps even more importantly, Senator Sessions obviously understands  the difference between lawmaking on the one hand and law enforcement on  the other hand. This is plain from testimony he provided before the  Judiciary Committee.   As just one example, he told us:         To go from the Legislative branch to the Executive branch       is a transfer not only of position, but of the way you       approach issues. I would be in an executive function and       enforcement function of the law this great legislative body       might pass.''    His commitment to the rule of law and even application of the law is  also plain from his public record, from his record serving in other  positions. His record, for example, as U.S. Attorney for the Southern  District of Alabama, and his record as attorney general for the State  of Alabama.    To put the matter quite plainly, a great number of Senators have  served in the Cabinet over the years. The standard has never been that  a Senator is somehow unfit for the executive branch--for a Cabinet  position in the executive branch--if he or she has disagreed with you  on important issues. If that were the standard, no Senator would ever  be confirmed because we debate important public policy issues  [[Page S943]]  every single day, and it is never the case that we will find any among  us, even colleagues, with whom we agree most of the time who are going  to agree with us 100 percent of the time. So I urge my colleagues to  put aside any policy differences they might have with Senator Sessions  when considering his nomination and when deciding how they are going to  vote in response to his nomination, because those simply are not  relevant to his job and, at a minimum, ought not to be disqualifying  factors relevant to his job.   As to independence, some of my colleagues doubt that Senator Sessions  will be an independent voice at the Department of Justice.  Respectfully, I can say with full confidence that anyone who actually  knows Senator Sessions knows that he is fiercely independent-minded. He  never shies away from expressing his closely held, sincerely developed  views on any issue, even when political pressure might suggest a  different course of action be in order. It is clear that Sessions will  apply his independent-mindedness to his job after he is confirmed as  Attorney General of the United States.   During his testimony before the Judiciary Committee, he repeatedly  outlined the importance of having an independent Attorney General, and  he explained how he would fulfill this obligation, how he would become  precisely such an Attorney General, one who would exercise a degree of  independence and not simply be a rubber stamp.   For example, he told us that every Attorney General ``understands, I  think, that if a President wants to accomplish a goal that he or she  believes in deeply, you should help them do it in a lawful way but make  clear and object if it is an unlawful action.'' He described that  role--being able to tell the President ``no,'' that is--as ``the  ultimate loyalty to him.''   He testified: ``I hope that President Trump has confidence in me so  that if I give him advice that something can be done or cannot be done,  that he would respect that.''   Sessions also explained that if the Attorney General were asked ``to  do something plainly unlawful, he cannot participate in that. He or she  would have to resign ultimately before agreeing to execute a policy  that the Attorney General believed would be unlawful or  unconstitutional.'' Senator Sessions made this point repeatedly. He  made it with great emphasis and in such a way that it is unmistakably  clear to me that this is the Attorney General he would aspire to be and  that he would in fact become after being confirmed.   Now, some may argue that you cannot necessarily trust his testimony  because no Attorney General nominee would declare an intention to be a  rubberstamp to the nominated President. Others may argue that Senator  Sessions was too involved in the Trump campaign to be impartial. This  is one of those points that you either believe or don't believe. You  can't reason your way to an answer. You have to know the person.   So I urge my colleagues to reflect on their experiences with Senator  Sessions. If I know one thing about him, he is not a ``yes'' man. If I  know one thing about him, it is that of all the people with whom I have  served in the Senate, he is one of the very last who I would ever  expect in any context to sell out his sincerely held views on the basis  of political expediency. Instead, Senator Sessions takes his  professional responsibility very seriously.   When he was a lawyer, he took seriously his obligations to his client  and the law. As a Senator, he has taken seriously his obligations to  the people of the State of Alabama. I know he will do the same thing at  the U.S. Department of Justice.   He told us that ``the Attorney General ultimately owes his loyalty to  the integrity of the American people and to the fidelity of the  Constitution, and the legislative laws of the country.'' This  demonstrates that Senator Sessions understands, as any good lawyer  does, that every lawyer has a client, and you understand how best to  represent that client and that client's interest. You have to  understand the nature of the attorney-client relationship. You have to  know who the client is, you have to know how to interact with that  client, and you have to be willing to push back on that client, even  when--especially when--it is difficult, because that is the job of the  lawyer. The obligations incumbent upon the lawyer provides that the  lawyer sometimes has to push back on the client.   At the end of the day, it seems to me that some of my colleagues  perhaps just want an Attorney General who will be openly,  affirmatively, presumptively, perennially hostile to the President's  agenda. Now, that has never been the standard, and it is not a workable  way of arranging the executive branch of the U.S. Government. The  President should be allowed to assemble his or her team so long as the  President picks people who are qualified, people who are willing and  able to fulfill their constitutional responsibility, and people who do  not have anything disqualifying in their backgrounds that would suggest  that they cannot be trusted with this type of very substantial  responsibility. Senator Sessions plainly satisfies these criteria.   So I support Senator Sessions' nomination. I do so wholeheartedly. I  do so, I would add, with a somewhat heavy heart, knowing that as we  take this step and confirm Senator Sessions as the next Attorney  General of the United States, we will be losing a colleague--not just  any colleague but a colleague that has been a dear friend to me, who  has been a kind mentor and a good example to me at every stage of my  service in the Senate. He has done this not only when we have agreed,  but he has done this especially when we have disagreed. That is what I  love so much about Senator Sessions--that he has taught me much about  how to get along with and respect people who sometimes reach different  conclusions than I reach on my own.
