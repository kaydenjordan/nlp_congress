 The Biden administration has been working overtime to  sell the American people a fantasy. The President would like working  families who struggled under 2 years of soaring inflation to believe  their refrain that ``Bidenomics is working for America.''   The White House Press Secretary declared recently that ``people are  feeling better about their personal finances.'' If only that were true.  Unfortunately, the American people have too many reasons to believe  their financial outlook is worse today--worse--than when the President  took office.   According to a survey conducted last month, just 24 percent of voters  say the American economy is on the right track; less than a third buy  the claim that this administration's policies are bringing costs down  for working families; and just 22 percent think inflation is getting  any better.   No matter how many ways the administration officials spin the  numbers, folks who work for a living and manage a family budget know  that Bidenomics has made their lives harder. They know that prices have  risen 16.6 percent since the President took office because they feel it  every time they pay their bills. Energy prices, for example, are 38  percent higher than they were in January of 2021, and groceries are 20  percent more expensive.   In Washington State, one man reported recently that soaring rent had  forced him to move, take on a longer commute, spend more on gas, and  put his goal of homeownership on hold.   In Illinois, one woman told a reporter recently that she had paid $90  for groceries that would feed her family of three for 3 days. They  might have to start visiting food pantries. ``You have no choice but to  sacrifice,'' she said.   So look at it this way: During the first terms of the last four  administrations before this one, year-on-year inflation never cracked 4  percent. Under President Biden, it happened 26 times. To borrow the  President's own phrase, that is Bidenomics in action.   As one top Democratic economist put it last year, ``This is Biden's  inflation and he needs to own it.''   So it is fitting that the President finally slapped his name on our  current economic situation. He is right to take credit. Working  families wouldn't be in this mess if he hadn't spent his first  few months in office cramming $2 trillion in leftwing spending down the  throat of our economy. So owning the runaway inflation Washington  Democrats helped produce is one thing, but it is about time they  focused on fixing it.                            ____________________     Now, on a different matter, tomorrow, Prime Minister  Meloni of Italy will visit Washington for a series of meetings. I look  forward to welcoming her to the Capitol at an important time for our  two countries' friendship and for Italy's role in the transatlantic  alliance.   Prime Minister Meloni took office as Europe faced its first large- scale land war in decades and Italy faced the increasing economic  vulnerabilities of reliance on China. By all accounts, she has  addressed these challenges head-on.  [[Page S3562]]  The Prime Minister has repeatedly asserted Italy's commitment to  helping Ukraine beat Russian aggression and rebuild its economy.  Importantly, like some leaders, she has done so with refreshing clarity  to the Italian people about their own country's concrete interest in  helping Ukraine defend itself.   Earlier this spring, in an address to the Italian Senate, Prime  Minister Meloni summed up the reality. She said:         We are also sending [arms] to the Ukrainians to prevent the       possibility of having to use them ourselves one day. We are       sending arms to Ukraine also to keep the war far away from       the rest of Europe and our home.    Not vaguely defining philanthropy; just cold, hard investments in our  own security.   At the NATO summit in Vilnius earlier this month, Italy's leader  rightly declared:         Our freedom has a cost. . . . [W]hat is invested in defence       comes back tenfold, a hundredfold, in terms of our ability to       defend our national interests.    Secretary General Stoltenberg has recognized the Prime Minister's  ``strong, personal commitment to NATO, [and] to our trans-Atlantic  alliance.''   And the Italian Government has expressed its intention to accelerate  progress toward the alliance's 2-percent defense spending program. I  hope and expect to see Italy and all NATO allies meet this goal.   This shift in Italy's approach to defense and security policy  reflects what allies have recognized across Europe: that the long  holiday from history is over, and their investments and hard power are  overdue.   But as Prime Minister Meloni meets with President Biden tomorrow, it  is important to remember that our shared interests extend beyond  Europe. Italy is rightly concerned about growing instability,  terrorism, and migration flows in Africa--yet another area where  Russian and Chinese influence has played a corrosive and threatening  role. America has a shared interest in keeping pressure on the global  terrorist resurgence that has followed the disastrous withdrawal from  Afghanistan.   I am also encouraged that the Italian government is unraveling its  involvement with China's so-called Belt and Road Initiative, another  indication our European allies are taking steps to protect themselves  against China's economic force.   So if we are serious about competition with the PRC, we need to work  more closely with allies and partners who share our interest in  preserving a world of free and fair trade and secure supply chains.   I am hopeful that President Biden and Prime Minister Meloni have a  productive meeting tomorrow. I look forward to discussing our two  nations' common challenges and priorities with her directly.   In the meantime, I am hopeful our colleagues will continue to work  diligently to provide for common defense and equip America and our  allies to meet and deter common threats.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.   The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
