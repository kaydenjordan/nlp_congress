 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for  as much time as I may consume.    Madam President, I rise to join my colleagues in  sharing my concerns and all of our concerns that we have--and really  the concerns of a nation--about the announcement last night from a  Department of Justice that works for this administration, which  announced its plans to literally invalidate the Affordable Care Act and  strip healthcare coverage away from millions of Americans, including  those with preexisting conditions.   Before this time, it was a bit unclear, despite a court filing in  Texas, what the intentions were. Some of our colleagues were saying,  ``No, we don't really want to repeal the Affordable Care Act,'' but  last night we learned the truth, and the truth was very clear. The  Justice Department took a hardline approach that they want to repeal  the Affordable Care Act.   The President tweeted today that the Republican Party ``will soon be  known as the party of health care.'' In fact, yesterday's filing--in  which the administration changed its previous position and argued in  support of affirming the decision of a district court judge in Texas-- ensures exactly the opposite; that this administration will break the  promise it made to the American people that they can have healthcare  insurance; that if they have a preexisting condition, they will not  lose their healthcare. That was what the situation was before we had  the protections in place in the Affordable Care Act, before you were  able to keep your kids on your insurance until they were 26. That was a  huge positive development.   Then we also put in place protections that said you couldn't be  kicked off your insurance for preexisting conditions. All over the last  year, we had a debate about this in this Nation. I still remember being  in a smalltown parade in Northern Minnesota, where a mom was pushing a  stroller. She brought me over and pointed to her toddler in that  stroller, to her young boy who had Down syndrome. She said: This is  what a preexisting condition looks like, and I will do everything to  protect my child. Guess what. Last night, the administration announced  they wouldn't protect that child because they will do everything to  repeal the Affordable Care Act.   Let's start with the absurd ruling the administration is basing its  actions on. The Texas ruling last December came more than 6 years after  the Supreme Court, in an opinion written by Justice Roberts, upheld the  law's constitutionality, which also found that parts of the law can be  severed from the rest of the legislation. It also came after  [[Page S2001]]  the administration's refusal to defend the law. Instead of going in to  put out the fire when the house was burning down, they just stood  there. They just stood there and poured lighter fluid on, in terms of  tweets and rhetoric.   If this ruling takes effect, the consequences of just this ruling  alone from Texas will be devastating. To start, protections for people  with preexisting conditions will be gone. About half of all Americans  have preexisting conditions. This isn't just rare diseases. It is much  more common diseases, like diabetes and asthma. The ability to keep  your kid on your insurance plan until they are 26 would be gone. The  work we have done to close the Medicare doughnut hole coverage gap  would be gone. The provisions that help people buy insurance on the  healthcare exchanges would be gone.   In my State, Minnesotans would see a loss of $364 million in premium  tax credits, and roughly 272,000 people would lose their coverage. That  is one State alone.   We cannot allow this to happen. The decision from Texas should be  overturned, and we need a President who believes the same thing. It is  time to stop trying to reset the clock or start from scratch. This is  not what the American people want. The vast majority of Americans  support those protections in the Affordable Care Act.   We know we can make improvements to the Affordable Care Act. I would  like to see pharmaceutical prices go down. I would like to pass my bill  to allow Medicare to negotiate cheaper prices for prescription drugs.  We could have a vote on that. I would love to see the bill I had with  Senator McCain, and now Senator Grassley, come up for a vote that would  allow less expensive drugs to be brought in from other countries that  are safe, like Canada. I would like to see a vote on the bill that  Senator Grassley and I have to stop pay-for-delay, where  pharmaceuticals pay off generics to keep their products off the market.   We have already seen what kind of healthcare proposal my Republican  colleagues have put forward. We saw it just last year. The legislation  we saw last Congress would have hurt people by kicking millions off of  Medicaid, by letting insurance companies charge people more when they  get sick, and by jacking up healthcare costs.   Every major group you trust, when it comes to your health, was  opposed--the largest groups of doctors, nurses, seniors, hospitals,  people with cancer, Alzheimer's, heart disease, diabetes. Why were they  opposed to repealing the Affordable Care Act? Because there was nothing  good that was proposed to replace it.   We cannot spend the next 2 years going backward and fighting old  fights, as this administration announced they would do last night. We  need to focus on building on the strengths of the Affordable Care Act,  those protections, and making it even stronger by allowing seniors to  negotiate for less expensive drug prices, for bringing in less  expensive drugs from places like Canada, and for stopping pay-for- delay.   We can also reduce premiums by passing the bipartisan bill that  Senators Alexander and Murray have for reinsurance, by passing Senator  Shaheen's cost-sharing bill, by moving on for a public option which  could be supported with Medicaid, the bill that Senator Schatz has, or  Medicare, which is another bill Senator Kaine has.   I have always said the Affordable Care Act was a beginning and not an  end, but guess what. Last night, we found out this administration truly  wants to end it.   What are real people saying about this who don't work in this place?  What are people who actually have to depend on the protections of the  Affordable Care Act saying? I am going to spend the rest of my time  this evening telling some of those stories, reading from the letters  that I and others have received about people who have been protected by  the Affordable Care Act, the very act that this administration  announced last night it wanted to repeal--not just partially repeal.  They announced they want to repeal all of it.   What would that do to people? Let's hear the stories. Let's read the  letters. I am going to read 100 letters tonight, and I am starting,  with the first letter, from my home State.   Bruce from Minneapolis has diabetes. He was spending $1,000 a month  for medical coverage before Congress passed the Affordable Care Act in  2010. Today, he pays $300. He was quoted saying: ``As an individual  with pre-existing conditions, the ACA has helped save me thousands of  dollars and given me a better lifestyle.''   Amy of St. Paul said she needs the Medicaid benefits she gained under  the ACA. What happened to her? She slipped on an icy driveway, as many  people in Northern States, in this past winter, have done. Sadly for  her, she had a brain injury when that happened. The ACA Medicaid  benefits helped to cover her medical costs.   Delaney was able to access a mammogram screening to see if she  carries the same genetic trait that predisposed several of her  relatives to breast cancer. I have worked on the EARLY Act--passed this  bill as part of the Affordable Care Act--that allowed us to do more to  help especially people who have genetically tested to have the same  gene, especially, by the way, certain women in African-American  populations and certain women who are Jewish. We have found a  prevailing gene that means they are more likely to get breast cancer  when they are younger, but before we had the Affordable Care Act, none  of this would have been covered. None of this would have been paid  attention to.   Delaney wrote that because of the bill, she was able to access a  mammogram screening to see if she had that trait. Any threat to the ACA  concerns her because the law mandated that healthcare plans cover  recommended screenings.   Story No. 4. Katherine of Minneapolis is trying to regain financial  independence after diabetes forced her out of her job. For now, she is  covered by a low-income government policy that would continue if the  ACA stays in place but otherwise it goes away. She worries that any  income from a part-time job would disqualify her for coverage and that  she would struggle to find private insurance without the ACA's  protections for people with preexisting conditions.    I think this is really important for people to know because even if  you are not using those exchanges because maybe you have employer  insurance, which over half the people in this country have, the ACA  helps you. Do you know why? It has those prohibitions that say your  insurance can't kick you off just because you have a preexisting  condition, just because you are born with diabetes, just because later  in life you have breast cancer, or, as was the case before we passed  the ACA in a number of States, if you were a victim of domestic  violence, that was considered a preexisting condition because it could  happen to you again.   So as I read these letters and tell these stories, people need to  understand that the people who have been protected are not just the  people who are getting their insurance on the exchanges. There are a  whole lot of people who are on private insurance but were protected  because the Affordable Care Act made clear that they can't be kicked  off their insurance.   Story No. 5, letter No. 5. Amy qualifies for Medicaid only because  the ACA raised the income limits to be eligible for the State program  for those with disabilities. She had 73 doctor visits after she had  this head injury, and she doubts she would have received that much care  without good insurance.   That is the same story we had here in the letter; it is the same  person who slipped and had a brain jury. This is another piece of why  this is so important, because she got a disability when she slipped,  and that means she is concerned that because of the income limits, that  could change.   Story No. 6. Kate wrote to me and shared the following story:         I call my son the baby that almost didn't happen. A bright,       loving and entirely all-boy 4-year-old, Daniel was a gift to       us after I battled cancer from 27 to 34 years old. Unable to       find care for my cancer after it reoccurred, my only       insurance option even denied my pap smears and lifesaving       tests. Cancer dotted my cervix in an attempt to overtake me;       I refused to allow it to win.        Because of the ACA, I faced a future of hope--not only for       myself, but for cancer sisters who were unable to receive       other treatment and died. My best friend's cancer scans       weren't covered by her insurance until 2015 and after       battling for 3 years, she passed last year. Special       provisions are now in place in the bill for women's health.       Healthcare is going to be more affordable for people like  [[Page S2002]]       me and my children for years to come. Being a woman should       NOT be a pre-existing condition.    Story No. 7. Abbey of Minneapolis was diagnosed with a parasitic  infection at the age of 10 months old. Because of the ACA, she was  still on her insurance throughout college when she had to have two  brain surgeries and multiple eye surgeries. It also helps her pay for  the only medicine that treats her disease.   Story No 8. Mary Jo from Minnesota is struggling with the costs of  sending three kids to college. She was able to provide health insurance  for her middle daughter only because the ACA allowed her to be covered  by her father's insurance. Mary Jo writes that a reversal of this  legislation would ``be the last straw for us. Please don't take it away  from us--we're hanging on by a fingernail.''   I think that is a good one to send to the White House: This would  ``be the last straw for us.'' This is someone who is struggling to keep  their kids in college and who needs the ACA to keep the kids on their  healthcare.   Tara is another one from outside of my State. Tara's young son would  not be alive if it weren't for Medi-Cal. Tara was laid off from her job  just prior to his birth, and there was an issue with transitioning to  COBRA. Her husband is self-employed without insurance, so when her son  Benjamin came, he was uninsured. Tara said:         We were hard-working Americans, but that didn't matter when       it came to insurance. Benjamin was uninsurable because of his       heart.    When Benjamin was 2 weeks old, he was taken to the emergency room,  where they learned he had a congenital heart defect that was causing  him to go into heart failure. As doctors rushed to save his life, Tara  and her husband panicked, not knowing how they would afford any care.  Tara's mom and sisters offered to sell their houses, and their extended  family looked to liquidate whatever assets they had. At that point,  someone at the hospital gave Tara the paperwork for California  Children's Services. That is where they live. They found they were  eligible, and Benjamin's coverage began shortly thereafter.   For years, Tara and her family watched their income levels closely,  keeping their income low, fearing that Medi-Cal would be terminated.  She didn't return to work for years. She emphasizes that they never  collected any other kind of assistance, but she was left with no  choice, knowing that they would never be able to find other coverage  for Benjamin.   Her mom, who is retired, takes care of Benjamin and helps her. Tara  eventually went back to work, but when she went back to work, her  husband was diagnosed with hepatitis. He now joins the millions of  Americans who have preexisting conditions. She wrote:         If the ACA is repealed and I lose my job, and insurance, my       husband and son will lose access to health insurance we can       afford. No healthcare saving will cover the cost of their       care, not on a teacher's salary. Benjamin will soon be an       adult and unable to be covered on my health insurance. I pray       he will be able to afford health insurance.    She says this is what she wants lawmakers to know--that means us,  right here, who work here:         We never collected any other type of assistance, but we had       no choice to accept the [healthcare] coverage. Please       consider the effects of repealing this act on children like       my son and our family. We are real people. We're not special.       We're normal Americans. We work hard, with some extraordinary       circumstances. We don't want a free ride; we just want help       and for lawmakers to know we're not disposable.    Letter No. 10. Kathy from Nevada says:         Before the Affordable Care Act, there were times in my life       when I had health insurance and other times when I did not.       Some employers would offer me a plan, and then if I switched       jobs, I'd lose it.    By the way, I can't tell you how many times I heard this in my home  State.   She goes on:         I tried to apply for coverage on the individual market--    This is before the Affordable Care Act--       but insurers would deny me when I admitted [and told the       truth] that I had occasional migraines and sinus issues.        In late 2013, I started to notice pain in my abdomen nearly       every time I ate anything. . . . I drove myself to the       nearest urgent care facility. Many tests and procedures       followed, and by March I was diagnosed with Burkitt's       lymphoma, a rare form of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma that's       extremely aggressive. . . . The diagnosis came at the worst       time imaginable. My mom died unexpectedly in January and a       tree fell on my house in February. I found myself running       away to escape because I was completely overwhelmed and       terrified of chemotherapy. But after about a week, the cancer       had weakened me to the point where I could barely walk from       my car. . . . I went home to begin cancer treatment.        Because Burkitt's lymphoma is so aggressive, I needed . . .       infusions of chemotherapy for 5\1/2\ days during each round,       for a total of six rounds. These infusions could only be       administered in the hospital.        When I finally finished treatment, I had amassed an       astronomical amount of medical bills. . . . If I had not had       medical insurance, I honestly don't know if I would have been       able to continue.        The gratitude I felt (and continue to feel) for the ACA and       the fact that I have medical insurance, is off the charts!       The thought of going back to the days of not having medical       insurance is so frightening to me. It almost feels barbaric,       for lack of a better term, for anyone to be denied the       opportunity to take care of his or her health without the       looming possibility of bankruptcy.    She continues:         It is truly inhumane. I recently moved to Nevada and       enrolled in their exchange. I will require monitoring for the       rest of my life. Now that the ACA is up in the air, I feel       like I am fighting for my life again! Congress is trying to       take away the one thing that continues to guarantee access to       screenings and treatment. Because of my age and my cancer       history, any plan that doesn't have those protections       guarantees that I will be charged more and that I am at risk       for being discriminated against.        Thank you for listening to my story.    Story No 11. Mendy in Virginia says:         My family's whole world was turned upside down in September       2015 when my husband, Ed, survived a massive stroke.        The stroke left Ed severely disabled. He lost the ability       to verbally express himself, needed a wheelchair, and       required help with all basic functions, including bathing and       toileting.        When the stroke hit, Ed was working for an insurance       company and I was a stay-at-home mom. His employer was kind       enough to keep us on their health insurance for as long as       they could. But within a couple of months, it became apparent       that the damage was too severe, and Ed's recovery would take       too long. His employer had no choice but to let Ed go, and       with that, we lost our health insurance.        It was frightening--I knew that Ed needed help and that       COBRA was too expensive at $600 a month. A friend recommended       that we make an appointment with a navigator at the local       health center. I had no idea help like that even existed, but       we walked out of an appointment with a silver plan for $15 a       month. . . . Our son was able to receive coverage through       CHIP.        The insurance is what we can ask for [and it is good]. It       covers Ed's physical therapy . . . our family doctor, his       cardiologist, neurologist, and all of the medications he       needs to make sure he doesn't have another stroke.    Now, you can imagine if they didn't have this coverage, and if he had  another stroke when he is not that old, it would be even more  expensive. Those are my words that I am adding.   She says:         Almost two years after the stroke, Ed can move around with       the help of a cane, but he still needs assistance standing.        What are we going to do if we lose access to insurance?    She continues:         I'm am not being dramatic when I say this is life or death.       My husband will die if we lose access to affordable coverage.        I wish lawmakers--    And I would add in this case, as we know from what was announced last  night, this administration--       could understand that they are cutting our family's lifeline.    Letter No. 12. Celeste and Larry from Michigan say:         My husband and I worked our entire lives. Larry worked as a       stone mason, while I pursued a degree . . . in social work. .       . . We . . . saved for retirement. We built up a great safety       net, but it all got yanked away. We're now 63 and 61, and I       don't know what we are going to do if the Senate takes away--    If this administration takes away, I would add--       our access to Medicaid.        In 2006, Larry was laid off from his job and he struggled       to find another job in light of the Great Recession. It       became really important for me to keep my job so that we       could maintain insurance for both of us.        Within a couple of years, Larry began to experience       problems with his memory, and doctors diagnosed him with       early onset Alzheimer's disease.    As we know, by the way, many millions of Americans are affected by  Alzheimer's--some of them way too early and some of them not expecting  it.  [[Page S2003]]  This can happen to any family--what happened to Celeste and Larry. That  is why taking their word last night and looking at what they have said  they wanted to do, which is to repeal the Affordable Care Act, would  mean that not only do those who buy insurance on the exchange lose out,  but every American loses out who could have a preexisting condition or  who does have a preexisting condition.   So she says this:         He was diagnosed with early onset Alzheimer's.       Unfortunately, because he had been out of work for so long,       he wasn't eligible for disability benefits. I had to leave my       job because I became disabled. We were without any insurance       until the Affordable Care Act marketplaces opened. In order       to get by, we sold our houses, spend down our retirement, and       took drastic measures to pay our medical bills and day-to-day       living expenses. That first year, we bought a plan that cost       us only $27 a month. The next year, we qualified for expanded       Medicaid.        We paid into the system our entire lives. I don't think it       is right that lawmakers are now threatening to take       everything away from us.    She says this:         My parents immigrated to this country. English wasn't their       first language. Four out of five of us kids went to college.       All of the grandchildren went to college. Everyone is doing       well because we worked.        My family has collectively paid into the system more than       enough to cover us, but now they are talking about ripping       away benefits. Where is the justice in that?    She adds this--this woman whose husband has Alzheimer's, who was  protected by the Affordable Care Act. Do you know what she says in this  letter?         We are not losers. We are not freeloaders. We should not       have to be embarrassed or shamed for needing help. There       should be dignity in getting old, and we should be enjoying       our golden years, but that has been taken away from us. Don't       make it worse.    Story No. 13, Mary and Erich:         Let me tell you about my son Erich. He is friendly and       compassionate. When he grows up, he wants to be in a band and       to be a Power Ranger. He loves to dance to videos we find       together on YouTube. His greatest joy comes from being around       his friends at Miracle League Baseball, [and that is a       baseball league for kids with] special needs, where he plays       third base.    Mary writes:         Erich was born with Down syndrome and a severe intellectual       disability. At 20 years old, he functions at roughly the       level of a second grader. While many young adults with Down's       have been able to integrate into society and take on       employment, Erich's disability is so profound that he       requires full-time care, and he will never be able to live       independently.        My husband, Mary writes, died suddenly in 2009. So today,       it is just Erich and me. After my husband's death, I was       forced to close down the business we owned, and we lost       access to traditional insurance. Erich and I were able to get       coverage through Medicaid. It has been a critical lifeline       over these last 9 years, and I don't know what would happen       to either one of us if it were to go away.        Through the services provided by Medicaid and other       supportive programs in our community, I am able to keep Erich       at home where he belongs. He needs Medicare for speech       therapy as he has an enlarged tongue, small mouth, and weak       facial muscles. He has difficulty communicating and saying       words like ``water'' [and] ``phone''. . . . His sentences are       two and three words. Erich is prone to sinus and allergy       infections due to a smaller cartilage in his nose typical of       Down syndrome. He suffers from skin rashes due to the       infections that he gets. He does require many prescriptions       and doctor's visits and occasionally a visit to the emergency       room.        As a boomer generation widow, I need to make sure that I am       healthy enough to show up for him. He has NO ONE else. I       depend on these services, too.        When I hear about potential cuts [to Medicaid, when I hear       about repealing the Affordable Care Act], I think not just       about Erich, but about all his ``special needs'' friends he       has made over the years at the school, at the tutoring       center, and on the baseball field. Cutting or capping       programs like Medicaid will devastate us all. Many of his       friends require more services, are wheelchair bound, have       speech, hearing, heart, and constant ear problems.        As a society, and the greatest country in the world, we       have to continue to support--    In her words--       our ``special people'' and families like ours. These       ``special people'' enrich our lives and show us what is       important . . . caring for each other, compassion, and       friendship.    Story No. 14, Sara in Maryland. She says:         I am a physician, and the ACA allows me to document       [healthcare issues] better and more fully. I no longer need       to worry that if a person is designated as, for example,       having acne and they have a serious condition later, they       will be denied insurance for a preexisting condition.    I thought this story in the letter was interesting because it shows  what the doctors were going through as they were trying to figure out  how they report things so this person isn't denied insurance later  because they have a preexisting condition. Now they don't have to worry  about that anymore, but if the administration wins--if they win in  their action to repeal the Affordable Care Act, like they announced  last night they wanted to do--we would go back to that situation.   Story No. 15, Tracey in Maryland. She says this:         In 2011, I began dialysis due to end-stage kidney disease.       Before dialysis and well into it, I worked as a preschool       teacher, a notoriously low-paying profession. In 2007, when I       changed jobs, I lost my employer-based health insurance.       After 1 year of COBRA, a local insurance person and a good       friend of ours told me about the Maryland State Health       Insurance Plan. Through that plan, I was able to qualify.       When the ACA began, the MSHIP [State] plan ended. In a       meeting with a member of Howard County's Health Department to       figure out how to replace my insurance under the ACA, he told       me that because of my end-stage kidney disease, I probably       would qualify for Medicare. He was right. I also have a       supplemental plan (Care First) and a drug plan [through]       AARP, and my parents help pay the premiums for those. In       2015, I had to stop working because of exhaustion caused by       dialysis. I then qualified for disability. In 2016, I had a       kidney transplant. Medicare will continue to insure me. . . .       Our hope is that by then I will be back to work, but my       biggest concern is that without the ACA, my preexisting       condition will prevent me from finding health insurance.    At the end of her letter, she asks a simple question: ``What will I  do then?'' That is a question that millions and millions of Americans  want to ask the President today. They woke up to read the newspaper or  turn on TV and found out that this administration had announced that  they want to repeal the Affordable Care Act--not part of it, no, no,  the whole thing. So when they do this, this means these protections  aren't in place. So there is a whole ton of people that joined Tracey  in asking: ``What will I do then?''   Story No. 16, Debbie in New Jersey:         I am a 48-year-old woman with chronic health issues that       require me to visit doctors every few weeks and take       prescription medications. I suffer from migraines. . . . I       also have herniated discs in my back. . . . I am self-      employed and run two businesses.    Guess what. That means she is contributing in a big way to our  economy.         I purchase my coverage on the federal ACA exchange. Before       the ACA--    Or as we know it, the Affordable Care Act--       I had nowhere to buy affordable insurance coverage that would       actually cover my health issues. Repealing the ACA will have       a devastating impact on small businesses and the self-      employed, especially those of us with health problems. I am       terrified that I won't be able to afford coverage as I inch       closer to the 50-64 age bracket. And if the ACA is repealed       and if there is no marketplace for me to purchase insurance,       I will be forced to close my businesses.    Story No. 17, Stephanie in Massachusetts:         I was born with hip dysplasia. I had surgery to correct it       at 9 months old. At best, the issue was corrected to 85       percent of what a normal hip will do. In college . . . I had       hip pain. I underwent four separate surgeries to fix       cartilage. That meant four sets of pre-op AND post-op MRIs or       other scans and four sets of post-op hospital stays.        In just 27 years, my family and I racked up hundreds of       thousands of dollars in medical bills. In recent years,       insurance covered . . . [me].        I'm honestly not sure what repeal of the ACA means for me,       but I guarantee it'll make life harder as it will for a lot       of people. I was lucky to have insurance.        Please vote no on any bill that repeals the ACA. Save my       care.    As for this story, even though she didn't know quite how it would  affect her, I can tell you that with hip dysplasia, something I have,  she has a preexisting condition, and that would mean that she couldn't  qualify for insurance, especially when it came to further hip  surgeries.   No. 18, Tegan in Ohio:         It would put me at risk of losing coverage [if you repeal]       because of a genetic pre-existing condition. Congenital       dilated cardiomyopathy killed my grandfather, nearly killed       my aunt, killed my sister, and nearly killed my brother. When       my brother, a 12 year old at the time, needed a heart       transplant, doctors told our parents that the insurance could       simply decide to not cover the procedure. They had buried a       toddler just 4 years earlier, and they were faced with the       possibility of losing another child.    Tegan writes:         We need to ensure that all Americans have access to care.       You can't predict when you  [[Page S2004]]       will get sick or injured, and you can't predict when a       dangerous genetic mutation may emerge in your family. How we       treat our fellow Americans is a measure of who we are as a       people.    That is a good one to send to the White House tonight.   No. 19, Shirley in Massachusetts. She writes:         My second daughter was born with liver disease, which was       diagnosed 9 weeks after her birth and required surgeries and       medications. Pediatricians, cancer specialists, heart       doctors, and family physicians all agree that . . .       [healthcare suggested changes that would repeal the       Affordable Care Act] will make things worse, not better.    No. 20, Sheila in Illinois:         The ACA allowed us to start a new business, in spite of the       fact that my husband was diagnosed in 1992 with hepatitis C       after receiving a tainted blood transfusion in the `70s. We       became, in her words, job creators because we were finally       able to get coverage for him outside of employer provided       coverage.    She says:         I have been self-employed for 28 years but have gotten a       job because at age 61, the fear of losing affordable       healthcare at my age could ruin our finances.    No. 21, Carter, 22 months. This is written by his family.         Meet Carter. He loves cars, swimming, and building blocks.       He requires therapy (speech, occupational, and physical),       orthotics . . . glasses, and nebulizer machine. He sees an       infectious disease, pulmonologist, and neurologist. His       disease is progressive . . . [he needs healthcare].    Story No. 22, Myka, age 7:         Myka is 7 years old. She loves the Girl Scouts, ice       skating, and playing with her friends. Myka was born with a       congenital heart defect. What does access to affordable       quality healthcare mean? It means Myka is still alive.    No. 23, Leonore in New York. She writes:         I have Parkinson's, and I have had it for 18 years and have       Medicare disability since 2008. I am 62, and the ACA allows       me to have a preexisting condition and . . . [still get       help].    She talks about her son, who is 24 years old and disabled and says:         We'd both be in terrible trouble if we lost our coverage.    No. 24, Joanna:         My name is Joanna. I am here to share the story of my       daughter Jasmine. . . . I will start at the beginning of her       life, 3 years ago, when she was . . . inside my belly.        I was four months pregnant . . . when I received the most       devastating and heart wrenching news. . . . I was told that       my precious little . . . [baby had a heart problem]. I was       told she had one of the most complex and deadly conditions       around.        I was told she would have half a heart with many of her       organs flipped.    But she was given options.         I prayed for a decision. I was quickly reminded of the       recent Obamacare legislation that would give Jasmine a chance       at life. One that is hopeful and compassionate, that protects       innocent children like Jasmine from being denied medical care       due to preexisting heart conditions, one that refuses to put       a dollar sign on her life by imposing lifetime caps, and one       that would ensure essential healthcare benefits to keep her       alive.    She was born, and she had the surgery. She says:         Thank goodness for Essential Health Benefits that allowed       me to receive proper maternity care when Jasmine was in the       womb . . . and emergency services.        I am sharing my story today as a plea to not steal these       lifetime protections away from Jasmine. . . . Please do not       tell my child and children like her that they are too       expensive, not worthy of life any longer. Please know, this       is a life and death fight for me and my daughter, and I will       do everything in my power to protect her and to stand up for       whatever is needed to keep her alive.    No. 25, Kendall in Oklahoma.         The moment I finally realized what it meant to be poor and       sick in America, I was sitting by myself in the cancer center       an hour from my home. I had arrived early for my infusion       that day, checked in and gotten that day's hospital bracelet.       Before I could be hooked up to an I.V., I was pulled into a       side room and told my insurance had denied my claim.    That is the story, and that is what is going to happen over and over  again if we go back to those old days before we had the Affordable Care  Act.   No. 26, Jennifer.         My husband Chris is one of many ACA success stories in red       state Oklahoma. In January 2006, at age 29 at the time, Chris       began working for a nonprofit that offered healthcare       benefits after a certain period of employment. A few months       later, we went to the ER thinking he had appendicitis.       Doctors quickly took him to surgery thinking the same. After       several hours, the surgeon (accompanied by a chaplain) said       he removed a large tumor from Chris' colon. He was on the       brink of death with a rare aggressive form of colon cancer.       Removing the tumor increased his chances for survival but the       cancer was far too advanced for traditional chemotherapy. The       only course of action at that point was to see an oncologist       every month for CEA labs and a colonoscopy every 6 months       until the oncologist determined he was out of danger for       recurrence. We crossed our fingers and hoped for the best.        Between 2006 and 2009, Chris tried to get health insurance       but [was] rejected due to cancer diagnosis being a       preexisting condition. Once the ACA became law, because of       its protections for people with preexisting conditions, my       husband was able to purchase a [healthcare] policy through       the federal exchange and continue seeing an oncologist for       needed care.        Miraculously, Chris has not had a recurrence--so far.       Without ACA protections for preexisting conditions, my       husband will be forced [and] (priced) out of the market.       Given the high probability for recurrence and increased costs       impeding an early diagnosis of recurrence, survival is less       likely for my husband. I cannot bear the thought of losing my       love, my best friend . . . my hero.    Story No. 27 is from Texas. His name is Mike. All he says is this:         My wife and I are uninsurable without the ACA. I take life-      saving medications.    Think of how many people just write those simple words.   No. 28, Amanda in Texas.         My son, Cooper, is 3 years old. We found out he has cystic       fibrosis when I was 14 weeks pregnant. Though he has been       very healthy for a child with CF, literally a simple cold       could change that. He will always have CF, and both       preexisting conditions and lifetime maximums keep us up at       night. Just being insured won't mean anything if there is a       lifetime maximum. By the time he reaches grade school, he       will likely have exceeded the typical ``million dollar       maximum'' we dread so much. Please keep our boy healthy.    She pleads not to repeal the Affordable Care Act.   No. 29, Adele in Massachusetts.         I was diagnosed with epilepsy at 18 years old. Beforehand,       I was dealing with chronic depression which required high       doses of antidepressants. . . . My mother is a single parent       and I am currently 22, so we try our best to be able to       afford our medications. . . . If the ACA [is repealed] it is       possible that we will no longer be able to afford our       medicines and that I could fall into a deep depression. . . .       If the ACA repeal is passed I will no longer be proud to be       an American.    No. 30, Helen in North Carolina.         Insuring me through COBRA when my husband retired would       have cost us a full third of our small, fixed income. The ACA       provided [us] not only assured access to health insurance for       me, but insurance with a premium and an out-of-pocket maximum       that fits [with] our budget.    So many of these stories involve people trying to fit their budget  with healthcare.   She writes:         That insurance allows me to continue my treatments for my       illnesses. Without my medications, I will be in extreme pain,       will have more joints eroding to the point of being       nonfunctional, and will be landing in a hospital multiple       times a year. . . . Without the tax subsidy I get through the       ACA, my insurance premiums plus the max for my current plan       would cost 80% of our income.    No. 31, Jennifer in Arizona.         I am an attorney and have been employed full-time since       graduating law school in 2006. I take care of myself, make       healthy choices, and work hard. I have encountered multiple       medical challenges in the last 15 years. I was diagnosed       with thyroid cancer in my first semester of law school and       had surgery to remove my thyroid over Christmas break that       year. The surgery damaged my [parathyroid] glands which       produce a hormone that helps the body process calcium. I       have to take replacement thyroid hormone, activated       Vitamin D, and calcium supplements to stay healthy. Over       the last 15 years my prescription costs have gone up from       $30 a month to about $110 a month.        In 2012, I had an unexplained placental abruption with my       first pregnancy and delivered my son 9 weeks early. He spent       5 weeks in [intensive care] learning to eat and breathe.        Last year, my son tripped over his Pull-up and broke his       femur. He was placed in a full-body cast for almost 8 weeks.        We [have good jobs] with good employer health coverage.    But here is the problem. Because of her problems with her thyroid,  she would have a preexisting condition. They would not get health  insurance.         We are working on continuing to be contributing members of       society, investing our savings . . . [and making sure we       participate] in the economy in every way.    No. 32, Debra in Illinois.         Our older daughter is severely disabled.    By the way, anyone who dealt with the past attempts to repeal the  Affordable Care Act knows that the disability  [[Page S2005]]  community was mobilized as never before. Because they, of anyone, the  families of people with kids with disabilities, understand more than  anyone how important this preexisting protection is.   Yet, last night, without regard to them, without regard to anyone in  America with a preexisting condition, the administration just announced  they are going all out to repeal these protections in the Affordable  Care Act.   That is what happened.   Debra from Illinois.         Our older daughter is severely disabled. Essentially a       preexisting condition since birth. In 2014 I underwent       treatment for Stage 3 . . . breast cancer. I was horrified.       Then I pulled myself together. If I can survive cancer, I can       survive [this].    But without healthcare, we can't survive.   No. 33, Felicia in Texas.         I have struggled with chronic pain for over 20 years. For       years I've gone to specialist after specialist, and pain       clinic after pain clinic. No one could tell me why regular       approaches to joint and tendon pain never worked for me.        Just last year I was finally diagnosed with . . . a genetic       . . . connective tissue disorder.    She goes through and describes what this means to her: There is no  cure for my chronic condition, only pain management.         Because these conditions are rare, [these physicians don't       know] how to help me.    She says she depends on healthcare specialists. She says she needs  the affordable healthcare act because of the preexisting condition  protection. I believe her.   No. 34, Janet in Illinois.         I have a son who survived cancer and a daughter with       Crohn's disease. My daughter's husband has Cystic Fibrosis.    Repeal of the ACA would change everything.         Let them stay healthy.    No. 35, Elizabeth in Illinois.         I am lucky (for now), in that I have coverage through my       employer. That said, even I could be impacted if lifetime and       annual benefits caps are put back in place. I have two family       members undergoing cancer treatment right now, what happens       to them? What if one of my children is diagnosed with a . . .       disease like my best friend's 5-year-old daughter was?    No. 36, Patricia in Illinois.         I have a preexisting condition as I have Multiple       Sclerosis. My treatment includes MRI's yearly and medications       that cost nearly 60,000 dollars yearly. I am now in Medicare       and Medicaid and would be left with no options as I am on       disability and could afford no insurance.    No. 37, Noel in Maryland.         I will soon be 26 and off my parents' health insurance, and       it is thanks to Obamacare that I have been able to stay on       that insurance while I have been struggling with a chronic       disease. . . . I have made great strides in recovering my       health . . . should not be punished for having a preexisting       condition.    No. 38, Megan in Texas.         My dearest friend recently donated her kidney to a two year       old child who was on dialysis, and saved his life. At the       time of her donation, Obama was President and preexisting       conditions seemed protected, and she didn't question such a       transformative medical procedure. Pre-existing Condition       coverage must remain in order to protect living organ donors       and encourage people to save lives by donating. Who would       donate an organ if they knew insurers could charge them or       not accept them? We must protect this important provision!    No. 39, Jeffery in Illinois.         I have MS. . . . Every 48 hours I inject myself with       prescription medication to prevent the disease from       advancing.        If the ACA was repealed, I would not have protection, and       MS would, of course, be considered a preexisting condition.        The ACA has allowed me to remain a productive wage earner       supporting myself and my family.    How many times do you hear this?         Please consider the personal and societal costs of       repealing the ACA.    No. 40, Lauren in California.         When I was a freshman in college, I donated blood to the       Red Cross. A couple of weeks later, a letter from the Red       Cross informed me that I had Hepatitis C--I was 18, living       away from home (clear across the country) for the first time,       and I had no idea what to do or how I might have contracted       the virus. After a year it was determined the diagnosis was a       false-positive . . . but every blood test since has indicated       liver enzyme levels outside of normal, which means Hepatitis       C will be a pre-existing condition that follows me around for       the rest of my life. I just earned my PhD and I'm still       looking for my first postdoctoral job, which means I'll need       health care coverage until I am insured by an employer. . . .       I'm screwed [if I don't have the ACA]. I've worked hard to       make good choices for my health, but now an administrative       mistake that I have no control over--    That was the information she received when she gave blood--       has the potential to wreck my chances for affordable health       insurance [if the ACA protections aren't in place].    No. 41, Koula in Texas.         I have high blood pressure & pre-diabetic. I am retired and       currently I'm covered under my employers plan as a retiree (I       pay premiums at twice what an active employee pays) until the       age of 65 then I switch to Medicare and my employer insurance       will become secondary. If you cut the requirements that       corporations offer to their employees and retirees I will be       greatly affected as I'm living on a fixed income. My       condition is heredity and no amount of exercise or dieting       will ever bring down my blood pressure enough for it to be       normal. . . .    No. 42, Joy in Texas writes:         I would be dead and/or bankrupt without ACA coverage.       Within 6 weeks of moving to Austin from New York City in       2012, I was diagnosed with stomach cancer; I had had breast       cancer . . . I came with insurance associated with my       business, a plan unavailable in Texas. When that expired, I       was kind of stunned to discover I was uninsurable. . . . For       the next 6 months, I was in the state pool and basically       self-insured until the ACA became effective. . . . Although       not perfect, it provided the coverage I needed at a price       point I could afford.    No. 43, Liz writes:         I wish the ACA had been around 10 years ago. Back then I       was almost 30 years into a happy and successful teaching       career. . . . But then along came that little glitch in the       economy, and schools were tightening belts. I found myself       unemployed, uninsured, and living with a pre-existing       condition requiring very expensive, but life extending       medications. Worse, I was living in a country where health       care is tied to one's job status.        Jobs were scarce, and age was not on my side in a tight job       market. So I worked in daycare centers, and did babysitting.       My Cobra ran out. Private insurance was totally out of reach.        Ultimately I had just one option left: I was just old       enough to retire early as a teacher and to qualify for       retired teacher benefits with TRS. It was a last resort. . .       . By law, I would no longer be eligible to teach. . . .       Without the ACA, I had to choose between my job and my life.    No. 44, Jerry writes:         Fifteen years ago I was self-employed and working furiously       to get a new company off the ground. Things were going fine       until I ran up against a brick wall--health insurance. My       wife and I had been happily paying for health coverage       through my previous employer via COBRA, but then we       approached the time limit allowed under that coverage. It was       impossible for us to buy a policy on the individual market       for two reasons: my wife had not only been recently treated       for cervical cancer, but she was also pregnant with our first       child.    He says:         Protect our care. Entrepreneurial and creative Americans       deserve the freedom to chase our dreams without having to       risk financial ruin by being denied access to comprehensive .       . . healthcare. Isn't that risk-taking spirit . . . what . .       . [people say] . . . is needed to build our economy ever       higher?    No. 45, Lisa writes:         No healthcare coverage for my chronic illness will result       in my death [because of the ACA.]    No. 46, Hannah writes:         My spouse is a research scientist. Some years ago, while       working at the University of Texas, he received a highly       prestigious national research fellowship. The fellowship made       him ineligible for employee health insurance. . . . Due to a       preexisting condition he contracted as a teenager, however,       he was denied affordable insurance. . . . We oppose the       repeal of the ACA because the denial of healthcare to       individuals based on their employment status, their economic       status, or their health conditions is deeply unethical and       ultimately deadly.    No. 47, Jaime writes:         I am a 62-year old and am currently in the hospital       awaiting open heart surgery. I am only able to have this       surgery due to being in ObamaCare.    No. 48, Devora in Maryland writes:         My daughter Esther was diagnosed with Leukemia when she was       12. She would not be able to get health insurance under the       proposed bill. She has been through enough.    That is what a lot of people in America would say right now to the  Trump administration. They have been through enough because of their  health problems and because they have worked hard, and they deserve to  be carried. They have been through enough because they have had that  healthcare threatened over and over. They voted in 2018 because they  wanted to have their healthcare protected.   Yet now, last night, the administration--not listening to that-- announced  [[Page S2006]]  they would repeal the entire Affordable Care Act.   No. 49, Darla in Michigan writes:         I'm on disability from chronic pain because of a doctor's       mistake with back surgery. I am going to have my fifth back       surgery. I live alone and am on disability. I already pay       huge premiums.    She says: If you repeal the Affordable Care Act, ``I will be  homeless.''   No. 50. Nathan in Michigan writes:         I am a builder who builds and maintains homes for many of       the wealthiest people in our State. I have worked hard and       climbed my way to the top over the last 20 years. None of the       employers in my area offered insurance, and only until the       ACA was I able to afford the healthcare I need. I have severe       asthma and have arthritis in my right hip. Even with the ACA,       we still struggle to pay my medical bills, but we manage.    He says:         Now, we are worried that . . . [if we lose the ACA] I could       be priced right out by being put in a high-risk pool because       I have preexisting conditions. I am making top dollar working       for the people who are going to reap the profits. . . .    He finishes by saying: This is taking away my ability to do the work  on their houses.   No. 51, Ellen in New York writes:         My husband has been disabled from a stroke for almost 20       years and unable to work. I am a licensed clinical social       worker within busy Private Practice doing counseling with       individuals, couples, and families. If Mental Health Services       are dropped . . . I will not be able to support my family.        My husband and I are both seniors and anticipate insurance       premium rates going up. . . . [if we don't have the       Affordable Care Act]. . . . we both have preexisting       conditions.    Erika in Washington writes:         I have triplet sons, each of which have all had a form of       healthcare issues that would be deemed under this plan to now       be pre-existing conditions.        I can't fathom the thought that another woman or a mom       would not be alive or her children would not receive the same       care we have. I will stand against anyone who threatens my       children's future access to health. I don't know a single       mother who won't be right there alongside me.    Well, I think they are going to have to go to the White House now  because we just heard last night that they want to repeal the entire  Affordable Care Act.   No. 53, Marcy writes:         I'm in fairly good physical health, but mental health has       been a lifelong struggle for me. I take medication and have       turned to therapists . . . several times over the years. I do       my best to stay mentally healthy. But there have been many       times when I needed help. . . . I believe everyone should       have access to mental healthcare. It's not something you       should choose as part of your health care plan or not.        We ALL need full, comprehensive, excellent healthcare       coverage. Essential coverage for mental health, maternity       care, well care check-ups, medication, etc. is important for       EVERYONE.    No. 54, Samantha in Massachusetts writes:         My husband has a genetic kidney disorder . . . and at the       age of 47, needed a kidney transplant. He is now, thanks to       the miracles of modern medicine and the incredible generosity       of his donor, back at work, paying taxes, and living a good       life. The transplant took place one week before the last       election, and the last thing we did before the surgery was       vote early--in large part to try to stave off the repeal of       the ACA. My husband's prospects are very good. . . . The       financial implications to both my family and the kidney       donors are impossible to predict or calculate, but the cost       of losing ObamaCare would be steep, terrifying, and entirely       un-American.    No. 55, Amal in Tennessee writes:         I feel ridiculously lucky that the ACA existed when I had       my baby, and here's why: My husband and I were both       freelancers when I got pregnant and were on ObamaCare in New       York. When I was 5 months pregnant, we moved to Nashville for       his job, which didn't provide insurance. Because of the ACA,       we were able to buy coverage, even though somehow pregnancy       is considered a preexisting condition. It could once again       become the basis for an insurance company to reject you or to       increase your premiums if the ACA is repealed.        Denying a pregnant woman insurance coverage can have far-      reaching effects. She might stay in an unhealthy job to       maintain coverage, or stay in an unhealthy or abusive       marriage to maintain her husband's coverage. A family might       forego a good opportunity to move for a better life for their       child. . . .    No. 56, Matthew in Washington writes:         I was diagnosed with a chronic medical condition when I was       9. Growing up, I was fortunate to have a mother who was able       to fight for me, from keeping me enrolled in a public school       to getting me access to experimental drugs at any of trials.       . . . But I also saw her in tears over medical bills when my       father was laid off after 9/11 and we had to go on COBRA, and       how draining negotiations with insurance companies were.        I am now successful, independent, and working in       international relations in Washington, D.C., which I love. If       the ACA is repealed, I will live in constant fear of being       laid off or fired and losing my insurance, or worry that I       will have a flare-up that would devastate me financially.    No. 57, Page writes:         I was fired in 2015 when I was 5 weeks pregnant. Thank       goodness we had the Affordable Care Act because I could not       be discriminated against under any preexisting condition       limitations. I knew my maternity care would be covered. I       logged onto the exchange, compared plans, [and] signed up . .       . I'm just so grateful that happened for me.    No. 58, Kelsey writes:         My brother has Type 1 diabetes and prior to the ACA, he was       covered on my parents' insurance, but I don't know what's       going to happen to him [when we don't have the ACA, if they       took it away.]    No. 59. Macon writes:         I'm a member of a union that takes care of me, but a lot of       people are not that fortunate and I'm scared for them. I have       family members with preexisting conditions, and by every       accounting, this bill, if it passes, is going to take       coverage away from people who are vulnerable. . . .    No. 60, Samantha writes:         I'm fighting the repeal of the ACA because my father has a       preexisting condition and he's hoping to retire in the next       few years. I don't believe plans should be changed because of       a bill that would remove protections for people with       preexisting conditions. . . .    No. 61, Golchin from Nevada writes:         It will be really hard for us to get insurance since I will       be [considered having a preexisting condition]. . . . We       would love to start our family. . . . Having kids is all we       talk about, so please don't take that away from many of us.    No. 62, Cathy writes:         ObamaCare saved my life. I had health insurance. I needed       brain surgery. My health insurance company kept delaying       approvals. . . . Because they refused to pay for a CT scan       that was needed to confirm a diagnosis, I had to pay for one       out of pocket. . . . But, because of the public pressure,       when ObamaCare was being drafted, my surgery was eventually       approved by the insurance company in 2009.        I am deeply concerned that legislation repealing ObamaCare       could leave in place devastating and historic cuts to my       hospital. Please do not gut protections for those of us with       preexisting conditions. . . . Do not eliminate services for       special needs kids.    No. 63, Jennifer in Nevada writes:         If the ACA is repealed, my healthcare might go away and I       could never afford continuing care with my . . . [heart       condition] . . . and my husband's arthritic condition. When       my battery runs out in four years, if I don't have health       insurance, I'll probably die or have to go bankrupt. . . . My       brother also has heart trouble. . . . And for what? So that       the wealthy can have more . . . ? Our government is supposed       to work for our best interests. . . .    No. 64, Adrian writes:         In 1986 to 1987, I was diagnosed with [genetic] breast       cancer and was told I had a 25 percent chance of living 5       years. I quit my job to have medical treatment, and, after       COBRA coverage ran out, was put in a high-risk pool       (Illinois). My insurance payments were high . . . I had to go       back to work to pay for . . . [them]. If that's what happened       30 years ago . . . [what would happen now if I had a       preexisting condition and couldn't get insurance coverage]?    No. 65, Michelle writes:         I have had three surgeries for the ``chronic disease''. . .       . Prior to ACA, these surgeries would not have been covered.       . . .    No. 66, Elizabeth writes:         Please do not allow States the ability to opt out of       holding insurances companies accountable to cover essential       health benefits like maternity care, mental health treatment,       and rehabilitation treatment. As an elementary public art       educator, I know firsthand the importance of [the] mental       health care [provision]. The school district I serve . . .       has suffered the loss of four students who have taken their       own lives just this year to battles with mental and emotional       issues, the youngest of whom was 12 years old and a former       student of mine from the first year I taught. . . . These       saddening and possibly preventable deaths have rocked our       community. Coverage for mental health and treatment will       allow parents the ability to seek help for their children       whose precious lives hang in the balance in the politics       of healthcare. Affordable care helps destigmatize mental       and emotional illnesses, giving these students the       confidence and ability to speak up.    People have long stories, and they care about this a lot.   Story No. 67, Karen:         My friend Mary was never able to purchase health insurance       until ObamaCare passed. She bought a policy the very first       day it was available to her. A few months later, she was  [[Page S2007]]       driving, and she was almost killed. She required prolonged       care and rehab, which would not have been available to her       before she had health insurance. Through good care, hard       work, and persistence, she is alive and again a productive       member of society. Please do not take healthcare away from       people like my friend Mary.    No. 68, JoSelle in Florida:         I am self-employed as a freelance editor and writer and       have been for most of my post-college life. Unfortunately, I       also have preexisting conditions.        Pre-ACA, I was ineligible for insurance despite taking some       of the cheapest, most common medications on the marketplace.       I was forced into a high-risk pool in the State where I lived       at the time, Utah, which placed an enormous financial burden       on me. . . . Post 2014, I can afford to pay for my insurance.        Of course, the ACA isn't perfect. I am sympathetic to those       who faced premium increases under it or who found their       access to healthcare diminished. However, the logical thing       to do is to improve it, not demolish it.    That is a pretty good line. Send that one to the Justice Department.         I urge all people reading this to stop and think. Whether       you voted for Clinton or Trump, whether you preferred one of       their primary challengers to either of them, whether you live       in a red, purple, or blue State . . . it does not do to not       have the Affordable Care Act.    No. 69, Kat in Kansas:         I had advanced stage 3 breast cancer and inflammatory       breast cancer. I am now on disability. Contrary to what many       have said, I did nothing to bring this on myself. I ate right       and exercised. I didn't smoke. My cancer was genetic. So was       the heart problem I had. I did not ask for this. Disability       is no picnic. I can barely make ends meet. If the ACA is       repealed, I will be homeless at the best and, at worst, dead.    No. 70, Lois in New York:         Breast cancer runs throughout my family on both my parents'       sides. My mother, aunt, and cousins have all had this       disease. Some have died from it, including my mom. When I was       23, I had a lump removed. Luckily, it was benign. The       anxiety, pain of discovery, and treatment are excruciating       enough without having to worry if you can afford care.    No. 71, Penny in New York:         My son has a life-threatening preexisting condition for       which he received medical treatment and medication through       the ACA expansion of Medicaid in the State where he lives.       Without this, he will be unable to pay for his medications       and doctors' visits and will surely decline. Both my mother       and my husband's father were able to be cared for in nursing       homes, until their dying days, because of Medicaid. I am       desperate to make sure we keep our healthcare.        Thank you for listening.    No. 72, Jen:         In 2015, I donated a kidney to a stranger, kicking off a       chain of three transplants. I didn't have to worry about how       it would affect my health insurance because, thanks to the       ACA, I could never be charged more or be denied coverage       because I shared my spare kidney. I am 55 years old and self-      employed. This repeal will be a direct attack on my financial       and health security.    No. 73, Jolene:         I know many of my friends rely on Medicaid. Losing it means       the loss of their lives. They cannot afford their medications       without the ACA.    No. 74, Deborah:         My family's story is over, but I want people to know how       much the ACA meant to us at a very difficult time. Our niece,       a single adult, lost her job and her insurance coverage when       she was in the middle of the fight for her life, battling       advanced melanoma. Because of the ACA, she was able to sign       up for insurance on the marketplace. I will be very honest       and say it wasn't easy, and she was forced to change       insurance companies because of changes in available plans.       However--and this is big--  she writes in capital letters, sort of similar to the President's  tweets--       she was able to get coverage despite the fact that she was       very ill. Anyone who has watched a loved one suffer from this       devastating disease of melanoma knows how terrible it is.       Even though she eventually succumbed to the melanoma that had       spread throughout her body, she was able to have continued       quality medical care and, eventually, hospice care until her       death. I beg you to consider how your decisions will impact       people. Even the least of those among us--    That was a quote she put--       deserve the dignity of receiving quality medical care.    Think about this. This is a story of someone whom she lost in her  family, and she is making a point that, I think, many would make in  this Nation. Even when people are going to die, they want to have them  die peacefully. They want them to have good healthcare. They don't want  to have them taken off of their insurance because of preexisting  conditions.   Story No. 75 talks about how a financial burden in the early 2000s  forced him into bankruptcy. The reduction of work hours and required  continuing medical costs left him unable to afford healthcare.         Now, with the potential loss of affordable healthcare on       the horizon, my wife is facing a similar situation with her       preexisting condition.    He writes:         Anyone is one step away from a financial disaster due to       the onset of a serious medical condition. Believe me, I lived       it first hand, and I didn't see it coming. I think most       people who get suddenly sick would say the same thing. They       have gone through their lives. They are working hard. They       didn't see it coming. That is why we need the protections of       the Affordable Care Act.    No. 76, Jackson:         Most of the people in my family are likely to lose coverage       without anything less than the protections established in the       ACA. Any one of us without the ACA would be one car accident       or illness away from bankruptcy.    That kind of says it all.   No. 77, Allison in Utah:         My husband and I are self-employed, so we buy our insurance       on the open market. Although we were much healthier than some       people when we applied for insurance prior to the ACA, we       were both rated out because of preexisting conditions. I was       even rejected by one company. This seemed ridiculous since       the preexisting conditions that caused the rate increases       were injuries from being active and were both completely       resolved. This made our insurance astronomically expensive.        When I say we are healthy, we really are healthy. We are       lean; we are trim; we are in our mid forties; but we can run,       hike, climb, and do more pushups than most people in their       mid-20s. We eat healthy, exercise hard, and never get sick.       At the most, we might catch one cold a year between the both       of us.        Since the ACA, we have had no problem getting health       insurance, and we are not rated out because of preexisting       conditions, but the best part is we feel comfortable that we       have health insurance. Now it sounds like people are scheming       to take away the protection we enjoy under the ACA.    OK. They are not just scheming. They actually announced last night to  the entire country that they were going to do this. People woke up.  They watched the TV. They looked at their newspapers. The  administration said, yes, it is not going to repeal just part of the  ACA; it is going to repeal the whole ACA.   It goes on to read:         We are against their attempt to take away the mandate that       prohibits insurance companies from discriminating against       individuals with preexisting conditions.    No. 78, Erin in Missouri:         Ours is a story of a genetic mutation that none of us could       fathom would bring incredible health challenges to our       family. We are the lucky few that have jobs that provide us       with insurance. My grandfather's sister was the first to be       diagnosed with breast cancer. My mother's cousin and her       sister were next. Then my mom was diagnosed with uterine       cancer. Then I came along at 32 with the diagnosis and then       my sister. Now, as I type this note, my 78-year-old mother       awaits another radiology appointment.        This story is filled with heartbreak and much love. These       are the things patients should have to worry about, not       whether they can afford their care or be discriminated       against because they carry a gene that is beyond their       control.    No. 79, Mary in Massachusetts:         We have MassHealth and great hospitals. Without both of       these, my daughter would have died at birth. Everyone, no       matter their income, deserves proper access to healthcare       even if you have a preexisting condition or a previous       illness. Every time I look at my daughter, it affirms this.    No. 80, Brent:         When I graduated high school, my dad informed me that he       had paid enough for my health insurance, and now that I was       an adult, he wasn't going to pay for it anymore. That's it.       That was the entire conversation. I had no idea how to get       health insurance for myself, much less how to pay for it, so       I just went without for 7 years. Within that time, I had       health problems.        My sister lives in France.    He talks about her getting protections.         Instead of being punished, we should be able to have       healthcare. This is no way to run a democracy. This is no way       to be a decent human.    No. 81, Tina in Texas:         I have stage 4 colon cancer, and I am currently on private       insurance. I will be forced on to Medicare in another year as       I am currently on disability. My life span is at risk if the       provision to cover preexisting conditions is abandoned. I       have literally risked my life in order to participate in a       phase 1 drug trial to help advance our knowledge of treating       cancer. How good is that knowledge if we will not be covered?    No. 82, Julia:         I am a 29-year-old adult who was diagnosed with a syndrome       at age 9, and all through  [[Page S2008]]       most of my life, I have had no real help besides my mom, but       she is a single mom. There is not just me but my brothers and       sisters as well as there is only so much one person can do.    She writes:         Help me.    No. 83, Nicole in Kansas:         I am writing on behalf of my 15-month-old daughter, Mira. I       experienced a normal pregnancy, a normal birth, and a normal       maternity leave, but around the 4-month mark, we learned that       Mira had a neurological disability that may very well render       her unable to walk or talk. I could not return to work for a       year while I was acting as her mom.        The ACA is the only thing that kept our family afloat in       the most difficult year of our lives. If the ACA is repealed,       Mira, who has absolutely no control over the state of her       health--  a 15-month-old kid--       she will suffer needlessly. Please help us.    No. 84, Jane:         I am a psychologist with a Ph.D., employed for the past 30       years in community mental health centers. I have a serious       preexisting condition that made me completely uninsurable       before the ACA. Access to healthcare matters.    No. 85:         Because the ACA mandates access to free mammograms, I got       one this year that resulted in a breast cancer diagnosis.       Because the ACA mandates coverage for genetic testing, I was       able to have that done and found out I have a gene that means       I am at risk for cancer. My risk of ovarian cancer was 60       percent. My risk of breast cancer recurrence was 70 percent.       I get to ensure that won't happen to me. Yes, early menopause       and a mastectomy suck, but they are a whole lot better than       radiation, chemo, and possibly death.    No. 86, Ashley:         In 2012, at the age of 29, I had my first job and was       diagnosed with a heart disease. This is a pregnancy-induced       form of heart failure that occurs in women with no prior       history of heart disease. My recovery has been a long and       brutal one of heart disease. I was on a life vest--a portable       defibrillator--for the first month, and I should have been on       it longer. I will always have a preexisting condition. The       ACA makes me safe.    No. 87, Lea:         I am a wife, mother, grandmother, sister, aunt, and great       aunt. In my family, my husband and I owned a small business       and couldn't change health insurance because of a preexisting       condition in one of my children. As a sister, I watched my       older sister fight cancer while still working 12-hour shifts       as an RN. As a great aunt, I have watched my niece handle two       sons with medical conditions. These people deserve the health       insurance that does not have any lifetime maximums, and they       should be able to pay reasonable premiums.    No. 88, Hillary from New York City and Kansas.         Although I live in New York now, Kansas City is home. I was       raised in KC, attended Shawnee Mission Schools and KU. My       friends, family, and a piece of my heart remain there. I was       born with spina bifida, so I have always had a preexisting       medical condition. I need affordable healthcare.    No. 89.         Eleven years ago, I had just turned 23.    She talks about her pregnancy, how she needed the protection, and how  the Affordable Care Act--now that she has a preexisting condition and  has a photography business and her husband's work insurance doesn't  cover her, ACA has saved her and allowed her to work, and she has a  beautiful baby.   No. 90, Laura.         My son Danny was born at 30 weeks gestation via emergency       C-section. He was diagnosed with spastic cerebral palsy at       the age of 1. Without the protections of the ACA, we would       not have him. Now we don't have to worry about lifetime       limits, preexisting conditions, and the security of knowing       we could keep him on our insurance until he is 26.    No. 91, Kerry.         My initial surgery, a bulging disk, happened when I was 17       and a senior in high school. When I was 18, the disk       herniated. I had back surgery at 19, and then I felt like a       new person. No more crawling to the bathroom every morning,       no more chronic pain. In June 2003, I was days away from       being kicked off my parents' insurance when I reinjured my       back.    Then she talks about how, later, the ACA helped her.   Now I am going to finish up with letters from my own State.   No. 92, Kayla from Belgrade. Kayla lost her child to cancer and wrote  to me that if protections for preexisting conditions are taken away,  more families will suffer similar heartbreak.   No. 93, Katie. Katie told me that without protections for individuals  with preexisting conditions, she would not have been able to have  gotten her diagnosis and beat cancer.   No. 94, Tony. Tony is afraid that without the protections provided by  the Affordable Care Act, he will be unable to afford healthcare or be  denied coverage because of his preexisting condition.   No. 95, Alison. A nurse named Alison from Minnesota is concerned that  changes to the health law could make the homeless populations she works  with even more vulnerable.   No. 96, Julie. Julie is concerned for her young son, Hudson, who has  asthma and a rare food allergy. Without protections for individuals  with preexisting conditions, Julie believes Hudson will be forced into  a plan that will dramatically reduce his access to healthcare or,  worse, prevent him from getting health insurance to begin with.   No. 97, Sarah. Sarah was diagnosed with stage IV colon cancer when  she was 34 and has undergone countless rounds of chemo. She fears what  the ``scarlet letter'' of having a preexisting condition will mean for  her access to care and wonders how she will be able to receive the most  cutting-edge treatments.   No. 98, Kate. I remember Kate. Kate did a video, and she became  famous. She wrote to me about her son, Cooper, who has severe,  nonverbal autism. Because of Medicaid, Cooper has access to the care he  needs, and Kate can keep her job. Why were they famous? Cooper was  featured on Jimmy Fallon and the ``Today'' show for being the cutest  toddler to say ``mama.'' He started a contest, and his mom Kate decided  to enter herself and her son saying ``mama.'' Cooper can't speak, but  he uses a speech device to help him communicate. She sent in her video,  that was the one they picked, and Cooper became a star.   Kate is afraid that changes to Medicaid could force her to quit her  job in order to take care of Cooper. How could she explain that to her  sons?   This is another story of someone who has a family member--in this  case, her beloved son--with a disability that would then be considered  a preexisting condition. Maybe there would be a way to cover him, of  course, under disability insurance, but then you start messing with  whether his mom can work. We would be right back where we were before  these protections took place.   Story No. 99, Penny of St. Paul. Penny works with disabled veterans,  but she has a chronic condition of her own--rheumatoid arthritis.  Thankfully, her current insurance allows her to get the care she needs.  But without the ACA, Penny is concerned that she and many others with  treatable conditions will be unable to afford their medications.   Last, Ariane. Ariane had triplets at just 28 weeks, and her pregnancy  included three hospitals stays and bedrest. Without the ban on lifetime  caps, Ariane said she would have lost everything.   Those are just 100 stories. Think of the millions more, the millions  of people who would like to tell the President and the Justice  Department and this administration what it would mean if what they said  they wanted to do last night actually happened. These are just 100  people from across the country.   I hope my colleagues are listening to this because just last night,  this administration announced that they were going to go all-out, that  they were going to do everything to repeal the Affordable Care Act.  These 100 people are not going to let this happen. You have heard the  stories of those moms who will do anything for their kids with  disabilities. You heard the story of the woman who, while her family  member was lost to melanoma, that coverage for a girl who would have  had a preexisting condition allowed her to have a peaceful life in her  last weeks of life.   These are the stories this administration needs to hear to understand  that this isn't just some political battle to see how this sits with  your base, to be against ObamaCare; these are real Americans with real  healthcare needs. We will fight this on their behalf to the end.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.                            ____________________
