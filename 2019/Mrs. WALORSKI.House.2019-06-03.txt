 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2940, to extend the  Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, or TANF, program for another 3  months, because families who use these critical benefits should not be  penalized for the failures here in Washington.   We are here for the 39th extension of TANF because we are once again  unable to move a longer term extension or a reauthorization of this  program.   I certainly hope Democratic leaders in the House will allow Chairman  Davis and me to work with our colleagues on the Ways and Means  Committee in a bipartisan manner to develop a long-term TANF  reauthorization that ensures this program focuses on helping  individuals prepare for, find, and keep good jobs.   At a time when we have 7.5 million job openings and growing demand  for workers that is driving wages up, we not only want every person to  reach their full potential--we need them to.   We have the opportunity to make economic and social gains in ways not  seen in decades so families are better off financially, helping to  improve their overall well-being in the near and long term.   Better wages and stable work bring along a whole host of benefits,  most importantly, the positive impact on children who are spared the  trauma that comes from unrest in the home.   At the root of addressing these challenges needs to be a focus on  human interaction, engagement, support, encouragement, and belief in  the possible, not just assumptions about the probable.   It is time to focus on solving the root causes rather than pushing  complex government ideas that will only address the symptoms.   That is why I, along with more than 50 of my colleagues, have come  forth with a full reauthorization of the TANF program. Our bill, called  the JOBS for Success Act, would return the program's focus to families  by:  [[Page H4196]]    Expecting universal case management so we can rebuild the human  connection and so no one is ignored or left behind in this process;   Holding States accountable for work outcomes, meaning folks can get  and keep a job, and ensuring that dollars go to their families;   Prioritizing households below 200 percent of the poverty line so they  get the services they need to be successful;   Using funds to support and encourage work over the long term, because  we know life is hard, not just when someone is starting a job, but 6  months into the job when the car breaks down or one of life's many  challenges happens; and   Increasing resources available to support childcare to more than $14  billion annually, better utilizing existing funds, and allowing up to  half of a State's annual allocation to be used for childcare.   We all want families to succeed and to achieve their American Dream.  The first step on that bridge out of poverty is getting a job, keeping  a job, and moving through the ranks to higher pay and more benefits.                                time  1530    Unfortunately, under Democratic leadership, we have yet to see any  proposals to reform or improve this program. And today, we are moving  to the floor without any formal consideration by the committee or  hearings on this bill.   Instead of reaching across the aisle to get things done for the  American people, Democratic leadership is focused on investigating the  President and going after his tax returns. They are proposing new  entitlements that tax low-income workers and subsidize large  corporations. They are passing bills that claim to protect people with  preexisting conditions but, in reality, take away their health  insurance choices. And they are continuing to allow infanticide by  refusing to bring to the floor the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors  Protection Act.   Republicans want to work on bipartisan changes to improve childcare  under TANF, and we have come forward with a viable plan to improve  support for families in need by nearly doubling historic funding  levels.   I know my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have the same  desire, and I hope we can find common ground before the next bill comes  to the floor.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield the balance of my time to the  gentleman from Kansas (Mr. Estes), and I ask unanimous consent that he  be allowed to control that time.  [[Page H4197]]
