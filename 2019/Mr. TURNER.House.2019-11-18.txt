 Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Pennsylvania (Ms.  Dean) for pushing this legislation with me, as well as Congresswoman  Bass of California. Congressman Stivers of Ohio has been an incredible  champion. I thank Congressman Wagner for her work on this bill.   And I want to thank, particularly, Ranking Member McHenry. I am not a  member of this committee, and I thank Chairwoman Waters and, of course,  Ranking Member McHenry for taking this up and allowing me to advocate  for this bill.   This is a bill of the heart. Everyone who has worked on this bill  knows that we are remedying a wrong that shouldn't exist.   Mr. Speaker, several years ago, a group of Ohio foster youth, foster  care alumni, and advocates came to me and explained to me the struggles  that they endure as a result of the government's failure as foster  parents. We fail to provide housing for these young people when they  age out of foster care.   Currently, when youth age out of the foster care system, they are  often placed at the back of the line to receive housing assistance,  despite some targeted interventions available. Essentially, many of  these youth, when they age out of foster care, age into federally  created homelessness.   Now, part of this problem is that foster care is under HHS and adult  housing is under HUD. Even though we know these kids are coming because  we are providing them funding and we are providing them care under the  foster care system under HHS, HUD acts like they have shown up for the  very first day when they become adults and age out of the system.   It is our responsibility to fix this. As Congresswoman Wagner was  saying, studies show that 37 percent of foster care alumni have  experienced homelessness. What a failure of a program.   The program under HHS is graduating 37 percent of its kids into  homelessness; 20 percent struggle with chronic homelessness. This is  after we have made a significant investment in these children's lives.  It is the time that they start to go forward into adulthood that they  face homelessness.   The government can and should remedy this. This bill will help with  that and will give these kids, as they go into adulthood, an  opportunity to jump in the front of the line--because we know they are  coming; we have known they are coming for years--and give them the  assistance for federally created housing so they can look toward self- sufficiency and become independent members of society.                                time  1830    Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank all of the Dayton, Ohio, area  foster kids and the alumni who helped work on this. Congratulations to  each and every one of them. We did it, Mr. Speaker. I encourage  everyone to vote for this.
