 Mr. President, I understand the floor vote is going to be  soon. I ask unanimous consent that it be after I finish my remarks.    Mr. President, listening to Senator Wyden and Senator  Brown about Social Security, I would tell my colleagues that the first  recipient of Social Security was a Vermonter. And Vermonters at that  time, I believe, were the most Republican State in the Nation.   I remember growing up as a child hearing so many people say: Well, I  may disagree with a whole lot of things that President Roosevelt and  the Democrats did, but Social Security, I am all for that.   And I learned that as a child, and it has been part of my mantra ever  since, along with Senator Brown and Senator Wyden. Social Security is a  contract, and we should follow it.                            Continuing Resolution    Mr. President, today, the Senate will vote to invoke cloture on the  motion to proceed to H.R. 6833 and take up a substitute amendment  containing a continuing resolution to fund the Federal Government  through December 16. I will vote to invoke cloture and move the process  forward. I urge my colleagues to do the same.   Funding the Federal Government is the most basic responsibility of  Congress. The continuing resolution before the Senate today will keep  vital services running for the American people through December 16,  provide critical support for Ukraine, secure the LIHEAP safety net  ahead of winter, and provide emergency relief to communities recovering  from natural disasters around the country.   However, let me be clear, this is only a temporary measure. As the  chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, I am committed to  completing the work of the Appropriations Committee before the end of  this Congress. In a time of rising inflation, when everything costs  more--energy, food, fuel, housing--we must respond accordingly. Running  on autopilot after December would be irresponsible, and the American  people deserve more.    Our Federal agencies run thousands of programs every day that benefit  working families. From nutrition programs to small business loans and  grants, from affordable housing to healthcare for our Nation's  veterans, from childcare services to our Nation's schools, the Federal  Government provides services that impact nearly every aspect of  Americans' lives. At a time of rising inflation, we cannot fund these  critical programs at last year's levels without cutting services or  underfunding needs. It is simple math. Enacting full year  appropriations bills into law must be our top priority. We owe it to  the American people who sent us here.   This bill addresses several urgent and pressing issues that cannot  wait. The third hottest summer on record has strained one of our most  successful safety nets--the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program,  LIHEAP--as families' energy costs went up with the record-setting  temperatures. This bill contains $1 billion to bolster LIHEAP ahead of  the winter, where Putin's war on Ukraine and inflation are expected to  drive energy costs even higher. No family should have to choose between  heating their home or buying food, not in Vermont and not in any  community across the country. I am glad that we were able to secure  these needed resources.   The bill includes $12.35 billion in emergency assistance for Ukraine,  further demonstrating our resolve to stand with the people of Ukraine  against President Putin's illegal, brutal war on their country. These  funds will provide much-needed training, equipment, logistical support,  supplies, and weapons to the military and national security forces of  Ukraine at this pivotal point in the war. These funds will also be used  to provide direct assistance to Ukraine to help its government maintain  day-to-day operations while it fights to repel Russia's invasion. And  it provides funding to replenish U.S. stocks of equipment that have  been provided to the government of Ukraine and to other countries in  support of the cause.   The bill provides $2.5 billion to support recovery efforts following  the Hermit's Peak/Calf Canyon Fire in New Mexico. The largest fire in  New Mexico's history has scorched hundreds of thousands of acres,  destroyed homes, displaced thousands, and sparked a fresh water crisis  in the community of Las Vegas, New Mexico. This is not an issue of red  States or blue States, we are the United States, and we must stand with  communities in crisis wherever they may be.   The bill also includes $2 billion in community development block  grants to help address unmet recovery needs in communities experiencing  major disasters in 2021 and 2022, such as Kentucky, Missouri, and  Puerto Rico. And with Hurricane Ian advancing in the Gulf, the CR also  includes an additional $18.8 billion for the FEMA disaster relief fund.  We must ensure FEMA has the resources to meet this challenge, and this  bill provides those resources.   I am disappointed that, due to Republican opposition, there is no  additional funding to combat COVID-19 or monkeypox. Reductions in the  current infection levels for COVID-19 are a direct result of the  investments we have made in vaccines, therapeutics, and testing over  the past 2 years. If we hope to avoid a surge this winter, we need the  resources to continue that effort. And we should be investing now to  get ahead of monkeypox before it continues to spread both in the United  States and overseas. Not providing these resources is short-sighted,  and I will continue to fight for the necessary funding to continue to  combat these terrible diseases.   Now Congress must do its job and complete the appropriations process  before the end of the year. I look forward to working with Vice  Chairman Shelby, Chair DeLauro, and Ranking Member Granger to get this  done.   I yield the floor.                                Cloture Motion
