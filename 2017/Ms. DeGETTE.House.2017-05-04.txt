 Mr. Speaker, the American Health Care Act was pulled  from the House floor in March because the American people realized it  was a deeply flawed bill. That bill would have ripped healthcare  coverage away from 24 million of our constituents.   For those lucky enough to maintain coverage, the bill would have  massively raised premiums, deductibles, and out-of-pocket costs. The  crushing age tax in this bill would force older adults to pay  astronomically high premiums.   So what did the majority do in the last 6 weeks? They made the bill  worse.   The MacArthur amendment lets States opt out of the essential benefits  of the ACA. Not only would this jeopardize insurance availability for  the one-third of Americans who have preexisting conditions, it would  let insurance companies deny coverage altogether for maternity, for  emergency room, for mental health, and for other essential benefits.  And because the MacArthur amendment eliminates community ratings,  everybody's insurance costs would skyrocket.   I am going to tell you something. My Republican colleagues are going  to be really, really sorry that they rushed this bill to the floor  before they got an amended CBO score. The reason is, when we do get  this--and make no mistake, we will get this--they are going to find out  that many more millions of people besides the 24 million people,  originally, who are going to lose their insurance are going to be  shocked to wake up to find out, if this TrumpCare bill passes, many  millions more will lose their coverage.   I urge a ``no'' vote on this poorly conceived legislation.
