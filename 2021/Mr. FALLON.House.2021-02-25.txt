 Madam Speaker, the COVID relief bill, which Democrats  want to pass and spend $1.9 trillion, is not about COVID or relief.  Sadly, it is just another massive waste of taxpayer dollars.   Here is the proof: 91 percent of this money doesn't even go to  fighting COVID, and the bill isn't bipartisan. There were 229  amendments by Republicans, 99 percent of which were rejected.   This so-called American Rescue Plan includes $750 million for global  health activities outside our country. It also includes $135 million  for the National Endowment for the Arts, $135 million for the National  Endowment for the Humanities, $50 million for an increase in Planned  Parenthood, $60 billion for union pension bailout, and a $350 billion  bailout for mismanaged Democratic-controlled States that have run out  of money and people to tax.   This $1.9 trillion proposal, which incidentally is $1,900,000  millions, is a colossal waste of money. I urge my colleagues to join me  in voting ``no.''                            ____________________
