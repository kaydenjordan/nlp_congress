 Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, I rise today to offer my amendment, and I urge  my colleagues to support it, which would eliminate funds for official  receptions within the Department of the Interior.   Our national debt is quickly approaching $34 trillion, and yet  wasteful and unnecessary spending is still rampant in our Federal  Government. The American taxpayers deserve to know that their hard- earned money is being spent responsibly and conservatively, but the  underlying bill still includes thousands of taxpayer dollars for  government operations that are neither relevant nor essential for the  success of our Nation in the Department of the Interior.   One such account is the receptions and representation expense  account, which provides funds for hosting cocktail receptions and  catering for Department of the Interior events. Our Department of the  Interior should not be holding such events as the Department's actions  simultaneously jeopardize our Nation's energy security.   For example, earlier this year, the Department of the Interior  announced its plans to withdraw millions of acres within the National  Petroleum Reserve in Alaska, as well as efforts to cancel the lawfully  awarded leases to the Alaska Industrial Development and Export  Authority within the nonwilderness coastal plain that were issued in  early 2021, as required by law. It is ridiculous that the Biden  administration is penalizing Alaska's right to produce more oil but  allows Iran to produce more of its oil while Iranian-sponsored  terrorists wage war on Israel, our greatest ally in the Middle East.   It is abundantly clear that the Biden administration--in this case,  the Department of the Interior--needs to reevaluate its priorities and  put America first. These individuals should not be rewarded with  taxpayer funds to pay for cocktail receptions while advocating against  American security amidst a dire debt crisis.   When it comes to budgeting, every little bit counts. We need to  clawback all wasteful spending and unnecessary spending to get our  fiscal house in order.   Mr. Chair, for this reason, I urge my colleagues to support my  amendment to this bill, which eliminates this frivolous use of funds,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, eliminating official reception funds is not a  new or novel idea. We should be fiscally responsible with every  solitary dollar that we spend. We eliminated almost a half a million  dollars of official reception funds in the Commerce-Justice-Science  appropriation. Of that half million, $284,000 was in the FBI, $36,000  was in the ATF, and $50,000 in the Office of the United States  Attorney, among other amounts.   This is only $15,000, not a huge amount of money, but every dollar  counts. We must be fiscally responsible in every area, especially  regarding money spent on cocktail receptions.   Who can forget the picture of the GSA official, Jeffrey Neely,  pictured in the hot tub with a wine glass in Las Vegas. That was a  complete abuse of funds.   This is $15,000 that will be going to the funding reduction account.  We will be saving $15,000. We do not need a reception fund in the  Department of the Interior for them to do their job better.   Mr. Chair, I encourage my colleagues to support my amendment, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I am proud to be an original cosponsor of the  Israel Security Supplemental Appropriations Act which provides $14.3  billion in critical military assistance to our great ally, Israel,  while also replenishing our own defense stockpiles and ensuring the  safe return of American citizens impacted by Hamas' barbaric terrorist  attack on Israel.   On October 7, Iran-backed Hamas terrorists committed heinous attacks  on the people of Israel. In the days following this savage onslaught,  the world has watched in horror as images and reports reveal the vile  depths of Hamas' depravity. These terrorists have perpetrated barbaric,  sadistic, and evil acts against innocent Israelis, including burning  and decapitating babies, raping women, abducting families, and  murdering over 1,400 people.   Tragically, more than 30 Americans were also murdered by Hamas in  Israel on that day while several Americans remain held hostage by the  terrorists in Gaza. In response to these atrocities, the Israel  Security Supplemental reinforces Israel's defense systems by providing  $4 billion to replenish the Iron Dome and David's Sling missile defense  systems, $3.5 billion for the procurement of advanced weapons systems,  and $1.2 billion for the Iron Beam defense system to counter short- range rockets and mortar threats.    This is not time for a cease-fire or a pause in any way, Mr. Speaker.  This is a time to crush Hamas, eliminate their leadership, and  obliterate their fighters. I am so thankful that there is humanitarian  aid here that could possibly get into the hands of Hamas.   This bill will help Israel do exactly what it needs to do, and that  is defend itself. This bill also provides 200 million for the  protection of U.S. personnel in Israel and evacuations of U.S. citizens  to ensure that Americans can return safely to the United States.   Finally, under Speaker Johnson's leadership, this bill is fully  offset by a rescission of IRS funding taken out of the reckless  inflation expansion act. This commonsense solution ensures that we can  assist our strongest ally in the Middle East without further burdening  American taxpayers by irresponsibly borrowing millions of dollars. I  ask my colleagues to support this bill.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of my amendment No.  82, which would simply prohibit funds made available by this act to be  used for the cancellation or suspension of oil and gas leases in the  Arctic National Wildlife Refuge or the National Petroleum Reserve in  Alaska.   On September 6, 2023, the Biden administration's Department of the  Interior posted a press release announcing Secretary of the Interior  Haaland's cancellation of seven oil and gas lease permits covering  365,000 acres in the coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife  Refuge, also known as the ANWR.   The former dean of our House, Congressman Don Young, once told me  that his mission in Congress--a mission that he worked for for decades  to accomplish--was to allow drilling in the ANWR. That was his passion.  This mission was finally accomplished during the Trump administration  with the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Now, just 1\1/2\ years  after Congressman Young's passing, the administration is reversing his  important work.   President Biden's disastrous America last energy policies and his  embrace of the radical Green New Deal agenda have jeopardized American  energy independence and have cost hardworking Americans significant  inflation, both at the gas pump and in their utility bills.   First, the Biden administration halted construction of the Keystone  XL pipeline. Then President Biden froze all oil and gas lease permits  on Federal lands, and later he drained our Strategic Petroleum Reserve  to boost political capital while putting American national and energy  security at risk.   Previously under President Trump's America first agenda, the Tax Cuts  and Jobs Act established an oil and gas leasing program in the coastal  plain of ANWR, increasing our Nation's energy security and lowering oil  and gas prices for hardworking Americans. However, on President Biden's  first day in office, he issued a disastrous executive order, Number  13990, titled: Protecting Public Health and the Environment and  Restoring Science to Tackle the Climate Crisis, and it imposed a  temporary moratorium on the statutorily mandated oil and gas lease  activities in the coastal plain.   So now President Biden is waging his latest battle in his war on  American energy independence, the outright canceling of these oil and  gas leases in the coastal plain of the ANWR while citing a dubious  source of statutory authority and potentially losing out on 7.7 billion  barrels of recoverable oil according to the U.S. Geological Survey.  This action by the Biden administration is blatantly circumventing the  democratic process and subverting the will of Congress.                                time  1830    My amendment to the fiscal year 2024 Interior, Environment, and  Related Agencies appropriations bill would prohibit funds from being  used to implement the Biden administration's cancellation of the  statutorily mandated oil and gas leases in the coastal plain of the  ANWR.   Therefore, I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this amendment to  prevent the cancellation of oil and gas leases in the coastal plain.  Vote to unleash American independence and vote to lower your  constituents' gas prices and utility bills.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I concur with my colleague on the other side of  the aisle that climate change actually does happen. It happens four  times a year--spring, summer, fall, and winter. Congressman Don Young  represented Alaska. He knew Alaska better than anyone did, and he knew  what was best for the ANWR. It was his passion that ANWR be open for  drilling for the security of America, the entire country, for energy  independence.   Mr. Chair, I encourage my colleagues to vote for this amendment, and  I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong support of my  amendment No. 83 to the FY24 Interior, Environment, and Related  Agencies appropriations bill, which halts the funding for the Bureau of  Land Management's misguided proposed rule on energy development in the  Alaska National Petroleum Reserve.   In these times of global upheaval, record-high gas prices, and  economic instability, restricting American energy production would be  unwise to the point of recklessness. It undermines the pillars of our  national strength, our national security, fiscal health, and the  prosperity of the American taxpayer. Yet, the Biden administration  seeks to drastically limit access to responsible energy production on  our own soil--resources that rightfully belong to the American people.   The Alaskan reserve holds the potential to supply hundreds of  thousands of barrels of oil per day, lessening our reliance on  untrustworthy foreign sources. Yet, this administration seeks to  negligently barricade access to our invaluable domestic resources.   The Bureau of Land Management rule plainly defines the clear intent  of Congress within the National Petroleum Reserves Production Act,  which is to responsibly harness these resources through competitive  leasing. The rule imposes arbitrary restrictions and redundant  regulations that serve no purpose other than obstructing energy  development. We cannot allow Washington bureaucrats to override the  legislative mandate from this Congress and push a radical anti-American  energy agenda down our throats.   Utilizing the Alaskan reserve's resources is crucial for our energy  security and the operational viability of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline.  Leaving this vital infrastructure stranded would weaken America's  strength on the world stage amidst looming threats from adversaries  like Russia, China, and Iran. Our energy independence must stand  resolute.   In short, my amendment wisely prevents the squandering of taxpayer  dollars on stifling our tremendous American energy potential. I urge my  colleagues, those who cherish our working families, fiscal prosperity,  and national security to rally behind this necessary course correction.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, it is vital that we unleash and support  American energy, fossil fuel energy, and pursue pro-American energy  policies. I am deeply concerned that my colleagues on the other side of  the aisle refuse to put the needs of Americans first.   Given the current state of affairs globally, we should not be relying  on energy supplies from foreign powers. Therefore, I again urge my  colleagues to support my amendment, which defunds this disastrous BLM  rule.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
