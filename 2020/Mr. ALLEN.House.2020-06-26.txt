 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to voice my strong opposition to  overriding President Trump's veto.   We can all agree that no student should be intentionally misled and  schools engaging in fraudulent misrepresentation must be held  accountable. But the Obama-era borrower defense regulations lack  clarity, and simply, did not function. The 2016 regulations did not  make the critical distinction between fraud and unintentional mistakes  made by schools.   Mr. Speaker, under the rule, the Department of Education can impose  significant financial penalties on institutions found to engage in  fraud. But with no distinction, this can cause a school to have to  close despite no intentional wrongdoing, hurting students on their path  to a higher education. That is why President Trump took decisive action  and created the 2019 borrower defense rule to clear this up.   Mr. Speaker, the Trump administration's solution delivers relief to  students, including veterans, who have been lied to and suffered  financial harm. It would also save taxpayers $11 billion by helping  students complete their education, rather than indiscriminately closing  schools. The Trump rule will ensure due process for all parties, while  also ensuring institutions engaging in fraudulent misrepresentation are  held accountable.   Mr. Speaker, when Democrats originally brought forward a resolution  to disapprove this new commonsense rule, I voted ``no,'' and I will  vote ``no'' again today.   I thank President Trump for rightfully using his veto authority,  because we cannot go back to the Obama-era regulations that hurt  students and taxpayers.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose this measure today.
