 Mr. Speaker, I rise today as a concerned American,  concerned because our country stands at a crossroads in foreign policy  and history, I might add.   In recent days, we have seen this administration cynically abandon  our Kurdish allies in northeast Syria and open the door to a Turkish  invasion. These decisions were made without consulting our allies, our  distinguished diplomats, and regional experts like Ambassador Jeffrey.   Much damage has been done. Yesterday, President Putin and President  Erdogan signed an agreement, I believe, that harms American interests  in that part of the world.   Hundreds of people have been killed. Tens of thousands have been  displaced. Dangerous ISIS prisoners, who have been killing and wounding  Americans, are now on the loose, threatening increased international  terrorist actions in Europe and the United States. This is a real  threat.   Turkey's actions have shown it to be a dangerous actor on the  international stage, but it is not the first time. We must immediately  impose sanctions to show our commitment to a stable international order  and the rule of law, and Turkey must understand that.   Clearly, the international reputation of the United States has, I  think, been deeply damaged.   As chairman of the Transatlantic Legislators' Dialogue, I know. Our  European partners ask me all the time: Are we together? Do we share the  same values of the rule of law, of democratic freedoms?   The United States should never, ever end up standing alone. The past  few days also reminds us of another injustice that must be rectified.   In 1915, the Ottoman Empire embarked upon systematic deportation of  1.5 million Armenians. These innocent men, women, and children became  the first genocide in the 20th century. Yet, as I stand here this  morning, the brutal atrocity has still not received the official  recognition by our government that it deserves.                                time  1015    Turkey outrageously continues to ignore the voices of the survivors  and the descendants around the world. Many of these survivors settled  in my district in the San Joaquin Valley where they have lived and  where they have raised their children in the blessings of liberty, and  they made it in the American way.   But this is not justice. The road to justice begins with full  recognition of the Armenian people's suffering. Both Turkey and the  United States, immediately, should recognize that the Armenian genocide  occurred, as the European Union has done.   I am proud to support H. Res. 296 which, over the objections of  Ankara, would establish permanent U.S. recognition and ongoing American  remembrance of the Armenian genocide. That is the right thing to do.   I call upon my colleagues who have yet to publicly endorse this  bipartisan resolution to join me, with over 110 cosponsors, in calling  for a long-overdue  [[Page H8393]]  passage by the United States House of Representatives.   Mr. Speaker, the horrors of the Armenian genocide can never ever be  undone. Words alone cannot comfort those who suffered nor dry the tears  of another mother or grandmother who has lost her children or  grandchildren. By acknowledging the suffering of the victims through  the official recognition of the Armenian genocide, we can at least  ensure that future generations will never ever forget this atrocity to  mankind.                            Election Interference     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to talk about the growing  serious threat to our democracy and the interference in elections of  foreign adversaries. Yes, these things are all related.   With the 2020 elections fast approaching, now is the time to take  action by supporting the SHIELD Act. The SHIELD Act puts four  commonsense bipartisan reforms to improve our defenses against anyone  meddling in our elections. No one should do that, and every American  should take issue. It closes loopholes, strengthens reporting  requirements, restricts exchange of information between campaigns, and  limits any involvement with foreign agents.   As public officials, we raise our hand to protect and defend the  Constitution of the United States. We must rise to this occasion to do  just that. That is what we should do as Members of the House of  Representatives. Our constituents expect it from us to ensure that  every vote is counted and that no one--no foreign source--can meddle in  American elections, ever, as took place in 2016.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join with Congresswoman Zoe  Lofgren and others who have worked very hard on this important  legislation to pass the SHIELD Act this week. It is the right thing to  do.                            ____________________
