 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to honor the life of UCLA  Chancellor Charles Young, who passed away at the age of 91.   For 29 years, Chancellor Young led UCLA, America's premier research  institution. He transformed UCLA from a regional collegiate university  to the powerhouse that it is today.   He took over at UCLA at the age of 36, making him the youngest  chancellor in University of California history. He was the first UCLA  alumnus to hold that top position on campus. Under his leadership,  UCLA's annual operating budget grew tenfold, to $1.7 billion, and  undergraduate enrollment exploded.   Chancellor Young was a staunch supporter of making higher education  accessible to all. He championed diversity at the university and led  UCLA through a very difficult social unrest period.   We will forever remember Chancellor Young for his contribution to  this country. Go Bruins.                        Celebrating Enrique Hernandez     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the life of  Enrique Hernandez, a beloved member of our Orange County community.   Enrique was born in 1937 in Jalisco, Mexico. He worked as a  construction laborer, specializing in concrete and asphalt. He was a  man who took pride in his work. Enrique didn't know how to do less than  his very best every day.   Enrique loved watching lucha libre matches and telling stories about  his time in Jalisco, Mexico, and the small ranch where he grew up.   He also loved to talk about his love life. He was married to Edelmira  for 65 years. Their legacy includes 7 children, 22 grandchildren, and  15 great-grandchildren. Enrique's five siblings carry on his tradition  of being great storytellers.   We honor Enrique for his service to our community and to his  beautiful family.                            ____________________
