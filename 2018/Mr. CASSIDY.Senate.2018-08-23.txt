 Mr. President, I, too, want to emphasize the importance  of introducing young students to computer science and coding courses as  part of their education. I thank my colleague and friend, Senator  Cantwell, for working with me on this issue. The answer is yes. Our  legislation, the High School CODES Act, will incentivize states to  allow coding and computer science classes to satisfy an advanced math,  science, or foreign language graduation credit.   Now, this is not to replace the basic math, science, and foreign  language classes all students need, but to allow students who do not  need to take Calculus II or III to instead take a computer science or  coding course. The CODES Act does not mandate curriculum on States; it  gives them the flexibility to provide students with the type of  education that best fits their needs. It gives students more  opportunity to succeed in our rapidly changing economy.   According to code.org, computing occupations are the No. 1 source of  all new wages in America and make up over half of all projected new  jobs in STEM fields; yet, computer science is marginalized throughout  our education system, with fewer than half of U.S. schools offering any  computer science course, and only 8 percent of STEM graduates studying  it.   In my home State of Louisiana, there are currently more than 2,300  open computing jobs. The average salary for a computing occupation in  Louisiana is approximately $67,600, about $26,000 higher than the  average salary in my State.   I applaud the State legislature for creating the LaSTEM Advisory  Council to oversee the creation and delivery of STEM programs in  Louisiana and for the LA Board of Elementary and Secondary Education  for approving new STEM pathways for students allowing new, industry- based courses to count towards math and sciences for graduation.   In addition to thanking Senator Cantwell, I want to thank education  committee Chairman Alexander for his support for including provisions  in the reauthorization of the Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical  Education Act that effectively captures the original intent of our  bipartisan bill. We are also pleased the chairman agreed to report  language and a letter to Education Secretary DeVos expressing the  intent of the provisions. Lastly, I am pleased that Senator Cantwell  and my amendment is included in the minibus appropriations bill  highlighting the importance of funding for coding courses in K-12  education.   These are positive steps that will give more students the opportunity  to take computer science and coding classes.  [[Page S5911]]                                ____________________
