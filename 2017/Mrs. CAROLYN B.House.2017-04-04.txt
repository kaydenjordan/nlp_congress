 MALONEY of New York asked and was given permission  to address the House for 1 minute.)    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, think all the way  back to New Year's Day--94 days ago--and contemplate for just a moment  the fact that if a full-time working woman were to take all of the  money she made between way back then and today, and she added that to  what she had made working all of last year, well, she just now would  have an amount equal to what a typical man made just last year. Well,  welcome to Equal Pay Day.   The exact size of the gender pay gap can vary. It tends to be smaller  when you are younger, worse when you are older, and worse still if you  are a woman of color. Even where you choose to live can make a  difference.   My thanks to the Democratic staff of the Joint Economic Committee,  where I sit as the ranking member, for producing a new report that  updates all these numbers, as well as State-by-State numbers on the  gender wage gap.   I encourage all my colleagues to take a look at this report to see  just how your State is doing. The best news I read all day was that New  York State is number one. That was good news.                            ____________________
