 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, on National Police Week, we celebrate  our law enforcement officers, but it is also important to pause and  honor those who gave their lives in the line of duty and to pause and  remember the families they left behind.   Last year, I stood in this Chamber as we unanimously adopted the  National Police Week resolution and honored the 576 law enforcement  officers killed in the line of duty in 2021. Today, I take this moment  to honor the 246 brave men and women who were killed in the line of  duty in 2022. In order to rightfully honor these men and women who lost  their lives, we must continue to demand policies that will make our  communities safer and, by extension, our officers in the line of duty  safer.   This topic is incredibly personal to me. My father was a chief of  police in our hometown of El Dorado, KS, for 30 years. Here is a  picture I share of my father in 1965, a proud new police officer with  our family dog and police officer dog, Rinny.   On more than one occasion, my dad put his life on the line to protect  our community, and on many other days, he would tell stories of the  bravery and courage of his officers when responding to an emergency.  These were all my friends, but they were heroes in my eyes, as well,  and always will be remembered as such.   But, today, I am sad to report that our men and women in law  enforcement feel demoralized. They are constantly put in a no-win  situation, and their own city governments are setting them up to fail.  In short, like my dad told me recently on a fishing trip, law  enforcement officers know this White House and many mayors and city  councils do not have their backs. They feel abandoned, and they feel  like they get no respect, even to the point of being wrongfully shamed.   These brave men and women need our support now more than ever.  Democrat-run cities have demonized law enforcement, making it harder  for our men and women in uniform to do their jobs. And, sadly, their  dangerous rhetoric and policies are emboldening criminals at the  expense of our officers.   You don't have to look any further than our own Nation's Capital. In  November of last year, here in Washington, the DC Council voted to  dramatically reform the city's criminal code to favor the rights of the  offender during a crime wave across the District. The legislation  eliminated mandatory minimum sentences for most crimes and lowered the  maximum penalties for crimes such as carjacking and robbery.   The reforms to the city's criminal code came as the city's crime  crisis hit a fever pitch.   Listen to this. Our Nation's Capital had 203 homicides in 2022--our  Nation's capital, 203 homicides. Carjackings have tripled since 2019.  This year, so far, violent crime is up by double digits. Last year, a  physician was murdered after he tried to prevent a carjacker from  stealing his car. A city council candidate had his car stolen at  gunpoint. More recently, a Senate staffer was brutally attacked and  stabbed in the head in broad daylight.   I remain fearful for my staff as they walk from their homes to the  Capitol. Just recently, I gathered with a group of Senators to discuss  policy, but the topic of discussion soon became the safety of our  employees and what we could do to help ensure their safety.   With the culture of lawlessness on the streets being embraced by the  DC City Council, at a time of low morale and increased crime, it is no  wonder why the city has lost over 1,200 officers over the last 2 years,  a number that is growing each day.   We need to stop here and talk about the culture of lawlessness  started by this White House. It started during his campaign with a  summer of applauding violent riots and vandalism.   After being sworn in, the administration purposefully and shamelessly  opened our borders, and, even now, this administration turns their  heads to violent criminals and terrorists crossing our borders. And  with the Democrats embracing cashless bail in Joe Biden's America, we  are now not only a country without borders but also a lawless society,  where criminals roam the streets and fentanyl poisons our children.   This Nation must change its course before it is too late. To preserve  this union, we need law and order. Our Republic will not survive  without it.                                 H.J. Res. 42    I rise today in support of Senator Vance's motion to nullify the DC  Council's Comprehensive Policing and Justice Reform Amendment Act of  2022. By passing this resolution, we can now join our House colleagues  in firmly rejecting the council's antipolice, pro-criminal laws and  reaffirm our support for our heroic law enforcement officers.   I urge all of my Senate colleagues and the White House to choose  people over politics by joining our efforts to  [[Page S1661]]  improve public safety in Washington, DC.   With its passage, we can send a clear message to 1600 Pennsylvania  Avenue: We in the Senate will not stand by while our law enforcement  officers are vilified and cut off at the knees when trying to do their  job.   And with its passage, it will make Washington, DC, a safer place for  the millions of visitors who pilgrimage to this great Capital to  petition their elected Members of Congress, to regale in our history,  and to celebrate our freedom.   This is a bill that makes DC safer, but it also sends a message to  the entire country--a message that we want safe streets, we want safe  communities, we want safe schools, and we want to do it in a bipartisan  way.   Let's signal to every county, every city, and every State that  Washington, DC, will no longer be soft on crime and cater to criminals.   I yield the floor.
