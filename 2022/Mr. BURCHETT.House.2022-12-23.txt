 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 2617.   Democrats are railroading this $1.7 trillion bill full of garbage  without any regard for what it is costing Americans.   The truth is our constant flood of reckless, bloated spending bills  has blown inflation rates right through the roof, and Americans are  going to pay the price.   What are we spending Americans' hard-earned money on you ask, Mr.  Speaker?   Well, I will tell you a little bit of it, Mr. Speaker. Over $45  billion for Ukraine, when Europe should be carrying the burden of these  costs. That is $100 billion total. And don't forget the Democrats  blocked any efforts we had to audit this money so we knew exactly where  the money was going. That works out to about $200 million per  congressional district, Mr. Speaker. I wonder what we could have spent  that on back in east Tennessee.   Mr. Speaker, $1.2 million is going for LGBT pride centers in San  Diego. That is a whole heck of a lot of pride.   Mr. Speaker, $3 million is for an LGBT museum in New York City;  nearly half a million dollars is for an equity institute in Rhode  Island; $545 million is for international family planning and  reproductive health--including in areas where population growth would  dare to threaten biodiversity or endangered species.   Over $400 million is for Middle Eastern countries to protect their  borders, Mr. Speaker, when we don't even protect our own dadgum  borders.   Mr. Speaker, we only have ourselves to blame, and I hope you have a  merry Christmas.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this bill which I feel is pumped  full of woke nonsense.   This $1.66 trillion package has billions of dollars set aside for  LGBT centers, museums, hiking trails, pride centers, skate parks, solar  panel projects, and other Democrat priorities.   We are giving $410 million to five Middle Eastern countries for  border security, while billions of dollars of our own border protection  are prohibited. They are prohibited, Mr. Speaker, from being used to  enhance border security; not to mention over $45 billion for Ukraine,  bringing it up to $100 billion total.   Mind you, Mr. Speaker, the Democrats blocked the bill that would have  allowed us to have some transparency and audited those funds and know  where they went. These massive costs are not our responsibility. They  are Europe's, Mr. Speaker.   My Democratic colleagues are not even keeping an account of where  this money is really going. One hundred billion dollars is about $200  million per congressional district. Imagine what east Tennesseans could  do with $200 million or the districts on our southern border.   If you are a Republican and vote for this but claim to be a fiscal  conservative, Mr. Speaker, then you are a liar. If you are a Democrat  and vote for this but claim to be against war, then you are a liar.   We only have ourselves to blame, Mr. Speaker, and those 20 million  so-called conservatives who decided to stay home for whatever reason  this past election year.
