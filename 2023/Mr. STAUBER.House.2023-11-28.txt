 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak in favor of the Small  Business Contracting Transparency Act.   I thank my colleague, Representative Houlahan, for bringing this up.  It is a very good bill and I am proud to stand in support of it.   In Minnesota, Feeding Our Future, a supposed nonprofit in Minnesota  meant to feed children, used $250 million of COVID-19 Federal funds to  buy luxury cars and real estate.   Since COVID-19, fraud has been on the rise. Bad actors are taking  advantage of vulnerable government programs and stealing taxpayer  dollars for their own benefit and wealth. We must be better stewards of  taxpayer dollars and ensure proper safeguards are in place.   The Small Business Administration is charged with ensuring that only  eligible firms are participating in its Women-Owned Small Business  Federal Contract program, HUBZone programs, and the Service-Disabled  Veteran-Owned Small Business programs.   The Small Business Contracting Transparency Act would bring much- needed oversight to the certification process, ensure the SBA is only  approving appropriate firms, and give Congress the tools to hold the  SBA accountable, if necessary.   By supporting the Small Business Contracting Transparency Act, we  will not only provide valuable assistance to small businesses but also  ensure effectiveness in government contracting.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on the Small  Business Contracting Transparency Act.
