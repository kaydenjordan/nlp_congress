 Mr. Speaker, I am proud to welcome Pastor Paul C.  Meyers as our guest chaplain this morning and greatly appreciate him  leading us in prayer on this historic Thursday.   Pastor Meyers is from the 16th Congressional District of Illinois,  which I proudly represent, and serves as the senior chaplain at the  United Methodist Church in Roscoe, Illinois.   Serving in ministry since 1992, Pastor Meyers has been a stalwart,  faithful figure in our community. He serves as chaplain for the fire,  EMS, and law enforcement--19 years and counting--and is currently the  head chaplain for the Harlem-Roscoe Fire Department and the Roscoe  Police Department. He also serves as chaplain with the FBI and will be  resident chaplain at the FBI Academy this month in Quantico.   I want to say thank you to Pastor Meyers and to his family for all  they do to serve in our community. We are humbly grateful for this  dedication to serving the Lord and providing us with this spiritual  guidance.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of our fallen  heroes, the seven U.S. military members killed in the helicopter crash  over western Iraq on Saturday, March 16, 2018.   As an airman, I had the privilege of flying with Captain Andreas  O'Keefe. His Air Force service included three tours in Iraq, serving in  Afghanistan and the Horn of Africa and, most recently, in Texas to help  out during Hurricane Harvey. And still, he wanted to do more.   Andy was a fellow air guardsman, a Long Island guy, and served with  the 106th Rescue Wing of the New York Air National Guard. Like many who  join the service, Andy did so voluntarily, with a servant's heart,  eager to serve his country and to help others. Without question, he  lived by the 106th credo: ``That others may live.''   As a nation, we mourn for the families and loved ones of those fallen  heroes. We send them our prayers, deepest condolences, and deepest  gratitude for their service to the country.   While we grieve this tragic loss, I know Andy died doing what he  loved and what he was called to do and what he wanted to do: serve his  country.   Mr. Speaker, we stand in this Chamber because of the sacrifices of  men and women like this. We have the freedom to debate and vote and use  our voices because of their sacrifice.   With that, it is with a heavy heart that I say Godspeed to my friend,  Captain O'Keefe.   May God bless our troops every day.                            ____________________
