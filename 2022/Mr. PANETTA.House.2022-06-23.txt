 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to celebrate the 50th  anniversary of the Federal Pell grant. Created in 1972, the Pell  targets students with a demonstrated financial need. It helps cover the  cost of tuition, fees, room and board, and many, many other expenses.   Now, unlike loans which can burden low-income students, Pell grants  do not need to be repaid. The Pell actually helps students focus on  school rather than have them wondering about how to pay for it.   The Pell has benefited more than 80 million students in the past 50  years and is an absolute lifeline for students at colleges in my  district on the central coast of California. Currently, there are close  to 16,000 students receiving $68 million in Pell grants to pursue their  higher education goals at our local colleges and universities.   Now, clearly, support for the Pell is widespread and bipartisan. I am  proud to say that we here in Congress actually increased the Pell by  $400 for 2022. That is the largest increase, Mr. Speaker, to the Pell  in 10 years, but I think you would agree with me that this is not  enough. As we celebrate this anniversary, Mr. Speaker, the Pell now  only covers less than one-third of average attendance costs. So we must  do everything we can to strengthen the Pell. I believe we can do that  by doubling the Pell.   I look forward to working with my colleagues to ensure that that  happens and ensure that students, regardless of need, can afford  college and attain a brighter future.                            ____________________
