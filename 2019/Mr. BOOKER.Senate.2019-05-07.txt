 Madam President, today I wish to speak on the nomination  of Janet Dhillon, who is nominated to be Chair of the Equal Employment  Opportunity Commission. The EEOC plays an important role in protecting  American workers. I am deeply concerned that Ms. Dhillon will put the  interests of corporations over those of employees, which is  antithetical to the mission of the EEOC.   The EEOC is charged with ``enforcing federal laws that make it  illegal to discriminate against a job applicant or an employee because  of the person's race, color, religion, sex (including pregnancy, gender  identity, and sexual orientation), national origin, age (40 or older),  disability or genetic information.'' It also investigates claims of  individuals who are retaliated against for complaining about  discrimination. Needless to say, the EEOC plays a critical role in  protecting American workers and ensuring that our Federal anti- discrimination laws are enforced and not disregarded by unscrupulous  employers.   In choosing someone to sit on the Commission, it is critical that the  administration select someone with a history of working to advance  civil rights and workers' rights. Ms. Dhillon clearly does not have  that background.   Ms. Dhillon has spent the vast majority of her career working for and  representing the interests of large corporations. Notably, while she  was employed at JC Penney, the company was harshly criticized for its  handling of a garment factory accident in Bangladesh that killed more  than 1,000 people. She also worked at the Retail Litigation Center, an  entity that works to limit employees' and consumers' access to justice.  These experiences stand in direct opposition to the mission of the  EEOC.   Additionally, during her confirmation hearing, she would not commit  to maintaining the EEOC's current position that title VII of the Civil  Rights Act of 1964 protects LGBT people from discrimination. As one of  the main authors of the Equality Act in the Senate, which clarifies  that existing civil rights law forbids discrimination of LGBT people, I  am deeply concerned Ms. Dhillon would not make that commitment at her  hearing.   If the United States is going to be a beacon of liberty and freedom,  we must not allow discrimination of any kind to continue. The EEOC  plays an essential role in fulfilling that promise of eradicating  discrimination and creating a workplace that reflects the best of  American values: hard work, ingenuity, decency, and respect.   It is clear to me that Ms. Dhillon is not the right person for the  job, and I urge my colleagues to vote against her nomination.
