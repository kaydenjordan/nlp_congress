 Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for  yielding.   The threshold question for any NAFTA replacement must be whether it  will finally stop the outflow of American jobs and raise the standard  of living for Mexican, Canadian, and, of course, American workers.   My Democratic colleagues have worked tirelessly to ensure NAFTA's  replacement leads to positive change, and I thank them for their  efforts which have improved the deal President Trump originally  negotiated.   But these improvements will not be enough to overhaul the entrenched  system in Mexico that denies workers their rights, keeps wages  unconscionably low, and, consequently, incentivizes companies to ship  jobs to Mexico.    It incentivizes companies to ship jobs to  Mexico and out of our communities like mine in southeast Michigan.   Mexico has not demonstrated the will, meaningfully, to reform its  labor system, and the weakness of USMCA's enforcement mechanisms mean  that we will not be able to hold Mexico's feet to the fire when  promised reforms do not occur.   I genuinely hope I am wrong about this, but I fear we can expect the  USMCA will perpetuate the harms of  [[Page H12266]]  NAFTA for Mexican and American workers alike; therefore, I oppose this  legislation.                                time  1315
