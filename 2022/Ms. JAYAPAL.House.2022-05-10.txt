 Madam Speaker, workers' rights are human rights. The  labor movement has shown us what is possible when we dream big and  fight hard. Tonight, we will clear yet another hurdle in the battle for  workplace safety and dignity.   I thank my colleague, Representative Levin, for his tremendous  leadership on this resolution. With House Resolution 915, congressional  staff will be able to organize and bargain for a better workplace  without fear of intimidation or retaliation.   As someone who organized with unions, working people, and for  collective bargaining rights before coming to Congress, I know how  important it is that we guarantee our staff that same  [[Page H4768]]  right. As a co-lead of the PRO Act, I have continuously pushed for pro- worker policies that prioritize safety, equity, and better pay. Like  other workers, congressional staff deserve to be protected at work.  They put in long, hard hours. They work incredibly hard to serve the  people.   We must lead by example and show our gratitude by ensuring our staff  have the right to bargain, to organize, and to unionize.
