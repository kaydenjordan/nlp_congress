 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, the House is still on schedule to vote  tomorrow on a reform of one-sixth of the American economy that the  American public has not seen. This is, frankly, unprecedented--this  rush job, this attempt to jam through a massive rewrite of the American  healthcare system, intentionally done so fast that the American public  cannot keep up with what is a truly disastrous piece of legislation. It  is a train wreck. It is a dumpster fire. I cannot come up with enough  words to describe how bad this legislation is going to be for the  American public.   Bill Kristol, who is an icon of the conservative movement and who has  been arguing for the repeal and replacement of the Affordable Care Act  since it was passed, tweeted out this:         This healthcare bill does not, A, lower costs; B, improve       insurance; C, increase liberty; D, make healthcare better. So       what is the point?    Frankly, many Americans, many healthcare professionals, and many  consumers are asking the same question: What problem does this bill  solve?   Whatever you want to call it--the American Health Care Act,  TrumpCare, RyanCare--what problem does this bill solve other than a  political problem?   Clearly, Republicans have a political problem. They have promised,  for the last 6 years, to repeal the Affordable Care Act. Now they have  control of the White House, the House, and the Senate, and they feel  pressured to make good on that promise.   It does solve a political problem for the Republicans. The passage of  this bill in the House or the Senate would allow my Republican friends  to say: We told you we were going to repeal the Affordable Care Act,  and--doggone it--we did it. But it does not solve any other problem in  the American healthcare system. It makes the existing, remaining  problems even worse. The Republicans know this because, for 6 years, we  have heard criticism--relentless criticism--that the Affordable Care  Act was rammed through the process, that it was passed without Members'  knowing what was in it, that it was shoved down the throats of the  American people. Well, imagine our surprise when the replacement to the  Affordable Care Act is being pushed through at absolutely light speed  compared to the passage of the Affordable Care Act.    So we look at what happened when the Affordable Care Act was passed,  and the HELP Committee that I sit on, the Finance Committee in the  Senate, the Energy and Commerce Committee, and the Ways and Means  Committee held dozens of hearings--dozens of committee meetings. The  Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee in the Senate alone  debated hundreds of amendments and accepted 130 Republican amendments  to the Affordable Care Act.   This time around, the HELP Committee isn't even going to have a  meeting on the replacement. The committees in the Senate aren't going  to have anything to do with this bill. The substitute language that  Speaker Ryan has filed likely will not even get a CBO analysis before  it is jammed through the House tomorrow. Why is that? Because  Republicans are so fearful that the American public will have the time  to take a look at this and realize what it is.   I don't often say that Bill Kristol is right, but he is right when he  says that this bill doesn't lower costs, it doesn't improve insurance,  increase liberty, or make healthcare better, so what is the point?   Here are three really simple ways to understand this bill. This bill  is all about higher costs for consumers, all about less care for  Americans, all in order to finance tax cuts for the rich. These are the  three prongs of TrumpCare: higher costs, less care, and tax cuts for  the rich. You don't have to spend a lot of time deep inside this bill  to figure out what it is all about.   So costs go up, CBO says 15 to 20 percent, just in the first couple  of years for a number of reasons, but primary amongst them is the fact  that the help that you are going to get to afford insurance just  dramatically decreases. For low-income Americans, here it is: You get  $1,200 less if you are 27, you get $1,100 less if you are 40, and if  you are 60, you get really hosed. If you are 60, good luck affording  insurance. Your subsidy goes down by $5,800. It gets even worse than  that because this bill allows for the insurance companies to  discriminate against older Americans by jacking up the ratios that you  can charge older Americans versus younger Americans from 3 to 1 to 5 to  1, so the average low-income, sixtyish-year-old in this country will be  paying about $15,000 more out of pocket for healthcare.   What problem does that solve? Talking to people in Connecticut, I  didn't hear a lot of my constituents who are in their fifties and  sixties say: Let me tell you the problem with the American healthcare  system. I am paying way too little. I need to be paying--if I could be  paying $13,000 more, that would scratch me where I itch.   Nobody says that the problem with the healthcare system today is that  costs are too low. It is the opposite. Costs are too high. Yet the  first prong of TrumpCare: higher costs. That is not me saying it; that  is CBO saying it.   I will give my colleagues the exception to this because let's lay all  of our cards out on the table. CBO does say that if you are young,  healthy, and relatively affluent, you might get a lower rate. Let's be  honest about that. So if you are young, healthy, and you are affluent,  you might get a lower rate. But that is a sliver of the population  compared to all of the people who are going to be paying higher rates,  especially older people and especially low-income people, because the  subsidies don't change if your income goes up, and because of the  discrimination made legal in this bill, older people have to pay more.   So, basically, another way to think about this in terms of how costs  are going up is the more you need healthcare, the less help you get. If  you are low-income and you are older, you get less help. If you are  younger and higher income, comparatively, you get more help from this  bill. Again, that is not attacking a problem that I hear about very  often. People who need more help tend to need more help.   Here is the second chart. All of this is done in order to give a big  tax cut. So here is the amount of tax cuts in this bill for people  making $10,000; here is the amount for people making $20,000 to  $30,000; here is the amount of the tax cut one gets if you are at  $50,000 to $60,000. We see a trend line. It is about the same amount if  you are making $10,000 up to about $200,000. The amount of tax cut you  get from this bill in that range is zero. But if you are making  $200,000 or more, well, here is where the money is, up to the point  where people who are making the highest incomes in this country get  over $1 million in tax cuts.   It repeals some tax provisions in the Affordable Care Act that were  used to finance the subsidies, but all of those tax provisions affect  the very top income level earners. So there is a tax cut in this bill,  but it gives you zero if you make less than $200,000 a year. It gives  you a lot if you are making more than $200,000 a year.   Here is the last chart: less care. Here is what CBO says will happen  if the Affordable Care Act remains. This is a really important line to  look at here because part of the narrative, part of the explanation for  this piece of legislation is that, in Paul Ryan's words, ObamaCare is  in a ``death spiral,'' and Donald Trump says it is ``collapsing.''    The Congressional Budget Office--which is run by a man who was  handpicked by the Republican caucus in the  [[Page S1918]]  House--the Congressional Budget Office says: No, actually, it is not  collapsing; it is not in a death spiral. If we do nothing and allow the  Affordable Care Act to remain--yes, over 10 years, the number of people  without insurance will go up by a little bit, up to 28 million, but the  death spiral happens if you pass TrumpCare. There is a death spiral  coming into the American healthcare system. There is a humanitarian  catastrophe that is about to hit us, but it only happens if you choose  to pass this piece of legislation that is pending before the House of  Representatives today.   Now, I hear this legislation can't pass the U.S. Senate because my  Republican colleagues understand this. So I am not necessarily talking  directly to my Republican colleagues here because I trust that they  understand the collapse of the American healthcare system that occurs  when, in a very short period of time, you create 24 million more  uninsured people.   But, remember, Donald Trump said during the campaign that no one was  going to lose healthcare. Republicans in the House said that everyone  who is on healthcare today will get to keep it. CBO says that is not  even close to true. In the first 2 years, 14 million people lose care,  and eventually those who are uninsured goes to 52 million. The  Presiding Officer knows this, and my Republican colleagues here know  this.   This 52 million, it is not that they are totally outside of the  American healthcare system. If there is an emergency, they go to an  emergency room, and the emergency room covers their care. That is the  most inhumane way to run a healthcare system, to wait until you are so  sick, so ill, that your cancer has ravaged your body so badly, you have  to show up in the emergency room, but they will get that care--often  the most expensive care--and we will all pay for it. Part of the reason  that CBO says that rates will go up is because this 52 million gets  their care from emergency rooms. The emergency rooms and the hospitals  pass that cost along to private insurers, and everybody's premiums go  up.   Here is another way to think of this. I know these numbers tend to  get a little hard to digest, a little hard to understand as they get  thrown around. Here is what 24 million people losing healthcare looks  like. How many people is 24 million? Twenty-four million is the entire  combined population of Alaska, Delaware, Hawaii, Idaho, Kansas, Maine,  Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Mexico, North Dakota,  Rhode Island, South Dakota, Vermont, West Virginia, and Wyoming. This  isn't a minor shift in the number of people who will not have  healthcare. This is a seismic change. The entire population of 17  States loses healthcare over the course of 10 years if this bill is  passed.   By the way, let's be honest about who these people are. Yes, many of  them will be people losing healthcare in the private marketplace. CBO  says people who have private insurance will lose it because of this  bill, either because their cost-sharing goes up and they can't afford  it or because their employer might not offer it any longer. But a lot  of this is in the Medicaid population, and you have to make a decision.  The Medicaid population is, by and large, poor people, disabled people,  elderly Americans, a lot of children, a lot of kids. The Members are  going to have to make a decision about whether their conscience will be  OK with 24 million. Most of them are pretty sick and disabled and  pretty young--if you are OK with that many people losing coverage.   So Paul Ryan is right; it is a three-pronged approach. The three  prongs are higher costs, less care, in order to finance tax cuts for  the rich. It doesn't solve any problem that exists today in the  healthcare system, except for maybe, as I mentioned, that very narrow  issue of young, healthy, affluent Americans. They will probably do a  little bit better here. But everybody else does worse.   By the way, here is what CBO says is the reason why those young,  affluent healthy Americans do better--because you kick old people off  of insurance. The only reason that premiums stabilize in years 3 and 4  and 5, according to CBO, is because this bill jettisons millions of  older, relatively sicker Americans off of healthcare. So as you just  kick old people off healthcare, then it gets a little bit cheaper for  the younger people who remain.   So even the small percentage of Americans who, from a monetary  standpoint, do a little bit better under this bill, they only do better  because individuals who really needed care lose it under this approach.   This bill is moving really, really fast. It is moving really, really  fast. Its impact is absolutely stunning. My hope is that it gets stuck  somehow, that Senators of goodwill recognize, as Bill Kristol did in  his tweet, that this bill doesn't actually solve any problems. Maybe  they recognize that it looks an awful lot like the Affordable Care Act.  For the Speaker's reputation as being a big ideas guy, there are no new  ideas in this legislation. It is essentially just the Affordable Care  Act dialed down from 10 to 3.5, making healthcare unaffordable for  everybody. The subsidies are still there; they are just much less. The  individual mandate is still there; it just applies it in a different,  more cruel way. Instead of paying a penalty when you lose coverage, you  now pay a penalty when you lose coverage and try to sign up again. It  is the same concept; it is just the penalty applied at a different  place, and the insurance requirements are there.   So there are no new ideas. If you were ideologically opposed to the  Affordable Care Act, there is no reason why this solves any of your  problems. And from a practical consideration, it raises costs, it  doesn't improve insurance, and it kicks a lot of people off healthcare.   My final thought is this: I know this issue of healthcare has become  probably the most partisan, in part because there are some real  important philosophical questions at the heart of this debate. I don't  apologize for the fact that I do believe that healthcare should be  looked at as a human right. I really think that in this country, we  give you access to education; we should give you access to healthcare  as well. You are living in the most powerful, most affluent country in  the world. You probably shouldn't die because you are not rich enough  to afford access to a doctor. It seems like something we should be able  to do for you. So there are some serious ideological differences  because I know a lot of my Republican colleagues don't view it that  way. They view healthcare as a commodity much more so than I do. But we  have shown the ability to work together on healthcare and on some  pretty controversial pieces of it.    At the end of 2016, just 2 months ago, we passed the 21st Century  Cures Act. That wasn't easy. That was $6 billion of additional spending  on medical research in this country. It included legislation that  Senator Cassidy and I wrote--the Mental Health Reform Act--that had  some tough reforms on our insurance markets requiring insurance  companies to cover more mental illness. We had to work through some  very tough issues with Senator Cornyn, who opposed our legislation  until we worked out issues he had, and then he became a supporter and  champion of it. We had to work through some difficult issues, but we  passed a big healthcare bill at the end of 2016, with Republicans and  Democrats supporting it. Frankly, in the end, some progressive  Democrats voted against it and some conservative Republicans voted  against it. It wasn't without controversy even until that final vote.  But we have shown the ability to be able to work together, so why don't  we do the same thing here?   I submit there are still big problems in the healthcare system. The  Affordable Care Act didn't solve every problem out there, and even some  aspects of the Affordable Care Act have to be amended, have to be  changed. But let's work together on ways to keep what is working in the  Affordable Care Act and make improvements to the parts that aren't  working as well. Let's move into territory that we haven't covered yet,  like drug prices, and do something about that.   Donald Trump, the President of the United States, gave a speech  earlier this week in which he told Americans that if you pass this  legislation, drug prices will come ``way, way, way down.'' That is his  quote, that drug prices will come ``way, way, way down.'' That is not  in this bill. TrumpCare doesn't have anything that controls drug  prices. Drug prices are not coming way, way, way down, but  [[Page S1919]]  we could work together to try to make sure that happens. We could have  a tough conversation about what we are willing to pay when it comes to  drugs, whether we are willing to let the rest of the world free ride on  the contribution of the United States to global research and  development. That would be a very important discussion to have. I bet  it wouldn't get all 100 of us, but it would allow for Republicans and  Democrats to work together.   Instead of ramming this bill through this process, through the  reconciliation process, which means you can do it without a single  Democrat supporting it, let's sit together and try to work out a  bipartisan approach to improving our healthcare system.   I know why Speaker Ryan is pushing this bill through so fast. He  knows it doesn't solve any problems that exist in the American  healthcare system. He knows that the only problem it solves is a  political problem--a political problem created by the promise that  Republicans and this President made to repeal the Affordable Care Act.  But because they are doing it so fast, so ham-handedly, the replacement  is going to result in disaster for Americans. That is not me saying  that. That is the Congressional Budget Office. That is Bill Kristol.  That is Republicans and Democrats all across the country.   Whatever happens tomorrow in the House of Representatives, the Senate  will have a chance to be the adults in this conversation. Senate  Republicans will have a chance to take a big step back and start over,  and they can start over in a partisan way, or they can start over by  reaching out to Democrats and saying: Let's try to work this out  together. We may not get to that point where we have a bipartisan  agreement, but, boy, it would be nice if my Senate Republican  colleagues would at least try because if they don't, then Paul Ryan is  right--there will be three prongs to what will be called TrumpCare, if  it isn't already: higher costs for consumers, less care for Americans,  all in order to finance a giant tax cut for the rich. This isn't what  the American people thought they were getting, and we have a chance in  the Senate to do so much better.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Dr. Laura  Willing, a health fellow in my office, be granted floor privileges for  the remainder of the year.
