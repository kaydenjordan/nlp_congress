 Mr. Speaker, I would like all members of the  Texas delegation to join me.   Mr. Speaker, today I would like to recognize and pay tribute to the  life and legacy of former Congressman, fellow Texan, and a dear friend,  Ralph Hall.   Congressman Hall served the people of the great State of Texas for  nearly a half century: 10 years as a Texas State Senator from the Ninth  District, and 34 years as a Member of the U.S. House of Representatives  from Texas' Fourth District. He genuinely enjoyed public service, and  he was good at it as well.   Known throughout the Halls of Congress as an effective legislator,  Congressman Hall made great legislative strides in the science field  and was a top advocate for the country's space program during his time  as both chairman and ranking member of the House Science, Space, and  Technology Committee.   Congressman Hall was the first to reach out and offer his assistance  when I was first elected to the House of Representatives. He helped me  learn the ins and outs of Washington. No matter the party affiliation  or political leaning, Congressman Hall was a man who could always be  counted on and one who enjoyed a good joke.   Congressman Hall was preceded in death by his wife, Mary Ellen Murphy  Hall; sister, Rosemary Hall Scott; and brother, Hugh Hall. He is  survived by his three sons--Hamp, Brett, and Blakeley Hall--and many  wonderful grandchildren.   Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the entire Texas congressional delegation,  I would like to pay respects to Congressman Hall for a life dedicated  to his family, his country, and his constituents. The Texas community  will miss him dearly, and we will be presenting Congressman Hall's  family with a flag that was flown over the Capitol today.                            ____________________
