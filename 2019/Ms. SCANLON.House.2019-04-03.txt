During  consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose  of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members be  given 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Mr. Speaker, on Monday, the Rules Committee met and  reported a rule, House Resolution 281, providing for consideration of  H.R. 1585, the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2019,  under a structured rule.   The rule self-executes a manager's amendment that makes technical  changes to reflect appropriate statute sections, corrects  terminologies, and makes in order 40 amendments.   Mr. Speaker, this year, we are celebrating the 25th anniversary of  the Violence Against Women Act, VAWA, a landmark piece of bipartisan  legislation that has helped to reduce instances of domestic violence  and ensure that millions of survivors have access to the services they  need.   VAWA was the first piece of Federal legislation to acknowledge  domestic violence and sexual assault as crimes and has dramatically  improved our Nation's response to helping survivors in both the short  and long term.   Since its enactment in 1994, VAWA has brought together law  enforcement, social service organizations, and victims' advocates to  bring domestic violence to light, provide survivors with support, and  hold abusers accountable for their actions.   VAWA was and still is a piece of legislation developed by the people  who work closest to these issues in their communities. The bipartisan  bill we will vote on this week reflects the ongoing commitment of  Members on both sides of the aisle to ending domestic violence and  abuse in all forms.   Before I get further into the components and details of the bill, I  would like to share two stories about my constituents to illustrate why  VAWA reauthorization is so necessary and why we must continue to commit  ourselves to preventing domestic violence at every opportunity.   Mr. Speaker, please keep in mind that each of these stories happened  in the past week in my district.   First, last week, a young woman was murdered by her ex-husband at a  convenience store, where the two were meeting to exchange custody of  their 6-year-old son. The ex-husband left their son at home and,  instead, brought an AR-15 style rifle, which he used to murder the  woman in the middle of the store.   He was caught by law enforcement after he fled the store, but as a  result of these horrific actions, a young woman was murdered in cold  blood and a child has, effectively, lost both parents.   This was not the first time the ex-husband had threatened to kill his  ex-wife during a child custody exchange just like the one this past  week. Following an incident 3 years ago, he was charged with harassment  and making terroristic threats, and the woman was granted a protection- from-abuse order.   But this didn't prevent her or her family from living in fear of what  her ex-husband might do next. Tragically, the very worst happened.   Then, just this past Sunday evening, another woman was asleep in her  home in Upland with her three children when, just after midnight, her  ex-boyfriend broke into her house, entered  [[Page H2994]]  her bedroom, and shot her. Her 5-year-old child witnessed the shooting.  Had the gun not jammed when the ex-boyfriend fired a second time, the  victim would be dead.   This victim, too, had a protection-from-abuse order against her  attacker, hers being issued just 5 days before that attack.   These two attacks happened just miles apart from each other, just a  few days apart. These stories are all too common, because violence  against women is all too common.   I am willing to bet that every Member of this body could point to  similar examples of violence against women from their own congressional  districts. Such acts of violence are not isolated incidents but are,  instead, representative of the larger systemic problem.   According to the National Center on Domestic Violence, one in four  women experiences severe intimate partner physical violence, intimate  partner sexual violence, or intimate partner stalking, with impacts  such as injury, fearfulness, post-traumatic stress disorder, and more.   The same organization found that one in three women has experienced  some form of physical violence by an intimate partner, and one in seven  women has been stalked by an intimate partner during their lifetime, to  the point they felt very fearful or believed that they or someone close  to them would be harmed or killed.   Intimate partner violence accounts for 15 percent of violent crimes  nationwide. Women between the ages of 18 and 24 are the most commonly  abused by an intimate partner.   It is absolutely no wonder why domestic victimization is correlated  with a higher rate of depression and suicidal behavior later in life.   Further, 19 percent of domestic violence involves a weapon of some  kind. The presence of a gun in a domestic violence situation increases  the risk of homicide by 500--that is 500--percent. You don't need to be  a mathematician in order to see that guns in the hands of domestic  abusers routinely leads to violence and death.   The Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act recognizes this  indisputable fact and takes active measures to correct and improve our  laws.   In the United States, women are 21 times more likely to be killed  with a gun than women in any other high-income country.   Mr. Speaker, 4\1/2\ million American women alive today have been  threatened by intimate partners with firearms. One million of those  have actually been shot or shot at by their abusers.   I have represented some of these women and have seen the fear that  they live with and the impact it has on their children and families.   This bill finally closes the boyfriend loophole. While Federal law  prevents gun possession by people convicted of, or under a restraining  order for, abusing their spouses, dating partners are generally exempt  from these restrictions.   This gaping hole in our gun safety laws has become even more deadly  over the years. The share of homicides committed by dating partners has  been increasing for three decades. Today, women are as likely to be  killed by dating partners as they are by spouses.   Closing the boyfriend loophole is a fact-based, commonsense response  to a very real threat.   The provisions in this reauthorization would protect women from  abusive dating partners by ensuring that their abusers are prohibited  from possessing guns under Federal law.   The definition of ``dating partner'' is already contained in the  Violence Against Women Act. This simple update to policy will provide  increased protections for partners in unmarried relationships.   Closing the boyfriend loophole has been a bipartisan issue since long  before this bill. Last year, six Republicans cosponsored legislation  that would have closed this loophole, and 23 States, in their own laws,  have already acted to prevent abusers from obtaining guns, including  Pennsylvania and Arizona.   It is time we update Federal law to reflect the reality, which our  States have already recognized, and prevent violent dating partners  from being able to access weapons.   This bill also closes the stalker loophole. Stalking has been shown  to be a predictor of intimate partner violence and homicide, although  current law does not prohibit misdemeanor stalking offenses.   A study of intimate partner homicides and attempted homicides  involving female victims found that 76 percent of those murders and 85  percent of attempted murders were preceded by at least one incident of  stalking before the attack.   Passing this bill will protect women from stalkers by ensuring those  convicted of stalking offenses are prohibited from possessing guns  under Federal law.   On top of limiting stalkers and abusive dating partners from legally  owning weapons, this bill strengthens enforcement by alerting State and  local law enforcement when an abuser fails a firearms background check.  This notice gives State law enforcement an opportunity to intervene  before an abuser can obtain a firearm or do any further harm.   This provision mirrors a bipartisan bill that was introduced earlier  this year to notify State law enforcement each time a person who is not  allowed to have guns tries to buy a firearm and fails the background  check. Clearly, keeping guns out of the hands of those who should not  have them is a bipartisan priority.   Mr. Speaker, one of my first experiences as a young attorney was  representing women and families who had sought shelter at the People's  Emergency Center in West Philadelphia. That agency was started by  former Congressman Bob Edgar.   Most of the women in that shelter had been subjected to domestic  abuse. This was before VAWA was the law of the land, but even then it  was clear there were significant problems with how the system cared for  abused women and punished their abusers.   When VAWA was enacted in 1994, it spoke to so many of the problems my  then-clients were facing, issues with housing and employment, caring  for young children, and fighting for custody in court.   What makes VAWA such a critical bill is not just the legal  protections it puts in place to protect women but the structures it  sets up to help women who have been abused.   This reauthorization bill builds upon those critical reforms from 25  years ago and updates them to address current needs.   The bill funds and improves screening for victimization and the  perpetration of intimate partner and sexual violence across federally  funded healthcare programs. The healthcare system is often one of the  first places women go where unseen abuse can be detected. Empowering  healthcare professionals to address such sensitive situations can help  to avert abuse before it escalates or prevent it from happening in the  first place.   The bill ensures that survivors of domestic abuse can maintain  housing in the event of a breakup with their partner and further  protects their privacy through strengthened confidentiality agreements  with housing authorities. Similarly, the bill extends traditional  housing grant opportunities to organizations that help underserved  populations.   Victims of domestic abuse are often at risk of significant financial  loss if they are unable to work and provide for their family as a  result of abuse. This bill protects survivors from termination from  employment due to disruption caused by domestic abuse and also  addresses the impact of domestic abuse on a woman's credit rating.   We should also note that transgender people are disproportionately  survivors of sexual assault and violence, and they deserve to access  services consistent with their gender identity.   Domestic violence providers and law enforcement agree: Transgender  women being in the same space as other women does not make either less  safe. Laws that prohibit discrimination based on gender identity have  been in place for years, including specifically for VAWA programs.   Minneapolis, for example, has had gender identity protections since  1975, and there is no credible evidence that the existence of these  laws has contributed to violence against women. Instead, they simply  keep transgender people safe.    Since 1994, VAWA has provided critical tools to survivors of domestic  [[Page H2995]]  abuse, law enforcement, and community organizations to prevent and  address the impact of domestic violence. Using those tools to represent  survivors of such abuse, I have seen both clients and constituents find  safe havens, rebuild their lives, protect their families, and develop  emotionally and financially productive lives.   Mr. Speaker, I look forward to reauthorization of this bill, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   This is not the first time that I have heard my colleagues misgender  trans women as biological males, and I need to point something out.  Beyond this term being outright offensive, it shows how disingenuous  their concern for the safety of women is, and they are showing their  hand.   The use of the term ``biological male'' is a dog whistle to  transphobia that runs rampant in society and seems to on the other side  of the aisle. It is not rooted in concern for women but, rather, a  manifestation of their disdain for the trans community.   Also, my constituents are not the Senate. My constituents are not Mr.  McConnell. My constituents want VAWA reauthorized, and we are going to  do what we can to pass it.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Maine (Ms.  Pingree).    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman from Maine an  additional 30 seconds.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, we have heard this allegation over and over again based  on one case in Fresno where the facts have not been established. It is  still in litigation.   As a former trial lawyer, I know that a lot of allegations can be  made, but the fact that what has been stated as facts in this case,  that men were in a shelter, is not true. Transgender women were in the  shelter.   It has been stated that a transgender man couldn't be excluded from  the shelter and that the staff at the shelter failed to take action.  That actually is under dispute.   So we have one isolated instance that is being misrepresented to  continue this line of argument. What we are really seeing is this  tactic of trying to pit one minority group, one group in need of  services, against another to convince us that the rights and  protections of one group come at the cost of another. They have done it  with people of color, with immigrants, and now with women and members  of the trans community.   Mr. Speaker, I have a clear message: this country is better than  that. They both need help. It can be done under this law.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from the District  of Columbia (Ms. Norton).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Florida (Ms. Frankel).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).                                time  1315     Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentlewoman from Texas.    Mr. Speaker, the NRA has spent a lot of money to create  this distraction, making this about them as opposed to protecting the  lives of women. Over 50 percent of women murdered in 2017 were slain by  an intimate partner or family member; 82 percent of homicide victims  targeted by intimate partners are women; the weapon of choice in over  half of female homicides, a firearm.   This is an opportunity to support both saving the lives of women and  responsible gun ownership.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs.  Carolyn B. Maloney).   ( Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Lee).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   I have to rebut my colleague's repeated assertion that this iteration  of VAWA would violate the Second Amendment because it fails to offer an  opportunity for abusers to protest having their guns taken away--and  the gentlewoman said this several times in the course of debate--on the  basis that ex parte orders are often entered against abusers.   But, in fact, in every instance, even if an initial order is an ex  parte, the abuser has the right to request a hearing, including in  Arizona, where title 12, section 1809 provides that anyone who has a  protection order entered against them can file a written request for a  hearing, and that is when they get their due process. So I just want to  point that out.   The purpose of the Violence Against Women Act is today as it was when  it was passed in 1994: to keep women safe from domestic abuse. It  remains a piece of bipartisan landmark legislation.   Ms. Jackson Lee detailed the number of Republican amendments and  bills that have been incorporated into this version, so it is a shining  example of what Congress can accomplish when we set aside our partisan  differences and work together to find actual solutions.   VAWA has dramatically improved our Nation's response to domestic  violence and has provided invaluable support to victims, communities,  social service providers, and law enforcement. It is working.   We won't solve domestic violence overnight, nor will we end it with  the passage of a bill, but we can continue to change the culture of  violence against women and provide the support that survivors need.   The two constituents I spoke of in my opening never should have  experienced the violence that was inflicted upon them; but it is not  enough to condemn what was done or to charge those responsible, no. We  must change the conditions to allow such acts of violence to occur.   We can look at the facts and we can look at the research so we create  policies and pass laws to better protect women from abusers, and this  reauthorization is a bold step in the right direction.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on the rule and the previous  question.   The material previously referred to by Mrs. Lesko is as follows:         At the end of the resolution, add the following:        Sec. 2. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution, the       House shall proceed to the consideration in the House of the       bill (H.R. 1741) to reauthorize Department of Justice       programs that combat violence against women, and for other       purposes. All points of order against consideration of the       bill are waived. The bill shall be considered as read. All       points of order against provisions in the bill are waived.       The previous question shall be considered as ordered on the       bill and on any amendment thereto to final passage without       intervening motion except: (1) one hour of debate equally       divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority       member of the Committee on the Judiciary; and (2) one motion       to recommit.        Sec. 3. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H.R. 1741.     Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I  move the previous question on the resolution.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself as much time as I may consume.   Mr. Chair, I rise today to offer an amendment to study the return on  investment of legal services for survivors of domestic violence.   As a former legal services board member and director of a pro bono  program, I know the importance of legal representation for the most  vulnerable members of our community.   Access to justice is especially critical when it comes to survivors  of domestic violence and human trafficking. Too often, survivors are  left to navigate the overwhelming fallout of abuse alone, whether that  means seeking custody, housing, medical care, employment protections,  or other legal assistance.   In the aftermath of abuse, legal remedies are often complicated and  hard to manage, and legal representation in these critical moments can  make a life-changing difference. Sometimes that means a lawyer who can  remove the abuser from the home so the survivor doesn't lose their  housing; other times, it is an attorney helping a survivor access the  medical resources to heal from physical and mental injuries.   Access to justice remains a crucial issue in our legal system, and  one of the key contributions of VAWA is that it recognizes the  importance of legal services for the survivors of abuse. So not only  does VAWA provide critical medical and housing services, but it  provides legal representation that often saves public dollars.   As with many social services, upfront investment in legal services  can result in long-term benefits and savings. That is why my amendment  would ask the GAO to conduct a study about the economic benefits of  investments in legal services provided under the jurisdiction of VAWA.   It is important that we have a full grasp of the importance of these  investments so that my colleagues and I can continue pushing for robust  investment in these critical legal resources. I urge my colleagues to  support this amendment and the underlying bill.  [[Page H3030]]    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I thank the distinguished gentleman from  Georgia, and I thank my colleagues for their support.   Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr.  Nadler).    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
