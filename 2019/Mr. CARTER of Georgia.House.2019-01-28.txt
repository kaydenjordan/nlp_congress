 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember the life  of Young Harris College trustee emeritus and former United States  Representative from the Third District of Georgia, Mr. Jack T.  Brinkley, Sr., who passed away on January 23 at the age of 88.   Mr. Brinkley was a true public servant who quietly helped numerous  individuals. Before his 16-year career as a Member of Congress, he  taught school, piloted planes in the Air Force, and moved to west  Georgia to be close to his wife's family.   After serving in Congress, he returned home to work in his family law  firm. Even with his low profile, Mr. Brinkley did significant work. He  introduced over 650 bills, most of which involved veterans. He had a  gift for remembering names and key qualities of his constituents, but  most importantly, Mr. Brinkley was a genuine, selfless, high-character  public servant who will be deeply missed.   My thoughts and prayers are with his family and friends during this  time.                            ____________________
