 Madam Speaker, we need to shift from the economic to the  biological focus on defeating this disease.   Everyone should wear a mask, including you, Mr. President, whenever  you might be within 6 feet.   And we need to provide free masks to the homeless and others.   We need more money for better paid sick leave so all those with  symptoms can stay home.   And so far, only one-tenth of 1 percent of the coronavirus money has  gone for medical research to prevent and treat the virus.   Now, I am pleased this bill has money for testing and to develop new  tests. The next bill needs $5 billion to research therapeutics.
