 Mr. President, today I rise to honor the life and  legacy of William M. Detweiler who passed away on March 27, 2019, at  age 79. Mr. Detweiler was a lifelong advocate for veterans and a former  national commander of the American Legion. His commitment to our  country stands as a shining example for every American. He leaves  behind a legacy of compassion for his fellow servicemembers that  touched everyone who knew him.   Mr. Detweiler was born in New Orleans, LA, on January 28, 1940. He  was a graduate of St. Aloysius High School and Loyola University, where  he earned both his undergraduate and law degrees.   Mr. Detweiler served as a captain in the U.S. Army Intelligence Corps  and, later, as assistant chief of staff for the U.S. Army Defense  Center at Fort Bliss, TX. He then joined the U.S. Army Reserve and  returned home to New Orleans to practice law.   During his law career, Mr. Detweiler served on various local, State,  and national veterans committees. In 1973, President Nixon appointed  him to serve on the Veterans Administration's National Rehabilitation  and Education Advisory Committee, which he later went on to chair.   As a member of the American Legion, Mr. Detweiler served in a number  of capacities including Department of Louisiana judge advocate,  chairman of the National Public Relations Commission, chairman of the  National Foreign Relations Commission, national vice commander, and  national commander.   While serving as national commander of the American Legion, he fought  for the extension of service-connected disability benefits for Vietnam  veterans exposed to Agent Orange. He was also involved in the planning  and development of the National D-Day Museum in the heart of New  Orleans, which later became the National WWII Museum.   In his most recent leadership role with the American Legion, Mr.  Detweiler served as the chairman of the organization's traumatic brain  injury--TBI--and posttraumatic stress disorder-PTSD-committee. He was  serving as chairman of that committee on March 27, 2019, when his final  battle, with pancreatic cancer, came to an end.   William M. Detweiler was a tireless advocate for the veterans  community, and we thank him for his lifetime of service to our  country.                            ____________________
