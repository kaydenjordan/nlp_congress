 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and legacy of  Linda Lambourne, a loving wife, compassionate mother, dedicated public  servant, and a pillar in the community of Santa Clarita.   Linda served this esteemed body as an aide to my predecessor,  Congressman Buck McKeon. She later continued her public service in the  office of my dear friend, California State senator, Scott Wilk.   Her energy, kindness, and commitment to the people of her community  was felt by everyone who had the privilege of meeting her. Linda was  deeply admired and loved by her family and the people of Santa Clarita.   Mr. Speaker, although she was diagnosed with ALS nearly 3 years ago,  Linda never lost her vibrant spirit, as her memory continues, to this  day, to be a light in our community.   She is survived by her husband, Steve; her two daughters, Lindsey and  Angie; and her five grandchildren. While California may have lost a  dear friend with her passing, her joy and wealth of kindness will  continue to spread from everyone she touched.   May God bless her and her family, and may she rest in peace.                            ____________________
