 Mr. President, I want to thank Senator Shaheen for her  leadership, and I am proud to be one of the cosponsors of her bill with  her commonsense approach--which I believe is the one that will rule the  day--to work together on changes to the Affordable Care Act that will  help the American people.   I join my colleagues on the floor in sharing the concerns I have  heard from so many people in my State and across the country about the  bill that has been introduced by our colleagues. I also heard their  desire to have us work together to bring down the costs of healthcare  and to make fixes to the Affordable Care Act.   Healthcare leaders in my State have come out strongly against the  bill released last week because it would be devastating to the people  of our State, especially in our rural areas--rural hospitals--and  especially to our seniors who rely on Medicaid funding for nursing  homes and assisted living.   Last night we heard that we will not be proceeding to that bill, and,  instead, the majority leader wants to bring up repealing big parts of  the Affordable Care Act without a replacement. I just want to remind my  colleagues that the Congressional Budget Office has already looked at  this repeal without a replacement, and it is just as bad. Instead of 22  million people losing their insurance by 2026, the CBO has estimated  that about 32 million would lose insurance under the repeal approach,  and premiums would double. So this repeal effort doesn't help the host  of Minnesotans who, according to the Minnesota Medical Association,  would be harmed by what they call draconian Medicaid cuts.   It doesn't help our children's hospitals. I met with several last  week, and they were very concerned that Medicaid cuts would wreck their  ability to provide healthcare to our kids. This was something, by the  way, that I heard repeatedly on the Fourth of July. During the parades,  people would come out of the blue, out from the sides of the streets,  mixed in with the hot dogs and American flags, and there were these  families--predominantly families with kids with disabilities--and they  would bring children over to meet me and would say how important this  Medicaid funding is for their entire family. I remember that once, when  the mom brought her child over with Down syndrome, all of the people on  the parade route, on that block, cheered for that family.    We know that we are all in this together, and we know that what  happens to one family could, next year, happen to another family. You  can have a child with a disability. You can suddenly have a disease  that could be debilitating to your family's finances. Basically, we  never know what is going to happen to our health or to the health of  our family members. That is why we have health insurance, and we must  make sure that it is affordable.   In addition to that, we have had the CEOs of our healthcare system  stand up and say that these approaches would lead to major job losses  in our State. As I mentioned before, for seniors, AARP has said that,  in my State, nearly half of all of the adults who receive tax credits  under the Affordable Care Act are 50- to 64-year-olds and these  subsidies would be eliminated under the repeal bill. This could make  healthcare unaffordable, especially for the more than 350,000 people in  my State who are aged 50 to 64 who have preexisting conditions.   Now, it does not have to be this way, as Senator Shaheen has so  articulately pointed out. I know that several of my Republican  colleagues have said that they cannot support legislation that would  take away insurance for tens of millions of Americans, and I agree.  Instead of making these kinds of draconian cuts and moving backward, I  think we have to move forward to actually help make healthcare in  America better and more affordable.   We can and we should make changes to the Affordable Care Act. The day  it passed, I said this is the beginning and not the end. You simply  cannot have a major piece of legislation like that and go for years  without any significant changes. That is just not how it has worked  with major legislation in the past, but every time we have tried to  make changes, we have heard back that we have to repeal it. Maybe the  result of all of this chaos in the last month has been that people have  finally come to realize what the American people want, as Senator  Shaheen has pointed out, as well as what is the best policy, and that  is to make changes.   I support Senator Shaheen's Marketplace Certainty Act because it  would stabilize the individual market and protect and expand the vital  program that reduces out-of-pocket healthcare costs for consumers. I  also support the bill of Senator Kaine of Virginia, who is here with us  today, and Senator Carper, which is the Individual Health Insurance  Marketplace Improvement Act, which reestablishes a Federal reinsurance  program. By the way, this idea of reinsurance is something that our  Republican legislature in Minnesota just passed on a State basis and is  supportive of. So I see these as not just some pie-in-the-sky ideas. I  see these ideas as things that we can work on across the aisle.   I just want to end by talking about some of my ideas, many of which  have bipartisan support. Again, I throw them in a package of things  that we could be working on. I have a bill that would harness the  negotiating power of 41 million seniors who are on Medicare in order to  bring drug prices down. Right now, by law, Medicare is banned from  negotiating prices with all of  [[Page S4033]]  those seniors. Think of the better bargain that those seniors could get  if their marketing power were unleashed.   Senator McCain, the Presiding Officer's colleague, and I have a bill  to allow Americans to bring in safe, less expensive drugs from Canada,  which is, by the way, very similar to the American market. As I have  often noted, we can see Canada from our porch in Minnesota. We see  right across the border the kinds of prices they are able to get.  Senator McCain and I and several Republicans voted for a similar  measure, and we think we should be allowed to bring in less expensive  drugs from Canada and, perhaps, from other countries. You could also  tie to it a trigger, if there is no competition or if prices have  ballooned like they have for 4 of the top 10 selling drugs in this  country.   Senator Lee and I have a bill that would allow for the importation of  safe drugs from other countries when there is not healthy competition.   Senator Grassley and I have a bill to stop something called ``pay for  delay,'' which is when big pharmaceutical companies pay off generics in  order to keep their products off the market. It would be $3 billion in  savings for the U.S. Government by just passing that, and I would  challenge my colleagues to vote against something as simple as that.   Lastly is the CREATES Act, and Senators Grassley, Leahy, Feinstein,  Lee, and I have that bill, which makes sure that we get the samples so  that we can get generics on the market, create more competition, and  bring prices down.   This debate is about the patients of a nurse practitioner who  provides psychiatric care in my State.   She wrote to me:         Please, please, do all you can to prevent these people from       losing the health insurance coverage for medical and mental       healthcare that is so vital to their lives.    In Minnesota, one-third--32 percent--of the funding for our State's  mental health agencies comes from Medicaid, and across the country,  Medicaid expansion has helped 1.3 million people receive treatment for  mental health and substance abuse issues.   This debate is about the mom in Minnesota who has private insurance  and who has colon cancer. She is working full time, raising two school- age boys and going to chemo every single week. She said she fears she  will not be able to afford the care she needs to stay alive.   This debate is about the rural constituents whom I noted come up to  me at parades, like the Fourth of July, at nearly every other block,  and tell me their stories of how they are concerned about their kids  with disabilities and how they are concerned for their rural hospitals.   We have things we can do to make this better, and now is the time  when we must get them done. We have bipartisan support for these  changes to the Affordable Care Act. Let's work together on them across  the aisle, and let's remember that this is about one team, one country.  We can get this done.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.
