 Mr. Speaker, in a moment of crisis, the people of Ukraine  and around the world are looking to the United States for support and  leadership.   After an 80-day hiatus, Russia launched a wave of cruise missile  attacks on Ukraine on the Remembrance Day of the Holodomor, which is a  reflection of when the Soviet Union imposed a famine and killed  millions of Ukrainians in 1932 and 1933.   These attacks come just days after the Senate Republicans blocked  funding for Ukraine and Israel. Putin is watching. He is enjoying these  political fights, which is only giving him an advantage, he believes.  His propaganda machine is celebrating the legislative blockade that is  occurring as the first step to withdrawing total support for Ukraine.  Believe it.   The United States must send a strong message to Putin that we stand  strong and united with the people of Ukraine.   I have met with brave Ukrainian soldiers and their families who  shared that our support has given them hope that Ukraine will win this  fight. They will. Those who say Ukraine is losing the war are wrong.  Putin's goal to conquer Ukraine has failed. Ukraine has regained 50  percent of the land Russia originally took and has reopened the Black  Sea to allow them to export grain.   Meanwhile, the Ukrainian military has depleted the Russian army. From  a total of over 480,000 soldiers, Russia has lost over 320,000 who have  either been wounded or killed--think about that, over half their army-- forcing Putin to take coercive actions for new and inexperienced  personnel, even people from prison, and has desperately turned to North  Korea for supplies--all this at a cost for the United States of less  than 1 percent of our GDP and all without U.S. troops on the ground.  That is a very good deal.   Less than 10 percent of our annual defense budget has gone to assist  Ukraine's military, and it has destroyed almost 50 percent of Russia's  army. Compared to our allies in Europe, we rank 20th in giving to  Ukraine, when you factor in GDP. We need to pass a supplemental aid  package to provide immediate assistance, and we need to do it in an  overwhelming bipartisan way as we have before.   We are living during a seminal moment in the history of America and  the world we live in. Historians will look back years from now and  determine whether or not we made more good decisions than poor  decisions. This is an opportunity to make a good decision. We need to  pass the supplemental package to provide immediate assistance that our  ally Ukraine needs now.   We must provide humanitarian assistance for the Palestinians that  have been afflicted by the war and for Armenian refugees who have been  removed from their historical home in Nagorno-Karabakh.   We need to pass a package to let our European allies know that the  United States is reliable and consistent in support of democracies  around the world. The passage of this supplemental package also  provides support for Taiwan and restores American military inventory  that is so critical.   There is nothing more that Putin wants than to see this Congress and  our country divided. The Congress in November and December seemed to  have time for baseless impeachment inquiries but not the time to do the  most important things like provide funding for national defense, the  Federal Aviation Administration, and, most importantly, resolving our  differences and passing a budget.   I ask my Republican colleagues: What have we done? What are we doing?  When we gather around the holiday tables in the next 2 weeks and we ask  for good tidings in the new year, as Members of Congress, I think we  must ask ourselves: What have we done? What have we done to work  together in a bipartisan fashion to pass these critical bills? The  answer is nothing.   We must do more important things to provide for the American people  and the world that we live in. This is a seminal moment, as I said  before, in world history, and the world is watching. We cannot lose  sight of what is at stake. If we do not stop these threats against  freedom and democracy, we will fail. This, make no mistake about it, is  the test of our time.   I also wish for one and for all a happy holiday season. May the new  year bring us good tidings. Let us not forget about our  responsibilities as the world's lone superpower. We have  responsibilities. We are still, as President Reagan said, the beacon of  light on that shining hill.

Mr. Chair, let me speak in favor of this important bipartisan  legislation. The Whole Milk for Healthy Kids Act is an investment, I  believe, in our children's health and future.   This proposed legislation, let's be clear, does not change the  underlying law. For the 19 years that I have been on the House  Agriculture Committee, the school lunch and breakfast program has been  and should be a focus of attention by the House of Representatives and  the Congress.    Why?   It is because we provide the support for the school lunch and  breakfast programs.   And why else?   It is because we want our children to have the most nutrition  possible from lunch and breakfast.   In addition, we want to deal with issues of obesity and issues of  allergies. It is important for a healthy future.   Now, let me say that I know a little bit about this. My family and I  have been involved in the dairy business in California for three  generations, since the early 1920s. Dairy plays a critical role in the  nutritional diet of children as a leading food source for nutrients  that are critical for development and growth. We must provide healthy  nutrient-packed options that children will actually choose to consume,  ranging from nonfat to whole.   Milk provides 13 essential nutrients, as has been mentioned,  including three of the four nutrients of public health concern that  involve calcium, potassium, and vitamin D.   A few months ago I visited the Fresno Unified Nutrition Center.  Fresno Unified is the third largest school district in California with  73,000 students. They prepare 45,000 lunches a day and 15,000  breakfasts at 85 school centers. It is a big undertaking for this  nutritional program.   What we know is that for many of the kids, the breakfast or the lunch  they get is sometimes the best meal they get in a day, so, therefore,  we need to be focused on this. Our schools must be equipped with  nutritional school milk options. We must be available and flexible to  new scientific developments that are made.    Mr. Chair, our schools must be equipped with nutritional  school milk options, and this is what this legislation attempts to try  to do.   When kids like their school milk options that are flavorful and  tasty, they  [[Page H6903]]  consume them in the levels that they should. When kids, I think, like  their choices for lunch or breakfast, America succeeds.   Let me close by saying that every body needs milk.
