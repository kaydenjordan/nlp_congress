 Madam President, earlier this month, Illinois lost a  local legend after a courageous 5-year battle against cancer.   A lifelong Illinoisan and a 50-year public servant, Larry Walsh, Sr.,  was known for his booming voice and big smile. He was a warm, welcoming  presence in my life and the lives of his family, friends, and countless  others.   Larry, much like the communities he would come to represent on the  local, county, and State levels, embodied the spirit and ethos of  Illinois. He was born in Elwood, into a family with deep roots in the  farming community. Dedicating his early life to the family trade, he  graduated Joliet Junior College, class of 1968, earning his associate's  degree in agriculture.   In 1970, at only the age of 21, he made his foray into politics,  winning an election to the local school board. Just 3 years later, he  was elected as Jackson Township supervisor--a position he took great  pride in and continued to hold until December of 2004.   He was first elected to the Will County Board in 1974--a county he  would ultimately lead as county executive for the last 16 years of his  life.   Will County is a great cross-section of Illinois. It is where the  farmlands of Central and Southern Illinois converge with the industry  of Chicago and Joliet. It is not only home to over 100,000 acres of  farmland, but it is also a booming transportation hub anchored by North  America's largest inland port, the CenterPoint Intermodal Center--a  project that Larry helped to land. Larry was one of the few Illinois  politicians who could credibly represent and be an advocate for both  Illinois's farming community and understand the region's need for  industrial expansion.   Throughout his career in public service, he was steadfastly committed  to bipartisanship--an absolute must for a leader who would help guide  Will County's development into the fastest growing county in our State.   Before he returned to the county board in 2004, Larry served in the  Illinois Senate, representing the 43rd District. In Springfield, he  befriended a fellow freshman Senator and seatmate on the floor, Barack  Obama. Their friendship would prove critical, as Larry helped introduce  him to the farming community in Will, Kankakee, and Iroquois Counties  and then became the first State senator to endorse him in what was then  considered a long-shot run for the U.S. Senate in 2004.   Larry's list of accomplishments is quite long and spans a crucial  time in Will County's development. During Larry's time in the State  senate and his return to lead the Will County Board, the county  experienced a 53-percent growth in size and now is the fourth largest  county in the State. Throughout his 16-year tenure as Will County  executive--the longest Will County executive tenure ever--he redoubled  his commitment to bipartisan, responsible community development. In  addition to helping land CenterPoint Intermodal, he helped establish  the Midewin National Tallgrass Prairie Reserve, championed the  construction of a new Will County sheriff's office law enforcement  center, and broke ground on the new Will County Courthouse that will  open this fall.   Beyond elected service, he remained deeply rooted in and dedicated to  his community. He was a member of the Joliet Exchange Club, the Elwood  Lions Club, Friends of Hospice, and many local chambers of commerce. He  passionately contributed to local charities, like MorningStar Mission,  Make-A-Wish Foundation, Boy Scouts of America, and Cornerstone, among  many others.   He was a lifelong parishioner of St. Rose of Lima Catholic Church in  Wilmington. He attended daily Mass and was a Eucharistic minister and a  member of the Knights of Columbus.   I can't begin to do justice to the legacy that Larry leaves behind,  but to his wife, Irene, of 50 years, his six children, and all the rest  of his loved ones, please know how much we all cared for  [[Page S2998]]  and how much we all respected Larry and how greatly he will be missed.   Thank you   I yield back.    Madam President, I continue with the reading of the  letter from Birmingham jail, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.         Yes, they have gone to jail with us. Some have been       dismissed from their churches, have lost the support of their       bishops and fellow ministers. But they have acted in the       faith that right defeated is stronger than evil triumphant.       Their witness has been the spiritual salt that has preserved       the true meaning of the gospel in these troubled times.        They have carved a tunnel of hope through the dark mountain       of disappointment. I hope the church as a whole will meet the       challenge of this decisive hour. But even if the church does       not come to the aid of justice, I have no despair about the       future. I have no fear about the outcome of our struggle in       Birmingham, even if our motives at present are misunderstood.       We will reach the goal of freedom in Birmingham and all over       the nation, because the goal of America is freedom. Abused       and scorned though we may be, our destiny is tied up with       America's destiny. Before the pilgrims landed at Plymouth, we       were here. Before the pen of Jefferson etched the majestic       words of the Declaration of Independence across the pages of       history, we were here. For more than two centuries, our       forebears labored in this country without wages; they made       cotton king; they built the homes of their masters while       suffering gross injustice and shameful humiliation--and yet       out of a bottomless vitality they continued to thrive and       develop. If the inexpressible cruelties of slavery could not       stop us, the opposition we now face will surely fail. We will       win our freedom because the sacred heritage of our nation and       the eternal will of God are embodied in our echoing demands.       Before closing I feel impelled to mention one other point in       your statement that has troubled me profoundly. You warmly       commended the Birmingham police force for keeping ``order''       and ``preventing violence.'' I doubt that you would have so       warmly commended the police force if you had seen its dogs       sinking their teeth into unarmed, nonviolent Negroes. I doubt       that you would so quickly commend the policemen if you were       to observe their ugly and inhumane treatment of Negroes here       in the city jail; if you were to watch them push and curse       old Negro women and young Negro girls; if you were to see       them slap and kick old Negro men and young boys; if you were       to observe them, as they did on two occasions, refuse to give       us food because we wanted to sing our grace together. I       cannot join you in your praise of the Birmingham police       department.        It is true that the police have exercised a degree of       discipline in handling the demonstrators. In this sense they       have conducted themselves rather ``nonviolently'' in public.       But for what purpose? To preserve the evil system of       segregation. Over the past few years I have consistently       preached that nonviolence demands that the means we use must       be as pure as the ends we seek. I have tried to make it clear       that it is wrong to use immoral means to attain moral ends.       But now I must affirm that it is just as wrong, or perhaps       even more so, to use moral means to preserve immoral ends.       Perhaps, Mr. Connor and his policemen had been rather       nonviolent in public, as was Chief Pritchett in Albany,       Georgia, but they have used the moral means of nonviolence to       maintain the immoral end of racial injustice. As T. S. Elliot       has said: ``The last temptation is the greatest treason: To       do the right deed for the wrong reason.''        I wish you had commended the Negro sit inners and       demonstrators of Birmingham for their sublime courage, their       willingness to suffer, and their amazing discipline in the       midst of great provocation. One day the South will recognize       its real heroes. They will be the James Merediths, with the       noble sense of purpose that enables them to face jeering and       hostile mobs, and with the agonizing loneliness that       characterizes the life of the pioneer. They will be old,       oppressed battered Negro women symbolized in a seventy two       year old woman in Montgomery,  [[Page S3004]]       Alabama, who rose up with a sense of dignity and with her       people decided not to ride segregated buses, and who       responded with ungrammatical profundity to one who inquired       about her weariness: ``My feets is tired, but my soul is at       rest.'' They will be the young high school and college       students, the young ministers of the gospel and a host of       their elders, courageously and nonviolently sitting in at       lunch counters and willingly going to jail for conscience'       sake. One day the South will know that when these       disinherited children of God sat down at lunch counters, they       were in reality standing up for what is best in the American       dream and for the most sacred values in our Judeo Christian       heritage, thereby bringing our nation back to those great       wells of democracy which were dug deep by the founding       founders in their formulation of the Constitution and the       Declaration of Independence.        Never before have I written so long a letter. I'm afraid it       is much too long to take your precious time. I can assure you       that it would have been much shorter if I had been writing       from a comfortable desk, but what else can one do when he is       alone in a narrow jail cell, other than write long letters,       think long thoughts, and pray long prayers?        If I have said anything in this letter that overstates the       truth and indicates an unreasonably impatience, I beg you to       forgive me. If I have said anything that understates the       truth and indicates my having a patience that allows me to       settle for anything less than brotherhood, I beg God to       forgive me.        I hope this letter finds you strong in the faith. I also       hope that circumstances will soon make it possible for me to       meet each of you, not as an integrationist or a civil-rights       leader but as a fellow clergymen and a Christian brother. Let       us all hope that the dark clouds of racial prejudice will       soon pass away and the deep fog of misunderstanding will be       lifted from our fear drenched communities, and in some not       too distant tomorrow, the radiant stars of love and       brotherhood will shine over our great nation with all their       scintillating beauty.        Yours for the cause of Peace and Brotherhood,                                            Martin Luther King, Jr.    I yield the floor
