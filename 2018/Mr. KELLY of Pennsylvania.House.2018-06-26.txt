 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  Warriors to Washington, a praiseworthy nonprofit organization from Erie  County, Pennsylvania.   Founded in 2013, Warriors to Washington was created to honor veterans  from the northwest Pennsylvania region who were deployed and served our  Nation in the Armed Forces as a result of the attacks on 9/11 by taking  them to historical and national sites in Washington, D.C.   Warriors to Washington raises money to fund an annual trip to  Washington, D.C., by which post-9/11 veterans are treated to an all- expense-paid experience, which includes visits to Arlington National  Cemetery, the Vietnam Memorial, the World War II Memorial, the Flight  93 Memorial Park, and many other sites of national significance.   Warriors to Washington focuses on camaraderie and connection, while  providing all attendees with a rewarding experience. The founder and  president of Warriors to Washington, Joe Pfadt, believes it is  important to give this opportunity to those who enlist and risk  everything for our freedom.  [[Page H5655]]    Joe Pfadt is a retired U.S. Army veteran himself, and has been  invigorated by giving back to our most recent veterans. He stresses the  significance of visiting our Nation's Capital and seeing the very  documents that every service person swears to defend: the U.S.  Constitution and the Declaration of Independence.   Each year, the Warriors to Washington trip grows and evolves,  continuously adapting to support the community and always striving to  benefit as many veterans as possible. I am overjoyed to see members of  my constituency stepping up to empower our veterans, and I am pleased  to recognize the Warriors to Washington organization, which I am proud  to say was founded in my district.   I ask my fellow colleagues in the House of Representatives to join me  in saluting the unwavering dedication of Warriors to Washington and all  those who are involved in their admirable efforts to serve our  veterans.                            ____________________
