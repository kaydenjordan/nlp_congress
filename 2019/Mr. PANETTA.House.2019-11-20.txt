 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the memory of Mike  Marotta, Sr., an entertainment legend, a Monterey native, and a  cornerstone of the Italian American community on the central coast of  California in my district.   I am sorry to say, Mike passed away earlier this week at the age of  98. Mike was a family man, a businessman, and a civic leader.   But I have to say everyone who knew him knew that music was Mike's  first and everlasting love. He taught himself how to play the accordion  when he was 11 years old. He would then take the accordion down to the  bay and play for the Italian fishermen coming back and unloading their  catch.   His musical journey even led him to Hollywood eventually, where he  played with stars like Roy Rogers and Dale Evans. During his military  service during World War II, he entertained the troops throughout the  United States.   Now, recently you could find Mike playing Italian songs with his kids  and grandkids and even at the Paisano Club, but also you could find him  continuing his tradition of playing for fishermen and our community at  the Festa Italia Santa Rosalia, the premier Italian American festival  on the central coast of California.  [[Page H9103]]    My condolences are with his family. Mike's civic-mindedness and his  musical gift will be missed by our community, but his legacy and his  love of music will be carried on by his family and friends through his  everlasting songs played by his son, but most importantly, through the  love in our hearts for Mike Marotta, Sr.                            ____________________
