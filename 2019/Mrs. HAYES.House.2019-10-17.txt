 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commend the chairman of the  Committee on Education and Labor for his steadfast leadership of the  reauthorization of the Higher Education Act, and introduction of the  College Affordability Act.   But I cannot do that without further recognizing my colleague and my  friend, Chairman Elijah Cummings, whose family was from South Carolina,  Clarendon County, to be exact, which is the home of the Briggs v.  Elliott case, one of the first cases challenging school segregation. He  understood the power of a high-quality education, and I know that he  would be so incredibly proud of this remarkable piece of legislation  that is being introduced this week.   This is an achievement that reflects the priorities of the entire  Democratic Caucus to expand opportunities and make college affordable  and accessible for all students.   I am proud that this bill embraces and reflects my priorities in  Congress, including the Pell Grant Restoration Act, the Teacher Debt  Relief Act, the Teacher Diversity and Retention Act, and the Jumpstart  on College Act.   These bills would respectively protect student aid of vulnerable  students who have been defrauded; provide educators with much-needed  student debt relief so that they can stay in the classroom; reinforce  critical programs that help develop a diverse educator workforce; and  provide a robust investment in dual-enrollment classes that will lower  the cost of a degree for students who need it most.   This bill is a year's-long effort to level the playing field for  every demographic of students across the country, from veteran  students, to working parents; and from small family farmers, to public  servants. It is for students hoping to become the first in their family  to go to college and afford it.   This bill is for families who struggle to put enough in the bank for  their children's education. This bill is for students who struggle to  fill out the overly complicated FAFSA; who struggle to earn degrees and  keep the lights on while working and raising children; who utilize the  Pell grant and other Federal aid to make it through, and still find  themselves in debt.   My own journey reflects the challenges of navigating a system that  simply is not built for everyone, of jumping through untenable hurdles  to complete a degree. So it is deeply gratifying today to be part of  the change that I so desperately needed as a student, to give a new,  more diverse generation of students the supports they need to succeed.   The College Affordability Act would immediately lower the cost of  college  [[Page H8205]]  for students and families across the country by expanding Pell grants,  incentivizing free community colleges, and driving States to  substantially reinvest in their public institutions.   The bill invests in teachers by fixing a broken Public Service Loan  Forgiveness program and TEACH Grant system, and permanently funding  historically Black colleges and universities and minority-serving  institutions, all proven incubators of diverse educators.   The bill raises the quality of higher education by holding  accreditors and schools accountable and weeding out bad actors. The  bill also improves the completion rate for underserved communities  through more robust and flexible student support.   This bill tackles the growing student default crisis by making  student loans cheaper to take out, simpler to understand, and easier to  pay off.   With the passage of the College Affordability Act, for-profit  colleges will no longer be able to look at students as mere profit  centers to swindle out of their Pell or GI dollars.   The bill closes loopholes to prevent veterans and low-income students  from predatory for-profit institutions and creates more guardrails to  ensure that every student can have the peace of mind that the degree  they are investing in has value upon graduation.   That is all Americans want--the opportunity to get an education that  opens the doors to a life of achievement, fulfillment, and economic  power, and to be self-sufficient.   The College Affordability Act is a downpayment on the success and  financial stability of students in my district and across the country.  I am proud to have contributed to it and I support it here today.                            ____________________
