 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, now, at the beginning, before I speak  on the business of the day, I would like to add that yesterday we were  all overjoyed, just thrilled, to hear from our colleague, our dear  friend, Senator Ben Ray Lujan.   Through his first public video message shared on social media, Ben  Ray reiterated yesterday that his recovery is going well; that his  office continues to work serving the people of New Mexico; and that he  expects, praise God, to make a full recovery.   I have been able to get on the phone with him in recent days. He was  chipper. He sounded like the same Ben Ray we have come to know and  love, and I can report he is in very good spirits, raring to go.   From now until his return, all of us in the Senate miss him greatly.  We are rooting for him. We cannot wait to see him walk through the  doors of this Chamber once again to get back to work.                          Business Before The Senate    Madam President, now on Senate business, on Postal, last week, as you  know, the House passed, with overwhelming bipartisan support--I believe  a majority from each party--the most important update to the U.S.  Postal Service in decades.   The Postal bill is the definition of legislation that should sail  through the Congress. Both sides support it. It had diligent work by  both Democrats and Republicans, with major input from  [[Page S654]]  both parties. Everyone knows we need it, and the American people so  strongly support action to put our Postal Service on sustainable  footing.   Our incredible postal workers give us their very best every single  day they are on the job. They deserve no less in return.   So many people depend on the mail. You could be a veteran; the VA  sends your prescriptions through the mail. About one-fifth of Social  Security recipients, as I understand, don't have the internet and  depend on the mail. Small businesses depend on the mail. Rural areas  depend on the mail. Just about everybody does. People don't want snail  mail.   It has been no fault of the workers at the post office that postal  delivery is slow. They don't have the resources they need, and, in  part, they don't have the resources they need because they have a  crazy, antediluvian-type system of how they calculate pensions and  healthcare.   We have to change all this. We have been waiting a long, long time.  Later today, I am going to move to have the Senate approve a few  technical fixes to the bill so we can move closer to final passage. The  House made these fixes on their end through unanimous consent last  week. Not a Democrat nor Republican in that whole body blocked it, and  anyone could have. We want to do the same here in the Senate.   I hope my Republican colleagues will give consent to allow these  necessary fixes to go through, just as it happened in the House. As I  said, Members from both sides worked very, very hard to put this bill  together. It commands strong, bipartisan support, and we should move  forward with it as soon as we can. Bipartisan postal reform already has  enough support to become law. I hope it happens quickly.   Let me just say this once again so people understand what is going on  here. All we are asking for is to fix a small clerical error made by  the House of Representatives when they sent their bill to the Senate.  It has nothing to do with the substance of the bill. As I mentioned,  this fix--this small, little, immaterial change that is technical-- received unanimous consent, every Democrat and every Republican, in the  House. So let's have the same outcome here in the Senate tonight. Let's  move forward on this proposal.   At the end of the day, it is about making sure the post office can  fulfill its obligations to its workers and to the American people. We  all know how many of us--millions of us--depend on the mail. We all  know how we have been disappointed that mail service has slowed down.  We all know that we should get together, Democrats and Republicans, to  fix it.   The bipartisan reform bill will make sure Americans can continue  relying on the post office the same way they have relied on it all  their lives.   I hope that here in the Senate, we will keep working on this bill  with the same bipartisan spirit we have seen for the past week.                              Government Funding    Madam President, our other priority this week will be approving  legislation to keep the government open until March 11 so we can give  appropriators from both parties more time to draft the yearlong omnibus  funding bill.   This is another place where we are making bipartisan progress. Led by  Senators Leahy and Shelby and their counterparts in the House,  Representatives DeLauro and Granger, we have come to good agreements on  top-line numbers, and we can move forward--not with a CR, which simply  just reenacts what was in place last year despite the need for changes,  in many ways--but we can enact what we call an omnibus, which is what  we should be doing.   We have had positive conversations, and Democrats are united to keep  the government open so we can achieve this omnibus. We will continue  working with the Republican leadership to move forward on a CR before  the deadline later this week.                           Supreme Court Nomination    Madam President, on SCOTUS, the Supreme Court of the United States,  well, one of the most solemn responsibilities entrusted to the U.S.  Senate is offering our advice and ultimately our consent on the  President's appointments to the U.S. Supreme Court. It is a  responsibility that stands apart from just about all others. Those whom  we approve sit on the Court, and they will render judgment and exert  influence on the most consequential legal matters for years and  potentially for decades. The impact of any one Supreme Court nominee is  often felt long after the work of a single administration comes to an  end.   Very soon, this will be precisely the task the Senate will be asked  to take up once again when President Biden announces his choice to  replace Associate Justice Breyer. I have no doubt President Biden will  name someone who can not only bring Members of this body together but  someone with a proven record for excellence and evenhandedness. When  President Biden makes his announcement, I intend to have the Senate  move quickly to take up and confirm his nominee.    The President has promised he will nominate a Black woman to serve as  a Justice for the first time ever. This will not only be one of the  most important moments in the history of our courts but of our entire  country. Precious few have held the title of ``Justice'' in American  history--only 115 to date--and none of them has been a Black woman. So  the President's announcement is truly historic and potentially game- changing for the future of Supreme Court nominees.   Imagine the impact the President's pick will have on countless young  people who look up to the Nation's courts and see men and women who  better reflect our country's makeup. Imagine how that will inspire the  next generation to pursue their own interests in public service and law  and government. The judges and Justices of the future have their eyes  on this body right now in the present.   If our democracy is to prosper in this century, we need people from  all walks of life to see that they have a place at the table when it  comes to public service. The President's promise is a big step in that  direction.   The Democratic-led Senate has already played an important role in  bringing balance and diversity to our courts with highly qualified  nominees. It has been one of our highest priorities from the moment we  entered the majority.   Under President Biden, the Senate has confirmed 46 judges to serve  lifetime appointments to the Federal Bench. Indeed, this majority has  confirmed the most judges in the first year following the President's  inauguration since the time of John F. Kennedy. Three-quarters of these  new judges have been women--three-quarters. Two-thirds have been people  of color. More than a quarter of all of President Biden's appointees  have been Black women, who are still too far underrepresented in our  Federal Judiciary.   It is not just their demographic diversity that makes them  remarkable, although that is unquestionably important; the new judges  are also diverse because of their professional backgrounds. We have  confirmed more Federal defenders in the President's first year than any  President in modern history. We have confirmed more civil rights  lawyers, election lawyers, more individuals with deep experience in  public service.   I want to emphasize one other thing. These nominees are also  extremely qualified. We are not sacrificing qualifications and  excellence for diversity. President Biden's nominees are both more  diverse and more qualified, in my judgment, than any President's in  recent history.   So Senate Democrats are proud of this record, and we are going to  keep going. Diversity in all of its forms matters. It is good for the  justice system, and it is vital to the health of our democracy.   When the President announces his historic pick, the Senate will be  ready to move quickly and fairly to confirm her to the Supreme Court.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that after  Senator Scott speaks and blocks the proposal, that I speak, Senator  Peters speaks, and then Senator Murray speaks on the Califf nomination  and that then we move forward on the cloture vote.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  agree to the request of the House to return the papers with respect to  H.R. 3076 and that when the Senate receives from the House the  corrected engrossment of the bill, it be in the same procedural posture  as it was at the time of the granting of this request.  [[Page S664]]     Madam President, what we heard is why people really are  frustrated and angered at the U.S. Senate. This is a broad, bipartisan  bill months and months in the making, with large amounts of discussion,  has the support of the Democratic chair of the committee, the  Republican chair of the committee, was voted in the House with a  majority of Democrats and a majority of Republicans, and would finally  fix the post office.   I wonder if my colleague from Florida has ever heard his colleagues  in Florida, his voters, talk about snail mail, about everything coming  late--prescription drugs coming late, Social Security checks coming  late, birthday cards arriving weeks after the birthday occurred.  Finally, both parties come together in a bipartisan way in the House  and Senate to pass this legislation, and the Senator from Florida is  using a technical detail to hold us up.   It is the same bill that was on the floor Thursday, where we had  agreement to move to vote on it tonight. But the House sent us a bill  with a technical change. Five times in the past, this has happened; and  each time, no Senator had the temerity to get up and block it on a  technical issue. It just passed by UC, and we went and moved forward.   Our constituents want us to fix the post office. An overwhelming  majority of Democrats and Republicans want us to fix the post office.  All the postal workers are for this bill.   My colleague from Florida says he is defending postal workers. Ask  the people who represent them. I dare say, it is the head of the letter  carriers and the head of the postal workers and the head of the mail  handlers who represent the postal workers more than the Senator from  Florida; and they are overwhelmingly for the bill, as is the  Postmaster--an appointee of President Trump.   So everyone tries to come together and get something done, and the  arcane rules of the Senate allow one person to stand up--on a bill that  has been out there and discussed repeatedly--at the last minute and  raise objections. It is regrettable, and it is sad.    There is good news, though. Even though this will delay the bill, we  will pass it. We will have to just go through this elaborate process-- the old-fashioned and often discredited rules of the Senate that the  Senator from Florida is employing--we will have to use them, but we  will pass this bill because America needs it. Rural people need it.  Senior citizens need it. Veterans need it--80 percent of veterans'  prescriptions are sent through the mail. Nobody should be standing in  the way of this bill. It is a sad day that just one Member has.  [[Page S665]]    I yield the floor to Senator Peters.    And I dare say, the Senator from Michigan speaks for the  vast majority of Members in this Chamber and in the House of either  party.   Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate lay before  the body a message from the House with respect to H.R. 3076 and that  the Senate vote on the request without further intervening action or  debate.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that all  postcloture time on the Califf nomination be expired and that the vote  on confirmation be at 12 noon, Tuesday, February 15, and that if the  nomination is confirmed, the motion to reconsider be considered made  and laid upon the table and the President be immediately notified of  the Senate's action.    Madam President, I move to proceed to legislative  session.    Madam President, I move to proceed to executive session  to consider Calendar No. 692.    I send a cloture motion to the desk.    Madam President, I move to proceed to legislative  session.    Madam President, I move to proceed to executive session  to consider Calendar No. 476.   THE PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion.   The motion was agreed to.    Madam President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.    I ask unanimous consent that the mandatory quorum calls  for the cloture motions filed today, February 14, be waived.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to legislative session and be in a period of morning business,  with Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that all  previous action prior to today, February 14, with respect to H.R. 3076  be vitiated.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 255, H.R. 2497.    Further, I ask unanimous consent that the Bennet  amendment at the desk be considered and agreed to; the committee- reported amendments be agreed to; the bill, as amended, be considered  read a third time and passed; and that the motion to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table.    Madam President, I understand there is a bill at the  desk, and I ask for its first reading.    I now ask for a second reading, and in order to place  the bill on the calendar under the provisions of rule XIV, I object to  my own request.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 10 a.m., Tuesday,  February 15; further, that following the prayer and pledge, the morning  hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date,  the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the  day, and morning business be closed; that upon the conclusion of  morning business, the Senate proceed to executive session to resume  consideration of the Wallander nomination; and that the Senate recess  following disposition of the Califf nomination until 2:15 p.m. to allow  for the weekly caucus meetings.    Madam President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned  under the previous order.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 7:53 p.m., adjourned until  Tuesday, February 15, 2022, at 10 a.m.                            ____________________
