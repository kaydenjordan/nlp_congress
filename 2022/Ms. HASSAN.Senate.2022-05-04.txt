 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that,  notwithstanding the previous order, it be in order to offer my motion  to instruct at this time.    Mr. President, I call up my motion to instruct, which is  at the desk.    Mr. President, I rise today to offer a bipartisan motion  with Senator Young that will help fuel American innovation.   The research and development tax credit gives critical support to  small businesses and startups that power our economy. By strengthening  the R&D tax credit for startups and preserving other tax incentives for  research here in America, we can outcompete countries like China.   I would also like to thank the additional 16 Senators supporting the  motion: Senators Baldwin, Marshall, Feinstein, Sasse, Warnock, Blunt,  Kelly, Portman, Padilla, Fischer, Coons, Boozman, Cortez Masto, Capito,  Rosen, and Wicker.   I yield to the Senator from Indiana.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 10  more seconds.    Our R&D proposal is critical to helping small businesses  and to investing in R&D here at home to help us outcompete countries  like China.   There is strong bipartisan support for this measure.                                Vote on Motion    I ask for the yeas and nays.  [[Page S2320]]
