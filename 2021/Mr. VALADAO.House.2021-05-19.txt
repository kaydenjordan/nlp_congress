 Madam Speaker, I rise today to call attention to the  worsening drought crisis in California, which has become so devastating  that farmers are abandoning their crops in the fields.   This was an asparagus field in Firebaugh, a small, rural town in my  district. Recently, the farmer made the difficult decision to abandon  the crop in that field to preserve water for his melon crops instead.  You can clearly see the destruction this drought has wreaked on his  farmland.   Promised water will now not be delivered. Farmers all over California  are unable to bring their crops to harvest, crops that would have fed  families across the United States.   With legislation like my bill, the RENEW WIIN Act, those farmers  might have been able to save their fields rather than be forced to  waste and destroy half-grown produce our Nation relies on California to  grow.   If the House majority continues to refuse to take up legislation to  address the drought, farmers won't have to choose between asparagus or  melons, because they won't have the water to grow any food at all.
