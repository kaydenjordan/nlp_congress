 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to highlight some of the  important provisions in this bipartisan omnibus legislation.   I want to specifically touch on the needed investments in medical  research, education, and for our soldiers. It matches last year's $2  billion increase in research funding at the National Institutes of  Health, the largest increase since 2003, renewing our commitment to  science with a 13 percent  [[Page H3297]]  increase in research funding over these last 2 years.   It improves access to education by increasing funding for Head Start  programs and restores year-round Pell grants.   It invests $25 billion to rebuild our military for the 21st century  and gives our troops the largest paying raise in 6 years.   Mr. Speaker, as chairman of the Legislative Branch Subcommittee, I am  proud that our bill continues 13 percent reductions in spending on  Congress since Republicans took control of the House of Representatives  in 2011 and denies a pay increase for Members of Congress, showing the  American people we are leading by example when it comes to fiscal  responsibility.   I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.
