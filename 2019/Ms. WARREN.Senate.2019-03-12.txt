 Madam President, I come to the floor to oppose the  nomination of Neomi Rao to be a judge of the second most powerful court  in the country.   My decision boiled down to just this one question: Will Ms. Rao  advance equal justice for all or will she continue to tilt the courts  in favor of the rich and powerful?   Ms. Rao's record shows that she will continue to tilt our courts in  favor of the powerful few and leave everyone else behind, and that is  why I oppose her nomination, but that is also exactly why she was  selected by the President for this important lifetime appointment.   In the last 2 years, with the Trump administration controlling the  White House and Republicans, until January, controlling both Houses of  Congress, the rich and powerful have had unparalleled access to the  Federal Government, and they have been terrifyingly effective at making  Washington work even better for themselves.   Just think of some of their high-profile victories: a tax plan that  takes away money from working Americans and gives it straight to the  biggest corporations and wealthiest individuals, rollbacks of countless  protections to protect public health, consumer welfare, and  environmental safety. Those are just the policies that people have been  paying attention to.   For decades now, billionaire-funded rightwing groups have operated in  the shadows to take over our courts by installing rightwing judges who  will put the interests of giant corporations and wealthy individuals  ahead of everyone else. For those special interests, Neomi Rao is the  ideal candidate.   In 2017, I came to the floor to oppose Ms. Rao's nomination to lead  the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs--the small but  powerful Agency that reviews and signs off on economically significant  Federal rules. I was concerned about Ms. Rao's advocacy for weakening  or handcuffing Federal Agencies that are there to help protect the  public from giant corporations that prey on consumers, that mistreat  their workers, and that pollute our environment.   I worried that confirming her to lead OIRA would threaten the health  and safety of all Americans. For example, Ms. Rao attacked the Consumer  Financial Protection Bureau--the Agency that has returned $12 billion  to working families who were cheated--arguing against its authority to  protect consumers from predatory lending practices.   That was exactly the kind of candidate that Big Business and  billionaires wanted, so the Republican-controlled Senate confirmed Ms.  Rao, and the all-too-predictable happened.   Under Ms. Rao's leadership, OIRA approved the EPA's decision to roll  back important environmental positions, OIRA rubberstamped changes at  the Department of Labor that allowed certain employers to hide  workplace injuries, and Ms. Rao blocked a proposed measure from the  Equal Employment Opportunity Commission that would have helped uncover  pay discrimination. The list goes on.   Ms. Rao pairs her pro-corporate stance with harmful, regressive views  about sexual assault. In college, she wrote an article placing blame on  the  [[Page S1788]]  survivors of sexual assault if they drank alcohol, claiming that such  behavior was ``part of their choice.''   At her hearing, she refused to fully disclaim this line of thought,  claiming she was just recommending certain actions women could take to  make themselves less likely to be assaulted.   If that wasn't worrisome enough, Ms. Rao also argued in a book review  that public protections for women, for people of color, and for  Americans with disabilities are bad because they have eroded the power  of traditional elites, going so far as to call affirmative action the  ``bane of all good elitists.''   For President Trump, congressional Republicans, and their billionaire  buddies, Ms. Rao's commitment to protecting the interests of the rich  and powerful over everyone else was a feature of her tenure at OIRA,  not a bug. Now, as a reward for spending a year and a half rolling back  public protections and rubberstamping corporate America's wish list,  the Trump administration has selected her to be a judge on the second  highest court in this country.   At the DC Circuit, Ms. Rao would have even more power to stop Federal  efforts to protect Americans from abusive corporations and  billionaires. She would rule on attempts to protect the air we breathe  and the water we drink. She would have the power to overturn  protections for workers from unsafe working conditions, and she would  have the chance to upend rules to prevent big corporations from  discriminating against people of color, LGBTQ Americans, and other  marginalized communities.   Throughout her career, Ms. Rao has made very clear what her preferred  hierarchy looks like: corporations and billionaires up at the top, and  everybody else at the bottom.   As a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals, Ms. Rao will have an  opportunity to practice that philosophy at an even larger scale.   Madam President, our Federal courts are supposed to defend equal  justice for all Americans, not cater to the wealthy and well connected.  Neomi Rao's record shows that she will continue the corporate takeover  of our courts.   A vote for her is a vote against the millions of Americans who have  already borne the consequences of the radical, pro-corporate policies  she has advanced throughout her career. That is why I believe the  Senate should reject her nomination.                         Nomination of William Beach    Madam President, I also want to express my strong opposition to the  nomination of William Beach to run the Bureau of Labor Statistics.  BLS's accurate and impartial analysis is crucial to policymakers,  workers, and businesses.   In Mr. Beach, President Trump has chosen someone who has spent years  at so-called think tanks that are funded by radical rightwing  billionaires pushing so-called studies that criticize Social Security  and support draconian budget cuts and tax cuts for the richest  Americans--studies that have since been discredited. That is not whom  we need running one of our country's most important statistical  Agencies.   Besides Mr. Beach's radical, pro-corporate background, I want to join  Ranking Member Murray in expressing my serious concern with my  Republican colleagues' refusal to confirm Democratic nominees to other  important Agencies for workers--the National Labor Relations Board and  the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. This obstruction is a  total departure from precedent, and it is preventing these Agencies  from protecting the rights of millions of American workers to bargain  collectively and to go to work without worrying about illegal  discrimination and harassment.   I yield the floor.
