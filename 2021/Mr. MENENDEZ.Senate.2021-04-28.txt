 Mr. President, I think I will get done before, but, in  case, I ask unanimous consent to be able to finish my statement before  the vote.    Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for  the nomination of Ambassador Samantha Power to be our next  Administrator of the U.S. Agency for International Development.   Ambassador Power's qualifications for this position are beyond  dispute. Her lifelong commitment to protecting human rights and  preventing global atrocities, combined with the foreign policy  experience she gained during the Obama administration, make her  impeccably qualified for this role.   I want to highlight, in particular, her leadership on the  international effort to end genocide. Our struggle against these  horrific crimes is ongoing and unrelenting. Like Ambassador Power, I  was proud to see the Biden administration formally recognize the  Armenian genocide, a recognition by the U.S. Government that was long  overdue.   Ambassador Power's intellect, energy, and focus will be an enormous  asset to USAID in the Administration's efforts to end poverty around  the world, help victims of conflict, improve food security, and build  the kind of resilience that ultimately benefits the security and  prosperity of the American people.   This work is not easy, but it is exactly the sort of work that  President Biden described in his inaugural address when he spoke of the  United States as ``a strong and trusted partner for peace, progress,  and security.''   It is also the work we must do to confront the immense crises we face  around the world. Many of the conflicts Ambassador Power contended with  during her time at the United Nations continue today. New conflicts, as  we know, are brewing in Ethiopia, Haiti, and Burma, and creating  hundreds of thousands of innocent victims and refugees.   Climate change is increasing food insecurity, intensifying natural  resource scarcity, and beginning to drive mass migration.   And, of course, the COVID-19 pandemic is an ever-evolving threat, and  its proliferation around the world will continue to endanger our public  health here at home. As long as there is a COVID-19 virus anywhere, it  can be everywhere. We cannot hermetically seal off our Nation. That is  why this particular role of USAID is going to be increasingly  important.   As we reengage with our partners in the world to meet these  challenges, Ambassador Power will play a critical role. I am confident  her experience, tenacity, and drive to build a better, more prosperous,  peaceful world are exactly what USAID and our country need at this  moment.   I urge all of my colleagues to support Ambassador Power's successful  confirmation.   With that, I yield the floor.                            ____________________
