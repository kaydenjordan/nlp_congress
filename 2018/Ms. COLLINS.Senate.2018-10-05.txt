 Thank you, Mr. President.   Mr. President, the five previous times that I have come to the floor  to explain my vote on the nomination of a Justice to the U.S. Supreme  Court, I have begun my floor remarks explaining my decision with a  recognition of the solemn nature and the importance of the occasion.  But today we have come to the conclusion of a confirmation process that  has become so dysfunctional, it looks more like a caricature of a  gutter-level political campaign than a solemn occasion.   The President nominated Brett Kavanaugh on July 9. Within moments of  that announcement, special interest groups raced to be the first to  oppose him, including one organization that didn't even bother to fill  in the judge's name on its prewritten press release--they simply wrote  that they opposed ``Donald Trump's nomination of XX to the Supreme  Court of the United States.'' A number of Senators joined the race to  announce their opposition, but they were beaten to the punch by one of  our colleagues who actually announced opposition before the nominee's  identity was even known.   Since that time, we have seen special interest groups whip their  followers into a frenzy by spreading misrepresentations and outright  falsehoods about Judge Kavanaugh's judicial record. Over-the-top  rhetoric and distortions of his record and testimony at his first  hearing produced short-lived headlines which, although debunked hours  later, continued to live on and be spread through social media.  Interest groups have also spent an unprecedented amount of dark money  opposing this nomination.   Our Supreme Court confirmation process has been in steady decline for  more than 30 years. One can only hope that the Kavanaugh nomination is  where the process has finally hit rock bottom.   Against this backdrop, it is up to each individual Senator to decide  what the Constitution's advice-and-consent duty means. Informed by  Alexander Hamilton's Federalist 76, I have interpreted this to mean  that the President has broad discretion to consider a nominee's  philosophy, whereas my duty as a Senator is to focus on the nominee's  qualifications as long as that nominee's philosophy is within the  mainstream of judicial thought.   I have always opposed litmus tests for judicial nominees with respect  to  [[Page S6586]]  their personal views or politics, but I fully expect them to be able to  put aside any and all personal preferences in deciding the cases that  come before them. I have never considered the President's identity or  party when evaluating Supreme Court nominations. As a result, I voted  in favor of Justices Roberts and Alito, who were nominated by President  Bush; Justices Sotomayor and Kagan, who were nominated by President  Obama; and Justice Gorsuch, who was nominated by President Trump.   I began my evaluation of Judge Kavanaugh's nomination by reviewing  his 12-year record on the DC Circuit Court of Appeals, including his  more than 300 opinions and his many speeches and law review articles.  Nineteen attorneys, including lawyers from the nonpartisan  Congressional Research Service, briefed me many times each week and  assisted me in evaluating the judge's extensive record. I met with  Judge Kavanaugh for more than 2 hours in my office. I listened  carefully to the testimony at the committee hearings. I spoke with  people who knew him personally, such as Condoleezza Rice and many  others. I talked with Judge Kavanaugh a second time by phone for  another hour to ask him very specific additional questions.   I also have met with thousands of my constituents, both advocates and  many opponents, regarding Judge Kavanaugh. One concern that I  frequently heard was that the judge would be likely to eliminate the  Affordable Care Act's vital protections for people with preexisting  conditions. I disagree with this contention. In a dissent in Seven-Sky  v. Holder, Judge Kavanaugh rejected a challenge to the ACA on narrow  procedural grounds, preserving the law in full. Many experts have said  that his dissent informed Justice Roberts' opinion upholding the ACA at  the Supreme Court.   Furthermore, Judge Kavanaugh's approach toward the doctrine of  severability is narrow. When a part of a statute is challenged on  constitutional grounds, he has argued for severing the invalid clause  as surgically as possible while allowing the overall law to remain  intact.   This was his approach in his dissent in a case that involved a  challenge to the structure of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.  In his dissent, Judge Kavanaugh argued for ``severing any problematic  portions while leaving the remainder intact.'' Given the current  challenges to the ACA, proponents, including myself, of protections for  people with preexisting conditions should want a Justice who would take  just this kind of approach.   Another assertion I have heard often is that Judge Kavanaugh cannot  be trusted if a case involving alleged wrongdoing by the President were  to come before the Court. The basis for this argument seems to be  twofold.   First, Judge Kavanaugh has written he believes Congress should enact  legislation to protect Presidents from criminal prosecution or civil  liability while in office. I believe opponents miss the mark on this  issue. The fact that Judge Kavanaugh offered this legislative proposal  suggests he believes the President does not have such protection  currently.   Second, there are some who argue that given the current special  counsel investigation, President Trump should not even be allowed to  nominate a Justice. That argument ignores our recent history. President  Clinton, in 1993, nominated Justice Ginsburg after the Whitewater  investigation was already underway, and she was confirmed 96 to 3.   The next year, just 3 months after Independent Counsel Robert Fiske  was named to lead the Watergate investigation, President Clinton  nominated Justice Breyer. He was confirmed 87 to 9.   Supreme Court Justices have not hesitated to rule against the  Presidents who have nominated them. Perhaps most notably in United  States v. Nixon, the three Nixon appointees who heard the case joined  the unanimous opinion against him.   Judge Kavanaugh has been unequivocal in his belief that no President  is above the law. He has stated that Marbury v. Madison, Youngstown  Steel v. Sawyer, and United States v. Nixon are three of the four  greatest Supreme Court cases in history. What do they have in common?  Each of them is a case where Congress served as a check on Presidential  power. I would note, the fourth case Judge Kavanaugh has pointed to as  the greatest in history was Brown v. Board of Education.   One Kavanaugh decision illustrates the point about the check on  Presidential power directly. He wrote the opinion in Hamdan v. United  States, a case that challenged the Bush administration's military  commission prosecution of an associate of Osama Bin Laden. This  conviction was very important to the Bush administration, but Judge  Kavanaugh, who had been appointed to the DC Circuit by President Bush  and had worked in President Bush's White House, ruled that the  conviction was unlawful. As he explained during the hearing: ``We don't  make decisions based on who people are, or their policy preferences, or  the moment. We base decisions on the law. . . . ''   Others I have met with have expressed concerns that Justice Kennedy's  retirement threatens the right of same-sex couples to marry. Yet Judge  Kavanaugh described the Obergefell decision, which legalized same- gender marriages, as an important landmark precedent. He also cited  Justice Kennedy's recent Masterpiece Cakeshop opinion for the Court's  majority stating that ``the days of treating gay and lesbian Americans  or gay and lesbian couples as second class citizens who are inferior in  dignity and worth are over in the Supreme Court.''   Others have suggested that the judge holds extreme views on birth  control. In one case, Judge Kavanaugh incurred the disfavor of both  sides of the political spectrum for seeking to ensure the availability  of contraceptive services for women while minimizing the involvement of  employers with religious objections. Although his critics frequently  overlook this point, Judge Kavanaugh's dissent rejected arguments that  the government did not have a compelling interest in facilitating  access to contraception. In fact, he wrote that the Supreme Court  precedent ``strongly suggested'' that there was a ``compelling  interest'' in facilitating access to birth control.   There has also been considerable focus on the future of abortion  rights based on the concern that Judge Kavanaugh would seek to overturn  Roe v. Wade. Protecting this right is important to me. To my knowledge,  Judge Kavanaugh is the first Supreme Court nominee to express the view  that precedent is not merely a practice and tradition but rooted in  article III of our Constitution itself.   He believes precedent ``is not just a judicial policy . . . it is  constitutionally dictated to pay attention and pay heed to rules of  precedent.'' In other words, precedent isn't a goal or an aspiration;  it is a constitutional tenet that has to be followed except in the most  extraordinary circumstances.   The judge further explained that precedent provides stability,  predictability, reliance, and fairness. There are, of course, rare and  extraordinary times where the Supreme Court would rightly overturn a  precedent. The most famous example was when the Supreme Court, in Brown  v. Board of Education, overruled Plessy v. Ferguson, correcting a  ``grievously wrong'' decision, to use the judge's term, allowing racial  inequality.   But someone who believes the importance of precedent has been rooted  in the Constitution would follow long-established precedent except in  those rare circumstances in which a decision is ``grievously wrong'' or  ``deeply inconsistent with the law.'' Those are Judge Kavanaugh's  phrases.   As the judge asserted to me, a long-established precedent is not  something to be trimmed, narrowed, discarded, or overlooked. Its roots  in the Constitution give the concept of stare decisis greater weight  such that the precedent can't be trimmed or narrowed simply because a  judge might want to on a whim. In short, his views on honoring  precedent would preclude attempts to do by stealth that which one has  committed not to do overtly.   Noting that Roe v. Wade was decided 45 years ago and reaffirmed 19  years later in Planned Parenthood v. Casey, I asked Judge Kavanaugh  whether the passage of time is relevant to following precedent. He said  decisions become part of our legal framework with the passage of time  and that honoring precedent is essential to maintaining public  confidence.   Our discussion then turned to the right of privacy, on which the  Supreme  [[Page S6587]]  Court relied in Griswold v. Connecticut, a case that struck down a law  banning the use and sale of contraceptives. Griswold established the  legal foundation that led to Roe 8 years later. In describing Griswold  as ``settled law,'' Judge Kavanaugh observed that it was the correct  application of two famous cases from the 1920s, Meyer and Pierce, that  are not seriously challenged by anyone today.   Finally, in his testimony, he noted repeatedly that Roe had been  upheld by Planned Parenthood v. Casey, describing it as precedent on  precedent. When I asked him whether it would be sufficient to overturn  a long-established precedent if five current Justices believed it was  wrongly decided, he emphatically said no.   Opponents frequently cite then-candidate Donald Trump's campaign  pledge to nominate only judges who would overturn Roe. The Republican  platform for all Presidential campaigns has included this pledge since  at least 1980. During this time, Republican Presidents have appointed  Justices O'Connor, Souter, and Kennedy to the Supreme Court. These are  the very three Republican President-appointed Justices who authored the  Casey decision which reaffirmed Roe.   Furthermore, pro-choice groups vigorously opposed each of these  Justices' nominations. Incredibly, they even circulated buttons with  the slogan: ``Stop Souter or Women Will Die!'' Just 2 years later,  Justice Souter coauthored that Casey opinion, reaffirming a woman's  right to choose. Suffice it to say, prominent advocacy organizations  have been wrong.   These same interest groups have speculated that Judge Kavanaugh was  selected to do the bidding of conservative ideologues, despite his  record of judicial independence. I asked the judge point-blank whether  he had made any commitments or pledges to anyone at the White House, to  the Federalist Society, or to any outside group on how he would decide  cases. He unequivocally assured me he had not.   Judge Kavanaugh has received rave reviews for his 12-year track  record as a judge, including for his judicial temperament. The American  Bar Association gave him its highest possible rating. Its Standing  Committee on the Federal Judiciary conducted an extraordinarily  thorough assessment, soliciting input from almost 500 people, including  his judicial colleagues. The ABA concluded that ``his integrity,  judicial temperament, and professional confidence met the highest  standard.''   Lisa Blatt, who has argued more cases before the Supreme Court than  any other woman in history, testified:         By any objective measure, Judge Kavanaugh is clearly       qualified to serve on the Supreme Court.        His opinions are invariably thoughtful and fair.    Ms. Blatt, who clerked for and is an ardent admirer of Justice  Ginsburg, and who is, in her own words, ``an unapologetic defender of a  woman's right to choose,'' said Judge Kavanaugh ``fit[s] within the  mainstream of legal thought.'' She also observed ``Judge Kavanaugh is  remarkably committed to promoting women in the legal profession.''    That Judge Kavanaugh is more of a centrist than some of his critics  maintain is reflected in the fact that he and Chief Judge Merrick  Garland voted the same way in 93 percent of the cases they heard  together. Indeed, Chief Judge Garland joined in more than 96 percent of  the majority opinions authored by Judge Kavanaugh, dissenting only  once.   Despite all of this, after weeks of reviewing Judge Kavanaugh's  record and in listening to 32 hours of his testimony, the Senate's  advice and consent role was thrown into a tailspin following the  allegation of sexual assault by Professor Christine Blasey Ford. The  confirmation process now involves evaluating whether Judge Kavanaugh  committed sexual assault and lied about it to the Judiciary Committee.   Some argue that because this is a lifetime appointment to our highest  Court, the public interest requires that doubts be resolved against the  nominee. Others see the public interest as embodied in our long- established tradition of affording to those accused of misconduct a  presumption of innocence. In cases in which the facts are unclear, they  would argue the question should be resolved in favor of the nominee.   I understand both viewpoints. This debate is complicated further by  the fact that the Senate confirmation process is not a trial. But  certain fundamental legal principles about due process, the presumption  of innocence, and fairness do bear on my thinking, and I cannot abandon  them.   In evaluating any given claim of misconduct, we will be ill-served in  the long run if we abandon the presumption of innocence and fairness,  tempting though it may be. We must always remember it is when passions  are most inflamed that fairness is most in jeopardy.   The presumption of innocence is relevant to the advice and consent  function when an accusation departs from a nominee's otherwise  exemplary record. I worry that departing from this presumption could  lead to a lack of public faith in the judiciary and would be hugely  damaging to the confirmation process moving forward.   Some of the allegations levied against Judge Kavanaugh illustrate why  the presumption of innocence is so important. I am thinking, in  particular, not of the allegations raised by Professor Ford but of the  allegation that when he was a teenager, Judge Kavanaugh drugged  multiple girls and used their weakened states to facilitate gang rape.  This outlandish allegation was put forth without any credible  supporting evidence and simply parroted the public statements of  others. That such an allegation can find its way into the Supreme Court  confirmation process is a stark reminder of why the presumption of  innocence is so ingrained in our American consciousness.   Mr. President, I listened carefully to Christine Blasey Ford's  testimony before the Judiciary Committee. I found her testimony to be  sincere, painful, and compelling. I believe she is a survivor of a  sexual assault and that this trauma has upended her life. Nevertheless,  the four witnesses she named could not corroborate any of the events of  the evening gathering where she said the assault occurred. None of the  individuals Professor Ford said were at the party has any recollection  at all of that night.   Judge Kavanaugh forcefully denied the allegations under penalty of  perjury. Mark Judge denied, under penalty of felony, that he had  witnessed an assault. PJ Smyth, another person allegedly at the party,  denied, under penalty of felony, that he was there. Professor Ford's  lifelong friend, Leland Keyser, indicated that under penalty of felony,  she does not remember that party. Ms. Keyser went further. She  indicated that not only does she not remember a night like that but  also that she does not even know Brett Kavanaugh.   In addition to the lack of corroborating evidence, we also learned  some facts that raised more questions. For instance, since these  allegations have become public, Professor Ford testified that not a  single person has contacted her to say: ``I was at the party that  night.''   Furthermore, the professor testified that although she does not  remember how she got home that evening, she knew, because of the  distance, she would have needed a ride. Yet not a single person has  come forward to say that he or she was the one who drove her home or  was in the car with her that night. Professor Ford also indicated that  even though she left that small gathering of six or so people abruptly  and without saying goodbye and was distraught, none of them called her  the next day--or ever--to ask why she left or was she OK, not even her  closest friend, Ms. Keyser.   The Constitution does not provide guidance on how we are supposed to  evaluate these competing claims. It leaves that decision up to each  Senator. This is not a criminal trial, and I do not believe claims such  as these need to be proven beyond a reasonable doubt. Nevertheless,  fairness would dictate that the claims should at least meet a threshold  of ``more likely than not'' as our standard.   The facts presented do not mean Professor Ford was not sexually  assaulted that night or at some other time, but they do lead me to  conclude that the allegations fail to meet the ``more likely than not''  standard. Therefore, I do not believe these charges can fairly prevent  Judge Kavanaugh from serving on the Court.  [[Page S6588]]    Let me emphasize that my approach to this question should not be  misconstrued as suggesting that unwanted sexual contact of any nature  is not a serious problem in this country. To the contrary, if any good  at all has come from this ugly confirmation process, it has been to  create an awareness that we have underestimated the pervasiveness of  this terrible problem.   I have been alarmed and disturbed, however, by some who have  suggested that unless Judge Kavanaugh's nomination is rejected, the  Senate is somehow condoning sexual assault. Nothing could be further  from the truth.    Every person--man or woman--who makes a charge of sexual assault  deserves to be heard and treated with respect. The #MeToo movement is  real; it matters; it is needed; and it is long overdue. We know rape  and sexual assault are less likely to be reported to the police than  other forms of assault. On average, an estimated 211,000 rapes and  sexual assaults go unreported every year. We must listen to survivors,  and every day we must seek to stop the criminal behavior that has hurt  so many. We owe this to ourselves, our children, and generations to  come.   Since the hearing, I have listened to many survivors of sexual  assault. Many were total strangers who told me their heart-wrenching  stories for the first times in their lives. Some were friends whom I  have known for decades. Yet, with the exception of one woman who had  confided in me years ago, I had no idea they had been the victims of  sexual attacks. I am grateful for their courage and their willingness  to come forward, and I hope that in heightening public awareness, they  have also lightened the burden they have been quietly bearing for so  many years. To them, I pledge to do all I can to ensure that their  daughters and granddaughters never share their experiences.   Over the past few weeks, I have been emphatic that the Senate has an  obligation to investigate and evaluate the serious allegations of  sexual assault. I called for and supported the additional hearing to  hear from both Professor Ford and Judge Kavanaugh. I also pushed for  and supported the FBI's supplemental background investigation. This was  the right thing to do.   Christine Ford never sought the spotlight. She indicated she was  terrified to appear before the Senate Judiciary Committee, and she has  shunned attention since then. She seemed completely unaware of Chairman  Grassley's offer to allow her to testify confidentially in California.  In watching her, I could not help but feel that some people who wanted  to engineer the defeat of this nomination cared little, if at all, for  her well-being.   Professor Ford testified that a very limited number of people had  access to her letter. Yet that letter found its way into the public  domain. She testified she never gave permission for that very private  letter to be released. Yet here we are. We are in the middle of a fight  she never sought, arguing about claims she wanted to raise  confidentially.   One theory I have heard espoused repeatedly is that our colleague  Senator Feinstein leaked Professor Ford's letter at the eleventh hour  to derail this process. I want to state this very clearly: I know  Senator Dianne Feinstein extremely well, and I believe she would never  do that. I knew that to be the case before she even stated it at the  hearing. She is a person of integrity, and I stand by her.   I have also heard some argue that the chairman of the committee  somehow treated Professor Ford unfairly. Nothing could be further from  the truth. Chairman Grassley, along with his excellent staff, treated  Professor Ford with compassion and respect throughout the entire  process. That is the way the Senator from Iowa has conducted himself  throughout a lifetime dedicated to public service.    The fact remains that someone leaked this letter against Professor  Ford's express wishes. I suspect, regrettably, that we will never know  for certain who did it.   To that leaker, who I hope is listening now, let me say that what you  did was unconscionable. You have taken a survivor who was not only  entitled to your respect but who also trusted you to protect her, and  you have sacrificed her well-being in a misguided attempt to win  whatever political crusade you think you are fighting. My only hope is  that your callous act has turned this process into such a dysfunctional  circus that it will cause the Senate--and, indeed, all Americans--to  reconsider how we evaluate Supreme Court nominees. If that happens,  then the appalling lack of compassion you afforded Professor Ford will  at least have some unintended positive consequences.   The politically charged atmosphere surrounding this nomination had  reached a fever pitch even before these allegations were known, and it  was challenging even then to separate fact from fiction.   We live in a time of such great disunity, as the bitter fight over  this nomination both in the Senate and among the public clearly  demonstrates. It is not merely a case of differing groups having  different opinions; it is a case of people bearing extreme ill will  toward those who disagree with them.   In our intense focus on our differences, we have forgotten the common  values that bind us together as Americans. With some of our best minds  seeking to develop ever more sophisticated algorithms designed to link  us to websites that only reinforce and cater to our views, we can only  expect our differences to intensify.   This would have alarmed the drafters of our Constitution, who were  acutely aware that different values and interests could prevent  Americans from becoming and remaining a single people. Indeed, of the  six objectives they invoked in the preamble to the Constitution, the  one that they put first was the formation of ``a more perfect Union.''  Their vision of ``a more perfect Union'' does not exist today. If  anything, we appear to be moving far away from it. It is particularly  worrisome that the Supreme Court--the institution that most Americans  see as the principal guardian of our shared constitutional heritage--is  viewed as part of the problem through a political lens.   Mr. President, we have heard a lot of charges and countercharges  about Judge Kavanaugh, but, as those who have known him best have  attested, he has been an exemplary public servant, judge, teacher,  coach, husband, and father.   Despite the turbulent and bitter fights surrounding his nomination,  my fervent hope is that Brett Kavanaugh will work to lessen the  divisions in the Supreme Court so that we have far fewer 5-4 decisions  and that public confidence in our judiciary and our highest Court is  restored.   Mr. President, I will vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh.   Thank you.   (Applause, Senators rising.)
