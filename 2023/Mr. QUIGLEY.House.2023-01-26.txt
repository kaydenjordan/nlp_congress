 Mr. Speaker, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I offer an amendment today to ensure that  the President and the Secretary of Energy are able to use the Strategic  Petroleum Reserve without arbitrary limitations during a time of war.   This amendment allows for the U.S. to have the full capabilities of  the Strategic Petroleum Reserve at its disposal without restrictions  for as long as Russia continues to illegally attack Ukraine.   On February 24, 2022, Russia launched an illegal invasion of Ukraine,  altering the geopolitical landscape, not only in Europe but across the  globe. President Biden and our allies took swift and significant action  to support Ukraine by banning Russian energy imports. These actions  have put pressure on Putin and allowed Ukraine to continue defending  its sovereignty, and with it, our democratic ideals.   Putin's war has caused a global energy crisis which has been  exacerbated by increased demand as we recover from the COVID-19  pandemic.   Americans felt the energy and gas prices rising as U.S. energy  suppliers worked to meet the need. Thankfully, the U.S. has the  strategic reserve at its disposal. This reserve is the world's largest  supply of emergency crude oil with the sole purpose of meeting energy  demands in times of crisis.   President Biden smartly utilized all the tools at his disposal to  limit energy supply constraints and released enough barrels of crude  oil to fill the gap left by Russian oil. Experts show that Biden's  actions helped lower the price of gasoline for Americans everywhere  from 13 to 31 cents a gallon.   Sadly, almost 1 year later, the international landscape continues to  be in crisis. We are no closer to re-establishing Ukrainian  sovereignty, while Russia continues to launch offenses.   Until Ukraine is free, until Ukrainians feel safe, until Russia is  held accountable, our global energy markets are at risk.   I yield back the balance of my time.                                time  2045                                Point of Order     Mr. Chair, for these purposes, the subject matter can be  construed as preventing certain SPR drawdowns until the administration  develops a production increase plan. This amendment narrowly addresses  the same subject matter without broadening the plan. Rather, it ensures  a timeline conducive with our current state of international crisis.   This amendment says the plan can't be implemented before the  Secretary of Energy certifies that Russia's invasion of Ukraine has  ended. It does not condition the effectiveness of the bill, nor does it  require any extraneous action or bring any new statute or new  committees of jurisdiction.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
