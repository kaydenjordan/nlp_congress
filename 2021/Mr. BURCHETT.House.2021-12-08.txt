 Mr. Speaker, I thank the Republican lead, Mr. McCaul,  for yielding. And Chairman Meeks, you are a force in the House  gymnasium. You are a force on the House floor, and I appreciate you,  brother.   The Chinese Communist Party does anything it can to get ahead of the  United States, Mr. Speaker. It steals  [[Page H7502]]  our intellectual property and uses Uyghur slave labor to manufacture  products. It is threatening the freedom of folks from Taiwan to Hong  Kong. Our government needs to stand up to them.   Today, we are acknowledging some of the Chinese Communist Party's  horrible, horrible behaviors. It is not enough. Additional action is  needed, Mr. Speaker.   The Chinese Communist Party knows there are no consequences for its  behavior. That needs to change. It starts with the Biden  administration. They need to do more than just finger-wagging to  effectively counter China. This administration needs to make it clear  to the Chinese Communist Party that bad behavior will be met with  action, not empty words.   President Biden also needs to set aside his climate agenda when  addressing the Chinese Communist Party. His administration tried to  kill the Uyghur Forced Labor Protection Act because the Uyghurs mine  the polysilicon for our solar panels. It is gross that this  administration wants to let Uyghur slavery slide to advance its climate  agenda.   I am glad we have these bills on the floor today. It is a start, but  more work needs to be done. I hope in the Foreign Affairs Committee,  both parties can work together and hold the Chinese Communist Party  accountable, Mr. Speaker.
