 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the talented and  diligent students in our Eighth District who participated in our annual  Congressional Art Competition.   This year, we received 230 submissions from eight schools. The  artwork from these dedicated students is on display at the Pyramid Hill  Sculpture Park and Museum until April 30, and it is available online,  as well.   One standout student received the grand prize victory for her art  submission. I congratulate Paige Harris, who was our grand prize winner  of the 2023 Eighth District Congressional Art Competition.   Paige is an 11th-grader and attends Badin High School, and her Urban  Renewal work will be placed on display in the United States Capitol for  the next year. Last week, I had the honor to meet Paige and her fellow  art competition participants, and her family, as well.   We celebrate their hard work, their skills, and their creativity. I  thank them all for their participation.                            ____________________
