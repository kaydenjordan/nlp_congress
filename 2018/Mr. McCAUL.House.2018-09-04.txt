 Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 6439) to amend the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to  establish in the Department of Homeland Security the Biometric  Identification Transnational Migration Alert Program, and for other  purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows                                 H.R. 6439         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Biometric Identification       Transnational Migration Alert Program Authorization Act of       2018''.       SEC. 2. BIOMETRIC IDENTIFICATION TRANSNATIONAL MIGRATION                     ALERT PROGRAM.         (a) In General.--Subtitle D of title IV of the Homeland       Security Act of 2002 (6 U.S.C. 251 et seq.) is amended by       adding at the end the following new section:       ``SEC. 447.

Biometric Identification Transnational Migration Alert                Program.''.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks  and include any extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of my legislation to  help protect the American people and keep our homeland safe.   We are only 1 week out from the 17th anniversary of 9/11, and a lot  has changed since those four horrifying attacks, but one thing remains  the same: America's enemies are always looking for new ways to sneak  into our country.   Today, many special interest aliens and other nefarious actors,  including potential terrorists, are exploiting illicit pathways  throughout Central and South America, racing towards the border.   To combat this threat, we need to leverage our international  partnerships and use advanced technology to our advantage. One of the  best tools we have is ICE's Biometric Identification Transnational  Migration Alert Program, otherwise known as BITMAP. BITMAP was created  in 2011 by the Obama administration and is utilized on five different  continents.   Through this program, trained and vetted law enforcement officers  collect biometric and biographic data on potentially dangerous  individuals traveling through their country. The collected data is then  shared with American law enforcement, the Department of Defense, and  intelligence agencies. This vital information helps us enrich our  databases, map illicit pathways, exploit networks, and learn about  individuals looking to bring harm.   In the last few years, BITMAP has identified several hundred known or  suspected terrorists. Top national security officials from DOD and DHS  have testified to its success. For example, former Acting Director of  ICE, Thomas Homan, told me at a recent hearing: ``People that were  known terrorists had been turned around in Panama and sent back before  reaching our shores. . . .'' BITMAP ``has already proven successful.''  And that is according to the former Director of ICE.   BITMAP does not just ID suspected terrorists, however. It also  identifies drug smugglers, sex offenders, murderers, child predators,  gang members like MS-13, and people with active warrants and other  dangerous backgrounds.   My bill will enhance American and foreign law enforcement's ability  to keep our citizens safe by identifying threats at the earliest  possible stage. Simply put, it will help stop dangerous individuals who  want to bring harm to the American people.   Threats to America, whether through terrorism, human trafficking, or  deadly opioids, continue to grow, and we must do everything we can to  stop them.   I am proud this legislation passed out of our committee with  bipartisan support, and I want to thank Congressman Bill Keating for  all of his work on this issue.   Passing this important legislation through the House is a simple step  we can take to make our homeland more secure, and I urge my colleagues  to support this bipartisan bill.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I have tremendous respect for the gentleman from  Mississippi, but I do have to respectfully disagree with some of his  assertions. First of all, this program, BITMAP, was started 7 years ago  under the Obama administration. And over the last 7 years, we have  obtained sufficient data that would verify the success of the program.   In fact, I can't get into the classified nature of the program.  Suffice it to say that we stopped hundreds of known or suspected  terrorists from entering the United States under this tried-and-true  program.   The Secretary testified before our committee that, on average, 19  known or suspected terrorists try to enter the United States every day.  Our solemn obligation is to protect the American people from the  threats that we see outside of the United States and do everything we  can to stop them from getting into the United States.   What the 9/11 Commission talked about in its report about travel and  keeping bad people and bad things out of the United States, is the  reason this committee was formed in the first place. And we have heard  the stories about ISIS in written materials encouraging followers to  cross our southwest border. We talked about the 9/11 Commission. We  talked about terrorists' travel strategies. This is one of those  strategies, one of those programs that I believe the 9/11 Commission  was talking about.   Why not use the best technology we have and use biometrics to  identify known or suspected terrorists, MS-13 gang members, child  predators, opioid traffickers, all of the bad stuff that can come into  this country. When Border Patrol tells me we only know 50 percent of  what is coming into the country, why would we not want to use the most  innovative technology so that when someone enters this hemisphere under  one name and gets up to the Mexico border under another name--just like  in the Mollie Tibbetts' killing, slaying, where someone came into the  country and changed their identity. This stops the changing of identity  up the road into the United States.   Why? Biometrics don't lie. You are who you are. And we know who they  are through the great, best technology we have available today. So I  believe that being opposed to this legislation really puts the American  people at harm.   I hope I am wrong in saying this, because I never want politics to  enter this committee: National security should never be political. The  terrorists don't check our partisan affiliation. But my concern is that  because ICE is in this bill, we are drawing opposition.   Madam Speaker, this is one of the best programs that ICE administers,  created under the Obama administration. It deserves and it has earned  to be fully authorized by the United States Congress, and I ask that  all of my colleagues support this measure.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 6459) to amend the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to require  a strategy to diversify the technology stakeholder marketplace  regarding the acquisition by the Transportation Security Administration  of security screening technologies, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 6459         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``TSA Opportunities to Pursue       Expanded Networks for Business Act'' or the ``TSA OPEN for       Business Act''.       SEC. 2. STRATEGY.         (a) In General.--Subtitle B of title XVI of the Homeland       Security Act of 2002 (6 U.S.C. 563 et seq.) is amended by       adding at the end following new section:       ``SEC. 1617. DIVERSIFIED TECHNOLOGY STAKEHOLDER MARKETPLACE.         ``(a) In General.--Not later than 120 days after the date       of the enactment of this section, the Administrator shall       submit to the Committee on Homeland Security of the House of       Representatives and the Committee on Commerce, Science, and       Transportation of the Senate a strategy to diversify the       technology stakeholder marketplace that the Administrator       relies upon to acquire security screening technologies,       including by increased participation of small business       innovators.        ``(b) Contents.--The strategy required under subsection (a)       shall include the following:        ``(1) Information on how Administration solicitation,       testing, evaluation, piloting, acquisition, and procurement       processes impact the Administrator's ability to acquire from       a technology stakeholder, including a small business       innovator, that has not previously provided technology to the       Administration, an innovative technology or capability with       the potential to enhance transportation security.        ``(2) Specific actions that the Administrator will take,       including modifications to the processes described in       paragraph (1), to foster diversification within the       technology stakeholder marketplace, together with information       on projected timelines for such actions.        ``(3) Plans for how the Administrator may, to the extent       practicable, assist a small business innovator at certain       points in such processes, including when such an innovator       lacks adequate resources to participate in such processes, to       help ensure that an advanced technology or capability can be       developed and acquired by the Administrator.        ``(4) A feasibility assessment of partnering with an       organization described in section 501(c)(3) of the Internal       Revenue Code of 1986 and exempt from tax under section 501(a)       of such Code to help provide venture capital to businesses,       particularly small business innovators, for commercialization       of innovative homeland security technologies that are       expected to be ready for commercialization in the near term       and within 36 months. In conducting such feasibility       assessment, the Administrator shall consider the following:        ``(A) Establishing an organization described in section       501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and exempt       from tax under section 501(a) of such Code, modeled after the       In-Q-tel program, as a venture capital partnership between       the private sector and the intelligence community to help       businesses, particularly small business innovators,       commercialize innovative security-related technologies.        ``(B) Enhanced engagement, either through the Science and       Technology Directorate of the Department of Homeland Security       or directly, with the In-Q-tel program described in       subparagraph (A).        ``(c) Rule of Construction.--Nothing in this section may be       construed as requiring changes to the Transportation Security       Administration standards for security technology.        ``(d) Definitions.--In this section:        ``(1) Intelligence community.--The term `intelligence       community' has the meaning given such term in section 3(4) of       the National Security Act of 1947 (50 U.S.C. 3003(4)).        ``(2) Small business concern.--The term `small business       concern' has the meaning described under section 3 of the       Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 632).        ``(3) Small business innovator.--The term `small business       innovator' means a stakeholder that is a small business       concern that has an advanced transportation security       technology or capability.''.

(c) Clerical Amendment.--The table of contents in section       1(b) of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 is amended by       inserting after the item relating to section 1616 the       following new item:  ``Sec. 1617. Diversified technology stakeholder marketplace.''.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  any extraneous materials on the bill under consideration.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 6459, the TSA  Opportunities to Pursue Expanded Networks for Business Act, also known  as the TSA OPEN for Business Act, sponsored by the ranking member of  the Committee on Homeland Security, Mr. Thompson.   This bipartisan legislation seeks to improve how TSA partners with  the private sector to offer innovative technologies for passenger  screening. In particular, this bill aims to bolster access for small  businesses to TSA's acquisition process and better serve the public.   Specifically, this bill directs the TSA administrator to develop a  strategy to diversify the stakeholder marketplace used to acquire  advanced security technologies. This strategy must include plans to  assist small businesses with navigating the agency's acquisitions and  procurement processes, which are often overly bureaucratic.   Additionally, the bill will help establish public-private  partnerships that will direct venture capital toward emerging,  promising technologies.   Madam Speaker, our airline industry still remains the crown jewel of  targets for international terrorists. The public deserves to have the  best security in place throughout America's transportation and aviation  sector, and it is incumbent upon the TSA to create a streamlined way of  identifying and deploying advanced security technologies.   Since its creation, TSA has struggled to expand participation by  small businesses and direct resources towards promising technologies.  Ranking Member Thompson's legislation reduces bureaucratic hurdles,  while promoting private sector innovation.   Madam Speaker, I want to thank the ranking member for introducing  this excellent legislation, as well as the chairman of the Subcommittee  on Transportation and Protective Security, Mr. Katko, for his  leadership on this issue.   This legislation offers a bipartisan approach to improving  opportunities for small businesses seeking to partner with TSA, and  improves the security of our Nation's transportation systems.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the bill, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Madam Speaker, in closing, I thank Ranking Member Thompson for  bringing this legislation.   When a lot of people look at TSA, they look at the lines and the  screening that takes place. Sometimes I often think they don't get the  respect that they deserve.   TSA does a lot more than screening at airports. It screens overseas;  it has intelligence leads to stop terrorists from coming into the  country; and, most importantly, it stops terrorists with the latest  threat that we have that I can say publicly now: turning laptops into  bombs and toxic gas. That is a threat that keeps me up at night with  U.S.-bound passengers from airports like Istanbul, Cairo, and Riyadh  into JFK Airport and other airports, but also domestic flights. It is  important that we pass this bill that the ranking member introduced to  make sure that TSA has the best technology available to stop that  threat.   I am proud to say that we have worked in a bipartisan fashion to  ensure that the moneys have been appropriated to buy these new  technologies and new machines that outdated technology cannot see or  screen but the updated technology can. We owe it to the American people  to deploy this new technology as soon and quickly as possible, given  the immediate threat to the United States and the airline sector.   Madam Speaker, I think this is an excellent bill. I fully support it,  and I urge my colleagues to support it as well.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
