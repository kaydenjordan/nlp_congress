 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I see my colleague from Kentucky on  the floor, and I want to take this opportunity to express to him and to  Senator McConnell my condolences for what the people of Kentucky have  endured with this catastrophic devastation. I know he has been a strong  advocate for his State, and I fully support a swift, strong Federal  response to alleviating the suffering and assisting in rebuilding. In  times of tragedy, our Nation comes together to support all who are in  this kind of need.                     Unanimous Consent Request--H.R. 5323    Mr. President, I also express my strong support--and it is the reason  I am here--for $1 billion of supplemental security assistance to  replenish Israel's Iron Dome Supplemental Appropriations Act. The  Senate must pass H.R. 5323 as quickly as possible. The Iron Dome has  widespread, bipartisan support in Congress--as well it should. It has  the administration's support, which it richly deserves.   During the May 2021 conflict between Israel and Hamas, the Iron Dome  defense system intercepted about 90 percent of the missiles that were  targeting populated civilians in Israel. In total, 4,400 rockets were  launched by Hamas. If the Iron Dome had failed, countless Israeli  civilians would have been killed. The system performed exceptionally  well, and it showed its necessity for both humanitarian and strategic  defensive purposes.   I am very concerned that one of my colleagues previously blocked the  passage of this bill in the Senate. I hope provisions of this year's  Defense Authorization Act, specifically sections  [[Page S9187]]  1213 and 1214 and section 9021 of last year's Defense appropriations  bill, assuage any ongoing concern about transferring funds to the  Taliban. No funds--none--zero--will be used to help or support or  enable, in any way, the Taliban. Funds previously appropriated for the  Afghanistan National Security Forces are deeply needed to terminate  contracts that are already in place. These funds will not go to the  Taliban but to those who supported the U.S. mission in Afghanistan.   If any Pentagon employee breaks the law--if any one of them makes  funds available to the Taliban--that individual could and should face  criminal penalties, including jail time under the Antideficiency Act.  We cannot continue to use the U.S.-Israeli relationship as a political  football. It is against our own strategic interests; it violates our  humanitarian values; and it is a security problem.   I am a strong, strong supporter of Israel, but I often say that  friends can disagree, and friends can criticize each other. I have been  critical at times of my friends in the Israeli Government. I am  standing again on the floor of the U.S. Senate, being, arguably,  critical of one of my colleagues, and I ask: Where are my colleagues  across the aisle when one of their own Members is actively impeding  Israel's ability to defend itself from Hamas? It is a cause they say  they support. Where is their concern? Where is the outrage?    I urge all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support  this critical funding.   So, Mr. President, as if in legislative session, I ask unanimous  consent that at a time to be determined by the majority leader,  following consultation with the Republican leader, the Senate proceed  to the consideration of Calendar No. 140, H.R. 5323; that there be up  to 2 hours of debate; and that upon the use or yielding back of time,  the bill be considered read a third time, and the Senate vote on  passage of the bill without intervening action or debate.    Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, my  colleague from Kentucky talks about money as though it were going to go  to the Taliban, as if it were going to an entity that no longer exists.  In fact, that money is necessary to terminate contracts, to fulfill  obligations, not only under the contracts but to our allies, the Afghan  at-risk allies who sought to fulfill our mission. We have a moral  imperative, and we have, arguably, a legal obligation.   That money is not just sitting there. It is not fungible. But put  aside the merits of that argument, we have also a moral and strategic  interest to our ally Israel to replenish its defenses at a time when it  depends on our assistance to defend itself, to provide that Iron Dome  that saves lives of innocent civilians who otherwise would have  perished as a result of those 4,400 rockets launched by Hamas and  possibly led to escalating contention and conflict in that region.   So it is a win-win, in fact, for us to replenish the Iron Dome  without conditioning it in any way on other funds. Therefore, I will  not modify my request.    Mr. President, if I may just finish.   We are here again. I will come back again to the floor to seek this  Iron Dome money.   Many of us are absolutely determined that the United States fulfill  this moral, humanitarian, and foreign policy obligation. It is in our  strategic interest.   This obligation is paid for; it is not debt; and it will incur no  obligations that are unpaid for. So I regret that my colleague, again,  has blocked this from proceeding.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
