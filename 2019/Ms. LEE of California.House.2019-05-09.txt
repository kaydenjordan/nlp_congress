 ``Substantial evidence indicates that the  catalyst for the President's decision to fire Comey was Comey's  unwillingness to publicly state that the President was not personally  under investigation, despite the President's repeated requests that  Comey make such an announcement. Other evidence, however, indicates  that the President wanted to protect himself from an investigation into  his campaign.'' Volume II, pages 75 and 76.    ``In early 2018, the press reported that the  President had directed McGahn to have the special counsel removed in  June 2017 and  [[Page H3663]]  that McGahn had threatened to resign rather than carry out the order.  The President reacted to the news stories by directing White House  officials to tell McGahn to dispute the story and create a record  stating he had not been ordered to have the special counsel removed.  McGahn told those officials that the media reports were accurate in  stating that the President had directed McGahn to have the special  counsel removed.''   Volume II, pages 5 and 6.    ``The investigation established that several  individuals affiliated with the Trump campaign lied to the Office, and  to Congress, about their interactions with Russian-affiliated  individuals and related matters. Those lies materially impaired the  investigation of Russian election interference. The Office charged some  of those lies as violations of the Federal false statements statute.''   Volume I, page 9.    ``Two days after the President directed McGahn  to have the special counsel removed, the President made another attempt  to affect the course of the Russia investigation. On June 19, 2017, the  President met one-on-one with Corey Lewandowski in the Oval Office and  dictated a message to be delivered to Attorney General Sessions that  would have had the effect of limiting the Russia investigation to  future election interference only.''   Volume II, page 90.    Madam Speaker, I thank Representative Jayapal  for yielding, and I thank her for her tremendous leadership and for  staying steady and focused. And, also, I just have to recognize her for  the input which she has provided to the conference committee to keep  the government open, but, also, it was a conference committee to fund  Homeland Security. Her input and what she gave us really was extremely  important to get that done. We have a lot of work to do. So I thank her  very much for that, also.   Yes, our Nation has yet to recover from the Trump administration's  cruel zero-tolerance, zero-humanity prosecution policy that tore and is  tearing thousands of children from their parents and guardians, which  was announced 1 year ago this week.   Since Donald Trump started his zero-humanity policy--and that is  exactly what it is--we have learned more and more disturbing evidence.   We know that the Trump administration piloted family separation on a  limited basis and planned to impose a policy of mass separating of  children from their moms and dads--a policy. We have seen the  administration's memos contemplating how this could be done and the  resources needed to separate and detain thousands of children and  parents.   The Government Accountability Office has investigated, finding that,  despite the administration's contemplation, this is a very serious,  serious problem, that they were unaware the then-Attorney General, Jeff  Sessions, intended to launch this zero-humanity policy. They didn't  even know this, they said.   At least as of February this year, we know that the Justice  Department and their attorneys are still not tracking when they  prosecute parents and legal guardians separated from their children.   And that brings me to what may be the most disturbing part of it all:  The Department of Health and Human Services' inspector general found  that the total number of children separated from a parent or guardian  by immigration authorities is unknown and that thousands of children  may have been separated.   So the bottom line is that Donald Trump and his administration,  showing horrific cruelty and disregard for the well-being of children,  planned for months--this was a plan--to tear children from their  parents' arms.   Key officials were warned about the potentially lifelong harm to  children, and Donald Trump and his administration still did absolutely  nothing to ensure children could be reunited with their parents.   Yes, Congresswoman Jayapal, this is not a stain, but this is yet  another stain on the United States.   I am reminded that 400 years ago, when the first Africans were  brought to this country to begin the horrific, inhumane institution and  government-sanctioned slavery, children were separated from their  parents. And that was a plan, just as it is a plan now. African  families were split and destroyed.   We still experience, in the Black community, generational trauma from  these crimes against humanity. I couldn't help but be reminded of what  my ancestors experienced as I visited McAllen, Texas, and Brownsville,  Texas, last year.   I saw children sleeping on concrete floors, behind barbed wire,  crying for their parents. I spoke with mothers and fathers who did not  know where their children were after several months. And we were told  that they could make these phone calls, but also that these calls cost  money.   Where do they have money? How could they get any money?   These children and their parents had no access to mental health  professionals.   Now, my background is psychiatric social work, and I know the trauma  of separation of children from their parents, just within 24 hours that  trauma settles in.   They had no access to legal services. And, yes, I couldn't believe it  when I saw that these detention centers were prisons. They reminded me  of San Quentin.   I saw mothers in prison uniforms. These were asylum seekers. They  were put behind barbed wire in prison uniforms. This was like something  I had never seen in my life.   And yet it took me back to what our government sanctioned and  promoted and had as its policy 400 years ago.   Yes, I was born in a border city, El Paso, Texas. I was just there  with Congresswoman Escobar on Monday. And El Paso, the people of El  Paso are doing everything they can to help with the children and with  the families that are being so ruthlessly treated by our immigration  officials.    Now, I just have to tell you, these children will grow up with a  disdain for America; okay? Their trauma will turn into anger. And I  know that, professionally. I know what is going to happen to these  kids.   The long-term impact will not be good for our country, so this  administration better figure this out pretty quickly. There are so many  dimensions to what they are doing. I don't think they even get it.   The humane and the humanitarian crisis that we are experiencing is  first and foremost, but we also have to remind the Trump administration  they are creating children now who will be adults soon, and this trauma  is going to stay with them all of their lives. So we better get it  right, and get it right quickly.   Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Washington (Ms. Jayapal)  for her leadership. We have done much work in the Appropriations  Committee.   Thank God we were able to pass some of the amendments last year that  would not allow the immigration officials to chain pregnant women--get  it?--chain pregnant women. We got rid of that. Hopefully, they are  implementing that properly.   So there is a lot to do, but this is something that cannot last. This  is America, and we should not--the world should not see us leading an  immigration policy or promoting an immigration policy that, central to  it, destroys families and children and lives.   These are human beings. They don't deserve this, and we have to do  more to stop it.   Madam Speaker, I again thank the gentlewoman for yielding.    Will the gentlewoman yield?    Madam Speaker, Congresswoman Jayapal's bill is  extremely important, and I hope that Republicans also join us in this  effort because this is a concern that should be bipartisan or  nonpartisan.   But let me just mention a couple of things. Everyone who is a parent,  a grandparent, or has ever babysat children, or who has been around  children, if a child walks off, or you can't locate the child that you  are caring for, I know you have felt the panic. I know when my children  were small, and I would turn around and they were gone it was like: Oh,  my God, what has happened? And the anxiety and the fear, and just  getting very emotionally distraught behind not knowing where my  children were, will always be with me.   So I think everyone in our country should understand what these  parents are going through and what a lost child is feeling if they have  had that experience before.   We had a hearing on this family separation policy in the  Appropriations Committee, the Labor, Health and Human Services,  Education, and Related Services Subcommittee, and we had a panel of  individuals. Some were mental health professionals. And we were told in  no uncertain terms that a day or two of counseling is not going to get  it. These parents and these children need a specific form of  psychotherapy, and it has got to be sustained. It has got to be  professional, and it has got to be the type of therapy that addresses  specifically trauma.   So I am not sure that DHS even understands this. So it is on the  record, and we have been trying now to make sure that we can provide  the funding for the proper type of mental health services so that we  can begin to deal with this trauma that has to be addressed early on.  Because otherwise, this, again, is not going to be only these kids.  This will be generational because there are DNA changes through the  generations as a result of family separation and children being  separated from their parents at an early age.    Peeping out at you, begging for help.    It is hard to process that.    Madam Speaker, I thank Representative Adams.   First, I have to thank the gentlewoman for her tremendous leadership  on so many issues. Our young people at our Historically Black Colleges  and Universities really owe her a debt of gratitude.   I thank her and Congresswoman Underwood for forming the Black  Maternal Health Caucus, and also Congresswoman Robin Kelly, who has  been such a tremendous leader in healthcare. Her MOMMA's Act, which I  am proud to cosponsor, is really, truly, making a huge difference  already.   The horror of health disparities for African American women in many  ways is very personal to me. Let me just share a quick story about my  birth.   When my mother, Congresswoman Adams, went into labor--this was in El  Paso, Texas--she went to the hospital, and she needed a cesarean  section. They refused her admission, and she nearly died as a result.   By the time the very racist--it was a hospital that did not allow  African Americans into the hospital. By the time they allowed her in,  though, after my grandmother had to fight to get her in--as she told me  the story over and over again as a child--they put her on a gurney in  the hall. They just left her there. Again, she needed a C-section.   She became delirious, became unconscious. Somebody finally saw her.  By then, it was too late to do a C-section.   They pulled her in, and the doctors really didn't know quite what to  do. They finally decided to deliver me using forceps.   My mother almost died. I almost didn't get here. And I bore those  scars on my eye, the forceps scars, for many years. They went away just  a few years ago, actually.                                time  2100    I share that story because here we are now, in 2019, and we are  talking about many of the same issues that my mother had to face,  maternal death, infant mortality with African American women now here  in this country.   We have gone backwards. The United Nations did a report indicating  that we have gone back 25 years in this country. This is unacceptable.  It is totally unacceptable.   As a member of the Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and  Related Agencies Appropriations Subcommittee, though, we are working  every day to address the crisis swiftly and with a firm resolve to turn  the tide on these unacceptable disparities in health plaguing the  African American community and African American women.   It is utterly unacceptable that Black women are four times more  likely to die--again, I have to think about my mother tonight--four  times more likely to die from preventable pregnancy complications than  White women. We do have a Black maternal health crisis in America.   So as we celebrate Mother's Day, and as we honor our grandmothers and  our aunts and our mothers for giving us life, let us recommit  ourselves, on their behalf, to improving Black maternal outcomes.   But also, as Congresswoman Adams continues to remind us, we must  address the structural racism, structural racism which is really at the  core of this deadly issue. And it is a deadly issue.   So let me just remind us tonight that Black lives do matter.
