 Madam Speaker, over the last few days,  well more than 3,000 rockets have been fired into Israel by Hamas. This  comes as no surprise, given that the Hamas charter written in 1988  includes 36 articles all explicitly dedicated to the destruction of  Israel.   As a sovereign nation, Israel has every right to defend its borders,  communities, and citizens. The Biden administration has prioritized the  nuclear deal with Iran instead of making a full commitment to continue  our robust support for our most important ally in the Middle East,  Israel.   Iran is the leading state sponsor of terrorism and Iran's Supreme  Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, tweeted that Palestinians must ``stand  strong'' and ``confront the enemy'' shortly before Tel Aviv was  targeted by rocket fire.   Madam Speaker, many Democrats will not condemn the ceaseless attacks  against the Israeli people. Republicans are committed to ensuring that  the United States fully upholds its commitments to Israel and continues  to support the programs which have saved thousands of lives from  destruction by Iran, Hamas, and other terrorist groups.                            ____________________
