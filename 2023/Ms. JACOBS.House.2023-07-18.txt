 Mr. Speaker, gun violence is the number one killer of  kids and teens in America.   For so many problems facing our country, we don't know what to do, we  don't know exactly how to fix it. Gun violence is different. We know  what to do, but Republicans lack the backbone to do it, and, frankly,  their justifications why aren't good enough.   Bucking your party, alienating the NRA, or potentially risking your  seat is worth it to save lives.   We can save lives by reinstating the Federal Assault Weapons Ban. The  1994 ban that was implemented when I was only 5 years old decreased gun  massacres by 37 percent, and when that ban expired, gun massacres rose  by 183 percent.   Reinstating this ban would prevent parents from having to say their  final good-byes to their children. It would prevent the trauma we  knowingly pass on to future generations. It would prevent the never- ending what-ifs, if-onlys, and what-could-have-beens when thinking  about the loved ones we have lost.   I urge my colleagues to do the right thing and reinstate the Federal  Assault Weapons Ban.                            ____________________
