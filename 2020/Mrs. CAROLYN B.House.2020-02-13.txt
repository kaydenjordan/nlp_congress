 MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, I thank Chairman  Nadler and Jackie Speier for their historic leadership on the equal  rights amendment.   Madam Speaker, first introduced in 1923, the equal rights amendment  is still as relevant and necessary as ever because we know that  equality for women will always elude us when it isn't etched into our  Constitution.   We have seen it when the Supreme Court gutted the Violence Against  Women Act; we have seen it when judges don't enforce equal pay for  equal work or when a Federal judge ruled that Congress didn't have the  authority to outlaw female genital mutilation. But if your rights are  in the Constitution, then they can't be rolled back by the changing  whims of legislators, judges, or Presidents.   Women are long past due equal treatment under the law, and we will  persist until it is firmly guaranteed. There is no deadline for  equality. We demand our equality be spelled out in the Constitution,  and we spell it E-R-A.   Madam Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle  to support this important vote for equality.
