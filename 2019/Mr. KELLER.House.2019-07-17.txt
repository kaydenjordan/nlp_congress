 Madam Speaker, every Member of Congress was elected to  work on issues that will positively impact their districts.   As we stand here today, our Nation is dealing with a crisis at our  southern border; our seniors are struggling with rising prescription  drug prices; our farmers are waiting for a free and fair trade deal  with Mexico and Canada; and our veterans deserve the care they have  earned.   Yet, today, House Democrats are, once again, putting off these  important issues and continuing with their partisan investigations of  President Trump and his administration.   Madam Speaker, this administration has produced 31,000 pages of  documents related to the Census. This administration has made five  senior officials available for interview. All this is due to a  disagreement over a citizenship question on the Census.   Madam Speaker, a citizenship question is not new, nor should it be  controversial. Every Census conducted by the United States Government  from 1820 to 1950 asked about citizenship.   Other countries ask about citizenship. The United Nations recommends  it as a best practice. The Census Bureau today already asks a segment  of the population about citizenship.   Let's set these facts aside. Given that President Trump is no longer  seeking to add a citizenship question to the 2020 Census, voting on a  resolution to hold two Cabinet members in contempt of Congress is  simply a Democratic tactic to waste this Chamber's time and avoid  working on the serious issues facing our Nation.   Madam Speaker, I urge Members to vote against the resolution so the  House can stop this partisan nonsense and focus on meaningful policy.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise in support of H.R. 1847, the Inspector General Protection Act.  I thank Representative Ted Lieu for working in a bipartisan manner on  this legislation. H.R. 1847 will help ensure that inspectors general  vacancies across Federal agencies will be filled in a timely manner.   Inspectors general play an important role in improving the operations  of the Federal Government. They help combat fraud, waste, and abuse  throughout executive branch departments and agencies and promote a  resourceful and effective Federal Government.   They have assisted us with discharging one of our most important  responsibilities, shining the light on areas of the government that  need improved efficiency and economy.   However, throughout both Republican and Democratic administrations,  there have been numerous vacant inspector general positions. Certain  agencies have experienced prolonged periods of absent inspector general  leadership.   For example, the Department of the Interior has been without a  permanent inspector general since 2009. Likewise, there are  approximately 13 vacant inspector general positions for agencies  covered by the Inspector General Act.   This bill would require the President to timely notify Congress of a  failure to nominate an inspector general for a given agency. The  President would also be required to explain why a nomination has not  yet been made and provide a target date for that nomination.   The bill also calls for increased transparency by requiring the  President to notify Congress if an inspector general is placed on leave  or changes status.   Inspectors general are an indispensable tool to Congress. By ensuring  the Federal Government is adequately staffed with inspectors general,  we are reaffirming our commitment to rooting out government fraud,  waste, and abuse.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan  legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 736, the Access to  Congressionally Mandated Reports Act sponsored by my colleague from  Illinois (Mr. Quigley).   Federal agencies are required to produce numerous reports to Congress  each year. The reports cover a wide range of topics that give valuable  insight into government activities.   While some reports are posted on agency websites, most are not  available online. It is incredibly difficult for the general public to  find reports, especially older reports. Keep in mind that these are  reports that the taxpayers paid for in the first place.   H.R. 736 will solve this problem. The bill directs the Federal  Government to compile all congressionally mandated reports in a central  location.   The Government Publishing Office would be required to establish an  online database where agencies would submit congressionally mandated  reports. In order to protect sensitive information, the bill allows  agencies to redact information in reports that would otherwise not be  releasable to the public under the Freedom of Information Act.   The database would provide access to reports free of charge. The  reports would be searchable, sortable, and available to be downloaded  in bulk.   H.R. 736 ensures that these taxpayer-funded reports are transparent  and accessible. It will make it easier for both the public and Congress  to review and evaluate Federal agency activities. Increased  transparency under this bill will allow the public to help Congress  hold the government accountable.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I have no further speakers. I urge my  colleagues to support this bill, and I yield back the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Babin).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1250 introduced by  Representative Babin. The bill names a post office located in Hardin,  Texas, in honor of Army Chief Warrant Officer Lucas Lowe.   Lucas Lowe joined the United States Army in 2004. He served an 11- month deployment in Afghanistan, followed by a 14-month deployment in  Iraq. While deployed, Lowe served as a field artillery radar operator  and then as a paratrooper.   When he returned home, Lowe attended Warrant Officer Candidate School  and flight school at Fort Rucker, Alabama. Chief Warrant Officer Lowe  was then assigned to the 149th Aviation Regiment in the Texas National  Guard.   On December 28, 2016, Chief Warrant Officer Lowe lost his life during  a training accident while flying an Apache helicopter.   He left behind a wife, three sons, and two daughters.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1526 introduced by  Representative Heck. The bill names a post office located in Tumwater,  Washington, after Eva Hewitt.   Eva Hewitt was Tumwater's first female postmaster. Before becoming  postmaster, Eva and her husband owned and operated a drugstore in the  small town they called home. The drugstore housed the Tumwater Post  Office, and Eva started working there as an assistant.   In 1915 she assumed the role of postmaster and served there nearly  three decades. Following the death of her husband in 1927, Eva took  over the family business and served in both positions until her  retirement in 1942.   Often described as the heart and soul of Tumwater, Eva was a  community leader and a local historian. She spent her free time  researching, preserving, and educating the public on the history of the  Pacific Northwest.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I have no further speakers. I urge my  colleagues to support this bill, and I yield back the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1844, introduced by  Representative Krishnamoorthi. This bill names the post office located  in Elgin, Illinois, in honor of Marine Corporal Alex Martinez.   Alex Martinez knew he was destined for public service since he was a  little boy. He had a two-phased plan. First, he would join the  military, following in his father's footsteps. Then, upon retirement,  he would continue in public service as a police officer or firefighter.   Shortly after high school, Alex joined the United States Marine  Corps, filling step one of his boyhood dream. After boot camp, he was  assigned to the 1st Combat Engineer Battalion, 1st Marine Division.   Corporal Martinez was deployed twice to Afghanistan in support of  Operation Enduring Freedom. On April 5, 2012, Corporal Martinez was  conducting combat operations in the Helmand province of Afghanistan and  was killed after an explosive device detonated.   While Corporal Martinez's life of service was tragically cut short,  his sacrifice and bravery will not be forgotten. I urge my colleagues  to support this bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3305, introduced by  Representative Luria. The bill names a post office located in Virginia  Beach, Virginia, in honor of Ryan Keith Cox.   Ryan Keith Cox served the city of Virginia Beach for 12 years. He  worked in the Public Works Department as an account clerk until he was  murdered, saving the lives of his friends and coworkers earlier this  year.   On the morning of May 31, 2019, a city employee resigned from his job  at the municipal building where Cox work. That afternoon, the former  employee returned with evil intentions.   When a coworker ran into the office with news that there was an  active shooter, Keith remained calm and thought only of how to keep  other coworkers safe. He led them to the safety of a small room and  directed them to barricade the door.   Then, despite the danger, he continued to look for more of his  colleagues. By the time the shooting stopped, Keith was among the 12  innocent victims who were killed. His surviving colleagues remember him  as a kind, soft-spoken, and big teddy bear.   Madam Speaker, Keith's heroics will not be forgotten. I urge my  colleagues to support this bill, and I yield back the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  [[Page H5958]]    Madam Speaker, I yield as much time as she may consume to the  gentlewoman from Puerto Rico (Miss Gonzalez-Colon), my friend.                                time  1615    Miss GONZALEZ-COLON of Puerto Rico. Madam Speaker, I thank Mr. Keller  for the opportunity.   I am very humbled but, at the same time, very proud to rise in  support of H.R. 2325, legislation that I introduced to designate the  United States Postal Service facility located at 100 Calle Alondra in  San Juan, Puerto Rico, as the ``65th Infantry Regiment Post Office  Building.''   Shortly after Puerto Rico became a U.S. territory in 1898, Congress  authorized the creation of a unit of volunteer soldiers on the island.  Then, in 1920, the unit was redesignated as the 65th Infantry Regiment  of the United States Army, and it served as the Nation's last  segregated unit, composed mainly of Hispanic soldiers coming from  Puerto Rico.   Members of this regiment--commonly known as The Borinqueneers after  the Taino word for ``Puerto Rico'' meaning ``land of the brave lord''-- represent the best of our island's proud and rich tradition of military  service.   Despite their relatively limited combat service in World War II, the  regiment suffered casualties defending against enemy attacks.  Individual soldiers from this unit earned one Distinguished Service  Cross, two Silver Stars, two Bronze Stars, and 90 Purple Hearts.   However, it was during the Korean war that the 65th Infantry  Regiment's patriotism and courage came to be widely known and admired.   Fighting as a segregated unit from 1950 until 1952, the Borinqueneers  participated in some of the fiercest and toughest battles of the war.   The Borinqueneers not only fought the enemy on the battlefield, but  they also had to overcome negative stereotypes held by some of their  commanders and fellow soldiers.   Brigadier General William Harris, who commanded the regiment during  the early stages of the Korean war, would recall that he had been  reluctant to assume command of the unit just because of the prejudice  within the military, but that his experience eventually led him to  regard the members of the 65th Infantry Regiment as the best soldiers  he had ever seen.   General Douglas MacArthur, commander in chief of the United Nations  Command in Korea, would similarly write that ``The Puerto Ricans  forming the ranks of the gallant 65th Infantry give daily proof on the  battlefields of Korea of their courage, determination, and resolute  will to victory, their invincible loyalty to the United States and  their fervent devotion to those immutable principles of human relations  which the Americans of the continent and Puerto Rico have in common.  They are writing a brilliant record of heroism in battle, and I am  indeed proud to have them under my command. I wish that we could count  on many more like them.''   For its extraordinary service during the Korean war, the  Borinqueneers received many unit-level awards, including two  Presidential Unit Citations. Soldiers in the regiment earned a total of  nine Distinguished Service Crosses, approximately 250 Silver Stars,  over 600 Bronze Stars, and more than 2,700 Purple Hearts.   Even 60 years later the laurels continued, as Master Sergeant Juan  Negron, who served in the 65th Infantry Regiment, was posthumously  awarded the Medal of Honor, our Nation's highest military decoration.   In 2014, actually, this same House enacted legislation to award the  Congressional Gold Medal to the Borinqueneers. The 65th, consequently,  became the first Hispanic unit and the sole unit from the Korean war to  receive this distinction, and they were the last unit to launch a  battalion-sized bayonet attack by the U.S. Army.   Madam Speaker, H.R. 2325 allows us to continue honoring the  Borinqueneers' service by designating the U.S. Post Office in San Juan  as the ``65th Infantry Regiment Post Office Building.''   This recognition is made even more significant when considering that  this Federal building is located adjacent to one of Puerto Rico's main  avenues. Do you know the name? It is the 65th Infantry Regiment Avenue.  That is how proud we feel about our Borinqueneers.   The story of these soldiers is emblematic of the courage of thousands  of Puerto Rican soldiers who, for generations, have fought and bled  alongside their fellow Americans to defend the United States across the  world.   Madam Speaker, as Puerto Rico's sole representative in this Congress,  I urge my colleagues to join me in further recognizing their sacrifice,  their legacy, by supporting this bill.    Madam Speaker, I think that Representative Gonzalez-Colon  articulately pointed out why we should all support H.R. 2325.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and  I yield back the balance of my time.
