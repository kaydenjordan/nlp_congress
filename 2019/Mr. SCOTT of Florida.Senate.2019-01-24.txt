 Mr. President, I rise today as a voice for the  people of Puerto Rico. I intend to be their voice in the U.S. Senate.  They are Americans--as American as the people of Florida whom I was  elected to represent. They are our brothers and sisters, and they  deserve a voice. Their success is America's success. Their recovery is  America's recovery.   In September of 2017, Puerto Rico was hit by a devastating hurricane.  Maria's landfall changed the landscape of the island forever. As  Governor of Florida, I worked to be there for the people of Puerto  Rico. I worked with Congresswoman Jenniffer Gonzalez Colon, Governor  Rossello, Lieutenant Governor Luis Rivera Marin, Senate President  Thomas Rivera Schatz, and House Speaker Carlos Johnny Mendez to provide  whatever support and aid they needed.   Jennifer has been a tireless advocate for Puerto Rico, and she has  been fighting so hard for this funding. I am proud to join her in this  fight.   In Florida, we created welcome centers at the airports in Orlando and  in Miami to support those coming to Florida from the island. We waived  housing and education regulations to make sure families coming from  Puerto Rico could easily settle in Florida,  [[Page S575]]  whether they planned to stay permanently or just for a short period of  time.   I have visited Puerto Rico eight times since the deadly storm and  provided Florida State resources to the citizens of Puerto Rico to aid  in rebuilding and recovery, but the island still has a long way to go.   The bill I supported today does many good things. It reopens the  government after the longest shutdown in U.S. history. It provides  significant funding to secure our southern border--funding that is long  overdue and that is needed to keep American families safe. It extends  protections for children who were brought to this country illegally  through no fault of their own, and it extends TPS. While I would prefer  a permanent solution for the DACA kids and TPS, this is a positive  step. Putting protections for the DACA population into law is also long  overdue.   The bill also provides significant disaster funding for the State of  Florida following the devastation of Hurricane Michael, which hit  Florida's Panhandle just a few months ago. The funding includes  resources specifically for Tyndall Air Force Base. I would like to  thank Majority Leader McConnell for putting a bill forward to help  Florida recover from this horrible hurricane.   On all of these points, I join many of my colleagues in support, but,  unfortunately, the Senate version of the government funding bill does  not include $600 million in essential disaster funding for our brothers  and sisters in Puerto Rico.   I am offering an amendment today that would add the $600 million  included in the House bill back to the Senate version.   Puerto Rico's recovery continues, and the U.S. Congress must do  everything we can to support that, with responsible safeguards against  fraud and waste. As long as I am a Member of the U.S. Senate, I will  fight to make sure the people of Puerto Rico are represented. I am  proud that the first amendment I filed and my first speech on the  Senate floor is to fight for Puerto Rico.   To the people of Puerto Rico, know this: I will be your voice in the  Senate. I will fight for what is right, and I will never give up.   I will now address the Senate in Spanish. I provided the translation  to the Senate for the Record.   (English translation of the statement made in Spanish is as follows:)         The people of Puerto Rico deserve real change. We have to       strengthen the economy of the island. As a Senator, I will       fight for the families of Puerto Rico and work to ensure that       Puerto Rico is treated fairly.        Thank you so much.    Mr. President, the amendment is at the desk.   I yield back the balance of my time.
