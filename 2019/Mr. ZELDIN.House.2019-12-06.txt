 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H. Res. 326.   I have great respect for the gentleman from New York (Mr. Engel), who  has been a long-time champion of the U.S.-Israel relationship. And as I  was listening to his opening remarks, there is a lot that he said that  I strongly agreed with. And it kind of pained me realizing that he  didn't write this actual resolution that is before us, because I know  it would have been worded differently and it would have received  support.   Unfortunately, many of the opening remarks which I strongly agreed  with are deliberately not in this resolution. It is a great opening for  another resolution, not this one.   Last summer we came to the House floor and we almost unanimously  passed a resolution to strongly oppose BDS. That resolution included a  lot of what this resolution tries to do. It is a watered-down version  of what we did last summer. When we woke up the next day, many Members  in this House said, okay, now what are we going to do about it?   S. 1 was a bill that passed at the beginning of this year in the  Senate with strong bipartisan support with under 80 Senators voting for  it. It has a companion bill, H.R. 336, by lead Republican   Michael  McCaul of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. There is a discharge  petition that has almost 200 signatures on it led by Congressman Brian  Mast to bring S. 1-H.R. 336 to the floor.   So we made a strong statement last summer, and we woke up the next  day, and are motivated to do something about it. We can actually, right  now, with this time that we are debating and with the vote that we are  about to have, we can actually be passing a bill with teeth that would  go to the President's desk and would be signed into law.   And that is where our focus should have been. This resolution before  us today is deeply flawed, it is highly partisan, it is ill-timed, and  it is poorly crafted.   In the last 2 years, Israel has been hit by over 2,600 rockets and  mortars. In the past year alone, 1,500 of those rockets were fired from  the Gaza Strip into Israel.   Filing this resolution squarely into the category of worst timing  possible, H. Res. 326 comes to the floor just 1 week after Israel was  bombarded with over 450 rockets. In all of the pages of this  resolution, guess where it mentions Palestinian terrorism? Nowhere.   This resolution fails to not only recognize these latest attacks, but  all of the persistent assaults on innocent Israelis by Palestinian  terrorists.   Guess what else this resolution fails to mention? It is silent on  fundamental facts that shape the way Israel has dealt with a constant  threat on its border, as the chair so eloquently observed when he  referenced Hamas rockets raining into Israel and Palestinians paying  off terrorists, and the need for a Jewish and democratic state. It  makes no reference to Hamas firing rockets. It makes no reference to  Palestinians paying off terrorists. It makes no reference to  recognizing Israel as a Jewish state.   During the March of Return, every single week protestors gather along  the border of Israel in Gaza to throw Molotov cocktails and burning  tires at IDF soldiers. Just this week, Hamas passed out leaflets  calling on the public to join these protests in response to Israel  defending itself against the Palestinian Islamic jihad. You won't find  this in this resolution. Or that Hamas uses innocent women as human  shields, that they call jihad an obligation, inciting violence. And  that list goes on.   And maybe worst of all, this resolution completely fails to mention  that Israel has made repeated attempts to offer peace proposals to the  Palestinian Authority. After the Camp David talks in 2000, Israel  offered to withdraw from 90 percent of Judea and Samaria, parts of East  Jerusalem and Gaza. That same year, though, the Palestinians started  the Second Intifada, and more than 1,000 innocent Israeli civilians  were killed in a Palestinian campaign of suicide bombings and  shootings.   In 2008, Israel offered to withdraw from 93 percent of Judea and  Samaria, but time and again, the Palestinian Authority rejected peace  proposals while continuing to refuse to this day, both publicly and  privately, to accept Israel as a Jewish state.   In this vein, the Palestinian Authority continues to incite violence  and financially rewards terrorism through its Pay for Slay program,  which included the murder of an American, United States military  academy graduate, Army veteran Taylor Force.   Yet, House Democrats added language to this resolution at the last  minute to support the Palestinians, despite the fact that the  Palestinian Authority refuses to suspend this Pay for Slay program to  this day.   This resolution imposes a solution for Israel, stating specific  Palestinian Authority demands and deliberately leaving out critical  Israeli preconditions necessary to maintain security.   If you are going to engage in naming specific preconditions like the  way this resolution puts those preconditions on Israel, the Palestinian  Authority demands, well then try to balance it all out, but this  resolution doesn't even make any reference to Palestinian terrorism. It  is silent about providing assurances for Israel's safety and security  through a demilitarized zone, but that didn't stop the resolution's  authors from including Palestinian demands of Israel.   The timing of this vote is no coincidence either. This resolution, by  the authors' own admission, is a clear rebuke to the Trump  administration's recent reversal of the Obama administration's  targeting of Israel with U.N. Security Council Resolution 2334. The  timing is no coincidence.   The resolution references President Obama's policy toward Israel  after the November 2016 election, but does not mention the Trump  administration's efforts. One of the worst lines in this resolution  references support for ``the principles set forth by President Obama in  December 2016.'' After the Obama administration abstained from U.N.  Security Council Resolution 2334, the House, along with many of my  Democratic colleagues here today, voted in favor of a resolution to  forcefully condemn U.N. Security Council Resolution 2334.    This resolution, H. Res. 326, is a reversal on that point, pointing  to that December 2016 moment in time as if it was something that should  be applauded. This resolution chooses to reference President Obama's  policy while intentionally leaving out the Trump administration's  policy, ensuring a partisan outcome to this resolution.   The resolution doesn't mention the long list of victories that we  have had in this administration to strengthen our support and security  and stability of Israel, to strengthen the U.S.-Israel relationship,  like moving our embassy in Israel to Jerusalem, to signing the Taylor  Force Act, and recognizing Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights.   This partisan resolution creates a totally unnecessary schism in what  has otherwise been a longstanding history of strong, bipartisan support  for the U.S.-Israel relationship, which included the resolution that  passed last summer.   There are other great bipartisan bills that support Israel and fight  anti-Semitism at home. We should be spending our time debating and  passing bills like S. 1 and H.R. 336 sponsored by   Michael McCaul, the  Never Again Education Act or the Peace and Tolerance in Palestinian  Education Act.                                time  0930    The House already passed, almost unanimously, that resolution, H.  Res. 246, last summer that opposed BDS and supported peace between the  Israelis and Palestinians. Now, we are bringing a watered-down,  partisan, and weakened version of what has already passed in the House.   House Democrats should bring bipartisan legislation forward with  teeth that will support Israel and fight the BDS movement. But rather  than move forward and build on our longstanding history of bipartisan  support of the U.S.-Israeli alliance, House Democrats have decided to  play partisan politics with what is a powder keg.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this  resolution, and I reserve the balance of my time.  [[Page H9301]]         Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio  (Mr. Chabot).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, one point to clarify about this resolution, as the  bill's author, my friend from Queens, we should say, even though he has  a new district these days, talks about this not being a partisan  resolution, this debate and this vote, the reality is this resolution  is going to end up being, and is, the most partisan resolution that  this House has ever taken up on Israel.   Mr. Speaker, I look forward to an opportunity to work with the bill's  author. I believe strongly in the need to strengthen the U.S.-Israel  relationship. I also feel strongly in my opposition to this bill, as  many of my colleagues do as well, but it actually is quite partisan  with regard to the text, the debate, and the ultimate vote.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, for the sake of time, I will save some of my  thoughts on what was just said. That was a very alternate version of  reality that we look forward to addressing over the course of this  debate. Hopefully, my friend from Virginia (Mr. Connolly) sticks  around.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from North Carolina  (Ms. Foxx).    Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Roy).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from Texas.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, as I am listening to different colleagues on the other  side of the aisle speaking about this resolution, some are claiming  that this is not partisan and that the timing doesn't have anything to  do with the Trump administration, and then others are coming and  speaking that this is about rebuking the Trump administration. So I am  unclear as far as that messaging.   I do know that there have been multiple quotes that have been put out  by Democrats in this Chamber that the timing is no coincidence. This  was brought up after an announcement was made recently by Secretary  Pompeo with regards to reversing President Obama's policy that was  announced after the November 2016 election.   So, where my friends on the other side of the aisle speak about  longstanding U.S. policy, I guess it is important for a quick recap of  that longstanding U.S. policy over recent years.   At the end of 2016, after the November 2016 election, the Obama  administration helped get through the United Nations U.N. Security  Council Resolution 2334 with regards to the view of activity in Judea,  Samaria, and parts of east Jerusalem; and, for the first time, the U.N.  Security Council was saying that that was a violation of international  law.   This Chamber, with more Democrats voting in favor of the resolution  than against, voted for a resolution to condemn U.N. Security Council  Resolution 2334. This Chamber had a problem on a large, bipartisan  basis and came together to condemn U.N. Security Council Resolution  2334.   That is what this resolution specifically references when it says the  Obama administration's policy from December 2016. That was great when  we all came together like that because we had a problem with reversing  longstanding U.S. policy with that U.N. Security Council resolution.   Then this Chamber came together again this past summer, almost  unanimously, passing a resolution--a strong, bipartisan resolution-- strongly condemning BDS and talking about the need for peace between  the Israelis and the Palestinians.   This resolution today is, unfortunately, a debate. It is a draft, and  it is a vote that is going to be very partisan. But the inconsistency  and the arguments on the other side of the aisle--some are saying this  has nothing to do with President Trump and his policies and others are  saying that it does. And some are saying that timing is no coincidence  and others have made specific comments that it is absolutely a result  of the Trump administration's recent announcements. Those  inconsistencies are being noticed by all.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.                                time  1000     Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  [[Page H9305]]  The majority are tying themselves up in knots.   With all due respect to the majority leader, who said there was not a  departure in policy towards the end of the Obama administration and  that I was incorrect; I would like to point him to H. Res. 11 from  January 2017, that he voted in favor of as well as most House  Democrats, which included: ``Whereas on December 23, 2016, the United  States Permanent Representative to the United Nations disregarded  H.Con. Res. 165 and departed from longstanding United States policy by  abstaining and permitting United Nations Security Council Resolution  2334 to be adopted under Chapter VI of the United Nations Charter.''   That is from a resolution that the majority leader voted in favor of,  where he personally, and many others in this Chamber on both sides of  the aisle, took strong exception with that departure from longstanding  U.S. policy with U.N. Security Council Resolution 2334, now reversing  that, once again, with the text of this resolution that is giving a  shout-out to that December 2016 Obama administration policy as if it is  something to be applauded.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, again, I rise in strong opposition to this resolution. I  encourage all of my colleagues to oppose it as well.   It is no coincidence that this resolution is being brought now. It is  an attempted rebuke of the Trump administration.   I think that this Chamber should be coming together and praising the  decision to move the U.S. Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem, that this  Chamber should be coming together and praising the decision to  recognize Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights. We all should be  coming together on a bipartisan basis with regard to the implementation  of the Taylor Force Act.   The Palestinian Authority has a policy not just to incite violence  but to financially reward terrorism. If you murder an innocent American  or Israeli, by policy--this is no secret; it is documented; it is their  own admission--they will pay you money.   Now, as far as this Chamber goes, we are stewards of U.S. tax  dollars. To send money to the Palestinian Authority, as long as they  have a policy where they are going to pay someone for murdering an  American, that is something that this Chamber should be coming together  on, on a bipartisan basis, with regard to the implementation of the  Taylor Force Act and how to do even better.   This resolution attempts to get into that world of what preconditions  need to be met in order to have an agreement between Israelis and  Palestinians. It chooses to stay silent with regard to any of the  Israeli preconditions on the Palestinians, but this resolution chooses  not to be silent on the preconditions of the Palestinians toward the  Israelis. Not just in the text of the resolution but today in the  debate, the goal is to place pressure on the Israelis, on what they  need to make concessions on, by not saying anything at all with regard  to Palestinians committing acts of terror and being financially  rewarded for it, saying nothing about Hamas.   Hamas literally put in their charter that jihad is an obligation. I  wonder where Hamas stands.   If the Palestinian Authority sat down with Israelis and right now  agreed, I don't know if whoever would sign that document on behalf of  the Palestinian Authority would be assassinated within days. But I will  say that he can't in good faith deliver all of his people because not  only are the ranks of the Palestinian Authority filled with the likes  of terrorist groups like Hamas--and Hamas is a designated foreign  terrorist organization of the United States--not only can they not  deliver their people, Hamas doesn't just refute the argument that  Israel has a right to exist as a Jewish state, Hamas refutes the  argument that Israel has a right to exist.   How are we silent about a resolution? If you want to get into  preconditions, how do we not get into any acts of Hamas denying access  to humanitarian aid to its own people or the fact that they use women  and children as human shields, that Hamas will pay someone  [[Page H9306]]  to get shot? A kid goes to a checkpoint, gets shot, and gets paid $500.   Right now, as we are here--I mean, literally, as the decision is  being made to bring this resolution to the floor, Israel is getting  showered by rockets from a terrorist group in Gaza, hundreds of rockets  targeting innocent Israelis, kids who are going to school or are  worshiping or are at home or are running to bomb shelters because they  have rockets being launched at them, trying to kill them.   That is the issue with getting into that world of preconditions, only  talking about the preconditions that the Palestinians want to place on  the Israelis, and then to double down and triple down during floor  debate and to be silent entirely with regard to any of the  preconditions toward peace.   December 2016 is specifically referenced in this resolution. This  House came together and condemned that December 2016 policy. After the  November 2016 election, this House came together in January on a huge  bipartisan basis and condemned that change of policy in December 2016.   The reversal here in this resolution is now this resolution is  specifically referencing the December 2016 policy as if it is something  to be celebrated.   What we should be doing right now is passing legislation with teeth-- by the way, a whole lot of legislation with teeth: passing USMCA;  lowering the cost of prescription drugs, a bipartisan agreement that  passed out of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce; passing S.1/ H.R. 336, legislation with teeth to stop BDS, to help support Israel  with teeth; authorizing funding to support Jordan; legislation with  teeth to increase sanctions on Assad in Syria.   This bill has already passed the Senate with all of these different  Republicans and Democrats, almost 80 Senators passing it.   Bill numbers are set based on what is important. What is important to  the Senate? That was S.1.   We made a strong statement last summer, almost unanimously passing a  resolution condemning BDS, including language toward peace between the  Israelis and the Palestinians. We should have woken up the next day  united to now do something about it.    It is one thing to make a statement about anything that anyone in  this Chamber is passionate about, and I respect the different passions  and backgrounds of all of my colleagues. There are people who have  different opinions on just about anything that comes for a vote in this  Chamber.   When we choose to make statements of something that we feel strongly  about, it is important to wake up the next day and say: ``Okay, well,  what are we going to do about it?'' That is why, while I am so proud of  my colleagues for voting almost unanimously for that resolution, we  should be passing S.1/H.R. 336.   Mr. Speaker, I ask for all of my colleagues to oppose this  resolution, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
