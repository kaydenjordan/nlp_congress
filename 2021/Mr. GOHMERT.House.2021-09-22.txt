 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of amendment 165. It  creates a separate career track for military judges to prevent undue  influence from command above.   In the 1970s it was seen that it would be good for trial defense  attorneys to have a separate track so that they were not rated by the  same person who was pushing to have a court martial. That created some  problems and at times some abuses.   The separation and the creation of a trial defense service served a  great purpose, but before 2004 each of the judge advocates general of  the armed services subscribed to the policy that all judge advocates  should have a broad career and move from job to job. They became quite  good at all trades but masters of none.   So junior judge advocates would try a few court martials, then move  from one job to another. It gave them a broad basis, but it was not  helpful overall.   By giving the military judges a separate career track, it will ensure  avoidance of undue command influence and will give our servicemembers  the fair trials they deserve. I would encourage everyone to vote for  this amendment.
