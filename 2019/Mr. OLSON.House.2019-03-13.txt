 Mr. Speaker, on March 7 of this year, 6 days ago, we lost  our colleague Ralph Hall.   Ralph's journey among us here in Congress and our world started on  May 3, 1923, in a town called Fate, Texas. Never in American history  has a town of birth been more appropriate for a man than Fate, Texas.  Ralph's life was all about fate, great faith, and God.   As fate would have it, Ralph left Fate and moved to wall when he was  3 years old. He started working there at a local convenience store.   As fate would have it, guess who showed up? Bonnie and Clyde, the  notorious killers on a rampage throughout Texas, Arkansas, Oklahoma,  that part of our country. They gave Ralph a 25-cent tip--a quarter--big  money in those days. He was so excited, he showed his boss the quarter  and noticed a newspaper lying there on the  [[Page H2687]]  floor. Whose picture was on the front of that paper? Bonnie and Clyde.   He told his boss, ``They just came here. They are in Rockwall. That  is their car.'' His boss called the local sheriff. Ralph couldn't hear  the conversation, but the sheriff said something to the effect of,  ``Thanks for calling about Bonnie and Clyde. I've got two stray dogs  I've got to catch. Once I get those dogs, I'm going after Bonnie and  Clyde.''   After the surprise attack on Pearl Harbor, Ralph joined our Navy to  fly naval aircraft. He went to Pensacola, Florida, for his first  training.   As fate would have it, he met a Hall of Fame baseball player, Ted  Williams of the Boston Red Sox, the last man to hit over .400 in a  season. Knowing he had Ted on his baseball team, Ralph found a young  Army sergeant and said: ``Hey, son, I want to bet you my whole paycheck  on a baseball game, Navy versus Army.''   The day of the game, Ralph knocked on Ted's door. Ted answered with a  fishing pole and some gear to go fishing. Ralph said, ``You have to  play baseball and beat Army.'' Ted said, ``I came here to learn to fly,  defend America, and then fish.'' Ralph held the game up so Ted could go  AWOL, absent without leave, and go fishing.   Of course, that night, Ralph had to go home to his queen, his beloved  Mary Ellen, and tell her, ``Honey, I have just lost my entire paycheck  betting on a baseball game with the Army.''   Ralph got out of flight school and went to war. He flew the F6F  Hellcat on aircraft carriers. Now, I was a naval aviator, and I have to  tell you, those guys were crazy, crazy, crazy courageous. Right now, if  you land on an aircraft carrier, you have what is called the meatball.  This ball gives you course and glide slope. In those days, they had  guys with paddles.   Ralph said his proudest achievement in naval aviation during the war  was to make sure on his record book that his takeoffs were the same  number as his landings.   As fate would have it, once again, Ralph came home to Rockwall,  Texas, to become a lawyer. The local county judge retired, so there was  a vacancy. People said, ``Ralph, you should run our county. File for  election.'' Ralph didn't want to play politics. That wasn't his  business. But driving home, he said, ``You know what? I will just  apply, maybe be there for just a couple months and go back home to my  lawyer job.'' He filed 1 minute before the deadline that year, 1  minute.   He was driving home. The local radio was booming: ``Ralph Hall,  running for county judge.'' Guess who was outside his home, waiting  with an angered look on her face? His queen, Mary Ellen.   That fate got Ralph going into public service and got Ralph here on  Capitol Hill.   As fate would have it, when America goes back to the Moon sometime in  the next couple years, they are going to do that because of Ralph Hall.   God bless Ralph Hall. As our dear friend Gene Cernan said: May you  always have fair winds and following seas. You shot for your Moon. You  are still among the stars.   God bless Ralph Hall.                            ____________________
