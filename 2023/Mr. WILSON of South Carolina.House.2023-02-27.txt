 Mr. Speaker, I am grateful to serve as  chairman of the U.S. Helsinki Commission, also known as the  Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.   Last week, in Vienna, all democracies of the 57-member Parliamentary  Assembly unanimously supported Ukraine and condemnation of war criminal  Putin.   The world understands there is competition between democracies with  rule of law opposed by authoritarians with rule of gun. War criminal  Putin is sacrificing young Russians for oil, money, and power for  himself.   Ukraine represents peace through strength and must be victorious in  this conflict to avoid the Chinese Communist Party invasion of Taiwan  and to stop the Iranian regime as it develops intercontinental  ballistic missiles to vaporize Israel and bring mass murder to America.   America is not alone in understanding freedom is not free. The  European Union has provided $54 billion to Ukraine, and recently,  Norway authorized another $7 billion and Japan another $5 billion. Over  52 nations are promoting eventual peace through strength for Ukraine.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, who successfully protected  America for 20 years, as the global war on terrorism continues moving  from the Afghanistan safe haven to America.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the  rules and agree to the resolution (H. Res. 132) responding to the  earthquakes in Turkiye and Syria on February 6, 2023.   The Clerk read the title of the resolution.   The text of the resolution is as follows:                                H. Res. 132         Whereas, on February 6, 2023, a magnitude 7.8 earthquake       struck central-southern Turkiye, followed by a magnitude 7.5       earthquake later the same day, followed by over a thousand       aftershocks in Turkiye and northwest Syria;        Whereas the earthquakes have caused massive death and       destruction, killing more than 36,000 people and injuring       tens of thousands more in Turkiye and Syria;        Whereas the United States Agency for International       Development and other agencies mobilized Federal agencies and       partners to provide life-saving assistance to the people of       Turkiye and Syria;        Whereas dangerous freezing winter weather conditions       negatively impacted rescue efforts and put earthquake       survivors at further risk after thousands of buildings       collapsed into rubble;        Whereas the Republic of Turkiye is a North Atlantic Treaty       Organization (NATO) ally of the United States;        Whereas prior to the devastating earthquakes, millions of       people in Syria were relying on humanitarian assistance, and       Turkiye was hosting more than 3,500,000 Syrian refugees;        Whereas through 12 years of war in Syria, the Assad regime       has impeded the delivery of humanitarian assistance to       civilians, including those in areas now impacted by the       February 6, 2023, earthquakes;  [[Page H887]]         Whereas the Russian Federation and People's Republic of       China have used their veto power at the United Nations       Security Council to restrict the number of United Nations-      authorized border crossings between Turkiye and Syria from       four to just one--Bab al-Hawa;        Whereas although areas outside of the Assad regime's       control have been the worst affected by the earthquake,       Foreign Minister Faisal Mekdad stated that any aid to victims       must go through the Syrian Government in Damascus;        Whereas Department of State Spokesman Ned Price has stated       it would be ``ironic, if not even counterproductive, for us       to reach out to a government that has brutalized its people       over the course of a dozen years now'';        Whereas the Assad regime has shamefully used the earthquake       to call for the lifting of United States sanctions, falsely       claiming that such sanctions impede the aid response; and        Whereas the human cost of this disaster transcends mere       statistics and has resulted in deeply personal tragedies for       countless families: Now, therefore, be it        Resolved, That the House of Representatives--        (1) mourns the horrific loss of life in Turkiye and Syria       caused by the earthquakes in Turkiye on February 6, 2023;        (2) expresses its deep condolences to the families of the       many earthquake victims;        (3) applauds the heroic work of humanitarian aid and rescue       workers on the ground to save lives and provide care for       victims, including United States Agency for International       Development Urban Search and Rescue teams, the Armed Forces       of the United States, including members of such Armed Forces       stationed at the Incirlik Air Force base in Turkiye, and the       Syrian Civil Defense, otherwise known as the White Helmets;        (4) applauds the response to the earthquake tragedy by the       United States Government, other governments, and       nongovernmental organizations;        (5) applauds the civilians in Turkiye and Syria who have       selflessly volunteered to assist with response to the       devastating aftermath;        (6) urges the international community to support heroic       disaster response efforts in Turkiye and Syria, including       those by the Syrian Civil Defense, the White Helmets;        (7) condemns efforts by the Assad regime to cynically       exploit the disaster to evade international pressure and       accountability, including by preventing the United Nations       from providing assistance through multiple border crossings       between Turkiye and Syria;        (8) calls on the Biden administration to continue to use       all diplomatic tools, including through the United Nations       Security Council, to open all Turkiye-Syria border crossings       for United Nations assistance;        (9) underscores the need for international assistance to       reach northwest Syria to assist with disaster relief;        (10) calls for an increased oversight mechanism to ensure       that United States-funded assistance is not diverted for the       benefit of the Assad regime;        (11) urges the Biden administration to remain committed to       the protection of the Syrian people including by implementing       the Caesar Syria Civilian Protection Act of 2019; and        (12) welcomes the Republic of Turkiye's continuing support       to Syrian refugees in Turkiye and in northwestern Syria.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent  that all Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend  their remarks and include extraneous material on this measure.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, America and the world have been shocked by the deadly  earthquake in Turkiye and Syria on February 6, which killed more than  50,000 people and injured more than 100,000 people.   Entire cities and towns near the epicenter in Turkiye have been wiped  off the map. Five million people are homeless, and over 20 million are  in need now. We are grateful to see such a generous and compassionate  American response. Many brave men and women both inside Turkiye, Syria,  and others from around the globe sprang into action to work  relentlessly at search and rescue operations and providing relief to  the people impacted on the ground.   At Incirlik Air Base, a very strategic American air base in Turkiye,  125 miles from the earthquake epicenter, the 728th Air Mobility  Squadron and the 39th Operational Support Squadron have worked quickly  to coordinate with the United States Agency for International  Development to deliver aid to those impacted on the ground who are in  need.   American families offer sincere sympathies to the families who are  mourning loved ones and nursing others back to health. The Republic of  Turkiye for over 70 years has been a valued NATO ally, and as co-chair  of the Congressional Caucus on U.S.-Turkey Relations and Turkish  Americans, I am particularly supportive of their efforts to meet the  needs of the impacted earthquake victims.   Entrepreneurial Turkish-American and Syrian-American communities have  been mobilized to help, such as Vinnie and Nesli Senturk, owners of  Hidden Valley Tavern in Sapphire, North Carolina, represented by  Congressman Chuck Edwards, who are raising funds to help the people in  Turkiye.   Syria Civil Defence, better known as the White Helmets, have been  instrumental in search and rescue efforts, in addition to clearing  rubble and opening roads to facilitate the distribution of relief aid  by local nongovernment organizations. Their efforts saved at least  3,000 lives, despite being left alone and receiving no material  international support through the critical and crucial first days of  the response.   Impressive assistance by Raed Al Saleh and all the other White  Helmets, which he leads, has been achieved to help the people who are  so desperately needed to advocate and provide real assistance.   To make this devastating tragedy worse, Syria's brutal dictator Assad  is stealing humanitarian aid, and even worse, has continued bombing the  affected areas at least 10 times since the earthquake. There have  already been videos of the Assad regime soldiers stealing aid that is  attempting to reach Syrian communities in need.   The United Nations even refused to provide critical aid into  northwest Syria because of war criminal Putin's veto on cross-border  assistance in the United Nations Security Council after the Assad  regime initially refused to permit humanitarian aid through northern  points of entry that are controlled by opposition groups.   The United Nations should not politicize humanitarian assistance.  Even further, the U.N. should circumvent the obstructions of Assad and  war criminal Putin, which denies humanitarian aid to earthquake  victims. It is significant this resolution calls on President Biden to  use all diplomatic means to push the U.N. to get aid to those in need.   Natasha Hall from the Center for Strategic and International Studies  said it clearly, ``The Syrian Government has perfected the  politicization and weaponization of humanitarian aid throughout the  civil war--in some cases it's far more effective than a military  offensive.''   Yet, Assad, to add insult to injury, continues to lie and blame U.S.  sanctions for causing delays in aid. This is simply not true. As this  resolution makes clear, Mr. Speaker, sanctions on war criminals like  Assad, which passed on a bipartisan basis, prevent the regime from  obtaining the resources to further brutalize the people of Syria, and  do not inhibit humanitarian assistance.   Mr. Speaker, I am deeply saddened that there has been a weakening of  sanctions by the Biden administration on the Assad regime through  permitting direct transactions with the Assad regime. This will do  nothing to help with earthquake relief and will only endanger Syrian  civilians by enriching the regime.   We are already seeing the result of Biden's weak policy this week  with Arab countries beginning to normalize relations with the regime  and ignoring the Caesar Act, which threatened dire consequences for  normalization. Despite this, let it be known that Congress will  continue to stand with the Caesar Act on a bipartisan basis and  strengthen sanctions on Assad and those who engage this barbaric  regime.   It is gruesomely clear that there is no solution to the problems in  Syria so long as the brutal Assad regime remains in power. Terrorism,  refugees, war crimes, Iranian influence, chemical weapons,  narcotrafficking, genocide--Assad is the driver of all these. This  earthquake proves the point yet  [[Page H888]]  again, American families' prayers and sincere condolences go to the  people of Turkiye and Syria.   To the brutal Assad regime and its backers, war criminal Putin, and  the authoritarian Ayatollah in Iran, there will be a message: Your  diversion of humanitarian aid during an earthquake is despicable. You  are not fooling anyone with your lies about sanctions. The U.S.  Congress stands united. We will never normalize with you. We will hold  all those who attempt to normalize with you accountable. We will not  stop supporting the people of Syria to have a government they deserve  based on democracy with rule of law, not authoritarian with rule of  gun. It is bipartisan in America to support freedom for the people of  Syria and Iran and victory for the people of Ukraine seeking to defend  their country from authoritarian governments.   Mr. Speaker, our prayers go to those affected by the earthquake. God  bless the people of Turkiye, Syria, and the United States of America.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

Hon. Jim Jordan,      Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Jordan: Thank you for consulting with the       Foreign Affairs Committee and agreeing to be discharged from       further consideration of House Resolution 132, related to the       recent earthquakes in Turkiye and Syria, so that the       resolution may proceed expeditiously to the House floor.

I will seek to place our letters on H. Res. 132 into the       Congressional Record during floor consideration. I appreciate       your cooperation regarding this legislation and look forward       to continuing to work together as this measure moves through       the legislative process.            Sincerely,                                                 Michael T. McCaul,                                                          Chairman.     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume. It is really refreshing to see Republicans and  Democrats come together as we assist the people of Turkiye and Syria.  The comments from Bill Keating are inspiring. I am just so grateful  that he is one of the first cosponsors of the legislation to show our  appreciation of the people of Turkiye and Syria. It is particularly  meaningful to me. The loss of life is inconceivable: 50,000 people  dead, 100,000 people injured, and 5 million people homeless. Actually,  in some ways I can identify. The largest earthquake ever recorded on  the East Coast was in my birthplace of Charleston, South Carolina, on  August 31, 1886. Growing up    =========================== NOTE ===========================        February 27, 2023, on page H889, in the second column, the  following appeared: birthplace of Charleston, South Carolina, on  October 31, 1886. Growing up      The online version has been corrected to read: birthplace of  Charleston, South Carolina, on August 31, 1886. Growing up    ========================= END NOTE =========================    there in Charleston, when I was much younger, people had actually a  memory of the earthquake. It is something that has been so horrifying,          and indeed, we are with the people of Turkiye and Syria.   It is particularly significant to me where America has such a  positive role, the thought that Incirlik Air Base is    =========================== NOTE ===========================        February 27, 2023, on page H889, in the second column, the  following appeared: It is particularly significant to me where  America has such a positive role, the thought that an insular care  base is      The online version has been corrected to read: It is  particularly significant to me where America has such a positive  role, the thought that Incirlik Air Base is    ========================= END NOTE =========================  125 miles from the epicenter--how close--and it is significant that the  runways were not affected. So from that, the various American military                             units could work.   We want to give special credit to the 728th Air Mobility Squadron and  the 39th Operational Support Squadron who have worked so closely with  USAID to provide the massive amounts of aid for the 20 million people  who are in need.   So it is refreshing to see Republicans and Democrats working together  to see how important it is that the people of Turkiye understand as a  NATO member how important they are to the American people.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, again, it is so refreshing  to see colleagues of both political parties across the country from  South Carolina to Massachusetts to Pennsylvania. Actually, it is  reflective of the deep affection that the people of America have as we  appreciate, in particular, Turkiye, a NATO ally, that it is always to  be cherished because when you visit the Korean War Veterans Memorial  here on the mall in Washington, Mr. Speaker, you see the Allies who  stood together to oppose the Communist aggression of June 1950, and the  first country that is listed is Turkiye. It is an ever-present reminder  of our appreciation and then our recognition of Kemal Ataturk and his  success in creating a democracy in the Middle East.    Over and over again there is such a great affection, and the  significance of the Turkish-American community and the Syrian-American  community what they have meant as entrepreneurs across our country is  so positive.   Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I reserve the balance of  my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance  of my time to close.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the broad coalition of Members on both sides of  the aisle with the leadership of Congressman Bill Keating who have come  together to support this critical resolution.   I especially want to thank Speaker Kevin McCarthy and Leader Steve  Scalise for their accelerating the scheduling of this for today. It is  so important for the people of Turkiye and Syria to know of our  affection for them.   The people of the United States stand with the suffering people of  Turkiye and Syria who have been so impacted by this terrible natural  disaster.   Mr. Speaker, H. Res. 132 is an important statement of human  solidarity. It deserves our unanimous support, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas  and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
