 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous materials on H.R. 5.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Virginia?   There was no objection.   The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Allen). Pursuant to House Resolution 33  and rule XVIII, the Chair declares the House in the Committee of the  Whole House on the state of the Union for the consideration of the  bill, H.R. 5.   The Chair appoints the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Bost) to preside  over the Committee of the Whole.                                time  1350                        In the Committee of the Whole    Accordingly, the House resolved itself into the Committee of the  Whole House on the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill  (H.R. 5) to reform the process by which Federal agencies analyze and  formulate new regulations and guidance documents, to clarify the nature  of judicial review of agency interpretations, to ensure complete  analysis of potential impacts on small entities of rules, and for other  purposes, with Mr. Bost in the chair.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The CHAIR. Pursuant to the rule, the bill is considered read the  first time.   The gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Goodlatte) and the gentleman from  Michigan (Mr. Conyers) each will control 30 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Virginia.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Chairman, it is a new day in America. For 8 years, the Obama  administration has brought us one thing in response to the Nation's  need for recovery from hard times--failure.   Bold, innovative measures to unleash American freedom, opportunity,  and resourcefulness could have brought prosperity's return after the  Great Recession, just as under Ronald Reagan following his era's  recession.   But the Obama administration responded differently, with measure  after overreaching measure, through regulation, taxes, and spending. It  was consumed by the folly of trying to force transformation from the  American people through command and control from Washington. Everywhere  it went, it sought to choose the winners and losers.   When Washington tries to choose the winners and losers, we all lose.  And lose we have. We have a national debt of $20 trillion thanks to the  outgoing administration's blowout spending. We have an economy that for  8 years has failed to produce enough good, new, full-time jobs to  sustain growth and restore dignity to the unemployed. We  [[Page H324]]  have 92 million Americans outside the workforce, a level not seen since  the Carter years, and nearly $2 trillion of American wealth is  commandeered each year to be spent as Washington bureaucrats see fit,  through runaway regulation.   But it is a new day in America. An incoming administration promises a  new approach to make America great again. Central to that approach is  regulatory reform. The Obama administration abused regulation to force  its will on the American people. The assembling Trump administration  promises to wipe out abusive regulation, freeing Americans to innovate  and prosper once more. Today's legislation will give this new  administration the tools.   The heart of today's bill, the Regulatory Accountability Act, title  I, restores to the people the true right to be heard by Washington's  regulators. It commands Washington bureaucrats to listen to the facts  and ideas offered by the people and to follow them when they are better  than the bureaucracy's own. It calls on regulatory agencies to achieve  the benefits Congress has called on them through statutes to achieve.  But it gives the people full opportunities to offer fresh alternatives  for doing so and to vet with the agencies the facts and ideas that work  and those that don't.   After the public has fully contributed its say, agencies must choose  the lowest cost alternative proven to work, achieving the needed  benefits but rejecting unneeded costs. That leaves resources free to  generate the benefits, create the jobs, and yield the higher wages only  the private sector, through hard work and ingenuity, can achieve.   The other titles of the bill strongly buttress this reform.   Title II, the Separation of Powers Restoration Act, wipes out  judicial deference to agency interpretations of statutes and  regulations and restores to our system of checks and balances the rule  Justice Marshall declared in Marbury v. Madison that ``it is  emphatically the province and duty of the judicial department to say  what the law is''--not the bureaucracy. When title II is law, our  courts will no more be rubber stamps for runaway regulatory  interpretations that burst the bounds of what Congress truly intended  through statutes.   Title III, the Small Business Regulatory Flexibility Improvements  Act, provides teeth to existing law written to prompt regulatory  agencies to tailor flexibility for small businesses into their rules.  Small businesses have fewer resources to comply with Washington's  mandates. They need flexibility to survive. The terms of existing law  for too long have been ignored by Washington bureaucrats. Title III  assures the law will no longer be ignored, resulting in freedom and  flexibility for America's small businesses, which create the lion's  share of new jobs in this country and are pillars of communities across  this land.   Title IV prevents one of the most egregious of bureaucrats'  regulatory abuses: the promulgation of new rules that impose over a  billion dollars in annual compliance costs, which must then be complied  with even while meritorious litigation challenging their issuance  proceeds in court. Title IV, the REVIEW Act, eliminates this abuse,  forcing agencies to stay their billion-dollar rules administratively if  they are timely challenged in court.    And in titles V and VI of the bill, the ALERT Act and the Providing  Accountability Through Transparency Act, this legislation delivers  much-needed, greater transparency for the public about what new  regulations agencies are developing and proposing so they can better  prepare to comment on what is proposed, shape what is promulgated, and  comply with final rules.   With the help of these reforms, we can truly make America more  competitive again, put Americans back to work, and free America's  entrepreneurs to innovate and launch more exciting new products and  services again.   I thank my colleagues, Small Business Committee Chairman Chabot,  Subcommittee Chairman Marino, Representative Ratcliffe, and  Representative Luetkemeyer, who have joined me in contributing titles  to this legislation.   I urge all of my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve the  balance of my time.           House of Representatives, Committee on Oversight and             Government Reform,                                   Washington, DC, January 6, 2017.        Hon. Bob Goodlatte,      Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Chairman: I write concerning H.R. 5, the       Regulatory Accountability Act of 2017. As you know, the       Committee on the Judiciary received an original referral and       the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform a secondary       referral when the bill was introduced on January 3, 2017. I       recognize and appreciate your desire to bring this       legislation before the House of Representatives in an       expeditious manner, and accordingly, the Committee on       Oversight and Government Reform will forego action on the       bill.        The Committee takes this action with our mutual       understanding that by foregoing consideration of H.R. 5 at       this time, we do not waive any jurisdiction over the subject       matter contained in this or similar legislation. Further, I       request your support for the appointment of conferees from       the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform during any       House-Senate conference convened on this or related       legislation.        Finally, I would ask that a copy of our exchange of letters       on this matter be included in the Congressional Record during       floor consideration to memorialize our understanding.            Sincerely,                                                    Jason Chaffetz,      Chairman.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                      Committee on the Judiciary,                                    Washington, DC, January 6, 2017.      Hon. Jason Chaffetz,      Chairman, Committee on Oversight and Government Reform,           Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Chaffetz: Thank you for consulting with the       Committee on the Judiciary and agreeing to be discharged from       further consideration of H.R. 5, the ``Regulatory       Accountability Act,'' so that the bill may proceed       expeditiously to the House floor.        I agree that your foregoing further action on this measure       does not in any way diminish or alter the jurisdiction of       your committee or prejudice its jurisdictional prerogatives       on this bill or similar legislation in the future. I would       support your effort to seek appointment of an appropriate       number of conferees from your committee to any House-Senate       conference on this legislation.   I will seek to place our letters on H.R. 5 into the Congressional  Record during floor consideration of the bill. I appreciate your  cooperation regarding this legislation and look forward to continuing  to work together as this measure moves through the legislative process.            Sincerely,                                                      Bob Goodlatte      Chairman.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                     Committee on Small Business,                                    Washington, DC, January 6, 2017.      Hon. Bob Goodlatte,      Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, House of           Representatives.        Dear Chairman Goodlatte: I am writing to you regarding H.R.       5, the ``Regulatory Accountability Act of 2017.'' The       legislation falls within the jurisdiction of the Committee on       Small Business pursuant to Rule X, c1.1(q) of the Rules of       the House.        In the interest of permitting the Committee on the       Judiciary to proceed expeditiously to consideration of H.R. 5       on the House floor, I agree that the Committee on Small       Business be discharged from further consideration of the       bill. I do so with the understanding that by waiving       consideration of the bill, the Committee on Small Business       does not waive any future jurisdictional claim over the       subject matters contained in the bill which fall within its       Rule X jurisdiction. I request that you urge the Speaker to       name members of the Committee on Small Business to any House-      Senate conference that may be convened on this legislation.        Finally, I would appreciate your response to this letter       and would ask that a copy our exchange of letters be included       in the Congressional Record during consideration of the       measure on the House floor. Thank you for the cooperative       spirit in which you have worked regarding this issue and       others between our respective committees.            Sincerely,                                                      Steve Chabot,      Chairman.                                   ____                                    Congress of the United States,                                    Washington, DC, January 6, 2017.      Hon. Steve Chabot,      Chairman, Committee on Small Business.

Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Utah (Mr. Chaffetz) who is the chairman of the Oversight and Government  Reform Committee and a member of the Judiciary Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Utah (Mr. Chaffetz) who is the chairman of the Oversight and Government  Reform Committee and a member of the Judiciary Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  California (Mr. McCarthy) who is the distinguished majority leader of  the House.   Mr. McCARTHY. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I  thank the chairman for his work. I would also like to highlight a few  Members whose work is inside this bill. First, Congressman Marino,  Congressman Ratcliffe, Chairman Chabot, and Congressman Luetkemeyer  have all done a tremendous amount of work to make this bill here today,  and I appreciate that.    Mr. Chairman, we have a grave problem in our Federal Government. It  undermines our Constitution, it contradicts the will of the people, and  it is a deadweight on our economy destroying American jobs and costing  billions of dollars per year in paperwork and lost opportunities. I am  talking about the duplicative and unforgiving Federal bureaucratic  state.   But before I discuss the dangers that an overzealous bureaucracy  poses to our country, I want to be clear that the House has already  made great progress. We are engaged in a two-step approach: first, to  change the structure of Washington that deprives the people of their  power; and second, to repeal specific harmful regulations. We will get  started on the second part early next month.   We have already passed two bills last week to change Washington's  structure, the Midnight Rules Relief Act and the REINS Act. Today, we  will pass the third, the Regulatory Accountability Act. This requires  agencies to choose the least costly option available to do what they  are charged to do and prohibits large rules from going into effect  while they are still being challenged in court. It also ends something  called Chevron deference where courts automatically bend to the  agency's interpretation of the rules. Under the current standard, that  means the agency will win almost every single time in the courtroom and  the people lose.   These three bills are about more than stopping bad regulations from  being made. They are about changing the process in Washington that  systemically prioritizes government over the  [[Page H329]]  common good instead of making government serve the common good.   Mr. Chairman, our Nation is based on a principle that power  ultimately comes from the people. Elections are the great foundation of  our Republic, and, as we saw so clearly this last November, through  them, the people can make their voices heard. But something has  changed. Some of the most significant decisions in Washington, those  that most affect the lives of the public, are made by those who don't  stand for election.   What happens when the EPA imposes rules that deprive people of their  property rights, when the Department of Health and Human Services tries  to force nuns to violate their religion, or when the VA perpetuates a  system that lets veterans die while they wait for their care? The  people can't vote out bureaucrats who write rules at the EPA or the  Department of Health and Human Services. They can't vote out bad  leaders of the VA.   These bureaucrats know it. They know they aren't accountable to the  people even as they exercise great power. Without elections, the people  lose. Washington is brimming with executive employees devoted to  preserving the status quo.   Then there is a revolving door of high-level Federal employees who  head to major consulting firms and lobbying arms to influence the very  agencies they came from. This breeds thousands of regulations that  further enrich the connected and powerful--sometimes at the great  expense of the average American.                                time  1415    It is our economy and the American workers who suffer the most.  Federal regulations written and enacted by these bureaucracies impose a  burden of about $1.89 trillion every year. That number is hard to make  sense of or to even imagine. It comes to, roughly, $15,000 per U.S.  household, or 10 percent of the American GDP.   The Obama administration alone has written regulations that require  over 583 million hours to comply with. That is an average of nearly 5  hours of paperwork for every single full-time employee in America. The  Federal Register is now the length of 80 King James Bibles.   When bureaucrats and agency heads cannot be held accountable and when  they keep their jobs regardless of corruption, incompetence, waste,  fraud, abuse, or the backroom deals they make with special interests,  that is the problem. That is the swamp, and we need to drain it.   There is a reason the House is restructuring Washington first. It is  that we made a commitment to the American people that we would drain  the swamp. Now we are today.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Marino), the chairman of the Regulatory Reform,  Commercial and Antitrust Law Subcommittee and the chief sponsor of one  of the bills contained herein.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Ohio (Mr. Chabot), the chairman of the Small Business Committee, a  member of the Judiciary Committee, and the chief sponsor of one of the  bills contained herein.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Ratcliffe), a member of the Judiciary Committee and the  chief sponsor of two of the measures contained here.    Mr. Chairman, may I inquire how much time is remaining  on each side.   The Acting CHAIR (Mr. Donovan). The gentleman from Virginia has 9  minutes remaining, and the gentleman from Michigan has 15\1/2\ minutes  remaining.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Minnesota (Mr. Peterson), the ranking member of the House Agriculture  Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Missouri (Mr. Luetkemeyer), the chief sponsor of one of the bills  contained herein.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from Pennsylvania (Mr. Rothfus).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Kelly).    Mr. Chairman, at this time it is my pleasure to yield  1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. Knight).    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   The facts are plain, the conclusion is clear: the rampant tide of  unchecked, unbalanced Federal regulation is overwhelming job creators  and households all across this Nation. Thanks to Washington's endless  excess of regulations, hardworking Americans face higher prices, lower  wages, fewer jobs, and fewer new business starts; and America as a  whole is less competitive, less innovative, and less prosperous.   Federal regulations now impose an estimated burden of an amazing  $1.89 trillion per year. That burden is burying America's job creators  and suffocating job opportunities. It equals roughly $15,000 per U.S.  household, over 10 percent of America's GDP, and more than the GDP of  all but eight countries in the world.   The Obama administration set new records for numbers and effects of  major regulations, over 600 in total, with an average of 81 per year.  That is roughly one every 3 working days. Through just August 2016,  these rules had economic effects of over $740 billion and imposed 194  million paperwork burden-hours; and this only built upon the  insufficiently checked regulation already imposed by previous  administrations.   This problem must be solved, and this bill is the number one solution  to this problem. Its bold, innovative measures will unleash American  freedom, opportunity, and resourcefulness by dramatically reducing new  regulatory costs; and they will do that while still allowing agencies  to achieve the benefits that Congress' statutes have tasked them to  achieve.   Far fewer costs, all the benefits, who could be against that? We all  should be for it, just as the American people are.   Support the American people. Support the Regulatory Accountability  Act. I urge my colleagues to do so.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.   Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chair, I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 5,  the ``Regulatory Accountability Act of 2017,'' which is a radical  measure that could make it impossible to promulgate safety regulations  to protect the public.   I oppose this legislation because it would effectively shut down the  entire U.S. regulatory system, amending in one fell swoop every bedrock  existing regulatory statute.   My opposition to H.R. 5 is amplified by the Rules Committee's  decision to decline to make in order the Jackson Lee Amendment, ``to  provide an exception for regulations that help prevent cyberattacks on  election processes or institutions.''   Apparently, House Republicans are still reluctant to debate the  subject--undisputed by our Intelligence community--of Russian  cyberattacks on American cyber networks and infrastructure.   Key Judgments in the Intelligence Community Assessment's declassified  version of a highly classified report entitled, ``Assessing Russian  Activities and Intentions in Recent U.S. Elections,'' have confirmed  that 2016 witnessed the first American presidential election that was  the subject of cyberattacks.   These and other subversive activities have been confirmed to have  been perpetrated by entities allied with the Government of Russia and  were undertaken for the express purpose of influencing the presidential  contest to secure the election of its preferred candidate, Donald  Trump, who made history by becoming the first presidential candidate to  invite a hostile foreign power to launch cyberattacks against his  political opponent.   All three agencies, CIA, FBI and NSA, agree with this judgment.   The so-called Regulatory Accountability Act (RAA), in addition if to  this rule, demonstrates the deceptive design of the majority to make it  harder to establish regulations to protect the public by tilting the  entire regulatory system significantly toward special interests.   The bill allows Federal courts without expertise on technical issues  to substitute their judgment for those of the expert federal agencies.   These agencies are staffed with career subject matter experts that  are deeply knowledgeable of the background, context, and history of  agency actions and policy rationale.   For this reason, courts have long deferred to agency experts who are  in the best position to carry out the statutes.   The RAA would end this well-established practice and allow far less  experienced judges to second guess expert opinion--essentially  sanctioning judicial activism.   The Jackson Lee Amendment, however, would have attuned this dangerous  legislation to provide an exception for regulation upon which Americans  so greatly rely on their government to help prevent cyberattacks on our  highly coveted and esteemed election processes and institutions.   The bill promoted by the majority, calling for accountability from  our Administrative Agencies--fails to answer in accountability to the  threat posed by foreign and domestic invaders on our national cyber  networks.   As the new Congress commences in the People's House, obstructionist  Republicans are circumventing the very procedures by which elected  officials answer the cries of outrage and dismay of desperately  concerned constituents.   To the obstructionist majority perpetuating this restrictive rule,  let me stand firm in the American convictions laid bare by the Jackson  Lee Amendment--the system of Checks and Balances established by the  Separation of Powers clause of the Constitution will not be thwarted.   The spirit of the H.R. 5 is clearly designed to stop all regulation  dead in its tracks--no matter the threat to cyber networks, national  security, economy, or the very health and safety of the American  people.   We know that Russia's cyber activities were intended to influence the  election, erode faith in U.S. democratic institutions, sow doubt about  the integrity of our electoral process, and undermine confidence in the  institutions of the U.S. government. These actions are unacceptable and  will not be tolerated.   The mission of the Intelligence Community is to seek to reduce the  uncertainty surrounding foreign activities, capabilities, or leaders'  intentions.   On these issues of great importance to U.S. national security, the  goal of intelligence analysis is to provide assessments to decision  makers that are intellectually rigorous, objective, timely, and useful,  and that adhere to tradecraft standards.   Applying these standards helps ensure that the Intelligence Community  provides U.S. policymakers, warfighters, and operators with the best  and most accurate insight, warning, and context, as well as potential  opportunities to advance U.S. national security.   This objective is difficult to achieve when seeking to understand  complex issues on which foreign actors go to extraordinary lengths to  hide or obfuscate their activities.   My amendment would have improved H.R. 5 by exempting only those  regulations critical to making cyber networks invulnerable to attack  from foreign and domestic agencies and individuals.   Specifically, the amendment that the Rules Committee disallowed for  presentation on a vote here on the floor today would have provided the  American people an exemption to allow for the prevention of tampering,  alteration, or misappropriation of information by agents of foreign  countries with the purpose or effect of interfering with or undermining  election processes or institutions.  [[Page H335]]    In particular, restrictions put forth in H.R. 5 could result in  further delay to agencies attempting to take action to help network  defenders better identify new tactics or techniques that a malicious  actor might deploy or detect and disrupt an ongoing intrusion, in  addition to protecting data that enables cybersecurity firms and other  network defenders to identify certain malware that the Russian  intelligence services use.   The Regulatory Accountability Act provides no accountability to the  American public.   Instead, it allows polluting industries and special interests to game  the system and escape accountability for any harm they inflict.   It makes it incredibly difficult, if not impossible, to secure new  public protections and arms industry with numerous tools to avoid their  legal obligations.   The increasing use of cyber-enabled means to undermine democratic  processes at home and abroad, as exemplified by Russia's recent  activities, has made clear that a tool explicitly targeting attempts to  interfere with elections is also warranted.   We cannot afford to let global terroristic threats, in the form of  cyber activities, erode faith in U.S. democratic institutions, sow  doubt about the integrity of our electoral process, influence  elections, or undermine confidence in the institutions of the U.S.  government.   My amendment would have offered protections guarding the integrity of  our cyber networks, while at the same time allowing the bill to achieve  the proponents' major purposes.   For these reasons and more, I oppose this bill.   The Acting CHAIR. All time for general debate has expired.

Amendment No. 1 Offered by Mr. Goodlatte    The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 1  printed in part A of House Report 115-2.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         Page 39, line 3, insert after ``made by agencies.'' the       following: ``If the reviewing court determines that a       statutory or regulatory provision relevant to its decision       contains a gap or ambiguity, the court shall not interpret       that gap or ambiguity as an implicit delegation to the agency       of legislative rule making authority and shall not rely on       such gap or ambiguity as a justification either for       interpreting agency authority expansively or for deferring to       the agency's interpretation on the question of law.''.    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 33, the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. Goodlatte) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Virginia.    Mr. Chairman, if Congress is effectively to rein in  the runaway administrative state, a crucial part of the plan must be to  overturn, legislatively, the doctrines of judicial deference to  agencies' interpretations of the statutes and regulations they  administer. These doctrines, founded in the Supreme Court's decision in  Chevron v. NRDC and Auer v. Robbins, have, over the years, turned the  courts far too much into a rubberstamp rather than a vigorous check on  the self-serving tendencies of agencies to interpret the law to expand  their own power.   Title II of the bill, the Separation of Powers Act, delivers this  legislative reversal of Chevron and Auer. There is one thing, though,  that still needs to be added to that portion of the bill; that is  language to check the potential that once they are restored--the full  interpretive powers that rightfully belong to them--our Article III  courts will not engage in judicial activism.   To put a point on it, judges must not be allowed to use the  Separation of Powers Act as a license to interpret ambiguous statutes  always to expand agency power. My amendment, therefore, succinctly but  powerfully provides just that. It prohibits courts from reading  ambiguities in statutes to contain implicit delegation of legislative  rulemaking authority to agencies or from reading those ambiguities  expansively to extend agency power.   Although it failed in its task, the Chevron doctrine was originally  crafted to help check that kind of judicial activism. As we end the  failed Chevron experiment, we should make sure we do not go back to  judicial activism. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I include in the record a list of  organizations supporting H.R. 5.   I urge my colleagues to support this important amendment.

To All Members of the U.S. House of Representatives: On       behalf of the Agricultural Retailers Association (ABA), I am       writing to urge a vote in support of H.R. 5, the ``Regulatory       Accountability Act'' sponsored by Representative Bob       Goodlatte (R-VA). This legislation includes a number of       important provisions designed to reform the Federal       rulemaking process.        All stakeholders have a right to fair, open, and       transparent rulemaking that respects the proper role of the       states and the intent of Congress. For decades, there have       been Executive Orders issued from both Republican and       Democrat Administrations highlighting the importance of an       open, transparent, and fair regulatory process. H.R. 5 is an       important step forward in codifying the principles that       Presidents of both parties have issued in Executive Order       12004 (Issued in Match 1978), Executive Order 12291 (Issued       in February 1981), Executive Order 12866 (Issued in September       1993), Executive Order 13132 (Issued in August 1999), and       Executive Order 13563 (Issued in January 2011).        Some of the reforms in H.R. 5 include provisions such as       requiring federal agencies to use less costly regulations,       rather than more costly proposals, to obtain a stated       objective; requiring federal agencies to explain how their       proposed regulations would impact small business owners,       their employees, and customers; prohibiting any new rules       with a significant economic impact from taking effect until       litigation against such proposal has been fully settled       without impacting existing regulations; and requiring Federal       agencies to publish mandatory transparency reports.        Rep. Collin Peterson (D-MN) plans to offer an amendment on       the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives to prohibit       agencies from using social media to sway public opinion in       favor of a pending agency proposal. This common-sense       amendment is necessary to prevent actions taken by federal       agencies such as the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency       (EPA) that the General Accountability Office (GAO) found took       unlawful actions during its `Waters of the United States''       (WOTUS) proposed rulemaking. ARA urges all House members to       vote in favor of the Peterson amendment and to vote ``Yes''       on final passage of H.R, 5.            Sincerely,                                              Richard D. Gupton,                                              Senior Vice President,      Public Policy & Counsel.                                   ____                                  American Farm Bureau Federation,                                    Washington, DC, January 9, 2017.      House of Representatives,       Washington, DC.        Dear Rep.: The House of Representatives will soon take up       H.R. 5 for debate and a vote. This measure contains a number       of important elements that are designed to improve the       Federal rulemaking process. American Farm Bureau urges all       members to vote in favor of this legislation.        For decades, presidents of both parties have issued       Executive Orders and Memoranda underscoring the importance of       a regulatory process that is open, transparent and fair:        President Carter stipulated in EO 12044 that regulations       should not impose unnecessary burdens on the economy.        President Reagan issued EO 12291 in February 1981 to assure       that least-cost alternatives would be used in regulatory       decision-making.        President Clinton affirmed that regulations should maximize       net benefits (EO 12866, September 1993). Later in his       Administration, President Clinton issued EO 13132 reaffirming       the importance of federalism and respecting the rights of       states.        President Obama underscored the importance of sound science       in his Memorandum of March 2009. He also reaffirmed President       Clinton's EO 12866 when he issued EO 13563.        We understand that an amendment to H.R. 5 will be offered       on the floor by Rep. Peterson to prohibit agencies from using       social media to sway public opinion in favor of a pending       agency proposal. This amendment stems directly from EPA's       conduct in its `waters of the US' (WOTUS) rulemaking, conduct       found unlawful by the General Accountability Office and       scrupulously detailed in a report released by the House       Committee on Oversight and Government Reform,       ``Politicization of the Waters of the United States       Rulemaking.'' We strongly support the Peterson amendment and       urge all members to vote in favor of its adoption.        All stakeholders--farmers, ranchers, environmentalists,       academics, agency staff, and the general public--have a right       to a rulemaking process that is fair, open, transparent,       respectful of the role of states in our Federal system, and       faithful to the intent of Congress. H.R. 5 is an important       step in codifying principles that Presidents of both parties       have enunciated for decades. This legislation deserves       strong, bipartisan support.        We urge all members to vote in favor of the Peterson       amendment and to vote ``Yes'' on final passage of H.R. 5.            Sincerely,                                                      Zippy Duvall,      President.                                   ____                        Associated Builders and Contractors, Inc.,                                    Washington, DC, January 5, 2017.      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative: On behalf of Associated Builders and       Contractors (ABC), a national construction industry trade       association with 70 chapters representing nearly 21,000       members, I am writing in support of the Regulatory       Accountability Act of 2017 (H.R. 5) introduced by Rep. Bob       Goodlatte (R-VA). ABC supports this legislation, which would       reform the Administrative Procedures Act and strengthen       existing checks on federal agencies, allowing for more cost-      effective regulations through a more transparent process.        As builders of our communities and infrastructure, ABC       members understand the value of standards and regulations       based on solid evidence, with appropriate consideration paid       to implementation costs and input from affected businesses.       ABC strongly supports comprehensive regulatory reform which       includes across-the-board requirements for departments and       agencies to appropriately evaluate risks, weigh costs, and       assess benefits of all regulations. H.R. 5 is an excellent       step in regulatory reform as it ensures more accountability       from federal agencies and greater stakeholder transparency.        Today, federal regulatory agencies wield incredible power       through rulemaking. They have grown adept at using procedural       loopholes in order to accomplish narrowly-focused goals.       These agencies operate relatively unchecked and unsupervised,       especially during the early stages of the regulatory process.       They often disregard and circumvent the will of Congress and       the American public by issuing regulations with poor or       incomplete economic cost-benefit forecasting or other data       analysis, instead of using the best and most accurate data       that could have created more practical, sustainable rules and       regulations.        Consequently, some regulations that have limited or       questionable benefit result in crippling costs for companies       and often no serious consideration is given for more       practical alternatives. For the construction industry, these       regulations routinely translate into higher costs and are       passed along to the consumer.        Ultimately, these costs impact our industry's ability to       expand and hire more workers. It is particularly alarming       that small businesses, which comprise the vast majority of       the industry, are disproportionately affected by this       irresponsible approach to regulation.        Thank you for your attention on this important matter and       we urge the House to pass the Regulatory Accountability Act       of 2017.            Sincerely,                                             Kristen Swearingen,                                       Vice President of Legislative      & Political Affairs.                                   ____                                              The Associated General                                          Contractors of America,                                    Arlington, VA, January 10, 2017.      Re Vote ``YES'' on the Regulatory Accountability Act of 2017,           H.R. 5.       Hon. Paul Ryan,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative Ryan: On behalf of the Associated       General Contractors of America (AGC) and its more than 26,000       commercial construction company members, I strongly urge you       to vote ``YES'' on the Regulatory Accountability Act of 2017,       H.R. 5. This legislation is critical to helping ensure that       regulations undergo thorough economic analysis, are based in       sound science and/or substantial empirical data, and are       transparent with clear and feasible methods and goals.        The current regulatory process allows federal agencies to       promulgate rules based on unconvincing, scant and--      sometimes--just plain wrong evidence. For example, Professor       David L. Sunding, Ph.D., Thomas J. Graff Chair of Natural       Resource Economics at the University of California, Berkeley       found that the ``errors, omissions, and lack of       transparency'' in the Environmental Protection Agency's       economic analysis underlying its Waters of the Unites States       (WOTUS) rule to be ``so severe as to render it virtually       meaningless.'' Yet, the EPA was able to finalize that rule       based on such flawed analysis.        Federal agencies also write rules that are not feasible for       the construction industry to follow. The Occupational Health       and Safety Administration (OSHA) crystalline silica rule, for       instance, put forth a permissible silica exposure limit that       is beyond the capacity of existing dust filtration and       removal technology. Despite this fact, OSHA finalized this       rule and the construction industry is left liable to       implement.        The Regulatory Accountability Act will help hold federal       agencies accountable to the facts throughout the rulemaking       process. Under this legislation, the public could challenge       the underlying evidence agencies put forth to justify their       rules. Such challenges could occur through hearings before       the agency and before courts, which generally defer to any       evidence put forth by federal agencies currently. As a       result, agencies would be incentivized to undertake more       rigorous and realistic analyses, rather than risk delays as a       result of relying on cherry-picked studies or self-serving,       internal data.        The purpose of the bill is not partisan. Rather, it is to       ensure that the regulations federal agencies put forth are       feasible and based in thorough economic analysis and sound       science. To do so, H.R. 5 allows for greater transparency,       more public participation and needed objectivity in the       rulemaking process. As such, AGC again urges you to for in       favor of H.R. 5.  [[Page H346]]         Thank you for your consideration.            Sincerely,                                                  Jeffrey D. Shoaf,      Senior Executive Director, Government Affairs.                                   ____                                              Business Roundtable,                                                    January 6, 2017.      Re Support for H.R. 5--The Regulatory Accountability Act of           2017.       Hon. Paul Ryan,      Speaker, House of Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Minority Leader, House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Ryan and Leader Pelosi: On behalf of the CEO       members of Business Roundtable, who lead major U.S. companies       with more than $6 trillion in annual revenues and nearly 15       million employees, I am pleased to express our strong support       for H.R. 5, the Regulatory Accountability Act of 2017,       introduced by Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte.        Business Roundtable CEOs have consistently identified       overly complex and burdensome federal regulations as harmful       to accelerating job creation, job retention and increased       economic opportunity for American workers and their families.       We support a smarter approach to federal regulation that       would engage regulated parties earlier in the process,       improve the quality of information used to make regulatory       decisions and consistently apply rigorous cost-benefit       analysis to major regulatory proposals.        We are particularly pleased that H.R. 5 includes the       previously introduced version of the Regulatory       Accountability Act, also championed by Chairman Goodlatte,       the ALERT Act, championed by Representative John Ratcliffe,       and the Providing Accountability Through Transparency Act,       championed by Representative Blaine Luetkemeyer.        Overall, the smart regulatory improvements embodied in the       Regulatory Accountability Act of 2017 will:        Make U.S. companies more competitive. Usually after       prolonged periods of consideration, federal agencies       regularly issue rules that impose large and often unnecessary       burdens on U.S. businesses--burdens that foreign competitors       may not have to bear. The Act will reduce these burdens.        Enable U.S. companies to be more innovative. American       businesses are the world's most innovative, and that       innovation supports America's high standard of living. Rules       that require particular technologies or approaches or fail to       keep up with technological evolution can jeopardize future       innovation. The Act will encourage flexible, non-prescriptive       implementation that preserves the capacity to innovate.        Stimulate investment by enhancing business certainty. If       companies are unsure about what regulators will require or       how to comply with rules, they will be reluctant to commit       capital to new or expanded productive investments. By       encouraging early engagement with regulated parties and       improving the transparency and accountability of the       regulatory process, the Act will result in greater certainty       for U.S. businesses and thereby accelerate job growth and       investment.        The Regulatory Accountability Act of 2017 would make the       U.S. regulatory system more transparent, accountable and       effective. We endorse this legislation and pledge our full       support to see it enacted into law.            Sincerely,                                                     Mark J. Costa,            Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Eastman Chemical                                                             Company      Chair, Smart Regulation Committee, Business Roundtable.                                   ____                                                National Association                                                     of Realtors,                                    Washington, DC, January 9, 2017.      Hon. Paul Ryan,      Speaker, House of Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Democratic Leader, House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Ryan and Democratic Leader Pelosi: On behalf       of the 1.1 million members of the National Association of       REALTORS (NAR), I urge the House to approve H.R. 5       (Goodlatte, R-VA; Peterson, D-MN), the ``Regulatory       Accountability Act''.        NAR believes that federal regulations should be narrowly       tailored, supported by strong data and evidence, and impose       the least costs possible on regulated stakeholders.        The Regulatory Accountability Act embodies these principles       and will contribute to a more transparent and accountable       regulatory process by:        Increasing public participation in shaping the most-costly       regulations at an earlier point in the rulemaking process;        Instructing agencies to choose the least costly option that       achieves congressional intent unless they can show a costlier       option is needed to protect health, safety, or welfare;        Requiring public hearings for the most-costly regulations;        Improving the process for evaluating how small businesses       are impacted by regulations; and        Providing for a more rigorous test in legal challenges for       those regulations that would have the most impact.        The Regulatory Accountability Act builds on established       principles of a fair regulatory process and would make the       regulatory process more transparent, agencies more       accountable for their decisions, and regulations better-      tailored to achieve their purpose without unnecessary burdens       on stakeholders.        The Regulatory Accountability Act would allow Congress and       the public to reassert control over the federal regulatory       bureaucracy. Therefore, NAR strongly supports the Act, and       urges passage of the bill when it comes to the House floor       for a vote.            Sincerely,                                                  William E. Brown,      2017 President.                                   ____                                              National Federation of                                            Independent Business,                                   Washington, DC, January 11, 2017.      Hon. Steve Chabot,      Chairman, House Committee on Small Business,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Chabot, on behalf of the National Federation       of Independent Business (NFIB), the nation's leading small       business advocacy organization, I am writing in support of       H.R. 33, the Small Business Regulatory Flexibility       Improvements Act of 2017. This legislation puts into place       strong protections to ensure that federal agencies fully       consider the impact of proposed regulations on small       businesses.        In an economy where two-thirds of all net new jobs come       from the small business sector, we appreciate that this       legislation would require regulators to analyze further the       impact of certain proposals on job creation. As you well       know, the annual cost of federal regulation per employee is       significantly higher for smaller firms than larger firms.       Federal regulations--not to mention state and local       regulations--add up and significantly increase the cost of       starting and running a small business.        H.R. 33 expands the scope of the Regulatory Flexibility Act       (RFA) by forcing government regulators to include the       indirect impact of their regulations in their assessments of       a regulation's impact on small businesses. The bill also       provides small business with expanded judicial review       protections, which helps ensure that small businesses have       their views heard during the federal rulemaking process, not       after.        The legislation strengthens several other aspects of the       RFA--such as expanding the small business advocacy review       panel process to all agencies. Currently, the panels only       apply to the Environmental Protection Agency, the       Occupational Safety and Health Administration, and the       Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. These panels have       proven to be an extremely effective mechanism in helping       agencies to understand how their rules will affect small       businesses, and help agencies identify less costly       alternatives to regulations before proposing new rules.        Finally, H.R. 33 expands the standard for periodic review       of rules by federal agencies and gives the U.S. Small       Business Administration's Office of Advocacy increased input       into agency compliance with the RFA. These important       protections are needed to prevent duplicative and outdated       regulatory burdens as well as to address penalty structures       that are too high for the small business sector.        NFIB supports H.R. 33 because it strengthens the       requirement for federal agencies to consider both the direct       and indirect economic impact of proposed regulations on small       businesses. We look forward to working with the committee       towards enactment of the Small Business Regulatory       Flexibility Improvements Act of 2017.            Sincerely,                                                 Juanita D. Duggan,      President and CEO NFIB.                                   ____                                          Chamber of Commerce of the                                        United States of America,                                    Washington, DC, January 6, 2017.        To the Members of the U.S. House of Representatives: The       U.S. Chamber of Commerce strongly supports H.R. 5, which       includes the Regulatory Accountability Act, and may consider       including votes on, or in relation to, H.R. 5 in our annual       How They Voted scorecard.        The Chamber commends the House for acting on regulatory       reform legislation so early in the 115th session, and for       bringing H.R. 5, which also includes important provisions       related to small businesses, to the floor.        The Regulatory Accountability Act is a long-standing       priority for the Chamber and would update the Administrative       Procedure Act (APA) to improve how federal agencies       promulgate those rules with the most significant impact on       jobs and economic growth.        Modernization of APA is long overdue. While there has been       a dramatic increase in high impact, transformative rules that       are slowing economic growth and inhibiting job creation, APA       rulemaking provisions have remained virtually unchanged since       1946 when the law was established.        H.R. 5 would target only the most expensive and burdensome       of these rules for increased scrutiny by providing greater       transparency, by holding agencies accountable, and by making       sure the data behind the decisions of regulators are made       publicly available.        The Chamber urges you to support this legislation and to       oppose any weakening amendment when it is considered likely       next week.            Sincerely,                                                    Jack Howard,                                              Senior Vice President,                                   Congressional and Public Affair.     Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.  [[Page H347]]    The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Goodlatte).   The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes  appeared to have it.    Mr. Chairman, I just want to say that title I of the  bill contains several key requirements for the Office of Information  and Regulatory Affairs, OIRA, to put out high-quality, governmentwide  guidelines that all agencies can follow. These include, for example,  guidelines on cost-benefit analysis, risk assessment, consistency with  the Information Quality Act, and good guidance practices.   Since the importance of these issues and the need for swift and  effective implementation of reform, the amendment's institution of a  270-day deadline for the issuance of these guidelines is very  reasonable, very constructive. I urge my colleagues to support this  amendment.    I thank the gentleman for his amendment. Title III of  the bill contains important reforms to make sure agencies finally take  seriously Congress' directive to write rules with flexible  accommodations for small businesses, the source of most of our Nation's  job creation.   Congress' demands for flexibility began with the Regulatory  Accountability Act during the 1980s, but agencies have never fully  complied. One of the key ways agencies have skirted the law's  requirements has been to certify their way out of any need to actually  provide flexibility by finding that a proposed or final rule will not  have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities.   This amendment puts the brakes on an inadequately substantiated  certification by requiring certifications to include economic  assessment details sufficient to support the certifications. I support  the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and  I support his amendment.   Title I of the bill contains critical reforms to the rulemaking  process first introduced in the 112th Congress. In one sentence, one  could say that these reforms have one ultimate goal--to assure a fair  rulemaking process that achieves the benefits Congress seeks and keeps  unnecessary costs to a minimum.   The gentleman's amendment, of which I am a cosponsor, responds to an  extreme example of rulemaking abuse that played out during the 114th  Congress. That abuse was the Environmental Protection Agency's advocacy  campaign to skew the information submitted for its administrative  record and promote lobbying on behalf of its massive proposed waters of  the United States rule.   It is one thing to propose a rule and open the agency's doors  impartially to information from all members of the public. It is quite  another to promote public submissions to guarantee the cooking of the  administrative record to support the agency's view and to advocate  lobbying of Congress to support that view.   This amendment makes sure that the biased agency activity manifest in  the waters of the United States rulemaking never happens again.   Mr. Chairman, I support the amendment.    I thank the gentleman from Louisiana, and I support  his amendment.   Mr. Chairman, many of the reforms in title I of the bill focus on  assuring better decisionmaking and cost control for major rules-- typically, those that impose more than $100 million or more per year in  costs.   One of these reforms is the commonsense requirement that an agency,  when it publishes a major rule, include a plan for reviewing how the  rule is working within 10 years. A focus of that review is to determine  whether it is possible, after the rule has been put into practice, to  find new ways to lower the rule's costs.    The gentleman's amendment speeds this process up, requiring review  within 5 years, and increases Congress' oversight, requiring reports by  agencies to Congress on their reviews. Most importantly, the amendment  requires that, if an agency's report to Congress shows the rule's costs  in practice are higher than anticipated at promulgation, the agency  must institute a notice-and-comment process aimed at identifying  revisions that can lower costs.   This is a measure that can only strengthen the bill's effectiveness  and help lower unnecessary burdens on the American people. I support  the amendment.    Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman for the time.   I support his amendment. Agency guidance is a crucial part of our  regulatory system--flexible because not legally binding, but needed so  regulated entities can understand how best to comply with agency rules.   Guidance, if it responds in a timely way to the regulated community's  need for it, helps everything to function smoothly. But one thing that  does not help is agency heel-dragging in the issuance of guidance as  the regulated community comes up against legal or practical deadlines  by which it needs to implement compliance measures. Too often agencies  hurry up and wait to produce needed guidance, then tell those who  waited long and hard for it to hurry up and respond, pronto. That can  leave very little time for the regulated community to act before  deadlines hit.  [[Page H355]]    To solve this problem, the amendment offers a simple but much-needed  solution. It requires that, within ``good-guidance'' guidelines to be  issued by the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs under the  bill, there be guidelines for agencies generally to assure at least 90  days for regulated entities to institute measures consistent with newly  issued guidelines.   I support the amendment.    Mr. Chair, I was unavoidably detained. Had I been  present, I would have voted ``nay'' on rollcall No. 37.
