 Mr. Speaker, in February 1994, Caliph Barrett III,  Elliott Martin, and Brian McCullough lost their lives to senseless gun  violence in Fort Worth, Texas, in the Lake Como community. The people  back then said that that was the saddest day in Como history.   A crazed individual with a gun who should have never had one caused  other acts of violence throughout the city during this time.   Now, almost 30 years later, people are saying that what happened on  the evening of July 3, 2023, is perhaps the saddest day in Como  history. Over the Fourth of July holiday in Fort Worth, two separate  acts of gun violence, the one in Como that I just mentioned and one in  Polytechnic Heights, two of the most loved-filled and caring  communities in Fort Worth, had to deal with these tragedies.   In Como, Cynthia Santos, Paul Willis, and Gabriella Navarrete were  the names of the three young people who were murdered when people got  together at Como Fest the day before the big Fourth of July celebration  to barbecue, celebrate independence, celebrate freedom, and just have a  good time, but, instead, they lost their lives to senseless gun  violence.   I join with the Como and Polytechnic communities in mourning those  who were lost and injured over the Fourth of July weekend.   These shootings especially hurt because Como is the community that I  grew up in. That is where my mom and all of her siblings went when the  schools were segregated, Como High School, the Como Lions. That is the  neighborhood that a lot of my family still lives in.   We need to get together, Mr. Speaker. We need to do something.   I don't know much about the two gunmen who were arrested the other  day for what happened on July 3 in Como, but I bet you, Mr. Speaker,  they are just as bad as the person who was responsible for so many of  those murders during that 1994 era. I guarantee that people like that  should never ever get their hands on any firearm.   It is our duty as Members of the United States House of  Representatives, both Republicans and Democrats, to protect us from  people who are deranged criminals, people who are dealing with mental  illness issues that most of us should be blessed we don't have, and  people who are extremely violent and terroristic in nature.   It should be easy to pass bills like background checks and raising  the age limits for AR-15s to make sure that people like the ones I just  described don't ever get their hands on a firearm in their lives. That  should be easy.   It doesn't have anything to do with people who are law-abiding  citizens. I am talking about people who are sick and people who have  caused destruction and misery in communities, in families, and in  people's lives.   We have to do better as Democrats and Republicans.   I have introduced a resolution condemning these tragedies, but we  need action now. We can't wait any longer. I don't want 5, 10, 15, 20,  or 30 years later for people to say that this is the saddest day in  Como history again because we sat on our hands, didn't do anything, and  pretended that people's Second Amendment rights were being abridged  when all we are trying to do is stop really awful, terrible, and bad  people like I just talked about from ever owning a firearm.                            ____________________
