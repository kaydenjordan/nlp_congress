 Madam Speaker, I rise today in response to  President Biden's State of the Union address.   While I appreciated that Biden emphasized the importance of  continuing to support Ukraine, overall, his speech was a lot of talk  without tangible plans  [[Page H1258]]  to solve the numerous issues that are devastating the Nation.   The President's speech didn't address the root causes of inflation, a  crisis that is crushing many American families.   I found it ironic that Biden talked about securing the border when,  throughout his entire time in office, he has actively ignored the  unprecedented number of illegal crossings, which are due to his open  border policies currently in place.   Finally, I am incredibly disappointed that he made no plan to restore  American energy independence. We can produce affordable, reliable, and  sustainable energy right here at home in States like my home State of  Oklahoma.   Frankly, his address focused a lot on rehashing and disguising Build  Back Better while lacking concrete solutions to the pressing issues  negatively impacting the lives of American people.                            ____________________
