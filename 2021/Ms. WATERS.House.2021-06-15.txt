 Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 3642) to award a Congressional gold medal to the 369th  Infantry Regiment, commonly known as the ``Harlem Hellfighters'', in  recognition of their bravery and outstanding service during World War  I, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 3642         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Harlem Hellfighters       Congressional Gold Medal Act''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress finds the following:        (1) When the United States officially entered World War I       in April 1917, the Armed Forces were still segregated, even       though African-American soldiers had served and distinguished       themselves in every war since the Revolutionary War, and even       the Colonial Wars preceding the American Revolution.        (2) After several years of advocacy and debate, in 1916 the       State of New York authorized the recruitment of the 15th New       York National Guard Regiment, which was called to Federal       service on July 25, 1917, soon after arriving for training at       Camp Whitman, New York.        (3) The 15th completed its basic military practice training       at Camp Whitman, New York.        (4) To receive combat training, the 15th reported, on       October 8, 1917, to Camp Wadsworth, in Spartanburg, South       Carolina, where it experienced many incidents of racial       discrimination.        (5) Consequently, the government agreed to remove the 15th       from Camp Wadsworth, but, instead of receiving further       training, the regiment began preparing for deployment to       France in November.        (6) The 15th arrived in Saint Nazaire, France, on January       1, 1918, where it was redesignated the 369th Infantry       Regiment        (7) Partly because many White soldiers within the American       Expeditionary Forces (hereinafter, the ``AEF'') refused to       perform combat duty with Black soldiers, members of the 369th       were initially assigned manual labor tasks, such as loading       and unloading supplies, and constructing roads and railroads.        (8) After receiving pressure from the 369th regimental       commander about not having a combat mission, the AEF attached       the 369th to the French Fourth Army.        (9) By mid-March of 1918, the 369th went to the Argonne       Forest with the French 16th Division for training and soon       entered the trenches.        (10) The 369th encountered its first German soldiers in       combat in April, 1918.        (11) In May of 1918, Private Henry Johnson of the 369th       received the French Croix de Guerre, with Palm, for       extraordinary valor, becoming one of the first American       soldiers to be awarded this honor.        (12) Johnson also belatedly received a Purple Heart, was       awarded the Distinguished Service Cross, and in, 2015, was       awarded the Medal of Honor.        (13) Throughout the remainder of the spring and into the       summer the 369th served at Minacourt, in the Champagne-Marne       Defensive, and during the Aisne-Marne Offensive in support of       the French 161st Infantry Division.        (14) As summer turned to autumn, the 369th went on to       participate in the Meuse-Argonne offensive, where it captured       the important village of Sechault despite sustaining severe       losses.        (15) On October 14, 1918, the 369th advanced to Alsace.        (16) On November 20, 1918, the 369th reached the banks of       the Rhine River as part of the French Army of Occupation, the       first Allied unit to do so.        (17) The 369th was relieved of its assignment with the       French 161st Division in December, 1918, and elements of the       regiment sailed for New York in late January and early       February, 1919.        (18) The 369th Infantry Regiment received a parade up 5th       Avenue in New York City on February 17, 1919, receiving       applause and cheers from hundreds of thousands of onlookers.        (19) The 369th was demobilized on February 28, 1919.        (20) Over 170 individual members of the 369th received the       Croix de Guerre, many were awarded the Distinguished Service       Cross, and the 369th was awarded a unit citation.        (21) It is generally believed that the 369th was dubbed the       ``Harlem Hellfighters'' by German soldiers, who found the men       to be incredibly determined and courageous in battle.        (22) The 369th was the first regiment of African Americans       to deploy overseas during World War I and spent 191 days on       the front line in World War I, more than any other American       regimental sized unit.        (23) The 369th never lost a foot of ground nor had a man       taken prisoner, despite suffering a high number of       casualties.       SEC. 3. CONGRESSIONAL GOLD MEDAL.         (a) Award Authorized.--The Speaker of the House of       Representatives and the President pro tempore of the Senate       shall make appropriate arrangements for the award, on behalf       of the Congress, of a gold medal of appropriate design to the       369th Infantry Regiment, commonly known as the ``Harlem       Hellfighters'', in recognition of their bravery and       outstanding service during World War I.        (b) Design and Striking.--For the purposes of the award       referred to in subsection (a), the Secretary of the Treasury       shall strike the gold medal with suitable emblems, devices,       and inscriptions, to be determined by the Secretary.        (c) Smithsonian Institution.--        (1) In general.--Following the award of the gold medal in       honor of the 369th Infantry Regiment, the ``Harlem       Hellfighters'', the gold medal shall be given to the       Smithsonian Institution, where it will be displayed as       appropriate and made available for research.        (2) Sense of congress.--It is the sense of Congress that       the Smithsonian Institution should make the gold medal       awarded pursuant to this Act available for display elsewhere,       particularly at other locations associated with the Harlem       Hellfighters.       SEC. 4. DUPLICATE MEDALS.         (a) In General.--The Secretary may strike and sell       duplicates in bronze of the gold medal struck under section       3, at a price sufficient to cover the costs of the bronze       medals, including labor, materials, dies, use of machinery,       and overhead expenses.        (b) Proceeds of Sales.--The amounts received from the sale       of duplicate medals under subsection (a) shall be deposited       in the United States Mint Public Enterprise Fund.        (c) Authority to Use Fund Amounts.--There is authorized to       be charged against the United States Mint Public Enterprise       Fund such amounts as may be necessary to pay for the costs of       the medals struck under this Act.       SEC. 5. STATUS OF MEDALS.         The gold medal struck pursuant to this Act is a national       medal for purposes of chapter 51 of title 31, United States       Code.       SEC. 6. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS.          The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their  remarks on this legislation and to insert extraneous material thereon.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, the soldiers of the 369th Infantry Regiment were known  to both their enemies and allies alike for their fierceness in battle  and dedication to their country. They were called the Black Rattlers,  the Men of Bronze, and Hollenkampfer, but they were best known as the  Harlem Hellfighters.   The Harlem Hellfighters were one of the first African-American  regiments  [[Page H2783]]  to serve with the American Expeditionary Forces in World War I. Over  the course of the war, the Harlem Hellfighters spent more time than any  other American unit in the frontline trenches and suffered 1,500  casualties--the most losses of any American unit.   In addition to facing the dangers of frontline trench warfare, the  men of the Harlem Hellfighters endured racist, derogatory attacks from  their White compatriots, many of whom refused to perform combat duty  with African-American soldiers. This resulted in the Harlem  Hellfighters being transferred to a French Army where, despite racist  warnings from American Expeditionary Forces headquarters of the alleged  inferior nature of African-American troops, the Harlem Hellfighters  were treated as welcome reinforcements and equals.   Despite the racism and derogatory attacks from their fellow  countrymen, the Harlem Hellfighters were steadfast in their devotion to  their country. Some members considered their service to be a way to  prove they deserved respect from their White compatriots. Even German  propaganda targeting the Harlem Hellfighters highlighting the racism of  a segregated U.S. military failed to diminish their resolve.   Yet, despite their considerable sacrifices and being awarded the  Croix de Guerre by the French Army for their efforts, the Harlem  Hellfighters continued to face considerable racism when they returned  home after World War I. Their bravery and accomplishments were  similarly ignored by the broader American public. But their legacy and  memory has been kept alive in their hometown. The annual Harlem  Hellfighters Parade in Harlem, New York, became a marker of African- American service to their Nation, and their service was frequently  referenced as part of the civil rights campaign.   This bill directs the U.S. Mint to strike a Congressional Gold Medal  honoring the Harlem Hellfighters for their service during World War I.  The gold medal will be displayed at the Smithsonian Institution so that  others may learn of the patriotism and courage displayed by the men of  the 369th Infantry Regiment.   So, Madam Speaker, I thank Mr. Suozzi for introducing this bill. I  urge Members to vote ``yes,'' and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  New York (Mr. Suozzi) who is also the sponsor of this legislation.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New  York (Mr. Espaillat).    Madam Speaker, I yield the gentleman from New York an  additional 1 minute.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Ohio (Mrs. Beatty).    Madam Speaker, I have no further speakers and I am  prepared to close. I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   In closing, I certainly want to thank Mr. Suozzi for bringing forward  this legislation. I want to thank Mr. Espaillat and Congresswoman  Beatty for joining with him to bring this legislation forward. I want  to thank Mr. McHenry and the members of the Financial Services  Committee for joining together in support of this legislation.    The Harlem Hellfighters braved long deployments, treacherous  conditions, and the scorn of their fellow patriots. So we find  ourselves, I guess, 100 years later or so, understanding the important  role that they played and the sacrifices that they made.   We also understand how important it is for all of us to not only give  recognition to their sacrifice, but also recognize that this country  has gone through some very difficult times, faced with the question of  race.   Despite the fact that we have seen times in this country when we were  moving forward and we thought we were erasing the kind of racism that  had been present for too long, we find ourselves today fighting some of  the same battles.   There are many in the history of this country who have made  sacrifices in so many different ways that perhaps will never be  recognized. But I am hopeful, with the cooperation, the cosponsorship,  and the work for both sides of the aisle on a recognition such as this,  that this will help us to continue to fight to rid this country of  racism and discrimination and hatred.   I am hopeful that the word will go forward today about this  recognition that we are giving to the Harlem Hellfighters and will  inspire others to want to praise and honor those who are certainly ones  who are so committed to  [[Page H2785]]  justice and equality, and who love this country will be treated better,  will be recognized, and certainly will be given their correct place in  history.   So I urge Members to celebrate the memory of these brave men of the  369th Infantry Regiment, who, through their service, sought to realize  a more equal and a more perfect union, by voting ``yes'' on H.R. 3642.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 2332) to prohibit consumer reporting agencies from  furnishing a consumer report containing any adverse item of information  about a consumer if such consumer is a victim of trafficking, and for  other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2332         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Debt Bondage Repair Act''.       SEC. 2. ADVERSE INFORMATION IN CASES OF TRAFFICKING.         (a) In General.--The Fair Credit Reporting Act (15 U.S.C.       1681 et seq.) is amended by inserting after section 605B the       following:       ``Sec. 605C Adverse information in cases of trafficking         ``(a) In General.--A consumer reporting agency may not       furnish a consumer report containing any adverse item of       information about a consumer that resulted from a severe form       of trafficking in persons or sex trafficking if the consumer       has provided trafficking documentation to the consumer       reporting agency.        ``(b) Rulemaking.--        ``(1) In general.--The Director shall, not later than 180       days after the date of the enactment of this section, issue a       rule to implement subsection (a).        ``(2) Contents.--The rule issued pursuant to paragraph (1)       shall establish a method by which consumers shall submit       trafficking documentation to consumer reporting agencies.        ``(c) Definitions.--        ``(1) Trafficking documentation.--The term trafficking       documentation means--        ``(A) documentation of either--        ``(i) a determination by a Federal or State government       entity that a consumer is a victim of trafficking; or        ``(ii) a determination by a court of competent jurisdiction       that a consumer is a victim of trafficking; and        ``(B) documentation that identifies items of adverse       information that should not be furnished by a consumer       reporting agency because the items resulted from the severe       form of trafficking in persons or sex trafficking of which       such consumer is a victim.        ``(2) Victim of trafficking.--For the purposes of this       section, the term ``victim of trafficking'' means a person       who is a victim of a severe form of trafficking in persons or       sex trafficking, as such terms are defined in section 103 of       the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000.''.        (b) Table of Contents Amendment.--The table of contents of       the Fair Credit Reporting Act is amended by inserting after       the item relating to section 605B the following new item:  ``605C. Adverse information in cases of trafficking.''.        (c) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section       shall apply on the date that is 30 days after the date on       which the Director of the Bureau of Consumer Financial       Protection issues a rule pursuant to section 605C(b) of the       Fair Credit Reporting Act.        (d) Determination of Budgetary Effects.--The budgetary       effects of this Act, for the purpose of complying with the       Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall be determined by       reference to the latest statement titled ``Budgetary Effects       of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act, submitted for printing       in the Congressional Record by the Chairman of the House       Budget Committee, provided that such statement has been       submitted prior to the vote on passage.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their  remarks on this legislation and to insert extraneous material thereon.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I would like to thank the Committee on Financial  Services ranking member, Mr. McHenry, for introducing H.R. 2332, the  Debt Bondage Repair Act.   Over the last year, working in a bipartisan manner, the Financial  Services Committee has been engaged in an examination of trafficking  issues of all types. As we heard at a recent hearing that delved into  issues of human trafficking, which includes forced labor, sex  trafficking and organ trafficking, victims of trafficking are not only  abused physically and emotionally, but financially also.   The moving testimony of Reverend Dr. Martin Hatcher, an advocate for  sex trafficking survivors and a survivor himself, demonstrated how  traffickers steal their victims' identities, open accounts in their  names, run up credit card debt, purchase large ticket items like  automobiles, and take out loans while pretending to be their victims.   This financial exploitation is not only designed as a stream of  finance, allowing the traffickers' operation to thrive, but it also  inflicts long-term harm and asserts control over the victim.   This bill, which aims to help survivors of human trafficking restore  their credit and gain access to the consumer financial products and  services that most of us take for granted, is an important step in  restoring survivors' dignity and financial stability and in preventing  revictimization.   Specifically, the bill prohibits credit bureaus from including  adverse information that resulted from human or sex trafficking in a  victim's credit report. It directs the Consumer Financial Protection  Bureau to develop a process to ensure that adverse information caused  by their traffickers is not included in a victim's credit report. Such  a process does not exist now and, given the importance that credit  reports play in our economy, it makes it difficult for survivors in our  communities to get a loan or even secure a job.   As noted by the Survivor Inclusion Initiative of the Human  Trafficking Focus Liechtenstein Initiative, we must ``facilitate  survivor access to basic banking services, such as checking and savings  accounts, and help survivors' financial recovery to become full  financial participants in their communities.''   Madam Speaker, for these reasons, I urge my colleagues to support  this important bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1530     Madam Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I am  prepared to close. I reserve the balance of my time until Mr. McHenry  yields back.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Survivors of human trafficking face many obstacles to recovering from  the physical, emotional, and financial abuse inflicted by their  traffickers. The Debt Bondage Repair Act makes strides in assisting  them to restore their credit and achieve financial reintegration into  their communities.   Congress can play a leading role in helping trafficking survivors to  take back control. For that reason, I certainly urge both sides of the  aisle to join me in supporting this important bill.   I do want to take a moment to thank my ranking member, Mr. McHenry,  for the leadership that he has provided on trafficking in general and  on financial trafficking specifically. This is important legislation,  and I am so pleased to be able to work with him, and I am so pleased  that this bill has bipartisan support. I want to thank him for the work  that he has done and will continue to do.   I would also briefly note that survivors of trafficking are not the  only individuals who are harmed by our broken credit reporting system.  The system serves as a major barrier to economic opportunity for so  many others. So we are going to continue working with Mr. McHenry, and  I have scheduled a full committee hearing on June 29 to further explore  these credit reporting challenges. I believe that our Republican  colleagues will join with us to advance bold solutions to make the  system fair for all of our constituents.   Again, I am so pleased that the members of the committee have worked  together. I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 2332, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 1443) to amend the Equal Credit Opportunity Act to require  the collection of small business loan data related to LGBTQ-owned  businesses, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1443         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``LGBTQ Business Equal Credit       Enforcement and Investment Act''.       SEC. 2. SMALL BUSINESS LOAN DATA COLLECTION.         Section 704B of the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (15 U.S.C.       1691c-2) is amended--        (1) by inserting ``LGBTQ-owned,'' after ``minority-owned,''       each place such term appears;        (2) in subsection (e)(2)(G), by inserting ``, sexual       orientation, gender identity'' after ``sex''; and        (3) in subsection (h), by adding at the end the following:        ``(7) LGBTQ-owned business.--The term `LGBTQ-owned       business' means a business--        ``(A) more than 50 percent of the ownership or control of       which is held by 1 or more individuals self-identifying as       lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, or queer; and        ``(B) more than 50 percent of the net profit or loss of       which accrues to 1 or more individuals self-identifying as       lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, or queer.''.       SEC. 3. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS.         The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and to insert extraneous material thereon.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I would like to thank the gentleman from New York,  Representative Torres, for his leadership on H.R. 1443, the LGBTQ  Business Equal Credit Enforcement and Investment Act.   We know transparency is critical in helping identify discriminatory  lending practices in the financial marketplace. This bill would enhance  a provision of Dodd-Frank requiring data collection on lending to small  and minority-owned businesses to include data on lending to LGBTQ-owned  businesses as well, including self-reported gender identity and sexual  orientation.   This bill will also define an LGBTQ-owned business in the Equal  Credit Opportunity Act, the ECOA, which would allow more businesses to  gain access to capital and investment.   Of course, June is Pride Month, a time to recognize and celebrate the  [[Page H2788]]  LGBTQ community's significant contributions to our country, including  to the economy, and to also stand as allies.   We know there is more work to be done to ensure equal opportunities.  For example, according to a study of mortgage lending data from 2019,  loan applicants in neighborhoods with a higher density of LGBTQ people  received higher interest and fees, regardless of the applicant's  sexuality or identity.   In addition, LGBTQ individuals face employment discrimination, which  has contributed to high rates of poverty, especially for LGBTQ people  of color. The Williams Institute found that nearly 31 percent of Black  LGBTQ people live in poverty compared with nearly 25 percent of Black  cisgender, straight people.   These factors further support the urgency of supporting LGBTQ  businesses as they create job opportunities and build community wealth.   As of 2016, there were an estimated 1.4 million LGBTQ-owned  businesses in the United States. The CFPB needs to begin collecting  this data and help us as policymakers and the public identify and  understand the community development needs of LGBTQ-owned businesses.   I am pleased we were able to report this bill unanimously out of  committee with a voice vote. I hope we can build on that bipartisan  effort, and I urge all of my colleagues to support this important  legislation.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, may I inquire as to how much time we have  remaining in this debate?    Madam Speaker, I yield all 17\1/2\ minutes to the  gentleman from New York (Mr. Torres), who is also the sponsor of this  legislation.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   The LGBTQ Business Equal Credit Enforcement and Investment Act led by  Representative Torres would help ensure that LGBTQ business owners have  access to opportunities to grow and invest through government and other  private procurement contracts as well as have equal access to credit  opportunities.   This bill is supported by the National Gay and Lesbian Chamber of  Commerce, the Center for American Progress, the National Center for  Lesbian Rights, the National Center for Transgender Equality, Center  for LGBTQ Economic Advancement & Research, Human Rights Campaign, Out  Leadership, and many others.   The Financial Services Committee passed this bill unanimously by  voice vote in May 2021, and I would like to urge my colleagues on both  sides of the aisle, again, to join me in supporting this important  legislation.   I would like to thank the ranking member, Mr. McHenry, for joining  with me and others to pass this important legislation and particularly  this Pride Month that we are all celebrating the progress that has been  made in the LGBTQ community.   I thank Mr. McHenry for his cosponsorship, his support, and his  cooperation, for all that we are able to get done these days working  together.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 3325) to award four congressional gold medals to the United  States Capitol Police and those who protected the U.S. Capitol on  January 6, 2021, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 3325         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. FINDINGS.         The Congress finds the following:        (1) Every day, the United States Capitol Police (``Capitol       Police'') protects the U.S. Capitol, Members of Congress,       congressional staff and institutional staff, journalists, and       the visiting public.        (2) On January 6, 2021, a mob of insurrectionists forced       its way into the U.S. Capitol building and congressional       office buildings and engaged in acts of vandalism, looting,       and violently attacked Capitol Police officers.        (3) The sacrifice of heroes including Capitol Police       Officers Brian Sicknick and Howard Liebengood, Metropolitan       Police Department Officer Jeffrey Smith, and those who       sustained injuries, and the courage of Capitol Police Officer       Eugene Goodman, exemplify the patriotism and the commitment       of Capitol Police officers, and those of other law       enforcement agencies, to risk their lives in service of our       country.        (4) Up to seven Americans died following this violent       attack, and more than 140 law enforcement officers suffered       physical injuries, including 15 officers who were       hospitalized.        (5) The desecration of the U.S. Capitol, which is the       temple of our American Democracy, and the violence targeting       Congress are horrors that will forever stain our Nation's       history.        (6) On April 2, 2021 Officer William ``Billy'' Evans was       killed while protecting the North Barricade of the Capitol.       Officer Evans was a distinguished member of the First       Responders Unit and an eighteen-year veteran of the United       States Capitol Police. Also injured in that assault was       Officer Kenneth Shaver. Officer Shaver is a fifteen-year       veteran of the United States Capitol Police.       SEC. 2. CONGRESSIONAL GOLD MEDALS.

The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their  remarks on this legislation and to insert extraneous material thereon.    I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, every day the men and women of the United States  Capitol Police protect the U.S. Capitol. They protect us, they protect  our staff, they protect journalists and other visitors who come into  the people's House.   In March of this year, the House passed H.R. 1085 to award three  Congressional Gold Medals honoring the courage, patriotism, and  commitment to service exemplified by the men and women of the Capitol  Police, Metropolitan Police, and other law enforcement agencies who  risked their lives and sustained injuries as they sought to protect  those trapped in the Capitol on January 6, 2021.   This bill builds upon H.R. 1085 to include minting of a fourth  Congressional Gold Medal to be displayed by the Architect of the  Capitol so that we may continue to honor those officers who sustained  injuries in the line of duty and the sacrifices of heroes, including  Capitol Police Officers Brian Sicknick and Howard Liebengood and  Washington, D.C. Metropolitan Police Department Officer Jeffrey Smith.  We also honor Capitol Police Officer Eugene Goodman; whose quick  thinking and selfless action undoubtedly saved the lives of many.   Additionally, this bill honors the memory of Capitol Police Officer  William ``Billy'' Evans, who was killed while protecting the north  barricade of the Capitol against a vehicular assault on April 2, 2021.  It also honors the bravery displayed by Capitol Police Officer Kenneth  Shaver, who was also injured in that assault.   I thank Speaker Pelosi for introducing this bill this Congress and  urge Members to vote ``yes.''   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Pelosi) the Speaker, who is also the sponsor of this  legislation.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   In closing, I commend Speaker Pelosi for bringing forward this  legislation.   Every day, the brave men and women of the U.S. Capitol Police put  their lives on the line in service to our Nation.   On January 6, we all witnessed this bravery firsthand as they fought  against those who would seek to end this democracy. It is true that the  leadership and decisive action on that day saved many lives, including  my own. We honor their sacrifices on that day, and every day we thank  them for their service.   Madam Speaker and Members, I cannot help but say at this time where  this bill is being discussed on the floor of the House of  Representatives, I saw Capitol Police in hand-to-hand combat with these  insurrectionists. I saw them being attacked by QAnon, by the proud  boys, by the oath keepers, by the KKK, by white supremacists. I thought  I would never see such in my lifetime.   I watched Capitol Police being attacked with the American flag jabbed  into their bodies. I never thought those who considered themselves  conservative would attack uniformed police officers of the Capitol or  any place, but we saw it.   So we can't say enough about these Capitol Police, whose lives were  endangered and some who lost their lives and some who are still trying  to recuperate from the injuries that they received.   I am absolutely saddened by the fact that too many do not want to  know what really happened that day, who oppose investigation, oppose a  commission to delve into exactly what took place, who was responsible,  who organized it, who paid for it, et cetera.   I could go on all day and night talking about that experience, as  many Members of Congress perhaps would like to do, but I know that,  despite the fact, there is opposition to delving into what happened. We  are going to find out what happened. We are going to find out who  supported all of the resources that were put together to bring people  here in buses and put them on airplanes to come and attack us in the  Capitol of the United States of America.   So I urge all Members to honor the sacrifices and courage displayed  by the members of the Capitol Police, the Metropolitan Police, and  other law enforcement agencies by voting ``yes'' on H.R. 3325.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
