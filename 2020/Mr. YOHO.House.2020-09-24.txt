 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and legacy of  Sheriff Sandeep Dhaliwal who was tragically and senselessly killed in  the line of duty last year, September 27, 2019.   Deputy Dhaliwal was the first observant Sikh to serve in Harris  County Sheriff's Office and was the first Sikh American in Texas to  receive a policy accommodation to wear articles of faith, including his  turban and beard, while serving.   His story is an American story. Born in India, he moved to Houston,  Texas, at an early age with his parents. He started a successful  business but felt called to serve and build better relations and  understanding between the Sikh and all greater-Houston communities.   He was a beloved husband, father, and son who selflessly served  others and was a role model to all who knew him. Like many of the brave  men and women in law enforcement who put on the uniform to protect and  serve communities across our great Nation, Deputy Sandeep Dhaliwal is a  hero.                 Honoring the Life of Sergeant Eric Twisdale     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Clay County  Sheriff Sergeant Eric Twisdale who passed away due to complications  from COVID-19.   Anyone who knew Sergeant Twisdale said he was committed to serving  the community. Throughout his 28 years of active service, he showed  that commitment and was rewarded, receiving several awards, including  the Lifesaving Award in 2014 for saving a person from drowning.   He was honored as the 2015 Deputy of the Year for displaying  exceptional valor while helping stop two murder suspects during a high- speed chase through several counties.   There is a common thread that runs through our Nation's law  enforcement community: courage, and selfless service to others.   Sergeant Twisdale most certainly possessed both in abundance. He is  survived by his children, many grandchildren, and family members.   I thank Sergeant Twisdale for his service and for keeping our  community safe. He will be missed.               Celebrating the Opening of Middleburg VA Clinic     Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the critical work being  done by our VA health centers in Florida's Third Congressional  District, and specifically to congratulate the opening of the new  Middleburg VA Clinic.   On September 15, the Middleburg VA Clinic opened to patients. The  clinic is vital for the health and well-being of so many veterans who  call Clay County home.   Before the state-of-the-art facility opened, I introduced a bill with  the entire Florida delegation that would name this clinic after Naval  Chief Petty Officer Andrew Baker, a former Clay County resident and  American hero who lost his life while serving our country.   During these turbulent times, we must never forget to honor those who  serve and protect our fellow citizens and the Constitution from enemies  both foreign and domestic.     Congratulating University of Florida on Number 6 Ranking for Public                                Universities     Mr. Speaker, I rise today as a proud Florida Gator. In the  last ``Best Colleges'' edition of the U.S. News & World Report, the  University of Florida was named the number 6 public university in the  country. That ranking marks the fourth--I want to repeat that, that  ranking marks the fourth--consecutive year the University of Florida  has risen in the rankings for public universities, jumping from number  14 in 2017 to number 6 today.   UF is one of the finest research universities in the United States,  attracting the best and brightest from around the great State of  Florida, America, and the world.   I want to congratulate President Kent Fuchs, his staff, the faculty,  student body, and the board of trustees for their collective efforts in  continuing to elevate the University of Florida to higher and higher  rankings.   And I can't end without saying: Go Gators.               Supporting First Responders and Law Enforcement     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and show my support  for our Nation's first responders and law enforcement officials.   On September 14, we witnessed the assassination attempt of two Los  Angeles County sheriff deputies in Compton, California.   Just yesterday, we saw two more attacked in Louisville. As I speak on  this floor, the 31-year-old female and 24-year-old male deputies who  were brutally ambushed, thankfully, have been released from the  hospital.   The officers attacked yesterday, hopefully, will survive also. The  support from across the country for these heroes is inspiring, even as  the leftwing radicals shouted obscenities outside the hospital and  yelled they hoped the officers would die.   While the President pursues noble action through peace accords in the  Middle East, the Democratic Party cannot find its voice in admonishing  domestic terrorists targeting our brave law enforcement officers across  the country.   I stand with the President, with our law enforcement, and with the  foundation of this country--respect for life, defense of liberty, and  the protection of property.                            ____________________
