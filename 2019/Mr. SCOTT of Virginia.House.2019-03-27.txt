 Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend  their remarks and insert extraneous material on H.R. 7, the Paycheck  Fairness Act.    Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Chair, I thank the gentlewoman from Connecticut for her decades  of leadership fighting for working women.   In 1963, the Equal Pay Act codified the right to ``equal pay for  equal work regardless of sex.'' In fact, the Equal Pay Act was enacted  1 year prior to the Civil Rights Act of 1964 that, for the first time,  provided for the enforcement of antidiscrimination laws. Over the past  55 years, the Equal Pay Act, in combination with title VII of the Civil  Rights Act, has produced substantial progress toward addressing  inequities for women in the workplace.   Yet, loopholes and insufficient enforcement have allowed gender-based  wage discrimination to persist. Today, women earn, on average, 80 cents  on the dollar compared to White men in similar jobs. The wage gap is  even worse for women of color. It exists in every sector, regardless of  education, experience, occupation, industry, or job title.   Drawn out over a lifetime, the persistent wage gap could cost a woman  anywhere from $400,000 to $2 million. For many, this is the difference  between financial stability and poverty. In fact, we know that  achieving pay equity would actually cut the poverty rate for working  women more than 50 percent.   That is why we are considering this historic legislation today. After  decades of failing to address persistent wage inequity, the Paycheck  Fairness Act is our opportunity to strengthen the Equal Pay Act,  bolster the rights of working women, lift families out of poverty, and,  finally, align our remedies for gender discrimination with other  established antidiscrimination laws by eliminating caps on damages when  employers act with malice or reckless indifference, consistent with the  laws governing discrimination based on race or national origin,  treating attorney fees consistent with title VII of the Civil Rights  Act, and restricting an employer's inquiry and reliance on a  prospective employee's previous salary. This is consistent with the  Americans with Disabilities Act, the Genetic Information  Nondiscrimination Act, and similar restrictions regarding an  applicant's marital or pregnancy status.   As chair of the House Committee on Education and Labor, I urge my  colleagues to join me in casting a vote for final passage of the  Paycheck Fairness Act and making equal pay for equal work a reality for  working women across this country.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms. DeLauro), the sponsor of the bill.    Madam Chair, I yield an additional 1 minute to  the gentlewoman from Connecticut.    Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from California (Ms. Pelosi), the Speaker of the House of  Representatives.    Madam Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Oregon (Ms. Bonamici).    Madam Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. Adams).    Madam Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Levin).    Madam Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Wilson).    Madam Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. Underwood).    Madam Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Minnesota (Ms. Omar).    Madam Chair, I yield the gentlewoman from  Minnesota an additional 30 seconds.    Madam Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Beyer).    Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from the District of Columbia (Ms. Norton).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Madam Chair, I yield the gentlewoman from  Texas an additional 30 seconds.    Madam Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from New York (Mr. Nadler), the chair of the Committee on the  Judiciary.    Madam Chair, I would like to inquire how much  time I have left.    Madam Chair, I yield myself the balance of my  time.   Madam Chair, I just want to make a couple of closing comments.   We have heard speaker after speaker complain that, if this bill  passes, lawyers will get paid. Most lawyers, in fact, only get paid  when they have a winning case; so if they want lawyers to stop getting  paid, they could do this if we would stop discriminating.   The only way to enforce the laws against discrimination is to hire a  lawyer and go to court, and that is when lawyers get paid. Stop the  discrimination; stop the lawyers from getting paid.   There is also a suggestion that we ought to limit the amount of money  that can be paid to lawyers. The fact is that no group supporting women  support that limitation because the limitation sometimes can be so low  that you can't hire a lawyer. It is only supported by groups supporting  those representing people accused of discrimination.   It is also one-sided. There is no proposal to limit the amount of  money that the guilty can pay their lawyers.   A comment was made about unlimited damages. The damages, in fact, in  this bill are the same as you can get under race and religious  discrimination, and the purpose of the bill is to conform the process  for gender discrimination to the process for other forms of  discrimination like race and religion.   The EEOC data, as my colleague from Virginia pointed out, is  available, and if you do not report this data, you could have gross  disparities. You could pay all the men one thing and all the women  less, and until that is reported, nobody might notice.   Madam Chair, there are pay gaps. Discrimination still exists, and  this legislation is one step in closing that pay gap. We need to pass  the legislation.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I include in the Record a letter  from the International Federation of Professional and Technical  Engineers in support of this legislation.           International Federation of Professional & Technical             Engineers, AFL-CIO & CLC,                                    Washington, DC, March 26, 2019.        Dear Representative, On behalf of the 90,000 members       represented by the International Federation of Professional       and Technical Engineers (IFPTE), we are writing in support of       H.R. 7, the Paycheck Fairness Act. Sponsored by Congresswoman       Rosa DeLauro, this legislation will amend the Fair Labor       Standards Act of 1938 to provide more effective remedies to       victims of gender-based discrimination in the payment of       wages. With a floor vote scheduled this week, IFPTE urges you       to vote for H.R. 7.        Today, women earn 80 cents to every one dollar earned by       their male counterparts. It is even worse for African-      American women, who earn only 61 cents on the dollar compared       to white non-Hispanic men, while Hispanic and Latina women       earn only 53 cents  [[Page H2864]]       on the dollar compared to white non-Hispanic men. While these       glaring differences should be unacceptable in any day and       age, the impact is even greater today with poverty rates       among women recently reaching their highest peak in nearly       two decades.        The problem of unequal pay for equal work spans every       sector and all educational levels. According to a 2017       Department of Professional Employees (DPE, AFL-CIO) fact       sheet, Professional Women: A Gendered Look at Inequality in       the U.S. Workforce, women with a bachelor's degree or higher       earned $1,230 in median weekly wages in 2015, while men with       a comparable education earned $1,420. The DPE fact sheet also       looked at wage disparities per occupational category and       found that, without exception, women's wages lag far behind       men. Despite comprising 55 percent of workers in professional       and related occupations, women in those professions earn 28       percent less than men.        The Paycheck Fairness Act is aimed at closing the pay       discrimination gap by strengthening the Equal Pay Act of       1963. This legislation will:        Clarify acceptable reasons for differences in pay to ensure       that a wage gap is legitimate and truly a result of factors       other than gender;        Allow for reasonable comparisons between employees to       determine fair wages;        Prohibit employer retaliation against workers who inquire       about employee wages in general, or disclose their own wage;        Provide women with the option to proceed in an opt-out       class action lawsuit and allow women to receive punitive and       compensatory damages for pay discrimination;        Increase training for Equal Employment Opportunity       Commission (EEOC) staff to better identify and handle wage       disputes;        Require EEOC to develop regulations directing employers to       collect wage data;        Require the Department of Labor to reinstate activities       that promote equal pay (i.e. educational programs, technical       assistance to employers, promoting research about pay       disparities between men and women); and,        Establish salary negotiation skills training for women and       girls.        The Paycheck Fairness Act is a long overdue bill to help       close the pay gap suffered by women workers. IFPTE urges you       to support H.R. 7.            Sincerely,      Paul Shearon,        President.      Matthew Biggs,        Secretary-Treasurer/Legislative Director.     Madam Speaker, I reserve a point of order on  the motion to recommit.    Madam Speaker, I withdraw my reservation of my  point of order.
