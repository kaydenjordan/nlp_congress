 Mr. Speaker, last week, we celebrated Veterans Day. In  that spirit, I rise today to honor a man of exemplary service,  unwavering dedication to our country, and someone I am proud to call a  constituent, Mr. Herb Barret.   Mr. Barret is someone who has lived a remarkable life of service. He  is a veteran and a former member of the Marine Corps who risked his  life for our country in the Korean war--sadly, but often known, as  ``the forgotten war.'' Marines live by a set of values and principles,  such as honor, courage, commitment. They are the bedrock of our  Nation's character, and what Mr. Barret embodies every single day in  our community. Throughout his esteemed career, Mr. Barret has shined  bright as a beacon of perseverance and commitment, inspiring all of us  with his valor along the way.   Mr. Barret is a dedicated member of our community in New York City  and has laid the groundwork for the next generation of public servants  to follow in his footsteps. He is a living example that anything that  is possible in this country through hard work, dedication, and  perseverance, through the physical, mental, and moral battles faced  during combat and while serving in our communities on behalf of our  great Nation. He is a man of great integrity, courage, and humility,  and I am proud to call him a member of our community.                       Honoring Dr. Juan Tapia-Mendoza     Mr. Speaker, I also rise today to honor Dr. Juan  Tapia-Mendoza, a fellow Dominican immigrant and New Yorker who has  fought tirelessly to achieve the American Dream--and that he did.   Before Dr. Tapia-Mendoza opened his pediatric practice, he was a  graffiti artist known only as ``C.A.T. 87,'' whose work was found all  over the subway cars and across the city of New York in empty lots,  particularly in northern Manhattan and beyond.   Though he dropped out of school at a young age, his art showcased a  strong motivation, and he was able to channel that motivation into his  studies and return back to Santo Domingo to study medicine.   Upon his return, Dr. Tapia-Mendoza, opened Pediatrics 2000 group,  which now has two locations in my district and serves over 20,000  children, supporting not only the health of our children, but their  education and literacy as well, fostering the next generation of young  leaders in our community.   His clinic is also an art gallery, a center that brings together  young people in our neighborhood for healthy activities; uniting  medicine and art to uplift our children.   Dr. Tapia-Mendoza's incredible story was the subject of a recent  documentary titled, ``The Graffiti Artist Who Became a Doctor,'' which  was recently awarded an Emmy award.   Mr. Speaker, I am here not only because he won that Emmy but because  he also was there for the entire community during this horrible  pandemic.   He is a shining example of how tenacity, artistry, and community  intersect. I commend Dr. Tapia-Mendoza for his work and for using his  story to inspire a new generation of our Latino youth.
