 Mr. President, H.R. 5860 was the continuing  resolution signed into law on September 30. It narrowly averted an  extremist-led government shutdown.   That act included $16 billion in disaster relief for States like  Florida, Vermont, New York, Pennsylvania, Hawaii, Louisiana, and others  that suffered tremendous losses from extreme weather events exacerbated  by fossil fuel emissions causing climate change. It also provided  funding for the thousands of firefighters who protect our communities  from the ravages of wildfires.   Because that was designated as emergency funding, the Budget  Committee chairman--i.e., me--is authorized to increase the  Appropriations Committee's top line by the same amount. With this  adjustment, the emergency funding will not supplant nondefense  discretionary funding--which includes important investments for climate  mitigation, environmental protection, infrastructure, education, job  training, national parks and forests, and law enforcement--that is  subject to the fiscal year 2024 discretionary spending limits.   That funding was designated as emergency funding pursuant to section  251(b)(2)(A)(i) of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control  Act of 1985. Section 314(a) of the Congressional Budget Act allows the  chairman of the committee to revise the allocations, aggregates, and  levels consistent with the amount of emergency funding. Today, I am  making that adjustment.   In addition, section 121(c) of the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023  contained a reserve fund to allow the Budget chairman to revise budget  aggregates and committee allocations and to adjust the pay-as-you-go  ledger for legislation that would not increase the deficit over the  period of fiscal years 2024 to 2033. The authorizing portion of H.R.  5860, division B, meets the conditions of that reserve fund. Over the  10-year period, division B reduces deficits by $2 million. As such, I  am revising the budget aggregates, committee allocations, and pay-as- you-go ledger to accommodate H.R. 5860.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the accompanying tables  which provide details about the adjustment be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:        REVISIONS TO BUDGET AGGREGATES--BUDGET AUTHORITY AND OUTLAYS (Pursuant to Section 121(c) of the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023 and          Section 314(a) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974)                              [$ in billions] ------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                                  2024 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Current Spending Aggregates:     Budget Authority.......................................    4,940.424     Outlays................................................    5,080.282 Adjustment:     Budget Authority.......................................       16.642     Outlays................................................        1.219 Revised Aggregates:     Budget Authority.......................................    4,957.066     Outlays................................................    5,081.501 ------------------------------------------------------------------------       REVISIONS TO THE ALLOCATION TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS FOR                             FISCAL YEAR 2024   (Pursuant to Section 314(a) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974)                              [$ in billions] ------------------------------------------------------------------------                                      Current                   Revised                                     Allocation  Adjustments   Allocation ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Revised Security Budget Authority      894.349        0.000      894.349 Revised Nonsecurity Budget             757.849       16.000      773.849  Authority.......................
