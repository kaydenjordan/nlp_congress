 I ask unanimous consent to be recognized for 3 minutes.    Mr. President, I rise in support of Shalanda Young's  nomination to be the Director of the Office of Management and Budget.   Ms. Young has served with distinction as OMB's Acting Director for  the past year, leading the administration's efforts to execute the  American Rescue Plan, the bipartisan infrastructure bill, and numerous  Federal cybersecurity priorities.   Over the past year, she has been a true partner to Congress, working  closely with Members on both sides of the aisle to find bipartisan  paths forward.   In addition to her proven leadership at OMB this past year, Ms. Young  brings nearly two decades of public service experience to her role,  including as a senior staff Member on the House Appropriations  Committee where she led challenging bipartisan negotiations around the  debt limit, government funding, and budget reform.   OMB will continue to be central to the administration's efforts to  tackle the Nation's ongoing challenges, and Ms. Young will be  instrumental in leading that work.   I have every confidence in Ms. Young's ability to continue to rise to  the challenges facing OMB, both now and in the future.   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the confirmation of  Shalanda Young as director of the Office of Management and Budget.                            ____________________
