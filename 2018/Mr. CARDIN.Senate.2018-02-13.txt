 Mr. President, I want to share with my colleagues a  concern I have about a group of people who are legally in this country  and have a similar problem as the DACA registrant Dreamers who we need  to pay attention to. I am strongly in support of passing legislation to  protect DACA and Dreamers. I will talk a little bit about that also.   There is a group of individuals who have been in this country for a  long time--similar to the Dreamers--who know no other country but the  United States of America. They are legally here. They also have a date  on their back as a result of the Trump administration, in some cases,  not renewing what is known as temporary protected status; in other  cases, it has deferred that decision making on the extension of  temporary protected status.   In 1990, Congress passed legislation that authorized the creation of  the TPS program. We recognized that there were times in which armed  conflict or environmental disasters or other extraordinary  circumstances would present itself where individuals would not be safe  in their home country, and they would be permitted to legally come to  the United States under this protected status. I would like to call it  ``humanitarian protected status'' because these conditions have  continued in many of these countries for decades.   Many of these people have been here for decades because the  circumstances in their home country have not changed. Administration  after administration has renewed their protected status, and they have  been permitted to live here legally, to be able to work and go to  school. They serve in our military. They have served our Nation very,  very well.   The numbers are smaller than those of the Dreamers. The total number  is approximately 437,000. The largest country by far is El Salvador,  which is 195,000; Honduras, about 57,000; and Haiti, about 50,000.   I think Members of Congress are fully aware of the circumstances in  Central America and recognize the fact that, for many families, it was  not safe for them to stay in their countries because, if they had,  their children would have either ended up in gangs or have been  murdered and that the economic circumstances in these countries had not  allowed for economic opportunities for their families. As a result, the  United States welcomed them here in a protected status, and they have  become part of our economy.   For the State of Maryland, this number is actually larger than the  Dreamer category. We have 22,500 who are in the TPS status--97 percent  from El Salvador, Honduras, and Haiti. It has been estimated that this  group has contributed $1.2 billion to Maryland's GDP. They have been in  our country for decades. The young people particularly know no other  country than the United States of America. It would not be safe for  them to return to their countries.   We have information about that, and I call it to my colleagues'  attention. The process in going forward on extending the TPS status is  that we first get the recommendation from our Embassy in the country  itself. In this case, I had a chance to review the recommendations from  the Embassy, and it is clear that our experts on the ground in the  country felt that these families should be able to remain in the United  States. There are many reasons for that.  [[Page S902]]    One is the bilateral relationship with the country itself, in which  the country has asked us not to return these individuals to the country  because it cannot handle this population's returning to the country.  They don't have jobs, and the infrastructure in the country will not  handle that. I think we are all familiar with Haiti and how devastated  it has been by storms. It literally does not have the capacity to be  able to handle the return of the Haitians. It would be an incredible  burden on the country of Haiti, and there are no jobs available for  these individuals.   I think all are familiar with what happened with the returning of  certain individuals to Central America. If we force deportation, make  no mistake about it, the individuals who have been law-abiding here in  the United States, who have been adding to our economy, who are part of  our social fabric, and who believe that they are Americans will be  returned to an environment in which they are going to be vulnerable to  the intimidation of gangs, and they will be without employment. Many  will have no choice but to choose to either join a gang or be subjected  to the type of intimidation and violence that one's standing up to the  gang brings not only to oneself but to the members of one's family.  That is something that we should not be allowing.   There are also economic reasons for which there have been  recommendations to continue this program. The challenge is that they  now have dates on their backs because of the decision in some of these  countries not to extend the TPS status by the Trump administration.   These are very similar circumstances to those of the Dreamers, but it  doesn't quite have the same amount of attention around the Nation.  These individuals are legally in this country. They came here legally,  but they have been here for the same length of time, and they are part  of our fabric, which is the same as the Dreamers. It is for that reason  that the right result is to protect their legal status here in the  United States and to give them a pathway to citizenship so that they  can become legal citizens of the country they know as home.   S. 2144, the SECURE Act, was introduced by me, Senator Van Hollen,  Senator Feinstein, and others in order to accomplish that. I hope that,  during the debate that we are having here, we will find a way to  incorporate protection for these 437,000 people who are legally here so  that they know their futures are here and that they are protected in  the workforce.   As I said, it is very similar to the Dreamer issue. We know that the  Dreamer issue--the crisis, the March date that we are facing--was  created by the President of the United States. The DACA Program was  created by President Obama on June 15, 2012. Since that day, we have  had about 800,000 people who have been registered under the DACA  Program. They are now legally working, attending schools, and are able  to operate motor vehicles. They are, clearly, our future teachers, our  doctors, our engineers, and our entrepreneurs. They are very much a  part of our economy. In Maryland we have 10,000 who have registered  under the DACA Program. They have contributed $500 million to  Maryland's GDP.   For so many reasons, it would just be common sense for us--I would  think without too much controversy--to pass a bill that would say to, I  believe it is, a total of 1.8 million: We know that you know of no  other home but America. We welcome you. We are going to pass  legislation that protects your status and gives you a pathway to  citizenship.   We do that because America doesn't tear families apart. We don't say  to people who know no other home but America that we don't want them to  stay here. That is what we stand for as a nation. These are the values  that make America the strong nation that it is. By the way, these  individuals are contributing to the growth of our economy, and all of  us benefit.   Over the last several months--over a longer period than that--I have  been in the company of many of the Dreamers and many of the people  holding TPS status. I have been at roundtable discussions during which  we have had opportunities to listen to their stories about how they  view America as their home.   One said that the best birthday present she ever received was when  President Obama passed the DACA Executive order--when she knew that she  had a future in America. Others have told us stories: Without the  protection under the DACA Program, one never could have gotten a  driver's license and, therefore, never would have had an opportunity to  advance in our economy. Others have attended our colleges.   The interesting thing is that I have been in many meetings on college  campuses in which, for the first time, students have recognized that  their fellow student had been a Dreamer. They hadn't known that. They  had just known him as one of their classmates in school. I have been in  businesses when, for the first time, employees had discovered that one  of their colleagues happened to be a Dreamer. They hadn't known that.  They had just known him as a fellow employee.   This is widely supported. It is important for our economy and  important for our values to keep the families together, and the  American people support us on this. Poll after poll shows that  Americans believe that those Dreamers should be protected here in the  United States.   I include statements that I have received from Prince George's, Anne  Arundel, Howard, and Montgomery Counties and Baltimore City school  superintendents.   They wrote:         Maryland is a national leader in providing students with a       world-class education. Essential to our success is our       commitment to providing children in our schools with a safe       and welcoming environment to learn. Termination of DACA will       have direct and damaging effects on the Maryland students who       are current beneficiaries.        It is a direct threat to Maryland's economic stability and       safety, as it will strip students of their ability to work       and drive legally, pay taxes, and pursue post-secondary       opportunities. Parents who lose work authorizations will face       deportation or be moved into a dangerous underground economy,       causing financial uncertainty for their families and harmful       stress on their children--our students. In addition the DACA       decision could impact our ability to motivate our youth to       remain committed to their education and pursuing college or       careers, and will lead to worsening economic hardships of our       DACA community.    I have seen many letters of support and many testimonies from both-- those with TPS and the Dreamers--but I emphasize the one letter that I  received from the Law Enforcement Immigration Task Force, which is  cochaired by the Montgomery County police chief, Tom Manger. What he  said, I think, is very important. There are a lot of reasons we should  be protecting TPS recipients and DACA recipients, but he wrote:         We are concerned that, absent action by Congress, the       Dreamer population will be driven back into the shadows and       be hesitant to report crimes or cooperate with       investigations. Such an outcome would risk undermining       community safety.    We are not safe by people going into the shadows. This is the United  States of America. Why would we want people to try to hide from us?  That is not the country we are. We do not create fear in the hearts of  law-abiding citizens. These are law-abiding citizens. They have sisters  and brothers who are U.S. citizens. They have other family members,  some of whom are TPS recipients, some of whom are Dreamers, and some of  whom are U.S. citizens. We don't tell families that we are going to  tear them apart. That is not what America believes in. These are all  individuals who have gone through security checks. These are people who  have been law-abiding--complying with our laws--working, serving in our  military, building this country.   I know that the first order of business is to make sure that the  Dreamers are protected. I strongly support that and would vote for a  bill on the floor right now, tonight, which has been introduced by some  of our colleagues, that protects the Dreamers, in and of itself, with  nothing else connected to it. We should do it, and it shouldn't be  controversial. I also urge us to make sure that we take care of those  who are in TPS status. It is a smaller group, and it doesn't have the  same degree of national attention, but this is about the same values  and the same economic concerns, the same families and the same issues.   I hope we can find a way in which we can include both the Dreamers  and TPS recipients in protecting their status here in America and  giving them  [[Page S903]]  pathways to citizenship because it is the right thing for them, the  right thing for their families, the right thing for our Nation, and the  right thing for our economy.   I know that my colleague from Maryland is on the floor. He has been  one of the great leaders on this issue. I know he has met with many  from the community who are in both the Dreamer and the TPS status. I  have joined him at meetings around Maryland in which we have talked to  the families. Through the Presiding Officer, I personally thank my  colleague for all of the work he has done in order to bring this issue  to the Senate.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.   Mr. VAN HOLLEN. I thank the Presiding Officer.   Mr. President, I start by thanking my colleague from the State of  Maryland, Senator Cardin, for his leadership on many, many issues but,  especially, as we gather here on the Senate floor to discuss the  Dreamers and immigration issues, including the folks who are TPS  recipients. I thank him for his leadership in Maryland and around the  country on these vital issues.   I think the country understands how important it is that we provide  the Dreamers with a secure future. These are individuals who have grown  up in our country. They know no other country as home. They have been  in classrooms with our kids. They have pledged allegiance to the flag.  They are now students in college or individuals working in businesses.  Some of them are small business owners. Many serve in our Armed Forces.  It would be disgraceful if, after welcoming these young people, we were  to cast them away.   Unfortunately, last September, President Trump lit the fuse on the  deportation of the Dreamers, and that clock has been ticking every day  and every month as we approach the March 5 deadline. So we as a  Senate--as Republicans and Democrats but, more importantly, as  Americans--need to come together and finally do our work so that we  operate as a body that can help solve problems in this country. Part of  that is making sure that these Dreamers have a secure home and a  pathway to becoming full citizens here in the United States of America.   Just the other day I was talking to the president of the University  of Maryland. We have a number of DACA recipients who are there training  to be engineers, training to be doctors, and people who are looking  forward to participating in the only country they know, the United  States of America.   I wish to turn now quickly to people who are here under what is  called temporary protected status. These are individuals who are in the  United States and could not return home because of disasters in their  home countries, whether by earthquakes or hurricanes or other events  that made it impossible to return home because their homes had been  destroyed or other circumstances had changed that made it impossible  for them to return. We, the United States of America, granted these  individuals temporary protected status. These are individuals who are  in the United States legally, and many of them have been here for over  two decades. In the case of El Salvador, we have most people who are  here from El Salvador on temporary protected status since the year  2000. They have families here. They are small business men and women,  and they are working productively in our communities. In the case of  Honduras, it was even earlier, 1998.   Senator Cardin and I and others have introduced legislation called  the SECURE Act, which would also provide security here in the United  States for these individuals on TPS status. Unfortunately, a series of  decisions coming down from the Trump administration has put the future  of these individuals in jeopardy.   The clock is also ticking on many of these people who have been here  for more than 20 years toward deportation. These are individuals who  are, again, working here legally and are contributing to our  communities. I believe that as Americans we should recognize that it is  important that we provide a secure future for them as well. That is why  we introduced the SECURE Act.   So I am hopeful that as we debate a secure future for the Dreamers,  we also find a way going forward to provide a secure future for those  who are here under TPS.   It seems to me that the answer is in plain sight. The answer is  making sure that Dreamers have a secure future, providing a path to  citizenship as long as they meet all of the requirements, and that we  ensure we have border security. I don't think there is a Senator in  this body who does not believe that the United States has to have  strong and secure borders. The debate has always been what is the  smartest, most effective, most cost-efficient way to provide for border  security.   I hope nobody is interested in wasting taxpayer dollars on things  that don't work. It seems to me that we should be about the business of  finding the most cost-effective way to ensuring that border security.  As we do that, we should be listening to the experts as to what works  and what does not work. Unfortunately, we have seen more focus in  recent months on things that cost a lot of money but don't really  significantly improve our border security. I am hoping that we can come  together and have a rational conversation about how we can secure our  borders in the most cost-effective way.   This is a moment for the Senate to really stand up and do its job. I  think if you look at those two issues--a path forward for the Dreamers  with a path toward citizenship for those who meet all the requirements  and that we find a way to do smart, cost-effective border security-- then, that is clearly the way forward. I do hope that as we consider  those two important priorities, we also come together and find a way  forward for people who are here on temporary protected status, because  in my conversations with Republican Senators, they recognize that for  these individuals--who are here legally, working in the country, and  having been here for an average of 20 years--we should find a way to  make sure they have a secure future here.   We may want to look at ways to reform TPS going forward, and we can  have that discussion, but for those who are here now and have been  living in the United States for decades and working, let's find a way  to provide a secure future for them as well. This is going to be a test  for the Senate--hopefully, in the coming days, but if not, in the  coming weeks, and I hope we can get the job done.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.   The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.   Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.   Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the motion  to proceed to H.R. 2579 be agreed to; that Senator Toomey or his  designee be recognized to offer amendment No. 1948 and that Senator  Coons or his designee be recognized to offer amendment No. 1955;  further, that the time until 8 p.m. be equally divided between the  leaders or their designees and that following the use or yielding back  of that time, the Senate vote on the amendments in the order listed,  with 60 affirmative votes required for adoption, and that no second- degree amendments be in order prior to the votes; finally, that if any  of the amendments are adopted, they become original text for the  purpose of further amendment.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?   The assistant Democratic leader.
