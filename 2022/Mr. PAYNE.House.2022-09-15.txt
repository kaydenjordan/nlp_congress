 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor New Jersey State  Senator Ronald L. Rice after his retirement on August 31 of this year.   Senator Rice served the people of New Jersey's 28th District for 36  years. He was the longest serving Black legislator in our State's  history.   Senator Rice was first elected to the Newark City Council in 1981.  Then, he was elected to the State Senate in 1986 and won reelection 11  times before he retired.   His service extended beyond politics. Senator Rice was a sergeant in  the Marine Corps and a decorated Vietnam veteran. He spent 8 years as a  police detective in the city of Newark and 4 years as its deputy mayor.   He was known for his strong support and advocacy for social justice  and civil rights. Recently, Newark renamed a street in his neighborhood  in his honor for his commitment and service to the city of Newark.   Mr. Speaker, I congratulate State Senator Ronald L. Rice on his  tremendous career as a public servant. His work for Newark and the  people of New Jersey will be missed. But I am sure this will not be the  last we hear from our hero and our fighter, Senator Ronald L. Rice.                            ____________________
