 Mr. President, today I want to discuss Russia's sustained  campaign of attacks on our democracy and how the President's inability  to take these threats seriously harms our national security and the  integrity of our elections.   In the run up to his meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin  this week at the G20 Summit, the President showed no signs that he  planned to warn Russia against interfering in our democratic elections  in 2020. In press interviews, he said that he ``may'' ask Putin not  interfere in 2020 and told another group of reporters, ``I will have a  very good conversation with him . . . what I say is none of your  business.''   Following today's meeting with Putin, an autocrat who continues to  conduct hybrid warfare operations against our democracy, President  Trump made light of this threat in a joking manner. In response to a  reporter's question, he apparently grinned as he told Putin, ``don't  meddle in our election.''   This is not a joke. This is about deterring the Kremlin from  continuing to attack our democracy. He should be using every tool at  his disposal to direct a whole of government and whole of society  effort to counter these attacks, not emboldening Putin to escalate his  aggression. It is exactly the business of the American people to know  that our elections are free from interference and that we can trust the  President of the United States to deliver tough messages to deter  foreign adversaries.   Relatedly the President can't seem to grasp what's wrong with  accepting ``dirt'' on his political opponents from foreign adversaries.  In a recent interview with ABC News, the President made it clear that  he sees nothing wrong with compromising our national security if it  advances his own political interests. When asked if his campaign would  accept information on his opponents from Russia, China, or other  countries during the 2020 campaign, the President responded: ``I think  you might want to listen . . . there's nothing wrong with listening.''   He denied that this type of assistance from a foreign adversary was  interference, adding: ``They have information. I think I'd take it.''  It was only after being heavily criticized that President Trump  reversed course, telling Fox and Friends ``Of course, you give it to  the FBI or report it to the attorney general or somebody like that . .  . You couldn't have that happen in our country.'' But, of course, it  already happened. President Trump's inability or unwillingness to  recognize it is both completely wrong-headed and dangerous.   The President's response belies the undeniable fact that Russia  attacked our democracy in the 2016 election with an information warfare  campaign, and tried to do it again in the 2018 midterms.   Trump initially made Russia's interference sound like run of the  mill, opposition research--``oppo research'' he called it--and claimed  everyone does it, but this is not about politics as usual. This is  about Russia advancing its strategic interests and using tools from its  hybrid arsenal, including information warfare and malign influence  operation, to do so. Russia seeks to inject itself into our political  process to achieve its goals of promoting the candidates favorable to  Russia and discrediting those that are not, weakening the American  public's faith in the integrity of democracy, and undermining the  United States' standing globally.   President Trump's failure to grasp that there is a problem with  someone in his high office--or any candidate for public office for that  matter--accepting dirt on political opponents from a foreign government  or national is troubling on many levels, but importantly, it harms our  national security. It undermines our ability as a nation to counter  Russia and other adversaries and our ability to protect our elections.  The President should be leading a comprehensive, meaningful approach to  deter Russia and others who seek to target our democracy. Instead, he  is announcing to the world that our elections are open to manipulation.   Some would have you believe that, with the release of the Mueller  report, the case of Russian interference in the 2016 election is  closed, that our work is done, and that Congress can stop caring about  the attack on our democracy and the integrity of our political system.  The White House, the Attorney General, and congressional Republican  leaders are sending a coordinated message that there is nothing to see  here, folks.   But no matter how they try, we can't forget that Russia attacked our  democracy in 2016, that Russia tried to do it again in 2018, and that  it continues to deploy hybrid operations against us, our allies, and  our partners. Just recently, a report issued by the European Union  concluded that Russia conducted ``continued and sustained'' information  warfare campaigns against the EU Parliamentary elections this spring.  We must continue to work to highlight these types of findings including  those made by the special counsel and their implications going forward.  As Special Counsel Mueller's powerful press statement from his  investigation underscored: ``there were multiple, systematic efforts to  interfere in our election.'' Mueller added, ``And that allegation  deserves the attention of every American.''   The special counsel' s report and related indictments described these  operations in great detail. Let's look specifically at key aspects of  the Russian information warfare campaign that the report laid out.   First, Mueller makes clear that Kremlin-linked operators sought to  help the candidate the Kremlin favored and whose election would serve  Russia's interests. The report describes how ``A Russian entity carried  out a social media campaign that favored presidential candidate Donald  J. Trump and disparaged presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.'' It  also found that ``[a]s early as 2014, the [Kremlin-linked Internet  Research Agency] instructed its employees to target U.S. persons who  could be used to advance its operational goals.''   Second, Mueller describes in detail the Russian spying operation to  steal ``dirt'' on the opposition candidate and then use that stolen  information against her. The report states unequivocally, ``[a] Russian  intelligence service conducted computer intrusion operations against  entities, employees and volunteers working on the Clinton Campaign and  then released stolen documents.''   Third, the Mueller established multiple contacts by Russian  Government officials or their proxies with the Trump campaign to  establish relationships. The report states: ``[t]he investigation also  established numerous links between the Russian government and the Trump  campaign.''   Finally, the Mueller report definitively concludes that Russia saw  its interests as aligned with and served by a Trump Presidency, that  Russia conducted a campaign to interfere in the 2016 election for the  purpose of helping the Trump campaign, and that the Trump campaign  hoped to benefit from the fruits of that foreign election interference.  Ultimately, however, the Mueller investigation could not prove beyond a  reasonable doubt that the Trump campaign or its associates conspired  with the Russian Government in its election interference.   As the report states: ``[a]lthough the investigation established that  the Russian government perceived it would benefit from a Trump  presidency and worked to secure that outcome, and that the Campaign  expected it would benefit electorally from information stolen and  released through Russian efforts, the investigation did not establish  that members of the Trump Campaign conspired or coordinated with  [[Page S4674]]  the Russian government in its election interference activities.''   As the special counsel's report details, Trump did not shy away and,  in fact, sought to benefit from help from Russia in the 2016 election.  Trump campaign associates, including his son, son-in law, and campaign  manager, met with Russian agents to hear potential dirt about Secretary  Clinton, which was presented to the Donald Trump, Jr. as ``part of  Russia and its government's support for Mr. Trump.'' Even in hindsight,  Trump said he most likely wouldn't have contacted the FBI about that  meeting, telling ABC News, ``I have seen a lot of things over my life.  I don't think in my whole life I've ever called the FBI. In my whole  life. You don't call the FBI.''   Think about that statement for a moment. Here is the President of the  United States, who has taken an oath to faithfully execute the laws of  the United States, declaring that people should not go to law  enforcement with evidence of foreign interference in our political  process.   But, of course, candidate Trump went further than simply not  reporting foreign attempts to influence our elections. The special  counsel detailed how Trump embraced the support of a foreign adversary  by calling on Russia to hack his political opponent and disseminate the  stolen information. On July 27, 2016, Trump announced publicly during a  press conference, ``Russia, if you are listening, I hope you're able to  find the 30,000 emails that are missing. I think you will be rewarded  mightily by our press.'' The Mueller report confirmed that a Russian  military intelligence unit, commonly referred to as the GRU, tried to  assist Trump with those efforts, finding, ``within approximately five  hours of Trump's statement, GRU officers targeted for the first time  Clinton's personal office.''   The special counsel also detailed how the Trump campaign ``showed  interest in WikiLeaks's releases of documents and welcomed their  potential to damage candidate Clinton.'' Furthermore, the Trump  campaign continued to promote WikiLeaks after it was apparent that  WikiLeaks was being used by the GRU to disseminate information stolen  by the Russians. On October 7, 2016, the Department of Homeland  Security and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence issued  a joint statement naming the WikiLeaks disclosures as ``consistent with  the Russian-directed efforts'' to influence public opinion. If not  prior to the release of that joint statement, certainly by that point  the President and his campaign should have known better. Instead of  calling the FBI, the Trump campaign strategized how to benefit from  Russia's stolen information. The Mueller report states: ``by the late  summer of 2016, the Trump Campaign was planning a press strategy, a  communications campaign, and messaging based on the possible release of  Clinton emails by WikiLeaks.'' A related indictment from the special  counsel detailed how the Trump campaign applauded WikiLeaks's release  of John Podesta's emails starting on October 7, 2016. In the last month  of the campaign alone, the President publicly boasted of his love of  WikiLeaks at least 124 times.   As I mentioned, the special counsel did not find sufficient evidence  to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the Trump campaign's embracing  of the benefits of Kremlin or Kremlin-linked operations constituted a  crime. But is it okay for a candidate to get elected President, or  elected to any public office, by capitalizing on information stolen by  a foreign adversary? Will that be acceptable the next time around? Will  foreign information warfare campaigns targeting our elections be  accepted as normal from now on?   Based on his public remarks, it certainly seems acceptable to  President Trump and his defenders. This is not theoretical. It happened  in 2016. Now the President put it out there that he would meet with  foreign adversaries again in the 2020 campaign to hear what information  they have on his opponents. He is emboldened to do it again. While, as  I mentioned, he later changed his position, it still leaves room for  doubt about his true intentions and invites our adversaries to try and  compromise our election. Trump publicly undermined his own FBI  Director, Christopher Wray, who testified in front of the Senate that,  ``If any public official or member of any campaign is contacted by any  nation-state or anybody acting on behalf of a nation-state about  influencing or interfering with our election, then that's something  that the FBI would want to know about it.''   When asked about Wray's testimony, President Trump bluntly said ``The  FBI Director is wrong.'' Trump's statements were so disturbing that the  FEC Commissioner responded by saying ``Let me make something 100% clear  to the American public and anyone running for public office: It is  illegal for any person to solicit, accept, or receive anything of value  from a foreign national in connection with a U.S. election. This is not  a novel concept.''   The President's actions also clearly aided ongoing Russian  information warfare operations. This is not the standard of conduct and  the public trust that goes with political office. The willingness to  embrace a foreign adversary in this fashion is unpatriotic and defies  the basic norms of this Nation.   The Trump campaign's series of foreign contacts in the 2016 election  and the President's continued willingness to accept assistance from a  foreign government make it clear that Congress must act to prevent  future interference efforts. That is why I am a cosponsor of the  Foreign Influence Reporting in Elections Act, or FIRE Act, introduced  by Senator Warner. The FIRE Act would require all campaign officials to  report, within 1 week, any contacts with foreign nationals attempting  to make campaign donations or otherwise collaborate with the campaign  to the Federal Election Commission. The FEC would in turn have to  notify the FBI within 1 week. It is in all our interest to ensure that  we can defend against foreign attacks on our democratic institutions  and reporting these kinds of contacts to the appropriate authorities is  our first line of defense. I am disappointed that my Republican  colleagues blocked Senator Warner's attempt to pass the FIRE Act, even  after many of them insisted that politicians should contact the FBI if  ever contacted or offered help by a foreign government.   This is not a Democratic or a Republican issue. This is an issue of  our national security and the integrity of our free and fair elections.  Russia exploited vulnerabilities in our open society to advance its own  interests and the Russian tactics were encouraged and amplified by a  candidate who was seeking our nation's highest office. We have every  indication that the Russians are poised to do it again, and the  President has shown time and again--including today for the world to  see--that he doesn't see anything wrong with foreign interference if it  works to his advantage.   We cannot let this moment pass without speaking up for the integrity  of our democracy and our values. Congress, as a body, and we, as a  country, must speak out and say this is not acceptable. It is not  acceptable for our candidates for political office to seek to engage  with our adversaries or foreign authoritarian regimes to advance their  political campaigns. It is not acceptable to meet with foreign agents  about getting stolen information on your opponents, information  acquired by foreign espionage. This is a violation of the public trust  that is inherent in any political office and which any candidate for  public office must uphold to be worthy of the American people's  support. I urge my colleagues to speak out in condemning this conduct  for the sake of our democracy and to preserve the American people's  faith in the integrity of our electoral system.                            ____________________     Mr. President, veterans who have become disabled during  their service to our Nation should have their student loans forgiven  without delay, without cumbersome red tape. Unfortunately, that is not  the case today, which is why I am introducing legislation with my  colleague from Georgia, Senator Isakson, to require the Department of  Education to automatically discharge student loans for veterans who are  totally and permanently disabled.   In the fall of 2018, the Department of Education and the Department  of Veterans Affairs announced a data-matching program under which the  Department of Veterans Affairs would disclose data to the Department of  Education concerning veterans who are determined to be 100 percent  disabled or individually unemployable. The Department of Education  would then alert eligible veterans with Federal student loans of the  opportunity to apply for debt relief.   This initiative was an important step forward in improving the  process for disabled veterans, but it did not go far enough. Too many  eligible veterans are still saddled with student loans that they cannot  repay. This spring, in response to hearing questions, the Department of  Education reported that of the over 40,000 veterans who were identified  as eligible for loan forgiveness through the matching program, fewer  than half submitted the required paperwork and, as a result, have not  had their loans forgiven. Many of these individuals are currently in  default on their loans, which has dire financial repercussions for them  and their families.   We can and must do better. As many Members of Congress have urged,  along with veterans' service organizations, and 51 bipartisan State  attorneys general, we should automatically discharge the loans for  eligible veteran student loan borrowers identified through the matching  program. Previously, concern about potential tax liability was  identified as a reason for not moving forward on automatic discharge of  these loans. However, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 removed the  Federal tax liability, and we should now move forward without delay to  automatically forgive these loans.   Our legislation requires the Departments of Education and Veterans  Affairs to conduct a computer matching at least twice per year of  individuals with student loans who have received a rating of total  disability or who have been determined to be unemployable. It also  requires the Departments to work together to address minor  discrepancies in the data to ensure that no veteran falls through the  cracks due to a clerical error. Finally, it requires the Department of  Education to automatically discharge student loans for individuals  identified as eligible through the matching program, unless the  borrower opts out because the Department has identified a potential  State tax liability.   We are proud to have the support of many veterans' organizations for  this legislation, including High Ground Advocacy, Iraq and Afghanistan  Veterans of America, Student Veterans of America, The Retired Enlisted  Association, Veterans Education Success, and U.S. Army Warrant Officers  Association. I urge all my colleagues to join us in cosponsoring this  legislation and pushing for its swift passage. Veterans who have served  our nation and are now unable to work because of a service-connected  disability should not have to worry about student loan payments.                            ____________________     Mr. President, veterans who have become disabled during  their service to our Nation should have their student loans forgiven  without delay, without cumbersome red tape.
