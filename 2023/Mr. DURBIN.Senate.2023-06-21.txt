 Mr. President, today the Senate will vote to confirm  Natasha Merle to the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of  New York. She is a highly skilled litigator who has practiced at  virtually every level of the legal system. Ms. Merle received her  undergraduate degree from the University of Texas at Austin and her law  degree from New York University School of Law. She then completed two  Federal clerkships, one in the Southern District of New York and  another in the Eastern District of New York. Following her clerkships,  Ms. Merle devoted her early career to representing indigent clients,  particularly as an assistant Federal public defender. She has also  spent time in private practice, where she represented individuals,  companies, and financial institutions in commercial litigation.   Since 2016, Ms. Merle has worked at the NAACP Legal Defense and  Educational Fund, where she has devoted her practice to ensuring equal  justice under law. She has also taught at two of the Nation's top law  schools: Columbia Law School, as a lecturer in law, and New York  University School of Law, as an adjunct professor of clinical law. Ms.  Merle has significant experience in the courtroom at both the trial and  appellate levels. She has litigated in State and Federal court on both  civil and criminal matters, practiced before the U.S. Supreme Court,  and successfully argued an appeal before the California Supreme Court.  Ms. Merle's deep expertise, diversity of experience, and commitment to  public service will make her an outstanding addition to the Eastern  District of New York.   The American Bar Association rated Ms. Merle ``well qualified,'' and  she has the strong support of her home state Senators, Mr. Schumer and  Mrs. Gillibrand. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting Ms.  Merle's nomination.    Madam President, let me first salute my colleague from  the State of Washington. She has really shown extraordinary leadership  on this  [[Page S2167]]  and so many other issues. She asked us to gather today, on the first  anniversary of the Dobbs decision, to really reflect on what has  happened to America in 12 months.   I am saying that 2 months ago the Senate Judiciary Committee, which I  chair, held a hearing on the devastating consequences of the Dobbs  decision on the women and doctors who are affected by it. We did it 2  months ago because the news was pouring in of incidents which had to be  told and shared with the American people. Growing reports of chaos and  harm caused by that decision are so alarming that we decided to move up  our fact-finding to 2 months ago.   There was one witness I will never forget. One of the people we heard  from that day was Amanda Zurawski. She shared some of the most  heartbreaking testimony I have ever heard, and I have heard a lot.   Last August, in the second trimester of her pregnancy, Amanda  suffered a catastrophic medical condition which ensured that she would  lose her much loved and much longed-for baby. What is more, without  medical care to help manage her miscarriage, Amanda was in grave risk  of dying herself. But she was denied that medical care for one reason-- she lived in the wrong place--because Amanda Zurawski lived in Texas,  which was one of the first States to impose a near-total ban of  abortions after Roe v. Wade was overruled. So Amanda waited at home, in  agony, for days. Then sepsis set in. Her husband rushed her to the  hospital. Hours later, her daughter arrived stillborn. Amanda spent the  next 3 days in the ICU, fighting for her own life.   Amanda told our committee:         People have asked why we didn't get on a plane or in our       car to go to a state where the laws aren't so restrictive.       But we live in the middle of Texas, and the nearest       ``sanctuary'' state is at least an eight-hour drive.       Developing sepsis--which can kill [very] quickly--in a car in       the middle of the West Texas desert, or 30,000 feet above the       ground, is a death sentence. . . . So all we could do was       wait.    This was Amanda's first baby. Tragically, because of the trauma her  body endured, she may never have another.   And she is not alone. This is happening to women across America.  Every day brings us another heartbreaking story of a woman who is  denied healthcare, another story of a woman whose life was needlessly  put at risk by the Dobbs decision.   According to a new survey, nearly two-thirds of OB/GYNs say the Dobbs  ruling has worsened maternal mortality rates in the United States,  which were already the worst of any developed nation, and 70 percent of  these doctors say the ruling has deepened racial disparities in  maternal and infant healthcare. These findings are from a survey  released this week by KFF, known as Kaiser Family Foundation.    The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the AMA  both warned that the Dobbs case would unleash an immediate healthcare  crisis in our country. With the first anniversary of this ruling, those  warnings, sadly, have come true.   Just 100 days after the Dobbs decision, 22 million Americans of  reproductive age--almost one out of every three women in America--found  themselves living in States where abortion is now illegal or highly  restricted. Abortion is now completely banned in 14 States, leaving  large swaths of the country without care. Some statewide bans include  jail time for healthcare providers who perform abortions. And make no  mistake: Unless we act, more and more severe restrictions are coming.   The last year has exposed the true aim of the anti-choice extremists.  They want a national ban. Medication abortions account for more than  half of all abortions in America. More than 20 years ago, the Food and  Drug Administration approved the drug mifepristone as safe and  effective for use in medication abortions. Yet anti-abortion groups are  now seeking in Federal court to ban its use in every State in America.   The impact of abortion restrictions in any State are felt well beyond  that State's borders. In my State, largely as a consequence of near- total bans in many surrounding States, the number of abortions  performed by Planned Parenthood in Illinois increased by 54 percent  last year. That increase was driven largely by women from out of State  seeking access to abortion that is now outlawed in their home States.  As a result, wait times to obtain abortions have increased dramatically  in our State.   In addition, some anti-choice extremists are seeking to deny women's  right to abortions through increased threats and violence against  abortion clinics.   We saw this recently in Illinois, when a man rammed his car into a  building that was being renovated to serve as an abortion clinic in the  Danville area. He also tried to set fire to the clinic; but,  thankfully, he was stopped.   According to the National Abortion Federation, last year saw a huge  increase in violence at abortion clinics, and a disproportionate  increase occurred in States like Illinois that protected women's rights  to reproductive care.   Personal decisions about healthcare should be made by individuals and  their doctors, not by politicians with an ideological agenda. That is  why I strongly support the four measures that my Democratic colleagues  have offered to today to protect women's rights to travel to receive  healthcare, protect patients' data privacy, protect healthcare  providers' ability to provide abortions in States where it is legal,  and protect the right to contraception. It is hard to imagine that in  2023, we are actually facing the prospect of losing a woman's right to  contraception, as well as access to reproductive healthcare.   The Dobbs ruling has sown chaos, fear, and division. It has usurped  doctors' rights to make the best healthcare decisions for their  patients. Doctors live in fear of these new laws, whether they include  criminal liability for what was good medical practice and still is.  They have stripped women of their right to make healthcare decisions  and given the power to politicians. It is now up to Congress to protect  women and healthcare providers from the results of this disastrous  ruling.   (Mr. OSSOFF assumed the Chair.)   Mr. President, you were at the Judiciary Committee today. We had a  hearing on LGBTQ rights, and there was some extraordinary testimony. A  16-year-old came to us who has gone through a change to her status.  This young woman, 16 years of age, explained how she realized at the  age of 10 or 11 that she was really inclined toward being a woman and  not a man. She sought counseling, through her understanding parents,  sat down with doctors, and they began working through the psychology of  that decision, the importance of it.   Fortunately for her--and she testified--her parents were supportive  of her all the way. We were lucky to have Dr. Ximena Lopez at the  hearing as well. She practices medicine in Texas. She is an  endocrinologist who treats patients just like this young 16-year-old  girl.   She disabused us of many of the myths which are outstanding when it  comes to healthcare for those who are in a trans situation. No, there  are no surgeries early in life on these children who are making this  decision. Yes, medications are held back until puberty to make sure  that they are doing the right thing at the right time. Yes, parents are  consulted every step of the way.   These are important and critical decisions which parents and families  make every day across America. Every day. They are decisions based on  the advice of a doctor, as well as what is right for your child. They  are decisions that parents will never forget. I know; I have been  involved in them. And they are decisions which really would determine  the future lives and the well-being of so many individuals.   To think that so many legislatures across the United States are now  regulating and putting criminal penalties on the conduct of that doctor  who was before us today is heartbreaking. It defies medicine. It defies  science. It is politics, pure and simple. The same thing is true on  this issue of women's reproductive healthcare.   We have got to leave these basic decisions, fundamental decisions, to  the families who are affected by them directly, to the women who are  affected by them directly. We have got to say to the doctors across  America: Follow the science. Practice good medicine. Don't let a local  legislature divert you from the best treatment of your patient to make  sure that they come out of this process in a very positive way.  [[Page S2168]]    It is a sad moment in America that we are debating these things and  debating whether or not to rely on sound medical judgment. In the end,  that is the only thing we can count on.   I am glad that we had the hearing today, and I am glad that we  gathered on the floor to make a record out of what is happening in our  great Nation.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  consider the following nominations: all nominations placed on the  Secretary's desk in the Air Force, Army, Marine Corps, Navy, and Space  Force; that the nominations be confirmed en bloc; that the motions to  reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no  intervening action or debate; that no further motions be in order to  any of the nominations; and that the President be immediately notified  of the Senate's action.
