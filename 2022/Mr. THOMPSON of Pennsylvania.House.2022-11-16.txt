 Mr. Speaker, every few weeks, we read  headlines of another crisis: baby formula; fertilizer; and now another  important input, diesel fuel.   This administration not only continues to turn a blind eye but  perpetuates harmful policies that worsen these crises.   From day one, President Biden has launched a war on American energy,  and now it must end. Through executive actions, the Biden  administration paused domestic production of oil while limiting and  disincentivizing investments in American energy infrastructure and  refining capacity.   On his very first day in office, President Biden canceled the  Keystone XL pipeline, thus declaring war on our domestic energy  production. Seven days later, he paused new oil and gas leasing on  public lands and offshore waters. Then, in November 2021, the EPA  proposed new source performance methane standards on the oil and  natural gas industry, tying the hands of smaller producers.  [[Page H8512]]    Just last week, at COP 27, President Biden doubled down on this  proposal and announced even more burdensome requirements on U.S. oil  and gas sources. Meanwhile, Americans were pumping away their paychecks  as prices for gas and home heating skyrocketed.   This administration needs to refocus its priorities by increasing  domestic energy production, expediting pipeline permitting, and  abandoning burdensome rulemakings that are harming American  agriculture.   Let's face facts. America's farm families and consumers have  struggled with fractured supply chains, skyrocketing input costs, and  historic levels of inflation, economic woes exacerbated by  congressional Democrats' excessive spending and the Biden  administration's burdensome regulatory agenda. Under this  administration, farm production expenses are up nearly $80 billion, led  by an 84 percent, or $21 billion, increase in fertilizer expenses and a  65 percent increase in fuel expenses.   As the Biden administration's self-inflicted energy crisis surges  into a diesel shortage, they continually pass the buck by blaming  domestic energy producers.   Further, Biden's regulatory assault destroys any incentive for  domestic energy producers to invest in energy infrastructure, which  worsens energy market volatility and increases costs for vital farm  inputs such as diesel fuel and fertilizer.   In October 2022, EIA reported the distillate fuel oil inventory at  106 million. This is the lowest stock since 2008; the lowest stock for  this time of the year since 1982; and, in some regions, the lowest  inventory since 1950.   Diesel fuel is used every day to power farm and ranch equipment and  deliver goods to the marketplace. This Biden-inflicted diesel crisis  further exacerbates record inflation, skyrocketing farm input costs,  and consumer prices. The national average price for diesel fuel per  gallon is $5.36 a gallon, an increase of $1.71, or 50 percent, from  this time just last year.   By gambling away American energy and resource independence in the  name of climate change, the Biden administration has harmed the very  industry, U.S. agriculture, that contributes to 13 percent of the  annual greenhouse gas sequestration.   Just this past summer, President Biden went to the Saudis and begged  OPEC+ to increase production. Instead of relying on our adversaries and  asking them to produce more, we should be focused on the responsible  development of America's own abundant natural resources.   Mr. Speaker, Republicans have solutions focused on reversing  industry-crushing regulations and market signals, unleashing production  of crude oil, streamlining permitting and environmental review  processes, and restoring refining capacity.   We must reverse this self-inflected crisis and unleash our domestic  energy production.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I rise today to  congratulate the Kiwanis Club of Clarion, Pennsylvania, on their 100th  anniversary.
