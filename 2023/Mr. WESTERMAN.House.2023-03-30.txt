 Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Chair, this amendment says that the sense of Congress is that the  royalty rates should be 12\1/2\ percent, which was the royalty rate  before the very misleading and misnamed bill, the Inflation Reduction  Act, was passed by my colleagues on the left.   We all know that it wasn't an Inflation Reduction Act, and they  publicly call it their climate bill. President Biden has called it the  climate bill.   The increase in the royalty rates was simply another way to attack  our energy resources here in America. The Democrats know that. The  Biden administration knows that. The officials in the Biden  administration know that.   In a bill that they call the Inflation Reduction Act, they actually  increased inflation by passing a law to say we are going to raise the  costs of energy off of Federal lands. It didn't take the market to do  it. It was done by the law passed by my colleagues across the aisle.   If you don't believe what I am saying, take the word of the Biden  administration. Earlier this month, the Biden administration confirmed  this fact in a leaked Bureau of Ocean Energy Management memo on Cook  Inlet Lease Sale 258. This is in response to BOEM trying to do an 18\3/ 4\ percent rate, trying to put the highest rate they could on this  sale. The memo reads: ``A 16-2/3 percent royalty may be more likely to  facilitate expeditious and orderly development of OCS resources and  potentially offer greater energy security.''   The Biden administration knows this. They know that the lower the  royalty rate, the more likely we will have energy security and the more  likely we will develop our resources.   They choose to use the highest rate possible to do everything they  can to attack American energy, to attack American jobs. It is putting  Russia and OPEC over the American people because we are still going to  use energy. We are not using less energy. We are just using it from  different sources.   Laws like this that were passed on a partisan basis last Congress,  that were signed into law by the Biden administration, simply put these  bad actors over the American people.   It is time we lower energy costs, pass the Lower Energy Costs Act,  and pass it with this great amendment by my friend from Tennessee. I  support the amendment.    Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I thank  the ranking member and appreciate bipartisan support on this very  important amendment.   I think this is a sign that we are making progress. This is a sign  that America is coming together to stand up against the Chinese  Communist Party. We need to stand up not only against them but we need  to continue standing up against Russia, against OPEC.   That is what H.R. 1 does. It is a bold step in the right direction,  and this is a small part of it. I commend the gentleman from Tennessee  for crafting this amendment and for getting it made in order.   I support the amendment for a very good reason: We simply cannot let  the Chinese Communist Party continue to dominate and take control of  not only mineral supply chains but energy supply chains as they are  trying to make a move in that area as well, where they are cozying up  with the Saudis. They are working with Russia to buy the oil and gas  that we have banned from there.   Their objective is dominance. They have made great strides in the  minerals area, and they are working very hard to do that in energy.   The way we push back against China and the CCP is we produce our  energy and minerals here, and we, for sure, don't let China come to  America and own any kind of lease on Federal lands or private lands. We  produce it ourselves. We send it to our allies.   There was a delegation recently in Germany, and the message they  brought back from Germany was gas equals peace. They want us to send  them our gas, and we have ample supplies of it.   We just need the pipelines. We need the ports. We need the LNG  facilities. We need the vessels to send gas to Europe that is much  cleaner than the gas they are getting from Russia. It will help bring  peace in Europe if they can get more of our energy here.   Mr. Chair, I again commend the gentleman, and I support the  amendment.                                time  0930     Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania for  bringing this amendment that makes very clear a stark reality that we  don't need the China Communist Party. America does not need the CCP.   They need us to buy the goods they are producing. They need us to buy  the minerals that they are mining out of mines they have developed with  child slave labor in Africa. They need us to buy the stuff they are  producing with slave labor in China.   But we don't need them, and we sure don't need their money here.   I appreciate the ranking member realizing that. I appreciate that the  people are speaking. The House of Representatives is the voice of the  people, and I believe this is how America feels.   But we need to go further. We need to put actions to our words. We  need to show the CCP that America is strong, that we have our own  resources, that we can develop these resources better than they can  develop them. We can put these resources out on the world market.   Instead of being dependent on others, we can be the ones exporting  our goods, growing wealth and jobs here and being a deterrent to the  spread of communism, the spread of dictatorships, and all of those  things that we as Americans deplore.   At the end of the day, this is about freedom and about promoting  those values that our country was founded on.   Mr. Chairman, again, I support this amendment. I appreciate the  gentleman bringing it.    Mr. Chair, again, I thank the gentleman from  Pennsylvania for yielding. I do rise in support of this amendment.   H.R. 1 would allow non-Federal entities to provide money to certain  Federal agencies to improve permitting efficiency. This good-governance  amendment, offered by my friend from Pennsylvania, would require the  Secretaries who accept this money to report on where it came from and  how much was provided.   I think there is some confusion about the intent of what is in H.R. 1  about speeding up permitting. Mr. Chair, before I came to Congress, I  did engineering work for over two decades. I am a professional  engineer, so I worked on a lot of projects where permits were required.  Fortunately, we were working with State permitting agencies, and we  would hear the same argument from the State permitting agencies: We  don't have enough resources and enough people to do these permits. It  is going to take longer.   A lot of States have programs where they allow the entity trying to  attain the permit to pay money to the agency so their employees can  work overtime. It is really a way to increase the resources and get  more out of the resources. It is not degrading the environmental  protections at all. It is just moving the process forward at a faster  rate.   That is what the intent of H.R. 1 is: to move permitting at a faster  clip so we can build all kinds of energy; so we can build solar farms  and windmills and high-voltage transmission lines; so we can build  pipelines; so we can extract minerals and resources here in America. We  can process those and we can manufacture things from them.   This is important to making our country a leader in the world by  overcoming the position we are in with China on minerals and the  position we are in with Russia and OPEC.   Mr. Chair, I support the underlying principle in the bill, and I  support the good-governance amendment by my friend from Pennsylvania.                                time  0945     Mr. Chair, I rise in support of this amendment. As we  know, this bill is about permitting streamlining, including for  domestic mineral projects.   The underlying bill allows for mining projects that have received  funding under the Defense Production Act to be placed on the existing  FAST-41 permitting dashboard.   My colleague's amendment states that mineral projects that contribute  to certain technologies, such as electric vehicles, cannot be placed  over and above other mined projects.   This amendment also supports responsible deployment of funds under  the Defense Production Act.   Mineral production is vital to our national security, and H.R. 1  creates multiple opportunities to streamline the process for mineral  development.   Mr. Chair, I recognize at this time the Natural Resources Committee  staff who worked tirelessly to advance H.R. 1, the Lower Energy Costs  Act.   I thank Ashley Nichols, Rebecca Konolige, Rob MacGregor, Tom  Connally, Chris Marklund, Rebekah Hoshiko, Madeline Bryant, Kiel  Weaver, Aniela Butler, Murray Miller, Sophia Varnasidis, Will King,  Nancy Peele, and Vivian Moeglein.   I also thank the Members of the Republican Conference and their staff  for all the work that they have put into this legislation. This has  really been a team effort to get this bill to the floor in a record  amount of time to address an issue that is very prevalent in our  country: to lower energy costs, to make America energy independent, to  increase our national security, to break supply chains on China, and to  make America be the leader of the world in the future.   H.R. 1 is the first step to that, and we should be proud to have put  it on the floor.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment and to  support the underlying bill.    Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the Clerk  be authorized to make technical corrections in the engrossment of H.R.  1, to include corrections in spelling, punctuation, section numbering  and cross-referencing, and the insertion of appropriate headings.    Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that when the  House adjourns today, it adjourn to meet at 2 p.m. on Monday next.
