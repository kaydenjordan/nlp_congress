 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   No one loved Nashville, Tennessee, more than our friend and colleague  John Robert Lewis.   As a young man, he arrived in Nashville on a bus with a ticket  purchased by the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Dr. King wanted  young John to attend American Baptist College.   For anyone wondering how to honor John Lewis and his legacy, think of  his alma mater, American Baptist, and remember also the historically  Black college and university that he later attended, Fisk University.  If you want more John Lewises in the world, think of his beloved  training grounds, American Baptist and Fisk.
