 Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chair, I rise in support of H.R. 1973, the Protecting Young  Victims from Sexual Abuse Act, for several reasons.   Most importantly, this is a reasonable bill and is intended to help  protect young athletes from abuse and preserve the sanctity of sports  associated with the U.S. Olympic Committee, the organization  responsible for preparing and training young athletes who might one day  represent their country competitively all over the world.    Children deserve to fully enjoy the innocence of their youth--by  exploring the curiosities of the world, taking pleasure in the arts,  and participating in sports--free from hurt, harm, or danger.   Involvement in sports, and instruction and guidance from adult  coaches, can positively influence a young person's growth and  development, as well as his or her potential for future success into  adulthood.   The sexual abuse of children and youth is intolerable in any text,  and we must take appropriate measures to eliminate it from youth  sports. Such exploitation betrays and harms young people, sometimes  severely and irreparably.   Young people look to adults to protect them and keep them safe. We  all have a responsibility to do so.   With H.R. 1973, we have an opportunity to ensure that individuals  abide by this duty. Existing Federal law requires certain  professionals, such as  [[Page H4576]]  doctors, dentists, social workers, psychologists, teachers, and daycare  workers, who regularly interact with children, to report suspected  abuse to law enforcement.   While our discussion of this legislation today may focus primarily on  sexual abuse, H.R. 1973 will require adults who interact with young  athletes, in connection to national governing bodies of various sports,  to report suspected abuse of any kind.   The need for this legislation is best illustrated by an ongoing  scandal of widespread abuse and exploitation of young gymnasts over the  course of 20 years within USA Gymnastics, a prominent governing body of  the U.S. Olympic Committee.   Many complaints of sexual and emotional abuse went unreported,  allowing coaches, instructors, and doctors to repeatedly victimize  gymnasts as young as 6 years old. The shocking failure of anyone to  report accusations through law enforcement, or even keep track of  complaints internally, made it possible for some of these predators to  commit horrific acts at several gyms in several states.   For example, a cloud of allegations of abuse surrounded one  particular physician in Michigan going back as far as 1997.  Regrettably, allegations against him were not reported to law  enforcement until recently. Following the first public complaint  against him in 2015, more than 100 women have filed complaints accusing  him of sexual abuse, and he now faces more than 20 criminal charges in  both Federal and State courts.   While the USA Gymnastics scandal is unfortunate, let it be an example  and incentive to prevent such pervasive abuse elsewhere.   Accordingly, I encourage my colleagues to join me and my chairman in  supporting this important legislation.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Frankel).    Mr. Chair, I yield the gentlewoman an additional 2  minutes.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to yield 5 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee), the ranking member on the  prime subcommittee on the House Judiciary Committee.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Chair, let me close by saying that protecting young victims from  sexual abuse is a necessary measure that will help ensure that young  athletes in this country are able to pursue their athletic dreams in a  safe environment and free of exploitation and abuse.   This bill imposes an affirmative duty on coaches, trainers,  instructors, doctors, and the like to protect the young athletes who  have been entrusted to their tutelage. This bill establishes remedies  for those who might be harmed, and this bill mandates training and  oversight to encourage compliance, vigilance, and protection.   I thank Chairman Goodlatte for facilitating the prompt consideration  of this bill, and the Judiciary Committee. I also want to recognize the  leadership of Senator Feinstein, the ranking member of the Senate  Judiciary Committee, who authored the Senate version of this bill and  who has been the leading voice in Congress in demanding we address  these issues.   Finally, I note that this important bipartisan legislation is  supported by many advocacy groups including the National Center for  Missing & Exploited Children; the National Children's Alliance; the  National Center for Victims of Crime; Rape, Abuse & Incest National  Network; and the United States Olympic Committee, as well as several of  its national governing bodies.   For the foregoing reasons, I urge all of my colleagues to join me in  supporting H.R. 1973, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition, although I do  not oppose the bill or the amendment.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise in support of the amendment offered by the gentleman and point  out that this amendment addresses the provisions in the bill concerning  one-on-one interactions between young athletes and the adults who work  with them.   The existing version of the bill requires the national governing  bodies instruct coaches, instructors, doctors, and the like to avoid  one-on-one situations with the young athletes that cannot be observed  or interrupted by another adult. Under the proposed change, national  governing bodies will be required to institute and enforce reasonable  procedures designed to avoid one-on-one interactions between young  athletes and their coaches, instructors, and doctors that cannot be  observed or interrupted by another adult.   Mr. Goodlatte's amendment also harmonizes language used in the bill  with language in the underlying statute and makes technical and  conforming changes.   I support this amendment and the changes it makes to enhance H.R.  1973, and I look forward to further discussions of these provisions  with the Senate, with the goal of producing a consensus bill for  enactment.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume,  and rise in opposition to this bill.   Mr. Speaker, this bill restructures section 2251 of title 18 of the  United States Code as apparently requested by the unit at the  Department of Justice that enforces the laws against child pornography.   H.R. 1761 is intended to address limitations in the prosecution of  cases pursuant to section 2251, as identified by the Department.    While we all agree that no child pornography offense should go  unpunished, we cannot overlook the consequences of mandatory minimum  sentencing.   Section 2251(a) prohibits the use of a child to produce child  pornography and related conduct, including overseas production and  advertising child pornography.   Pursuant to this bill, two new offenses would be added to this  section to prohibit the production of child pornography and the  transmission of live depictions of a child engaged in sexually explicit  conduct, such as live-streaming abuse online.   This measure would also modify the existing offense that prohibits  having a minor assist in sexually explicit conduct for the purpose of  producing or transmitting child pornography. As amended, this offense  would prohibit  [[Page H4584]]  having a minor assist in sexually explicit conduct that violates each  of the three newly enumerated production offenses, except the  transportation of a minor for use in child pornography production.   In addition, it would amend the prohibition against the production of  child pornography abroad to forbid the live transmission of child  pornography produced abroad.   The jurisdictional requirement for each of the offenses enumerated in  section 2251, except the production of child pornography abroad, would  be codified in a separate subsection. Other portions of the bill would  be modified to follow the restructure of the statute for consistency.   Unfortunately, current law sets forth a series of mandatory minimum  terms of imprisonment for production of child pornography offenses.  First-time offenses are punishable by mandatory imprisonment of at  least 15 years; offenders with a prior conviction face mandatory  imprisonment for at least 25 years; and offenders with two or more  prior convictions must be sentenced to imprisonment of at least 35  years.   By modifying and expanding section 2251 to include several new ways  in which to violate the prohibition against the production of child  pornography, the bill would subject new classes of defendants to  mandatory minimum sentences. Although the bill does not establish new  mandatory minimum sentences, it would--in this way--expand the  application of the existing mandatory minimums, which I oppose.   Mandatory minimums have been studied extensively and found to distort  rational sentencing systems, discriminate against minorities, waste  taxpayers' money, and violate common sense. Under mandatory minimum  sentences, regardless of the nature and circumstances surrounding the  offense, the role of the offender in the particular crime, and the  history and characteristics of the offender, a judge must impose a  sentence set by the legislature.   Even if everyone involved in a case--from the arresting officer,  prosecutor, and judge to the victim--believes that the mandatory  minimum would be an unjust sentence for a particular defendant in a  case, it still must be imposed. Mandatory minimum sentences are the  wrong way to determine punishment under this or any other statute.   During the Judiciary Committee's consideration of this bill, the  committee rejected an amendment that would have eliminated the  applicable mandatory minimums in the current statute but would still  have allowed judges to sentence these offenders to lengthy sentences up  to the existing statutory maximums.   Because those changes were not made, the bill continues to present  problems with mandatory minimums.   Accordingly, Mr. Speaker, I must oppose this legislation, and I  reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1030     Mr. Speaker, I now yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. Scott).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from Texas.    Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I yield myself  the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, the Members of the House cannot rely on prospective  discretion to protect juveniles under this statute. We simply can't  rely on it, participate in, given the new policy of the Attorney  General. We are under a new regime here at the Federal level, and I  can't depend on relying on the prosecutorial discretion to protect  juveniles under this statute.   Mr. Speaker, I believe this bill is well intended, and I share my  colleagues' desire to protect children from being victimized by their  depiction in pornography. However, I also believe that we must address  the serious problem presented by the bill, namely, that it would expand  the application of the existing array of mandatory minimum sentences  that the code provides for these offenses.   This aspect of H.R. 1761 directly conflicts with the growing  bipartisan realization that mandatory minimums are unjust and unwise;  this is so even for egregious offenses for which judges should be  allowed to impose sentences--often severe and even beyond the  minimums--based on the facts and circumstances of each case. I want to  leave it up to the judges.   In considering legislation to better protect our children from the  types of exploitation addressed by this bill, we must not ignore the  sentencing implications of these revisions to the statute. In light of  the bill's failure to address these serious concerns, I oppose H.R.  1761 and urge my colleagues to do likewise.   We should consider even stronger legislation that addresses all these  concerns. We are not through with the subject matter by this bill  coming before us today. There is more work to be done. I thank my  colleagues for this very important discussion.  [[Page H4587]]    Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman and congratulate  her on this very important amendment.   This amendment creates alternative sentencing specifically for  teenagers who participate in sexting and could, as a result of this  bill and the application of current mandatory minimum sentences, be  subject to mandatory sentences of at least 15 years. We should not, as  she has already stated so well, leave it to prosecutors to determine  whether teenagers take part in teenage behavior.    Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.
