 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Fulbright  Program, enacted in 1946 and sponsored by then-Senator J. William  Fulbright, who represented my home State of Arkansas.   This exceptionally American contribution to the world has educated  over 360,000 students from 165 countries, including 52 Nobel laureates  and 31 heads of state.   Every year, Fulbright scholarships are given to more than 2,500  Americans, from all backgrounds and in all stages of life, the chance  to spend time abroad and gain a global perspective on today's most  important issues.   Two years ago, I had the opportunity to plant a tree on the Capitol  Grounds in honor of the 70th anniversary of the Fulbright Program and  its Arkansas roots. This program has funded the academic pursuits of  countless American and international scholars while building economic  prosperity and promoting America's respect for freedom, the rule of  law, and our democratic values.   The Fulbright Program has my support, and all of our citizens should  encourage this uniquely American mission of friendship.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Colorado for the time,  and I appreciate the opportunity today to be on the House floor to talk  about H.R. 5636, the Flatside Wilderness Enhancement Act, to preserve  the wilderness areas for future generations of Arkansans.   On October 19, 1984, President Ronald Reagan signed into law the  Arkansas Wilderness Act, which set aside the first wilderness areas in  the State of Arkansas. One of those wilderness areas created by this  act was Flatside, which is located in both Perry County and Saline  County, both of which are in my district.   In 2005, the U.S. Forest Service recommended that these 640 acres be  included in the national wilderness program, stating that adding these  lands to the wilderness program would establish a more logical and  manageable boundary for these areas and is consistent with the forest  management plan.   This measure is a first step in enhancing Flatside. Additional  measures are being considered to study other U.S. forest lands that are  suitable for addition to the area adjacent to Flatside. We are also  working to restore certain adjacent areas that were in former private  ownership to native species.   Perry County offers something very special for Arkansans, visitors  young and old alike, seeking a unique, authentic outdoor recreation  experience. This tourism has had a positive effect on Arkansas'  economy, especially in these largely rural counties. By increasing the  wilderness area and promoting it, Arkansas, especially in Perry County,  can attract more people to enjoy these natural resources and continue  the trend of tourism's positive impact on Arkansas' economy.   It is important to note that this bill is narrowly tailored to only  place lands carefully selected by the U.S. Forest Service into the  wilderness area. It will not affect any private property.   On a personal note, Mr. Speaker, this bill is of particular  importance to me because, as a young Senate staffer working on the Hill  in 1984, I was able to work with then-Senator Dale Bumpers' office from  Arkansas and Representative Ed Bethune's office and helped to secure  the passage of the Arkansas Wilderness Act in the Senate. What a treat,  three decades later, for me now to represent the Second District of  Arkansas and see this good work continue, while also being able to  recognize my predecessor, former Congressman of Arkansas' Second  District, Ed Bethune.   I believe naming this tract for Congressman Bethune is a proper way  to recognize him for his dedicated service for conservation causes  important to The Natural State. This enthusiasm is shared by the entire  Arkansas delegation.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my friends, Chairman Bishop and  Representative Westerman, for their help in advocating for this bill  that is so important to my district, and I urge my colleagues to  support it.
