 Mr. Speaker, today is not just about tax reform. Today is  also about what we fundamentally believe as a nation. Today, we say  working class families, not the government, are best equipped to make  financial decisions.   Did we hear anything from our Democratic friends for nearly 8 years  about lowering taxes on middle and lower income families? We did not.   Now, for the first time since 1986, we are going to overhaul our  broken Tax Code.   Here is what it means for families in North Carolina. Middle-income  families will see more than a $2,300 increase in their take-home pay.  The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act means more than 30,000 new jobs in North  Carolina.   I am encouraged that our Senate colleagues have also decided to  include the ObamaCare individual mandate repeal and would urge our  House Conference to consider it, as well.   Last, I would like to thank Chairman Brady. There is no greater  servant in the United States House. Thanks to his work and that of his  team, today we keep our promise. It is time to move forward.
