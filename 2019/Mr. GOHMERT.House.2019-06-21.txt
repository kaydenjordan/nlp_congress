 Madam Speaker, I have comments about my giving remarks  at the end of the week, so it might be worth setting a little history  of these Special Order remarks.   In 2005 and 2006, my first term, I was not prone to give any remarks  in Special Orders, but I observed during those 2 years that one of my  classmates that came in January 2005, like I did, Debbie Wasserman  Schultz, and some other Democrats arranged each night, often taking  both hours of Special Orders that their party was afforded.   I was told by Republicans who had been here for a long time, ``You  know,  [[Page H5029]]  nobody is paying any attention to what they are saying. They are making  themselves look bad. They make us look good by what they say.''   There were times I would say, ``But are you paying attention to what  they are saying?''   You could see on C-SPAN sometimes when the sound was off, it would be  scrolling, and I would say, ``Look what they are saying. They are  blaming us for all kinds of things. We need to respond. This isn't  accurate.''   And I was told, ``Look, you know, don't worry about it. It doesn't  make any difference.''   And over the course of 2 years, I saw that a group that called  themselves the 30 Somethings--everyone that was probably in their  sixties or seventies, but otherwise in their thirties--that they did  affect national opinion. I mean, you could see over that many nights,  they made a difference.   After that, I endeavored to try to address some of the critical  issues when I had the chance, if other Members of my party were not  taking those opportunities.   So on fly-out days, when so many are rushing and have to get to the  airport by a certain time, they don't have time to come down here and  address some of our critical issues, then I volunteer. I will stay an  extra hour or two before catching a plane back to Texas in order to  address some of these important things. And it is a great opportunity.   I used to do more than one Special Order a week many times, but my  Democrat friend, and I mean that sincerely,   John Garamendi, had  referred to a new Democrat rule that was put in place this year that no  one could take more than one Special Order during the week, my friend,  John, referred to that as the Louie Gohmert rule.   The good thing about that was that it enabled me not to just continue  as I had been year after year encouraging other Republicans to take a  Special Order and address some of these important national issues, then  I was able this year to tell them, ``Look, I can only do one a week, so  you guys have got to start signing up for Special Orders and taking the  time, addressing areas that you know well that we need to communicate  about.''   So I have been very pleased with how many of my colleagues have  signed up for Special Orders and addressed critical issues, helped  educate on the matters before us, because you don't always get straight  and accurate news even by some of the so-called fact-checkers.   Often fact-checkers, as they call themselves, need fact-checking,  because many times they are not accurate either.                                time  1215    So this is a great opportunity that we have in a legislative body to  address issues so that information does get out to the public, unless  they are reading the remarks in some article that has had the facts and  statements twisted and edited to change the meaning. Otherwise, they  can judge for themselves exactly what has been said and what is  accurate and what isn't.   I heard our Majority Leader Hoyer and our Minority Whip Scalise and  their dialogue back and forth bringing up the critical issue of our  border and the humanitarian crisis going on there. In their discussion,  they did not get into what is causing--well, I guess they referred to  it. People are trying to get away from terrible circumstances.   Well, those circumstances in different places in the world have gone  on for centuries. We have never had the kind of mass effort at entrance  that we have seen in recent months.   So, things haven't gotten worse in the world. Why the huge surge at  our border this year? And the border patrolmen with whom I communicate,  the people who are dealing with those coming in illegally, coming  through places that are not legal ports of entry, the border patrolmen  get information from immigrants exactly why they are coming.   Sometimes immigrants are given pieces of paper--the immigrants coming  in illegally--with addresses, names, and these are either approved or  given by the drug cartels. Nobody comes into the United States across  our southern border without permission of the drug cartels.   The drug cartels are not interested in preventing humanitarian  crises. Drug cartels are interested in helping create humanitarian  crises. And since I have been there all hours of the night, which used  to be the prime time for people coming across illegally--now they are  just coming all the time--I got to see this so many times firsthand.   I have even seen, numerous times, people that had their little piece  of paper. It was supposed to be the address that they gave the Border  Patrol and, later, ICE: Yes, this is the address where I have somebody  waiting for me, somebody who knows me, a family member.   Often that information was provided by the drug cartels: This is  where you will go.   This actually fit together to help answer mysteries of who is telling  them where to go.   But the immigrants would be asked by Border Patrol, and it wasn't on  the list of questions they are required to ask: How much did you pay  the gang or the drug cartels that are responsible for bringing you in?  Because sometimes the drug cartels have gang members who will act as  coyotes and bring people in illegally. And the answer is, normally,  $6,000, $7,000, $8,000.   And the question follow-up: Where did you get that kind of money? You  don't have that kind of money.   Well, we have got $1,000 or $1,500 here, and then people in the U.S.  send us some money.   Well, what about the rest of it?   And the disturbing comment was, normally: They are going to let me  work that off when I get where I am going.   Well, these are drug cartels, and obviously the work they were going  to be doing would be either drug trafficking or sex trafficking, both  doing severe damage to our country. Yet we have not been able to reach  passage of a bill, bipartisan or otherwise, that would actually help  totally secure our border so we can control who comes in and ensure  that they are not people who are wanting to do damage to the country.   Now, some just want to come in the country, and they don't realize,  by coming in, they will do damage, that they have not been educated on  how you keep, how you retain a representative form of government and  how with the liberties and freedoms come great responsibilities.   The responsibilities portion has also been neglected in so many  schools. It is all about rights without getting into responsibilities.   But I will continue to bring up Ben Franklin's answer to the woman  after the Constitutional Convention: Sir, what have you given us?   A republic, madam, if you can keep it.   Eric Metaxas has a book on this that I read recently. It is very  difficult to keep a self-governing system going. Historically, any  attempt at some type of self-government has not lasted normally more  than 200 years. We are beyond that.   The Constitution was ratified and first elected a Congress,  President, and Vice President under the Constitution of 1787 that  finished being ratified in 1789. So we are 230 years beyond that  founding document being ratified. So we are beyond the number of years  that a self-government has been able to last in the past, normally.   The fact is there haven't been normal self-governments, and that is  why, in Ben Franklin's speech at the Constitutional Convention,  although kids are taught today in school that he was a deist, if  Franklin is even mentioned at all--a deist believing there is maybe  some force, some thing, some whatever out there that created things,  and if such force or person or being or deity existed and still exists,  it never interferes with nature or the things that were set in motion  originally. That is, in essence, a shorthand rendition of a deist.   But Franklin himself, we know what he said, because he wrote it down  when people asked for a copy. He said: I have lived, sir, a long time,  and the longer I live the more convincing proofs I see of this truth.  God governs in the affairs of man.   This means he wasn't a deist.   But he says: If a sparrow cannot fall to the ground without His  notice, is it possible an empire could rise without His aid? We have  been assured, sir, in the sacred writing, that unless the Lord builds  this House, they labor in vain to build it.   He said: I firmly believe this. I also firmly believe without His  concurring  [[Page H5030]]  aid, we shall succeed in our political building no better than the  builders of Babel. We will be confounded by our partial  local interests, and we, ourselves, shall become a bower down through  the ages.    Because Franklin knew. He studied history along with science and  other things, but he knew from history this is not something that had  been effectively done the way they were wanting to do it.   Sure, the Romans had had a Senate. The Greeks had made an effort at  democracy that worked for a short time--not well, but worked for a  short time.   The British, from whom we separated, they had a Parliament, but they  also had a king. This was going to be a new thing. And the ``Novus ordo  seclorum'' that is under the pyramid on the two-sided Great Seal that  was adopted over 200 years ago, ``Novus ordo seclorum,'' Latin,  meaning, ``new order of things,'' ``new order of the ages.''   Some have tried to say: A-ha, new world order.   But if you look at the Founders' own remarks, they make it clear that  they knew nobody had really gotten this self-government thing right.  But if they could do it right--and as Franklin said, it wasn't going to  happen right without the Lord's concurring aid.   But if they could get it right, this would be a new order of things.  This would be what people around the world, for the rest of history,  would probably try to emulate, if not outright imitate.   But if they didn't get it right, since they had the opportunity and  failed, as Franklin said, they would become a bower down through the  ages. They would be ridiculed. They had the chance to do self- government right, and they blew it.   But even though they got this thing incredibly right, the founding  document and the agreed upon 10 Amendments, the Bill of Rights,  obviously it has taken a couple hundred years to get the Constitution  to apply and mean what it says. It took a Civil War. It took a civil  rights movement. But here we are today, and we have not continued to  educate people on what Franklin knew would require education in order  to keep the Republic.   Oh, sure, we have got more schools now than ever, but because of the  heavy-handedness of the Federal Government Department of Education,  even though that education is something that is not an enumerated power  in the Constitution and, therefore, under the Tenth Amendment was  reserved for rights only of the States and the local government, the  Federal Government got involved and, as a result, not many students are  being taught the complete history that they should know and they need  to know in order to sustain this little experiment in self-government.   So when people come in and they have not been educated at all on what  it takes to keep a self-governing system, they are just told in their  own language about all of the free things they can get, they are not  told about the important responsibilities that come with those free  things and opportunities, that keeps up for so long, and there is no  bright light on a hill that draws people from around the world.   Then, as some West Africans told me, when America gets weak, we  suffer. And we are seeing that around the world.   Iranians are suffering tremendously under a heavy-handed, even  criminal, terrorist regime in Iran that came into place because we had  a President who didn't understand radical Islam, did not understand  that when he turned his back on the Shah, who was not a great guy--he  apparently did not treat his people as well as they should have been-- nonetheless, things certainly got worse.   When the Ayatollah was welcomed into power by President Carter as a  man of peace, well, the world soon found that Iran, now that radical  Islamists who wanted a new caliphate for the world to subjugate  Christians and every other religious group under their mean-spirited,  actually, dictatorship as a religious dictatorship, the people of Iran  suffered. The world has suffered from the failure during the Carter  administration to understand the dangers that were lurking there. Well,  those dangers are no longer lurking there. They are being spread around  the world.   I was amazed to hear people on television say, well, they couldn't  really say if Iran had caused the death of any Americans. Certainly  they have.   Not long after the Ayatollah Khomeini took over in Iran, our Embassy  was attacked and over 50 individuals were taken hostage. But they have  continued to support terrorism, unabated, over all these years since  1979.                                time  1230    They are responsible for the deaths and the explosions at the Marine  barracks in Beirut in 1983. And the message that was sent by the  Democratic majority in the House and Senate was to force the complete  withdrawal of troops in the area.   So that was a great encouragement to the Ayatollah and to the radical  Islamists that want to destroy self-government. They think that they  need a dictator who is really a religious bigot in control of things to  dictate to people what they can or can't do, and that is such a foreign  concept after 230 years here under our Constitution.   But anybody who studies history, who is up on his history, knows  there is a lot better chance that a dictatorship will eventually  prevail, whether it is a religious extremist like you have ruling in  Iran or it is just a dictator like you have had in the Soviet Union.   So having been in the Soviet Union for a summer as an exchange  student between my sophomore and junior year of college, I saw the way  people suffered. I saw the way the government spied on its people; I  saw the mean-spirited things the government did to people that weren't  being manipulated the way they wanted them to be; I saw suppression of  free thought and free exchange of ideas; and I came home literally  thanking God that we didn't have that kind of suppressive government.   But in the intervening years, we have seen a government get so  powerful that it can spy on its own people, and we saw with what was  released by WikiLeaks, the FISA application, the underlying affidavit,  and the order that--holy cow, the FISA judge just basically ignored the  Fourth Amendment, the protections against unwarranted searches and  seizures.   The application, my interpretation, was basically it said: We just  need all of the information Verizon has on every customer they have and  an underlying affidavit saying, basically, yeah, we just need every bit  of information Verizon has on every customer.   And then the judge--even though a Federal, Senate-confirmed judge, it  is a secret court--he just signs off on it: Oh, you want every bit of  information Verizon has on every single customer? Sure, yeah. Why don't  you provide that? Here, here is an order to provide it.   That scared me because it actually confirmed what some of us had  feared back when the Patriot Act was being reauthorized in my first  term: Wait a minute. This is giving the Federal Government power that  could go too far. There is language that is too loosely written that  could allow the government to spy on people without proper authority.   We have got to revisit those issues.   And that has been further brought to a head with what we are learning  about the abuses of the FISA court when one administration wanted to  spy on a campaign and then spy on--and, hopefully, eliminate--the  selection of a majority of the electoral college.   The electoral college itself underwent some evolution back in the  early days, because, originally, it was a brilliant idea. It was a way  of ensuring that both heavily populated States and lesser-populated  States would all be relevant in a national election for our President  and Vice President.   Unfortunately, in the beginning, the second highest vote getter  became the Vice President, and that became apparent as a failure and a  bad idea under the Presidency of John Adams, when Jefferson, his dear  friend, became Vice President with the second highest number of votes.  By the end of the fourth year, as McCullough points out in his book on  John Adams, Jefferson even hired a notorious newspaperman to make up  some lies about Adams to help him defeat him, which he did, which  probably explains why Adams is the only President who didn't stick  [[Page H5031]]  around for the inauguration of his successor. But that got changed to a  constitutional amendment, and so we have the electoral process.   If you do away with the electoral college, then it would mean most  every State that is not a heavily populated State will never see a  candidate running for President, because it would be a waste. They will  want to spend their time in the heavy population centers and mainly  disregard what some people refer to as flyover States, which many of us  feel are the real guts and the heart of the country.   So it is an important thing to have, but people are not getting  education on these things these days, and why things were created the  way in which they were, what succeeded, what failed.   When I do tours around the Capitol, sometimes they go a lot longer  than I think they should, but I am ready to stop any time the people  are, but they still have questions. We find so many people haven't  gotten the education.   I hear so often: I never really liked history in school.   Well, that doesn't tell me anything about them. It tells me a lot  about their history teachers, that they had history teachers who didn't  understand the importance of history, so they had true/false, multiple  choice, or fill-in-the-bank questions rather than emphasizing that the  real importance in history is the stories, what went right, what went  wrong.   Yes, it helps to have them in chronological order, but the more  important aspect is what worked and what didn't. And that is not what  so many American students are getting anymore.   And certainly those who are rushing into America illegally, they  certainly haven't gotten that. They know America is supposed to be a  better place, but they don't know why. They don't know that they are  jeopardizing that country's ability to continue as an attractive place  for people to want to go, the most attractive place for immigrants to  want to come in the entire world.   So we have got more education to do. And I am hoping that our  colleagues here in this body will begin to understand that, when we  take up legislation that will ultimately legalize illegal activity-- like coming into the country illegally or giving benefits for coming in  illegally--it becomes a lure for more and more people to come  illegally, which means it is going to make more money for the drug  cartels. It is going to have more young women raped.    We are told that is occurring. About one in four girls coming to the  United States through Mexico will end up being sexually assaulted,  little boys at a lesser rate. I think I read 17 percent, something like  that--just human tragedy.   It happens when well-meaning individuals in Congress think: Let's  help those less fortunate by luring them to our country, not  understanding that there is a tremendous amount of human suffering that  goes on, in addition to undermining the very foundation of what was the  freest country in the world.   So everybody is now indicating that America is not the freest country  in the world. We continue to add laws that keep taking more and more of  our freedoms away. But I heard the majority leader ruing that we  haven't had comprehensive immigration reform.   Well, in my time in Congress, what I have come to understand is, when  you hear the term ``comprehensive immigration reform,'' it normally  means we want a bill that is so big and so massive that people who will  vote on it won't have a chance to read it all and will be able to stick  things in there that a majority would never agree to if they knew they  were there. That is what I have come to see ``comprehensive'' meaning  when it comes to legislation.   We are better off if we take subjects up individually, let people  have a chance to read and know what is there, let them have a chance to  analyze the language. Is this something likely to be struck down? If we  don't have that opportunity, we pass legislation that is not what we  want as a majority.   And as a majority--obviously, I am a Republican. We are in the  minority. But I am talking about a majority of this body.   So we have these ongoing offers, which is what it is every time we  pass a piece of legislation, even if it doesn't become law. That word  is used by the drug cartels to encourage more people to pay them, to  bring them in. That means they are going to have more employees-- really, more like indentured servants--in the drug trade, in the human  trafficking, sex trafficking trade, and people suffer as a result of  well-intentioned but poorly thought-out legislation. We have got to do  a better job on that.   Unfortunately, in the last term of Congress when Republicans had a  majority in the House and the Senate, had a Republican President, we  had leadership in both Houses that was not interested in securing our  border or we could have passed a bill to do that. We could have passed  a bill and gotten it into law.   But there are monied interests out there that contribute heavily and  encourage people not to secure the border. Of course, I said before  from this lectern, if you hear somebody who is elected in Mexico say,  ``We don't want the border secure; we don't want a wall anywhere on our  border with the United States: Then you know that is someone who is  getting money from the drug cartels. You can take that to the bank.   But you also heard well-intentioned but uneducated or miseducated  individuals talk about what is happening on our border and even refer  to the efforts to care for those who have come in illegally as  concentration camps. If that were so, it would be the first time in  human history that people have flocked by the hundreds of thousands to  voluntarily go into concentration camps, because that has never  happened in the history of the world.   The Jews, during the 1930s and 1940s did not go flocking by their own  choice into concentration camps that resulted in over 6 million deaths.  They were forced into those.   The people who are coming voluntarily and illegally across our  border, they are putting themselves at risk of sexual exploitation but  also even for their very lives, because we constantly get reports about  people dying trying to get in or getting in illegally and then being  left by coyotes out somewhere to die.   We constantly, if you pay attention, get reports of our Border Patrol  saving the lives--ICE agents--saving the lives of people who have come  in illegally but have been abandoned by the drug cartels' coyotes.   So it is also interesting when you think about the facilities on our  borders.                                time  1245    The concentration camps of World War II did not have Germany  appropriating billions of dollars or their equivalent for them to have  a more comfortable existence. That didn't happen.   That is why, clearly, they are not concentration camps, as people  continue to flock there by the hundreds of thousands knowing what they  are going into. But as they continue to hear that we are passing laws  that will eventually allow them to be legalized if they come illegally,  we are going to have the numbers that we are seeing there at this time.   In the past, we have been told that they feel like they are catching  most of the people coming across. But if my colleagues spend a lot of  time on the border as I have, the Border Patrol will say that what  scares them is that they don't know what they don't know about the  people coming in.   They do know that every time a big group comes across our border  illegally and makes themselves available to be picked up and detained,  that the drug cartels know. We have to put all of our people on duty  trying to in-process these folks, and that is when the drug cartels  know they can bring in big shipments of drugs, bring in people who  otherwise may be a threat to our country.   We continue to hear from Federal officials about people coming. We  just had a report in the last couple of weeks about the ISIS member who  admitted that they are continuing to get radical Islamists who want to  destroy our country into our country through our southern border by  paying the drug cartels to bring them in with other people. That is all  going on.   Then comes this article yesterday from The Washington Times, Stephen  Dinan, that says, ``The Border Patrol has documented more than 100,000  immigrants who they know managed to  [[Page H5032]]  illegally sneak past them and get into the interior of the country, the  agency's Chief told Congress on Thursday, saying it's the most in 5  years.''   Just for reference here, we do have balloons that can be floated up  that have infrared or thermal technology, night vision. We have people  on the border with night vision, thermal technology, so they can see  the outline of individuals who get in, even when they are not caught.   But going back to the article: ``Known as `got aways,' the migrants  are ones who agents detect but know they didn't manage to stop from  crossing the border.''   I need to insert here that our Border Patrol for a number of  administrations has not been allowed to prevent people from coming into  our country. We need to fix the law so they can prevent people from  coming into the country using reasonable means.   I know when the Texas Department of Public Safety has their boats out  on the Rio Grande where people are crossing, they don't cross because  Texas DPS doesn't allow people to cross into Texas illegally if they  can stop them.   The Border Patrol, on the other hand, has their hands tied. They have  to allow them to come in illegally and then try to in-process them.   This article goes on. It says: `` `This high level of ``got aways''  is a direct result of agents being reassigned away from the front line  to provide humanitarian support to the unprecedented numbers of  individuals and families in custody,' Chief Carla Provost told the  House Homeland Security Committee.   ``The panel was meeting to hear how President Trump's orders to send  National Guard and Active Duty troops to the border is playing out.  Chief Provost said they've been a major boost, suggesting the got-away  numbers might have been worse without the troops there to fill gaps  left when her agents get pulled away to do babysitting duties for the  families and unaccompanied children.''   I have gotten pictures from our border of our actual Border Patrol  pushing baby carriages, literally babysitting because these folks have  been lured in by what we are doing here, what we are talking about  here.   Chief Provost goes on to say, `` `That support as my agents are being  pulled away to deal with the humanitarian crisis is key to us having  situational awareness on the border,' she said.''   The article says, further down: ``In one example last month, National  Guard troops in Texas spotted a group of migrants rafting across the  Rio Grande and reported it to Border Patrol agents. Agents, with the  help of local police, corralled the group, whose members had paid up to  $10,000 to be smuggled into the U.S.''   It says they corralled them, but what I didn't get until I started  spending a lot of time on the border is that that doesn't mean they  stopped them. It means they in-processed them into the United States.   Anyway, this article makes clear it is not even just the people who  are coming in at a record pace this year. But just in 1 month, they  think there may have been 100,000 people who came in that were not in- processed. They just came into the United States. Who knows if they  want to do evil or good, but they certainly wanted to engage in illegal  activity.   Another article here from Adam Shaw, ``Illegal Immigrants from 52  Countries Crossed the U.S.-Mexico Border this Year.'' That is just so  far. We are in June.   ``The U.S. Border Patrol Chief testified Thursday that migrants from  52 countries have illegally crossed the border this year as she  described an agency `overwhelmed on a daily basis' by the escalating  crisis.''   She said, `` `While smugglers primarily target the Northern Triangle,  family units from 52 countries have illegally crossed the southern  border so far this year.' ''   Further down, it says: ``A Senate panel on Wednesday approved a $4.6  billion request for funding to tackle the humanitarian crisis at the  border, but only after including a condition that none of the money be  used for a border wall.''   As I understand our majority leader's discussion today, they are  talking about emergency funding to deal with the humanitarian crisis,  but actually, the way it is being talked about, it will contribute to  the crisis because it will encourage more people who we are spending a  new $4.5 or $4.6 billion on, to provide food and comfortable shelter  for people who come in illegally.    That language is being drafted to ensure not only that it not be  spent on the wall, but that it is not going to be spent at all on  preventing people from coming in illegally. It is just going to be  spent on the more and more volumes that are coming in illegally, which  will, in this cyclical, worthless effort, encourage more to come in. We  will have to appropriate billions and billions more for a bigger  humanitarian crisis, and that will encourage more.   At some point, we have to take seriously, and I know there are a lot  of people who don't like Biblical references--not very many, but some-- but the fact is that it is the most quoted book in the history of our  country. It was the most quoted book during the Constitutional  Convention, and it continues to be the most quoted book in Congress.   If my colleagues look back in the Old Testament references, in  Psalms, Proverbs, and other places, the best that we can hope and pray  for is justice where the rich are treated like everybody else. They  don't get any special consideration. And the poor are treated like  everybody else and not given any special consideration. Everyone is  treated fairly and equally under the law.   Yet, what we are seeing in this effort is that we are going to treat  people who are trying to come into this country legally, we are going  to penalize them. We are going to make them take 7 to 10 years, as some  have, that we have tried to help family members with before.   But if they will just come illegally, we are going to treat them  specially. We are going to ship them to a place the drug cartels want  them to be to work as their employees or indentured servants. We are  going to treat them specially. We are going to give them all kinds of  things that people who are still waiting in foreign countries to get  approval to come legally are not getting and will not get because they  are trying to do things the legal way, while others are flooding the  zone illegally.   That is not a good scenario for a country to continue to keep a self- governing system. Of course, we have billionaires that have donated  large amounts of money to try to push us into being a socialist system.  Of course, Marx didn't foresee the growth of a middle class the way we  have had it here in the United States.   I continue to think that is the real strength of our country, the  huge middle class. It shrank during the Obama administration when, for  the first time in our history, 95 percent of the new income one year  went to the top 1 percent income earners. The middle class shrunk. The  poorest got poorer; the rich got richer; and the middle class shrunk.   That could end up leading to a communist revolution once we get to  having that small ruling class and then the much larger poor class.  Unfortunately, for the billionaires that contribute to help take us to  a socialist system, they haven't been educated in history adequately to  understand that if we go to a socialist system, normally, the  billionaires' money is taken. They are put in prison or killed, and  they don't end up being part of the elite ruling class as they had been  so hopeful of.   We do have a crisis on our southern border, but it needs to be while  we deal in a humane way with people who are here, that we also secure  our border because otherwise, we are not a nation. If we don't have a  border that is enforceable, we are not a nation. We are just a  transient area. And if there is wealth in the area, it will not  continue on for many more decades.   We had a hearing this week, changing gears, on the issue of  reparations. It has been amazing how miseducated people have been on  slavery, who supported it, who was against it; on civil rights, who  supported it, who was against it. It has really been amazing.                                time  1300    There is an article here from Jeffrey Lord in The American Spectator  from June 21.   It says: ``So amidst the chaos of that congressional hearing on  reparations for slavery, former NFL star Burgess Owens got straight to  the point, saying this, as reported by BizPac Review:  [[Page H5033]]    `I used to be a Democrat until I did my history and found out the  misery that that party brought to my race,' Owens said.   ``He added, `I do believe in restitution. Let's point to the party  that was part of slavery, KKK, Jim Crow, that has killed over 40  percent of our Black babies, 20 million of them. State of California,  75 percent of our Black boys can't pass standard reading and writing  test, a Democratic State. Let's pay reparation. Let's pay restitution.  How about a Democratic Party pay for all the misery brought to my  race.' ''   The article by Mr. Lord says: ``Bingo. Yet somehow, some mysterious  way, the hard facts of history are blithely ignored by members and  sycophants of the Democrats, the latter without doubt the party of  race.   ``Republican Congressman Louie Gohmert of Texas had the audacity to  quote from a 2008 article of mine that originally appeared in this  space and was reprinted in The Wall Street Journal. Among other things  in that article I noted these hard facts about what was missing from  the website of the Democratic National Committee as it tried to portray  itself as the champion of civil rights by leaving out the hard facts of  the party's horrendous actual history on race.''   Madam Speaker, these are the things he correctly notes that I read  into the Record at our hearing.   This is from the Democrats' ``Our History'' section of their website.   He said: ``There is no reference to the number of Democratic Party  platforms supporting slavery.   ``There were six from 1840 to 1860.   ``There is no reference to the number of Democratic Presidents who  owned slaves.   ``There were seven from 1800 to 1861.   ``There is no reference to the number of Democratic Party platforms  that either supported segregation outright or were silent on the  subject.   ``There were 20, from 1868 through 1948.   ``There is no reference to `Jim Crow' as in `Jim Crow laws,' nor is  there reference to the role Democrats played in creating them. These  were the post-Civil War laws passed enthusiastically by Democrats in  that pesky 52-year part of the DNC's missing years. These laws  segregated public schools, public transportation, restaurants,  restrooms, and public places in general, everything from water coolers  to beaches. The reason Rosa Parks became famous is that she sat in the  `whites only' front section of a bus, the `whites only' designation the  direct result of Democrats.   ``There is no reference to the formation of the Ku Klux Klan, which,  according to Columbia University historian Eric Foner, became `a  military force serving the interests of the Democratic Party.' Nor is  there reference to University of North Carolina historian Allen  Trelease's description of the Klan as the `terrorist arm of the  Democratic Party.'   ``There is no reference to the fact Democrats opposed the 13th, 14th,  and 15th Amendments to the Constitution. The 13th banned slavery.''   Madam Speaker, on further down: ``There is no reference to the fact  that Democrats opposed the Civil Rights Act of 1866. It was passed by  the Republican Congress over the veto of President Andrew Johnson, who  had been a Democrat before joining Lincoln's ticket in 1864.   ``There is no reference to the Democrat's opposition to the Civil  Rights Act of 1875.''   Anyway, Madam Speaker, it goes on and on here. But it was amazing to  me and this article points out: ``Tellingly, when Congressman Gohmert  was finished reciting these hard, cold, and quite accurate facts of  history, someone in the audience yelled out, `You lie.' An unwitting  admission of absolute historical ignorance or maybe just plain denial.  And over at the website Splinter writer Samantha Grasso assailed  Gohmert as the `dumbest Republican in the room' for daring to cite the  Democrats' appalling historical record.''   So anyway, Madam Speaker, it is an interesting time. Education is  important, but it has got to be accurate education.   One other thing I would like to quickly reference is the need for  criminal justice reform within our military. There are some aspects of  military justice that are very good.   In the grand jury process in the civilian sector, constitutionally  the defendant, potential defendant, is not allowed to be there, nor to  have his attorney there or her attorney. Attorneys are not allowed to  be there for a potential defendant when that potential defendant is  actually testifying before the grand jury.   Whereas, in the military system of justice, under the Uniform Code of  Military Justice, there is what is called an Article 32 investigation  which is sort of the equivalent, except a potential accused, as we call  them in the military, is allowed to be there and have an attorney there  to see what is being said against him and to give a chance to present  evidence to the Article 32 investigating officer.   But one of the problems--and it is a very, very serious problem--is  that the charges are sent to a court-martial by the commander, normally  a commanding general or admiral. He is called the convening authority.  He puts his signature on there saying: I want this individual charged  and tried in a court-martial for this offense. That is after reviewing  the results of the Article 32 investigation.   But where it becomes rather unfair is that to get a jury--I saw this  during my 4 years at Fort Benning--the commanding general has each  unit--we have platoons that make up companies. Platoons would offer  suggestions of hard-nosed guys that would convict anybody who was sent  if they were on the jury, and they were referred up to the company  commander. The company commander would choose those that he thought  were the very best out of those nominated, and he would refer them up  to the battalion commander. The battalion commander would winnow that  group down to the very toughest who would follow what the commander  would want them to do and send those up to brigade. The brigade would  take them and review them and decide to get it down to a number that  they would send up, and eventually it would get to the commanding  general of installation, and he would pick maybe up to 15 people who  would sit, sometimes for 6 months, on every court-martial during that  time.    They knew why they were there. They knew why the commanding general  put them on the jury. They were sent there to convict the guys that the  general sent to be tried.   There were a number of acquittals, but I can tell you every time  there was an acquittal in a court-martial, you never saw that jury  panel again. They may have been new, but if they acquitted somebody,  found them not guilty, the general immediately disbanded them as a jury  panel. It is not like you have jury selection where you can challenge  somebody and have them taken off the jury.   I remember one court-martial where virtually all of the jury said  that if a defendant did not testify, they would hold it against him and  find him guilty just because he didn't testify.   The judge said: Hey, we are all part of this man's Army, and if I  instruct you--and I will instruct you--that you will not hold it  against the defendant that he doesn't testify, will you follow my  direct order not to consider it against?   Oh, oh, okay. Sure. We didn't know you were going to instruct us not  to.   But they had already made clear that, yeah, they are going to hold it  against him.   So a defendant's constitutional rights in a military court-martial  can sometimes be illusory. I think we are seeing that with Eddie  Gallagher out in California. Even after a witness came forward and said  that he is the one who asphyxiated the deceased who was wounded, he was  an ISIS member, that Eddie Gallagher didn't kill him, they still  continue on with the court-martial.   From what I saw at Fort Benning, if you had somebody come in and say:  ``I am actually the one who did it,'' I have seen a good military judge  say then: Mr. Prosecutor, do you have a motion to dismiss at this time?   And they would make a motion to dismiss.   But, really, I have a great deal of concern. I saw in a brief that  someone had prepared for a parole matter that there was out of World  Wars I and II, Korea, and Vietnam, it said there were seven American  military members convicted of war crimes, but since then,  [[Page H5034]]  the Iraq war, Desert Storm, Kuwait, and Afghanistan, we had over 200.   This is something that needs to be looked at. We should not have our  military members risking conviction simply by trying to defend  themselves and those around them. So I am hoping that we can come  together in a bipartisan way and make some changes, some corrections,  and some improvements to military justice so that our heroes don't get  killed trying to avoid being seen as criminals by people who don't  understand what they are going through.   So, in any event, I am hopeful that we will do something next week to  help fund border security, but it sounds like from what we have heard  on the floor all we are going to do is help attract more people to come  in illegally because we are going to send $4 billion or so down to the  border.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.
