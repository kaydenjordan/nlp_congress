 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Madam Speaker, I rise up in support of the rules package being put  forward by the Democratic majority. In particular, I applaud the  decision to establish a Select Committee on the Modernization of  Congress, and I thank Chairman McGovern, Speaker Pelosi, and all those  who made this a priority.   We know that the best motives of Members on both sides of the aisle  are too often frustrated by dysfunction in the legislative process,  which then makes it difficult for us to deliver on the promises that we  give to our constituents and to the Nation. Diminishing congressional  resources and, at times, overly centralized decisionmaking have  empowered outside interests in the legislative process, and those are  interests who don't always have the public interest in mind.   Of course, we know that modern-day campaigning demands are running  Members ragged. We are increasingly unable to study the material and  build the relationships necessary for a healthy legislative  institution.   We have a responsibility to the people to build a Congress that  serves the people well. This is not something that is going to be easy,  and it is not something that is going to happen until we make it  happen. It will take work, but it is work that needs to be done.   The challenges we face as an institution are not entirely new, as my  colleague, Congressman Kilmer, just said. For much of modern  congressional history, Congress has continuously wrestled with how to  be more effective as the first branch of government.   In the past, when the challenges grew, we have come together as a  body to explore reforms to our rules and to institutional design,  congressional capacity, and the matter of resources.                                time  0930    In 1945, in 1965, and again in 1992, Congress convened Joint  Committees to study the functioning of Congress and to propose  comprehensive, expert-guided reforms.    Such a moment is before us again. It will be a  challenge. After all, Congress is complicated and messy by design.  Modernizing its operation is no simple task, but that is exactly the  role that the proposed Select Committee can play. It can create a space  for Members of Congress from across the ideological spectrum,  representing different parts of the country, different world views and  different backgrounds, to come together to work through the challenges  and think through the remedies. It will be a place for experts,  historians, and academics to present their views and help us wrestle  with how to self-improve; and it will signal to the American people  that we are earnest in our efforts to make Congress work better.   I strongly support the rules package before us, and I look forward to  the work of the Select Committee on the Modernization of Congress.
