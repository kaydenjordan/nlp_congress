 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me the  time.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today because my colleagues across the aisle are  once again seeking to put politics over people and inflict undue  economic harm, this time by denying much-needed student loan debt  relief.   President Biden's targeted student loan debt relief plan is designed  to help low- and middle-income borrowers, with 90 percent of the relief  going to those earning less than $75,000 per year.   In my home State of South Carolina, over 680,000 borrowers are  eligible, of which over 67 percent are Pell grant recipients. Over  48,000 borrowers in my district alone have been fully approved for  relief.   If enacted, H.J. Res. 45 will rescind life-changing relief for  hardworking borrowers, renege on the payment pause by forcing them to  pay several months of installments with interest, and claw back earned  credit from public servants toward the Public Service Loan Forgiveness  program. For many, this will mean thousands of dollars in payments with  little to no notice. Cruelty seems to be the point.   Mr. Speaker, President Biden's student loan debt relief plan will  help alleviate the yoke of student loan debt for millions of Americans.  Challenges to the program, both in court and posed by those in  Congress, are meritless.   Higher education shouldn't be a luxury for a privileged few.  Borrowers deserve our help, and I urge my colleagues to vote down this  resolution.                                time  1245
