 Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the  Committee on the Judiciary be discharged from further consideration of  H.R. 962, the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, legislation  to block fourth-trimester abortions, and ask for its immediate  consideration in the House.    Madam Speaker, for the protection of life, I urge that  the Speaker immediately schedule this important bill.
