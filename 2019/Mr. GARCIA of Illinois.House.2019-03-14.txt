 Mr. Speaker, during Women's History Month, I  rise  [[Page H2736]]  to honor the life and legacy of Raquel Guerrero, a woman who immigrated  as a child to Chicago's Pilsen community and who dedicated her life to  make it a better place for her family and for all families.   She was instrumental in improving opportunities and demanding more  resources and better education for the mostly Latino students in my  district.   She understood the value of a good education for children, but it  extended beyond books, and advocated for healthy hot meals for students  at what is now known as the Pilsen Community Academy, where I had my  first years of schooling.   She helped establish Pilsen's annual Fiesta del Sol, the largest  community festival in the Midwest.   Raquel was instrumental in securing funds to build the new Benito  Juarez Community Academy High School in Pilsen, which has since  provided many generations of young people with good public education.   She helped found APO, the Association for Workers Rights, a workers'  rights group that still operates in the community.   Raquel's organizing efforts also resulted in the funding of the Rudy  Lozano Library in Pilsen.   She was the mother of 11, but treated every child in the community as  a part of her family.   Mr. Speaker, we honor her during Women's History Month.                            ____________________
