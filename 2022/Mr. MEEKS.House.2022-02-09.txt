 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 900, I call up  the bill (H.R. 3485) to impose sanctions on foreign persons responsible  for violations of internationally recognized human rights against  lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer and intersex (LGBTQI)  individuals, and for other purposes, and ask for its immediate  consideration in the House.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H.R. 3485.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, this is a very important day with a very important bill,  and I rise today in strong support of H.R. 3485, the Global Respect  Act, as amended, and introduced by my friend and great American,  Congressman   David Cicilline.   Mr. Speaker, we live in a country that espouses that all human beings  are created equal, endowed with equal rights, no matter what we look  like, how we pray, or where we come from.   The Universal Declaration of Human Rights tells us, ``all human  beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights.'' The  International Covenant of Civil and Political Rights states that, ``All  persons are equal before the law and are entitled without any  discrimination to the equal protection of the law.''   And our own Declaration of Independence famously says, ``We hold  these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that  they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights, that  among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.''   Mr. Speaker, the Global Respect Act brings us closer to realizing  these treasured ideals.   Today, unfortunately, shamelessly, millions of people are living in  fear. In countless countries, LGBTQI-plus people face punishment simply  for being who they are. They are subject to brutal beatings, imprisoned  for lifetimes,  [[Page H1081]]  tortured, hanged, and stoned. When human rights abuses are being  committed, the United States of America must do its part to hold the  perpetrators accountable. And that is why Congressman Cicilline  introduced H.R. 3485, the Global Respect Act.   This legislation is critical, straightforward, and overdue. It  requires the President to identify foreign individuals responsible for  these human rights violations against LGBTQI-plus people and to prevent  them from entering the United States of America.   In addition, the Global Respect Act requires the State Department to  designate at least one senior officer responsible for tracking  violence, criminalization, and restrictions on the freedoms of LGBTQI- plus people abroad. This legislation also requires the Department of  State to include information relating to violence or discrimination  against LGBTQI-plus communities in its annual human rights reports.   Now, unfortunately, several of my colleagues on the other side of the  aisle say they oppose the bill because they claim it is duplicative of  Magnitsky sanctions. While Global Magnitsky is a landmark tool in the  fight against human rights abuses, rarely has it been used by  administrations to sanction those who persecute LGBTQI-plus persons.  This bill simply builds on existing human rights-related authorities to  ensure that human rights abusers are held accountable everywhere on  this planet.   They also argue the language of the bill is overly broad when, in  fact, the words they quibble with come directly from what has already  been enacted in the United States Code, drawing word-from-word the  definition of ``gross violation of human rights.''   There are critics out there who say this bill infringes on religious  beliefs. I wholeheartedly, 1,000 percent, reject this notion. The  Global Respect Act is about holding accountable individuals responsible  for committing human rights abuses against LGBTQI-plus people;  Individuals who commit the absolute worst crimes, such as murder,  forced detentions, and disappearances of persons. This bill is clear in  that it targets heinous acts, and does not authorize any action against  an individual based solely upon religious belief.   Mr. Speaker, I can't thank Congressman   David Cicilline enough for  his work, for his commitment, for his dedication on presenting this  legislation so that equality and human rights are protected. I also  recognize the courageous LGBTQI-plus activists who are out there and  who dared to stand up and claim their basic human rights in the face of  violence, discrimination, persecution, simply for whom they love.   Mr. Speaker, I have a brother who had to stand up for who he is. He  is a human being. And we should not allow any violations of human  rights here in the United States or anyplace we know as planet Earth.   So when LGBTQI-plus people are murdered simply for existing, the  world is watching. And the world is watching what we do. And the world  is watching how we react to it. And the world is watching what we say,  and what we stand for when we say we have value for human beings. That  is what is at stake here.   This should not be a partisan issue. It has never been a partisan  issue. This should be an issue about all human beings, protecting human  beings, the human race, because when you break it down, we are all the  same. And that is why I am heartened that this legislation is in fact  bipartisan. And I am heartened and proud that this legislation passed  out of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs by a voice vote. One of  the proudest moments I have is introducing and being on this floor  today as chair of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs to strongly  support this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I just want to state that the notion that  this bill is not supported by the administration is just blatantly  false.   Just last week, the Biden administration released a Statement of  Administration Policy in full support of the bill and noted the urgent  need to address threats to the human rights of LGBTQI-plus, not just  abroad but right here in the United States of America.   Mr. Speaker, I am honored to yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  Rhode Island (Mr. Cicilline), the author of this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentleman from Rhode Island.    Mr. Speaker, let me just say this real quick. I don't mind  burdening anyone if it is going to save somebody's life. There are  certain burdens that we have to carry, and this is one of them.   Mr. Speaker, I, with pride, yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Nevada (Ms. Titus), a strong fighter for human rights.  [[Page H1083]]         Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  North Carolina (Ms. Manning).    I am prepared to close, Mr. Speaker.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, let me start by commending and thanking the Biden  administration for its strong support in moving this legislation.   What is noted in his support is that legislation like this is needed  at a time especially when countries are undertaking steps to further  marginalize or harm LGBTQ-plus community members and that the  administration looks forward to working with Congress on what I know  will be a bipartisan vote.   I also happen to agree with President Biden and echo his statement  that in a time when a global rise in authoritarianism and hate persists  that it is critical that we send a strong message to the world that the  United States of America, the world's greatest democracy--that the  United States of America, who leads with its values--that the United  States of America can speak up and speak out striving to be a more  perfect Union, and that the United States of America can lead the world  to say that we are going to stop the persecution of human beings simply  for who they are.   This is the year 2022, Mr. Speaker. I would think by now we would  have learned that our voices should never be shut when we see  violations of human rights. One of the things that I pledged when I  became chair of this committee was that human rights would be on the  front burner because if we can't come together no matter what party we  are in, no matter what religion we have, no matter what ethnicity we  have, and no matter where we come from on this planet, if we can't come  together and say that we are going to stand up, speak out, and stop  where individuals are being persecuted and prosecuted--murdered--that  is the least that we can do.   I don't care how difficult it is. I don't care if it puts a burden on  the administration to do it because those are our values, that is what  should take precedence.   I have seen too much right here in the United States--individuals  just walking down the street holding hands with whom they love, and  someone walks up and does something horrific to them.   We have had to pass these bills and laws in our country so that they  can live their life. If we see it happening to anyone else, then we  have got to make sure that voice is heard and stop individuals who are  persecuting and prosecuting people from anyplace else on this planet  from coming to this country.   Send a message. Don't send it once, send it twice. If it takes three  or four times, then so be it. That is what this is all about. The  camera of history is recording this, looking to see what we do and what  we say.   How do we react to a human tragedy?   Generations yet unborn will be saying: What did the United States  Congress do when they knew?   No one denies what is taking place all over the world when it comes  to LGBTQI-plus individuals. Nobody denies that they are being killed.  No one denies that they are being tortured. Nobody denies that they are  treated in an inhumane way. That is not being denied.   So as long as it exists, we should use every tool available to make  sure that we wipe it off the planet Earth, and that is what   David  Cicilline, this great Congressman, intended when he offered this bill.   This should be an historic moment and a proud moment for the United  States Congress to say: We have stood up and led the world to stop  human rights violations to people just like us, human beings.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
