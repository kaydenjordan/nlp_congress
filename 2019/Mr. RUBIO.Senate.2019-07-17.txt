 Mr. President, as chairman of the Senate Committee  on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, it is my honor to recognize a  small business that exemplifies innovation, entrepreneurship, and hard  work. This week, it is my privilege to name Levatas of Palm Beach  Gardens, FL, as the Senate Small Business of the Week.   Levatas is a strategic marketing and consulting firm that uses  artificial intelligence--AI--and machine learning technologies to  develop solutions for their clients. They utilize AI technology to help  the manufacturing industry and other companies better understand their  customers. Levatas was started 13 years ago by Chris Nielsen in his  Jupiter, FL, garage. Nielsen and his team have since expanded to become  one of south Florida's leader in AI solutions.   Moving from Jupiter, FL, Levatas expanded to their current office in  Palm Beach Gardens and recently announced a second expansion,  headquartered in Rosemary Square, where an additional 50 new jobs will  be created.   A large part of their success lies in Levatas's excellent company  culture. In fact, Levatas was recently honored by Entrepreneur magazine  in the ``2018 Top Company Cultures'' for the ``Small Companies''  category. They have also been recognized by the Florida community as  well. In 2018, Palm Beach Tech Association awarded Chris Nielsen, Ryan  Gay, CEO of Levatas, and Levatas Golden Palm awards for excellence. In  addition to numerous accolades, Levatas has made significant  contributions to their community. Through Levatas's GenerosiTeam  initiative, employees have supported local philanthropic organizations  including the Big Heart Brigade, Sheridan House, One Blood Organization  Blood Drive, Children's Miracle Network donation drive, and other  nonprofits.   Levatas has cemented themselves as a local hub for innovation in the  Palm Beach community. Levatas's extensive clientele spans many  industries and includes companies such as Royal Caribbean Cruise Line,  Orangetheory Fitness, SunTrust Bank, HSBC, Dell, IBM, Discover the Palm  Beaches, Duffy's Sports Grill, and more. Renowned for their phenomenal  quality of service, Levatas's innovative solutions for digital  transformation showcase their significant experience in building  technology and bringing products to market.   Levatas has remained true to their core values by focusing on quality  service with an expert ability to provide innovative, creative, and  experienced solutions to shape brands and build technology.  Furthermore, Levatas is a phenomenal example of how hard work can lead  to success. It is with great pleasure that I extend my congratulations  to Chris Nielsen and all of the members of the Levatas community.  Levatas has an exciting future ahead, and I look forward to watching  your continued success.                            ____________________
