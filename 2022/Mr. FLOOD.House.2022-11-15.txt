 Mr. Speaker, yesterday, during new Member orientation with  the freshman class, which I now claim, we were addressed by the Clerk  of the House of Representatives.   She shared with us the history of her post and that, in 1789, the  Clerk of the House of Representatives was named as the second officer  following the Speaker of this storied institution.   Mr. Speaker, I have the great privilege today to rise and  congratulate one of the Nation's longest-serving clerks of a State  legislature in America's history.   Just like yesterday, when we were impressed with the history of this  institution, it goes without saying that institutions like this are  sacred because of the work of the nonpartisan staff, the people who pay  attention to the parliamentary procedure, the quiet ones that sit next  to the loud ones, the clerks of the United States State legislatures  and this body.   Mr. Patrick O'Donnell lives in Lincoln, Nebraska, and he has had a  distinguished career as clerk of the Nebraska Unicameral Legislature.  In 1977, he became the assistant clerk. He became the clerk in 1978.    Patrick has a record of defending the legislature as a unique  institution in our United States. He believes in the process and has  championed the vision of Nebraska voters when the voters changed to a  unicameral back in 1937.   As a former speaker of the Nebraska Unicameral, he taught me and  hundreds of other legislators what a powerful and important role our  branch of government should play in leading this Nation and our States.   The Founders of this country envisioned the legislative branch as the  most powerful branch of government. It was clear their intent was that  the people directly elected in their districts should decide where the  money is spent and the policies to be enforced.   After 44 years on the job, Mr. Patrick O'Donnell is retiring now as  the longest-serving clerk among his contemporaries in State  legislatures across this Nation. Only a couple of past clerks have  longer recorded tenures.   It is my privilege and honor on this floor to recognize a clerk that  has gone above and beyond for the people of his State and been a  resource to clerks and legislators throughout the United States during  his 44-year tenure.   On behalf of the First District of Nebraska, congratulations and best  wishes on your retirement, Mr. Clerk, Mr. Patrick O'Donnell of  Nebraska.                            ____________________
