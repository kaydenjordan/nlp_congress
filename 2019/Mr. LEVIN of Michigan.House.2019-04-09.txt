 Madam Speaker, I thank Congresswoman Stevens,  and it is so great to go after Congresswoman Wild.   The first thing I want to say is what a great time I am having with  you all, how much I am learning from you, how much fun we are having  working on things together.   Congresswoman Wild and I are particularly concerned that any new  replacement for NAFTA really protects the working people of our  country, really protects our environment, and does not subject people  to outrageously high prices for prescription drugs.   As I look about me and see the other Members here, I see others whom  I am working with on different things, and I think that is the great  thing about this new freshman class. I am really so proud to be a part  of this freshman class of the 116th Congress, and I feel like we have  really had an outstanding first 100 days fighting for the people.    Right out of the gate, we are delivering on our promises to pass  bold, transformative legislation and conduct essential oversight that  the Constitution demands of us.   Voting on final passage of H.R. 1, the For the People Act, was  certainly one of my proudest days.   My Transparency and Corporate Political Spending Act is in the final  version of the bill, and it will increase transparency for big  corporations that dump dark money into our elections.   My amendment to Whip Clyburn's gun violence prevention bill to close  the Charleston loophole will require the Government Accountability  Office to report on gun violence prevention methods so that we have the  best information available while crafting policy. I think it is so  important that we bring back research to this public health crisis of  gun violence.   Just last week, so many colleagues joined me in calling on the  Department of Homeland Security and Immigration and Customs Enforcement  to halt the cruel and unjust detention and deportation of Iraqi  nationals, many of whom are Chaldean Christians and other religious  minorities.   My district, the Ninth District of Michigan, has the most Iraqi  nationals of any district in the country, out of 435. But I think,  Congresswoman Stevens, 9 out of the 10 districts with the most Iraqi  nationals, those Representatives join me--I think, 23 altogether--in  calling on our government to respect the rights of these people to just  have their day in court.   I came to Congress on a mission to raise the standard of living for  working people, and the Democratic majority has delivered on that  promise in several ways already, from passing legislation to reduce the  cost of healthcare to passing the Paycheck Fairness Act, to  guaranteeing women get equal pay for equal work.  [[Page H3197]]                                     time  1900    I commend my colleagues in the majority and the leadership of our  Caucus for their hard work, fearlessness, and dedication that has  gotten us this far, and we have only just begun.   I yield back to my sister Michigander, the gentlewoman from Rochester  Hills, Ms. Stevens.
