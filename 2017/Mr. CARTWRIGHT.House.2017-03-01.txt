 Madam Speaker, I have a motion to recommit at the  desk.    I am opposed to it in its current form.    Madam Speaker, this is the final amendment to the  bill which will not kill the bill or send it back to committee. If  adopted, the bill will immediately proceed to final passage, as  amended. This motion to recommit is to defend ethical conduct  throughout our government.   In response to the Watergate scandal, Congress created the Office of  Government Ethics to protect against unethical behavior in the  executive branch. In 1988, President Ronald Reagan signed into law a  bill to strengthen the Office of Government Ethics by removing it from  the Office of Personnel Management and giving it greater independence  from the White House.                                time  1800    Now Congress is attempting to undo this vision of a strong,  independent Office of Government Ethics at a time when we need it more  than ever. This bill would put the Office of Government Ethics right  back under the control of the White House, and that is why this motion  to recommit simply excludes OGE from this bill.   We appreciate the need for strong ethical guidelines most strongly  when people act unethically. Every day we witness this White House  struggle with honesty and credibility. We heard the promises last  night, the ones we have been hearing all along.   When you promise to create family-sustaining jobs by revitalizing  American infrastructure and then we find out he means to do it with tax  breaks to huge corporations and none of the regular guarantees that the  people actually doing the work will be treated right and paid fairly,  that is when you have a credibility problem.   When you promote yourself as a man of the people but then we find out  you have stuffed your Cabinet with out-of-touch billionaire friends,  that is when you have a credibility problem.   When you promise to fix America's education system but then we see  you appoint Betsy DeVos to head the Department of Education, someone  with no education experience, someone who wants to gut public  education, that is when you have a credibility problem.   When you address Congress and promise to repeal and replace the  Affordable Care Act in a way that guarantees increased access, coverage  of preexisting conditions, and that costs will go down but no one in  America knows how you plan to pay for that, that is when you have a  credibility problem.   We don't need a White House with a credibility problem. We need these  promises the President has made to come true. We need a stronger  economy full of family-sustaining jobs. We need Social Security,  Medicaid, and Medicare to be protected. We need to have an executive  branch we can trust. This is our future, and we need to be smart about  it. I believe that smart people trust, but they verify.   The problem is we do seem to have a President whose relationship with  the truth is, at best, a nodding acquaintance. This is why we need a  strong Office of Government Ethics more than ever.   Ronald Reagan was right; it needs to be an office independent of  control by the White House.   We need it to keep our leaders from enriching themselves in public  office, to keep our leaders honest, to help us trust, but verify that  our elected officials do what is best for the American people and not  their own pocketbooks.   We need it to ensure that our President is acting in our best  interest with nations around the world. We have already seen this  President and his staff repeatedly lie and refuse to answer questions  about their business and political ties with dealings in Russia. We  have seen, at a minimum, improper and potentially far worse collusion  over rigging an election, and we have seen the administration attempt  to influence investigations into their dealings with Russia.   We need an Office of Government Ethics to be independent of the White  House because this President has used diplomatic relations to promote  his businesses abroad at the expense of the American taxpayer. He  promised to drain the swamp and immediately started appointing his  billionaire buddies to Cabinet positions and rush their hearings  through before they could even complete the ethics process.    Madam Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.
