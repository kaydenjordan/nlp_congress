 Madam Speaker, we have a lot of lofty goals in this  country about green energy, renewable energy, and such. But we are not  providing the ways in order to get there.   One of the important components is the mined products that we need to  go into various equipment and vehicles, et cetera. We are not able to  mine the critical minerals, the rare earths in this country.   For example, to get a permit to open a type of mine or expand a mine,  it could be 15, 16, 18 years in this country while our neighbors just  north of the border, a 2- or 3-year process to secure the permits to  mine products that are desperately needed in this country if we are  ever going to talk about meeting the goals you would have for renewable  energy, electric cars, and all that in order to lower the carbon  footprint.   So what is the hypocrisy here? In my home State of California, you  can hardly get mining done. You can hardly even keep electricity  flowing because of taking away power plants due to--those are power  plants that would be zero CO2. I don't understand the  hypocrisy. So we have to get smart about this.                            ____________________
