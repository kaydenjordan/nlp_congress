 Mr. Speaker, I want to congratulate a collective  group of Republicans and Democrats, people from the faith community who  joined together to acknowledge that Rodney Reed, an inmate on death row  for more than 20 years, with new DNA evidence and witnesses who  indicated that another individual, the fiance of the victim, may have  committed this crime, was given the opportunity for an indefinite  suspension by the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals.   It is important, as Texas probably remains one of the States with the  largest number of individuals on death row, that we do not take the  victim's interests lightly or that of the perpetrator and convicted  person.   Mr. Reed did not and was not convicted by a jury of his peers. The  jury was not diverse in Giddings, Texas. There was subsequent evidence,  as I indicated, DNA evidence, as I have indicated.   It is important as much for the justice for the victim to know, or  the victim's family to know, the actual perpetrator who did this  dastardly act and took a life as it is for the man sitting on death  row.   So religious community leaders, international leaders, my colleague  in the United States Senate Senator Cruz, I, and others around the  State want to recognize the work of the Texas Court of Criminal  Appeals, after the fact, and, of course, the Board of Pardons.   Justice must be rendered for all, and that is what is happening in  Texas today.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank my Colleague Congresswoman  Plaskett for anchoring tonight's Congressional Black Caucus Special  Order on Mental Health.   Mental health includes our emotional, psychological, and social  wellbeing. It affects how we think, feel, and act.   It also helps determine how we handle stress, relate to others, and  make choices.   Those experiencing mental health problems can have difficulty  thinking, experience mood swings or inappropriate emotional reactions  to everyday events, and behavior or engagement with others could be  affected.   Many factors contribute to mental health problems, including:  biological factors can include individual brain chemistry; traumatic  life experiences, such as the sudden death of a loved one, involvement  in a major accident, traumatic experiences during times of war or as a  consequence of serious illness; family history of mental health  problems.   People can experience different types of mental health disorders,  such as: Uncontrolled anxiety, behavioral, eating disorders (anorexia,  and bulimia are two frequently cited problems); substance abuse; mood  problems such as overwhelming feelings of sadness, personality changes;  psychotic behavior, and suicidal thoughts.   African American adults are 20 percent more likely to experience  mental health issues than the rest of the population.   25 percent of African Americans seek treatment for a mental health  issue, compared to 40 percent of white individuals.   The reasons for this drop off include misdiagnosis by doctors,  socioeconomic factors and a lack of African American mental health  professionals.   Adult African Americans living below poverty are three times more  likely to report severe psychological distress than those living above  poverty.   African Americans are less likely than white people to die from  suicide as teenagers, African American teenagers are more likely to  attempt suicide than are white teenagers (8.3 percent v. 6.2 percent).   The number of professionals that provide mental health care:   Only 6.2 percent of psychologists,   5.6 percent of advanced-practice psychiatric nurses,   12.6 percent of social workers, and 21.3 percent of psychiatrists are  members of minority groups.   According to the National Association on Mental Illness (NAMI), only  3.7 percent of members in the American Psychiatric Association and 1.5  percent of members in the American Psychological Association are Black.   African Americans of all ages are more likely to witness or be  victims of serious violent crimes.   Exposure to violence increases the risk of developing a mental health  condition such as post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, and  anxiety.   African American children are more likely than other children to be  exposed to violence, which can have a profound, long-term effect on  their mental health.   Some African Americans even see mental illness as a punishment from  God.   Up to 85 percent of African Americans describe themselves as ``fairly  religious'' or ``religious,'' and they commonly use prayer to handle  stress, according to one study cited by the American Psychiatric  Association.   Nationally, suicide is the 10th leading cause of death among all  Americans--over 47,000 people died by suicide in 2017.   On average, there are 129 suicides per day.   In 2017 there were an estimated 1.4 million suicide attempts.   From 1999 through 2015, 1,309 children ages 5 to 12 died of suicide  in the U.S.   Suicide is the third leading cause of death among Black youth  (Suicide is the second leading cause of death among all youth just  behind accidental deaths).   A report published in the JAMA Pediatrics, found that the rate of  suicide for Black children ages 5 to 12 died by suicide exceeded that  of White children.   A study in the Journal of Community Health showed that suicide rates  among black girls ages 13 to 19 nearly doubled from 2001 to 2017. For  black boys in the same age group, over the same period, rates rose 60  percent.   Black youth are about half as likely as their White counterparts to  get mental health care.   Trauma and Suicide: Among urban males, PTSD is associated with  increased suicide attempts.   African Americans living below poverty are three times more likely to  report serious psychological distress than those living above poverty.   While African Americans are less likely than white people to die from  suicide as teenagers, African American teenagers are more likely to  attempt suicide than are white teenagers (8.3 percent v. 6.2 percent).   Less than 2 percent of American Psychological Association members are  Black/African American, some may worry that mental health care  practitioners are not culturally competent enough to treat their  specific issues.   African Americans are 10 percent more likely to experience serious  psychological distress than their white counterparts.   70 percent of youth in State and local juvenile justice systems have  a mental illness (While just 14 percent of all youth under 18 in the  U.S. are Black, 43 percent of boys and 34 percent of girls in juvenile  facilities are Black.).   Incarcerated youth die by suicide at a rate 2 to 3 times higher than  that of youth in the general population.   The LGBTQ+ community is 4 times more likely to die by suicide than  their straight peers.   The 2015 U.S. Transgender Survey found 40 percent of respondents had  attempted suicide in their lifetime--nearly nine times the attempted  suicide rate in the United States population at large.   The Trevor Project estimates that more than 1.8 million lesbian, gay,  bisexual, transgender, and queer youth seriously consider suicide each  year.   The frequency and intensity of bullying that young people face are  astounding:   1 in 7 students in Grades K-12 is either a bully or a victim of  bullying.   90 percent of 4th to 8th grade students report being victims of  bullying of some type.   56 percent of students have personally witnessed some type of  bullying at school.   71 percent of students report incidents of bullying as a problem at  their school.   15 percent of all students who don't show up for school report it to  being out of fear of being bullied while at school.   1 out of 20 students has seen a student with a gun at school.   282,000 students are physically attacked in secondary schools each  month.   15 percent of all school absenteeism is directly related to fears of  being bullied at school.   According to bullying statistics, 1 out of every 10 students who  drops out of school does so because of repeated bullying.   Suicides linked to bullying are the saddest statistic.   David Ray Ritcheson was a victim of adolescent bullying. He was  bullied, beaten and tortured nearly to death because of his race. He  spent 3 months in a hospital as a result of his injuries and underwent  more than 30 surgeries to repair his battered body.   His courage in the face of such violence was reflected in his  willingness to come before Congress to tell his story. His courage  inspired members of Congress to pass the Matthew Shepard and James  Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act which became law. [Public Law No:  111-084].   Negative attitudes about mental illness often underlie stigma, which  can cause those suffering from mental illness or their families not to  seek help or deny clear symptoms of mental illness.   The stigma of mental illness may cause the mentally ill to delay  treatment, experience job discrimination, lead to the loss of  employment, loss of housing, or cost personal relationships, and  undermine successful recovery of those with mental illness or substance  abuse.   To overcome stigma, we need to avoid using generic labels such as  ``retarded'' or ``the mentally ill'' and terms like crazy, lunatic, or  slow functioning.   According to the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, most  adults (88.6 percent) agreed with a statement that people are generally  caring and sympathetic to persons with mental illness.   Adults with mental health symptoms (77.6 percent) agreed that  treatment can help them lead normal lives.  [[Page H8955]]    However, only 24.6 percent of those surveyed who had mental health  disorders believe that people are caring and sympathetic to persons  with mental illness.   Psychiatrists advise that emphasizing abilities and not limitations,  when talking about someone who has a mental illness is important for  the self-esteem of the mentally ill.   Everyone has strengths that are not related to a mental illness, and  these should be the focus of those seeking help for the mentally ill in  their lives.   We have to change cultural and socially acceptable language and  behavior toward the mentally ill--mental illness is nothing to laugh at  or make light of.   Mental health care disparities exist due to:   1. Reluctance and Inability to Access Mental Health Services impacts  the care of African Americans.   Approximately 30 percent of African American adults with mental  illness receive treatment each year, compared to the U.S. average of 43  percent. Here are some reasons why.   2. Distrust and misdiagnosis   Historically, African Americans have been and continue to be  negatively affected by prejudice and discrimination in the health care  system.   Misdiagnoses, inadequate treatment and lack of cultural competence by  health professionals cause distrust and prevent many African Americans  from seeking or staying in treatment.   Socio-economic factors play a part too and can make treatment options  less available. In 2017, 11 percent of African Americans had no form of  health insurance.   3. Provider Bias and Inequality of Care   Conscious or unconscious bias from providers and lack of cultural  competence result in misdiagnosis and poorer quality of care for  African Americans.   African Americans, especially women, are more likely to experience  and mention physical symptoms related to mental health problems.   For example, they may describe bodily aches and pains when talking  about depression.   A health care provider who is not culturally competent might not  recognize these as symptoms of a mental health condition.   Additionally, men are more likely to receive a misdiagnosis of  schizophrenia when expressing symptoms related to mood disorders or  PTSD.   Members of minority communities often experience bias and mistrust in  health care settings.   This often leads to delays in seeking care.   Those seeking mental health services, must be informed on how to best  determine the best person to provide them with care.   Key factors should include whether the mental healthcare providers  have:   Cultural Competence in Service Delivery   Culture--a person's beliefs, norms, values and language--plays a key  role in every aspect of our lives, including our mental health.  Cultural competence is a doctor's ability to recognize and understand  the role culture (yours and the doctor's) plays in treatment and to  adapt to this reality to meet your needs.   Cultural competence is important because cultural competence in  mental health care results in misdiagnosis and inadequate treatment.   African Americans and other multicultural communities tend to receive  poorer quality of care.   To improve the chances of getting culturally sensitive care patients  should go directly to a mental health professional because this is  their area of expertise, if they do not feel comfortable right away, a  primary care doctor is a great place to start.   The primary care doctor might be able to start the assessment to  determine if a patient has a mental health condition or help refer them  to a mental health professional.   When meeting with a provider, ask questions to get a sense of their  level of cultural sensitivity.   No person seeking help should feel bad about asking questions.   Health care providers expect and welcome questions from their  patients since this helps them better understand the patient and what  is important to them.   Some of the essential questions that should be asked are:   Have you treated other African Americans?   Have you received training in cultural competence or on African  American mental health?   How do you see our cultural backgrounds influencing our communication  and my treatment?   How do you plan to integrate my beliefs and practices in my  treatment?   The answers to these questions should inform the patient seeking  medical care.   Its is also important for the patient to know the clues that indicate  that the medical professional may be biased in how they communicate  with the patient regarding their medical condition.   There have been tremendous advancements in medical care that include  therapies and medications that allow persons with serious mental health  conditions to lead productive and full lives.   The Affordable Care Act takes a positive step forward to address the  issue of mental illness and access by making it a requirement that all  healthcare plans contain care for mental illness and substance abuse.   Because of the health care law, for the first time insurance  companies in the individual and small group market are required to  cover mental health and substance abuse disorder services as one of ten  categories of essential health benefits.   Additionally, health insurance providers must cover mental health and  substance abuse services at parity with medical and surgical benefits  (which means things like out-of-pocket costs for behavioral health  services must generally be comparable to coverage for medical and  surgical care).   The Affordable Care Act expands mental health and substance abuse  disorder benefits and the parity created by the law protections  approximately 60 million Americans by assuring coverage.   The Affordable Care Act is one of the largest expansions of mental  health and substance abuse disorder coverage in a generation.   As part of the White House roll out of the Affordable Care Act a $100  million commitment to improve access to mental health services was  announced.   The Affordable Care Act is providing $50 million to assist community  centers provide more mental health services. The Department of  Agriculture will provide an additional $50 million to finance rural  mental health facilities.   The health care law requires most health plans to cover recommended  preventive services like depression screenings for adults and  behavioral assessments for children at no cost to consumers.   In the State of Texas it is expect that 5,189,000 people will have  access to mental health and substance abuse assistance programs.   Post-traumatic stress disorder is a psychiatric disorder that can  occur following the experience or witnessing of a life threatening  event, such as military combat, natural disasters, terrorist incidents,  serious accidents, or physical or sexual assault in adult or childhood.   PTSD, one of the most prevalent and devastating psychological wounds  suffered by the brave men and women fighting in far off lands to defend  the values and freedom we hold dear.   A suicide bomber, an IED, or an insurgent can obliterate their close  friend instantaneously and right in front of their face. Yet, as  American soldiers, they are trained to suppress the agonizing grief  associated with those horrible experiences and are expected to continue  on with the mission. And carry on they do, with courage and with  patriotism.   PTSD can cause problems like: Flashback or feeling like the event is  happening again; Trouble sleeping or nightmares; Feeling alone; Angry  outbursts; and Feeling worried, guilty, or sad.   The fact of the matter is that most veterans with PTSD also have  other psychiatric disorders, which are a consequence of PTSD.   About 30 percent of the men and women who have spent time in war  zones experience PTSD.   More than half of all male Vietnam veterans and almost half of all  female Vietnam veterans have experienced clinically serious stress  reaction symptoms.   PTSD has also been detected among veterans of other wars.   Estimates of PTSD from the Gulf War are as high as 10 percent.   Estimates from the war in Afghanistan are between 6 and 11 percent.   Current Estimates of PTSD in military personnel who served in Iraq  range from 12 percent to 20 percent.   We need to ensure that no soldier is left behind by addressing the  urgent need for more outreach toward hard to reach veterans suffering  from PTSD, especially those who are homeless or reside in underserved  urban and rural areas of our county.                            ____________________
