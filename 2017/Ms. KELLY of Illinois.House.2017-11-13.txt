 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a blog post regarding this bill  written by Congressman Pallone and myself.           [From the Energy & Commerce Democrats, Sep. 13, 2017]      It's Time To Give the Government an Upgrade for the Mobile World                  (By Frank Pallone, Jr. and Robin Kelly)         In the wake of the natural disasters devastating so much of       the country, millions of Americans are turning to federal       agencies for help--but the government's websites don't always       make it easy. We've introduced legislation in the House that       would change that, and it's moving forward at a time when it       can help a lot of Americans who are suffering.        For people who were forced from their homes or are without       power because of hurricanes, storms or wildfires, their only       connection to necessities of survival--food, water, fuel, and       shelter--is through their mobile phones. It's the device they       could take with them when they had to flee their homes. But       while private websites and charities have developed new       mobile websites and apps to help those who are still       struggling, many of the essential government websites on       which people depend are essentially unusable on a phone.        During any natural disaster, we expect the government to be       at its best. But for people whose homes have been flooded,       burned out, or leveled, trying to navigate government       websites on their phones likely feels like a waste of time.       For instance, if you need to start looking for a loan to       rebuild your home, good luck trying to use your phone to       navigate the website for the Department of Housing and Urban       Development. If you need to reach state or local authorities,       the problems get worse. And asking people to hunt down a       working desktop computer right now is just unreasonable.        Although these natural disasters are making this problem       more acute, the need for a  [[Page H9143]]       government-wide upgrade is only growing more important every       day. That's because the people who need the most help are       often on mobile devices. If you are young, if you have a       lower income, or if you are a minority, you are much more       likely to use a smartphone as your only entry point to the       internet.        The gap is significant--people earning less than $30,000       were 13 times more likely in 2015 to depend on a smartphone       than people earning more than $75,000. Yet websites that are       intended to strengthen the social safety net like programs       providing food assistance are nearly inaccessible on a phone.   A smart government brings services to people when they need them most--                         not the other way around         Last year we crossed a significant threshold--Americans are       now more likely to access the internet on their mobile device       than on their desktop computer. If people rely on mobile       devices, our services should be designed for mobile devices,       and that's why agencies with consumer-facing websites should       be designed with an eye towards mobile first. These mobile       sites can make it easier for people who may not have the time       to wait in line at a government office.        In order to bring government up to speed, we have       introduced the Connected Government Act, which ensures that       all new federal agency websites are designed to work well on       mobile devices. These federal sites would serve as an example       to the states who need to do more to modernize their own       technology. This simple change can have a big impact--from       shorter lines and faster service, to providing more help to       more people. Mobile friendly websites will ultimately help       build a stronger democracy.        Today, our bill is expected to clear a crucial committee       vote in the House. And our colleagues Senators Maggie Hassan       (D-NH) and Cory Gardner (R-CO) recently introduced a       companion bill in the Senate. With this progress, our path to       a smarter government is within reach. Congress should act       soon to get this bill passed.        In the wake of these recent disasters, we need to ensure       that anyone looking for assistance from a federal agency can       get the information they need through their mobile device.       This is the least we can do to help alleviate some of the       stress people feel in times of need.     Mr. Speaker, I thank the coleader on this  bill, Congressman Frank Pallone, who has been a strong supporter every  step of the way, from the bill's drafting through today's floor  consideration. I also thank my good friend Congressman Mark Meadows, a  cosponsor of the bill, and I thank Senator Hassan, who introduced the  Senate companion.   Mr. Speaker, this is a simple bill that will ensure all government  websites are accessible to all Americans. It simply requires that any  new or updated Federal websites be mobile friendly. It is 2017. We need  Federal websites to work for all Americans.   In the past 90 days, there were 2.61 billion visits to Federal  websites. Almost 40 percent of those came from mobile devices. That is  over 1 billion hits from mobile devices like tablets and smartphones.  But today, according to a report by the Information Technology and  Innovation Foundation, 40 percent of government websites don't work on  smartphones or are mobile unfriendly.   Alarmingly, many of these sites are critical to serving the American  people, like the application for Federal student aid and the launch  point for bidding on Federal Government contracts. For millions of  Americans without access to reliable broadband or without a desktop  computer, smartphones are their doorway to the internet.   A recent Pew report found that younger Americans, low-income  Americans, rural Americans, and people of color are more likely to rely  only on smartphones to browse the web.   Today, 77 percent of Americans own and use smartphones to access the  internet. For 10 percent of Americans, it is their primary access to  the internet. That is 32 million Americans. It is unacceptable for 32  million Americans to have difficulty reaching their government simply  because we couldn't keep up with technological trends.   Recently, Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria showed just how vital  smartphones have become, especially during disasters. In the aftermath  of these storms, millions of Americans relied on their smartphones to  find assistance. Imagine the frustration of navigating SBA, FEMA, or  HUD websites, looking for assistance on a 5-inch screen, and the site  not working because it is only designed for desktop browsing.   In my time serving as the ranking member of the Information  Technology Subcommittee, it has been clear that the Federal  Government's IT systems are not working and have not kept up with even  the most basic technology trends that are common in the private sector.   Americans deserve a modern American Government that is accessible and  responsive to their needs. This bill takes us one step closer to  realizing this goal.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this commonsense bill  that the CBO has said will have no significant cost to taxpayers.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   H.R. 3071, the Federal Acquisition Savings Act, as amended, would  require Federal contracting officers to consider short-term rentals in  addition to long-term leasing or purchasing when acquiring equipment  agencies need. I would like to thank Chairman Gowdy and Representative  Carter for working with the minority in a bipartisan manner to address  concerns that were raised about the bill as introduced.   The Federal Acquisition Regulation is currently unclear about whether  short-term rentals are permitted. Rental equipment, as opposed to  purchasing or leasing, can be a cost-effective option for Federal  agencies in certain circumstances.   This bill would provide additional flexibility by allowing such  rentals. It would also improve efficiency by requiring the cost- effectiveness of renting to be considered by Federal contracting  officers. I support giving contracting officers additional tools to  make the most cost-effective decisions.   The bill, as amended, also would require GAO to produce a report card  on the use of renting or leasing by Federal agencies. The requirements  for that report were very burdensome for GAO in the bill as introduced.  I know we all value GAO's work and want to make the best use of its  resources. I am glad that those reporting requirements have been  streamlined.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, this legislation would amend the Former Presidents Act  of 1958 to cap a former President's annual pension at $200,000 indexed  to inflation. The bill also would provide an additional annual  allowance for expenses that would start at $500,000 per year and  decrease gradually to $250,000. Under this bill, the annual allowance  would be reduced dollar for dollar in instances in which a former  President's adjusted gross income in a taxable year exceeds $400,000.   Taxpayers should not have to pay for a former President's allowance  if the former President is making a comfortable living earning millions  of dollars a year, as many former Presidents do. This legislation would  not affect any funding for the security and protection of former  Presidents and their spouses. This legislation would update the pension  amount for surviving spouses of former Presidents, which has been  unchanged since 1958, by increasing it from $20,000 to $100,000.   Last Congress, President Obama vetoed a previous version of this  legislation because it would have had unintended consequences. For  example, due to technical drafting errors, it would have resulted in  the immediate termination of the salary and benefits of certain staff  of the former Presidents. It would also have resulted in the  termination of leases for office space and the removal of furniture and  equipment. That was clearly not an acceptable situation, and I am glad  we have been able to resolve these problems in the legislation before  us today.   I believe this bill makes fiscal sense, and I urge Members to support  it.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from the District  of Columbia (Ms. Norton).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to  the gentlewoman.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my  time.
