 Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak about the Suicide  Prevention Act.   I read this statistic on the House floor before, but it bears  repeating: every 9 minutes someone in the United States commits  suicide. And for every suicide-related death, there are 25 attempts.  These are truly heartbreaking statistics, and they hit close to home.   I have met with the family and friends of those who have taken their  own life. I have heard their stories and I am responding to their pleas  for help.   This bill is part of a longstanding commitment to reverse this  troubling trend. It is bipartisan, it is bicameral, and it would  provide for new resources to turn the tide on this dire situation.   Part of the problem when it comes to effectively addressing suicide  is that medical and other professionals have outdated resources and  stale data. The current data collection efforts regarding suicide are  often years out of date, and this limits the ability of State and local  health organizations, as well as community organizations, to recognize  the trends early and intervene.   Mr. Speaker, I am asking my colleagues here in the House and the  Senate to respond to those who are crying for help. This legislation  makes so much sense, we should make it a priority.                            ____________________
