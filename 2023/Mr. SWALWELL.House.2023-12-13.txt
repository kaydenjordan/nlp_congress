 Mr. Speaker, this impeachment is a continuation of the  insurrection that came here on January 6.   This gang has never accepted Joe Biden as the President. The  architect of the idea that you could overturn the election is the  current Speaker of the House.   Donald Trump sent that violent mob here. It didn't work, so now we  are here where they are going to try to use this House to overturn the  election through this inquiry.   The problem is they have zero evidence. The only crime is that Joe  Biden blew out Donald Trump in the 2020 election. That is a problem  because this place is the largest law firm in D.C., with these lawyers  working on behalf of just one client, Donald Trump, at the expense of  everything else that matters.   I want to give   James Comer some credit because after 50,000 pages  of depositions, secret hearings, and closed hearings, I think if we  give him enough time, he is going to prove that Hunter Biden is Joe  Biden's son.
