 Madam Speaker, I rise to emphasize how important our  actions today are for domestic violence survivors everywhere.   Domestic violence is yet another pandemic in this country. In my  district, we have seen a rise in domestic violence during the COVID-19  pandemic amongst teenagers.   Survivors of domestic violence carry their experiences with them  every single day, experiencing fear, chronic stress, self-doubt,  depression, and so much more. This emotional trauma can prevent  survivors from accessing and maintaining safe housing, employment, and  supportive relationships, leading to feelings of isolation that only  worsen their mental health.   Organizations in my district, like Safe Horizon, Westhab, Family  Services of Westchester, and the YWCA are a lifeline of support for  survivors of domestic violence. The Federal Government should support  groups on the ground like them doing this important work.   Madam Speaker, I strongly believe that together we can prevent all  violence and create a culture of care for one another. This  legislation, which will authorize funding for preventative and  culturally responsive services, is an essential step toward this  vision.   Madam Speaker, I am proud to cosponsor this bill, and I rise in  support of its passage.                            ____________________
