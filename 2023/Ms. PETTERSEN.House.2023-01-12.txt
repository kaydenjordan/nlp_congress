 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize two of my  most important constituents and the milestones in the week to come.   This Sunday, January 15, marks the 12th anniversary with my husband,  Ian Silverii. Twelve years ago, I said yes to our first date, and it  was the best decision I have made.   I am so grateful for his love and support all along the way. No  matter how difficult our paths have been, he has always been my rock  and biggest cheerleader. I am thankful every day for the life we have  built together.   Happy anniversary to my partner and best friend and the dad to my  other most important constituent, my son, Davis.   January 19 is my son's third birthday. Davis has been the greatest  gift to both of our lives. It has been amazing to watch him grow and to  see him become the loving and empathetic little guy that he is. Nothing  makes me happier and prouder than being his mom.   His Dad and I love him so much. I can't wait to celebrate him and all  that he brings to our lives and the people around him.   Happy birthday to my sweet boy.                            ____________________
