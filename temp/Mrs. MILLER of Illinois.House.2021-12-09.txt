 Madam Speaker, I rise today in opposition to  H.R. 5314.   Bringing H.R. 5314 to the House floor this week shows that the  Democrats' priority is partisan politics, not policies that will  directly benefit the American people.   If Democrats were serious about bipartisan reforms, they wouldn't be  pushing a bill like H.R. 5314. This bill is nothing but a continuation  of the Democrats' obsession with President Trump. He lives rent free in  their heads.   This bill incorporates several unnecessary ``reforms'' that are  nothing but an attempt to validate House Democrats' baseless  investigation of the Trump administration.   It is a huge red flag that H.R. 5314 was referred to nine committees  and not one Democrat-led committee has held a hearing or a markup on  the legislation. This legislation is being pushed through without  proper order, and I oppose it.
