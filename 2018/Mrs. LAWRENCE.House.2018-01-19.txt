 Mr. Speaker, we are close to a government shutdown.  The Republicans' top priority, however, is taking away a woman's right  to choose.   The abortion survivors bill is nothing but an insensitive, insulting,  and unconstitutional attack against a woman's right to make her own  healthcare decisions. No matter how sneaky the Republicans have been in  drafting this bill, it is still, plain and simple, an abortion ban. It  criminalizes doctors and intrudes into the doctor-patient relationship.   Politicians are choosing what is best for a woman's health, instead  of a woman making a choice with her doctor. This bill is part of the  Republicans' agenda to take healthcare away from women.   On the eve of the Women's March, we say again: Enough is enough. This  bill will intimidate and close down reproductive health clinics across  the country, leaving women who truly need help with no choices at all.                            ____________________
