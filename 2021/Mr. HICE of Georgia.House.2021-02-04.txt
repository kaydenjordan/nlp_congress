 Mr. Speaker, the hypocrisy here is an outrage.  My fellow Georgian, Congresswoman Greene, stood right here in this  House and took full responsibility for her statements. That is more  than we can say for any of the many in this Chamber who have made  outrageous, hate-filled, and vile statements and comments over the past  years--and recent months, in particular.   For example, a Democrat member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee  has repeatedly made blatant anti-Semitic statements. She still holds  her position.   The Democratic chairwoman of the House Financial Services Committee  encouraged supporters to aggressively assault anyone who supported  President Trump. She still holds her position.   The Speaker of the House has called Republicans enemies of the state.  She still has her position.   While we watch cities in flames, businesses being destroyed, officers  killed, and civilians attacked, a member of the majority party called  for further unrest in the streets. She still has her position.   I have got four pages of similar comments, and this is by no means  exhaustive. Inflammatory rhetoric around here has become commonplace,  unfortunately, and Members of this House have absolutely crossed the  line by calling for violence and making other similar remarks. The  majority refuses to hold its own members accountable. This is the  zenith of hypocrisy and injustice.   Mr. Speaker, I call on and urge our Members to oppose this  resolution.
