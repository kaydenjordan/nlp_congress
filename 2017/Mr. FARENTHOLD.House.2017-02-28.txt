 Madam Chair, you know what? We have got over 1  million pages of regulations. We have got so many laws nobody could  possibly know them. I would venture to say there are very few people  today who can't go a day without violating some law or some regulation.  It has gotten too complex.   Nobody wants a dirty environment. Nobody wants dirty water, but we  need a reasonable amount of regulation that we can understand, that we  can follow, and that will protect America and create jobs.   The SCRUB Act creates a commission that comes back to Congress with  recommendations of what to get rid of. You know what? I would like to  do it all here in Congress, too, but we sure face a lot of obstruction  in getting things done here. It doesn't move fast here.   Let's get a commission to do the basic work. Let's bring it back to  Congress, and let us decide and let us get rid of regulations. Let's  make the agencies pick and choose which regulations that they think are  important, and they will do it.   This is commonsense legislation to get the regulatory state under  control, and I urge my colleagues to support it.
