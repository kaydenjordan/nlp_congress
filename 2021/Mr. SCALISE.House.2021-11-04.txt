 Mr. Speaker, I yield back to the majority leader to  inquire as to the calendar for the remainder of this week--the bills  that we just finished voting on, go through the rest of the bills that  were on the schedule. Since there is no schedule that we see before us,  if the majority leader could tell us what to expect next after this  last vote.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. As we  anticipate possible votes tonight, possible votes tomorrow, the two  major pieces of legislation that are still out there, and specifically  the bill that went before the Rules Committee yesterday, roughly 2,500  pages.   One of the things we talked about is, if that bill were to come to  the floor, currently there is no Congressional Budget Office or Joint  Committee on Taxation score on those bills, would there be a score on  those bills prior to them coming to the floor for a vote?    The JCT is obviously important, and I appreciate that  the gentleman said there would be a JCT score, but on the CBO score,  there have been some significant changes made in the Rules Committee  since those CBO conversations.   Would that be revised to include the new version of the bill?
