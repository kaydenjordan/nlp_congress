 Mr. President, as I listen to my colleagues, I am  honored every day to serve with them in the U.S. Senate.   In 2018, in Minden, NV, I had the honor of commemorating the opening  of the Moving Wall, which is a replica of the Vietnam war memorial that  travels the country so the public can pay its respects to Vietnam  veterans. I will always remember the stories that veterans and their  families shared with me that day--stories of coming home from a  divisive war to an equally divided public. The pain of that reception  was still fresh for many of them decades later.   America's servicemembers make an implicit pact with our country. They  agree to put their lives on the line, and in exchange, they deserve our  support, our care for them and their families, and our respect.   Last week, The Atlantic magazine published a story in which anonymous  sources claimed that Donald Trump doesn't demonstrate that respect. The  article described a Commander in Chief who calls his own country's  fallen soldiers ``losers'' and ``suckers.'' The story has fit a pattern  from other anonymous sources over the years, some having described the  President as lashing out at generals and calling them ``dopes'' and  ``babies.''   Now, granted, these are from anonymous sources, so let's set them  aside for just a moment. As the saying goes, journalism is the rough  draft of history, and sometimes that rough draft gets things wrong.   What do we know?   What we do know from the President's public statements is that Donald  Trump does not understand the sacrifice and heroism that America's  Armed Forces demonstrate on a daily basis, and that makes him unfit to  lead them. How can a Commander in Chief make life and death decisions  for our troops when he doesn't understand the very nature of the  sacrifice he is asking?   I am not making up Donald Trump's refusal to understand military  sacrifice. You just have to look at the record, and you have heard some  of it today. That record is part of the public record that, in 1968,  showed that Donald Trump avoided military service through a medical  deferment. Although Donald Trump did not serve in the military, he has  felt free to criticize others who have and their families.   In 2015, we heard then-Candidate Donald Trump say that John McCain  was ``not a war hero. . . . I like people who weren't captured.'' He  was talking about a man who endured torture during the 5 years he spent  as a prisoner, a man who upheld the highest standards of our military  by turning down the release that his captors offered him in order to  stay with his fellow POWs, a man who refused to denounce his country  even when his captors informed him it could earn him his freedom.   Clearly, this President has no conception of that integrity and that  sacrifice. A President who refuses to honor men and women who were  captured doesn't understand what heroism is.    In 2016, as the Republican nominee for President, Donald Trump  attacked the family of CPT Humayan Khan, who was killed in Iraq while  trying to stop a suicide bomber. For his brave and self-sacrificing  actions that day, Captain Khan received a Bronze Star and a Purple  Heart.   Accompanied by his wife at the Democratic National Convention, Mr.  Khan spoke about his son's sacrifice. In response, after seeing Mr.  Khan and his wife, Donald Trump said:         If you look at his wife, she was standing there. She had       nothing to say. She probably--maybe she wasn't allowed to       have anything to say.    Can you imagine criticizing a mother for not being able to articulate  the pain of losing her son? A President who mocks a military family's  pain doesn't understand what selflessness is.   Just this Monday, we heard Donald Trump say that the top people in  the Pentagon want to do nothing but fight wars so that all of those  wonderful companies that make the bombs stay happy.   A President who attacks America's generals as valuing profits over  the men and women they command doesn't understand what leadership is,  and because, even after 3 years as Commander in Chief Donald Trump  can't understand or appreciate the commitment and sacrifice of  America's servicemembers, he cannot effectively lead them.   At the end of the day, Donald Trump does not understand the very  purpose of our military. He seems to believe that the military is his  personal police force. He doesn't get that the allegiance to which our  Armed Forces swear is to the American Nation, its people, and its  Constitution.   We saw this when, in June, President Trump threatened to use the  Insurrection Act to send Active-Duty troops to police the streets of  this country. I was in Washington on the day this administration  ordered police on horseback, armed with tear gas and concussion  grenades, to disperse protesters who were peacefully protesting against  police violence--all so that Donald Trump could stage a photo  opportunity in front of a church while he held a Bible. On that same  night, I could hear the noise overhead from the National Guard Black  Hawk helicopters that engaged in a show-of-force display on the streets  of Washington.   I come from a family of servicemembers. My father was stationed in  Korea after the war. My grandfathers both served in the U.S. Army, and  I had a great uncle who was on the beach at Normandy. My father-in-law  piloted LCM-3s in Korea for the Army, and I keep on the shelf in my  Senate office a photo that he took of the Korean War Veterans Memorial,  here in Washington, in winter. That stark image of troops in the snow,  moving cautiously through danger, is a reminder to me of the humanity  and sacrifice of our servicemembers, including of my father and father- in-law.   Each year, when I celebrate the induction of new Nevadans to the  service academies, I see the next generation devoting its idealism and  its courage to our country, and I consider the weighty sacrifice of  people who are so very young.   After reading the stories in the news and reflecting on the history  of comments from our current Commander in Chief, I just want to say one  simple thing to veterans, servicemembers, and their families in Nevada  and throughout this country: Thank you. I will always stand with  American troops who put their lives and bodies on the line to protect  our country, and the American people deserve a Commander in Chief who  will do the same.   I yield the floor.
