 Mr. Speaker, 2020 was California's worst fire season on  record, and 2021 has the potential to be even worse.   Wildfires damage property, pollute our air, and threaten lives, and  we need to take action.   I have been calling for fair pay for Federal firefighters. These  brave Americans put their lives on the line to keep our communities  safe, and I am glad that the Biden administration recently committed to  paying Federal firefighters at least $15 an hour.   As we begin another fire season, we need to strengthen our  coordination across levels of government to learn from past disasters.  I have introduced legislation to create an independent board to closely  examine and report on natural disasters. This will keep families safe  and save taxpayers money.   And, of course, we need to tackle a key contributor to worsening fire  seasons, the climate crisis.   As we move forward on infrastructure legislation, environmental  protection must be a priority.   For the millions of Americans and Californians hurt by wildfires each  year, doing nothing is not an option.                            ____________________
