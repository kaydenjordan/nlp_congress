 Mr. Speaker, if innovation is the lifeblood of our  nation's economy, then the Dallas-Fort Worth region might very well be  considered our country's heart. World-class research hospitals and  several leading pharmaceutical companies call DFW home, where they  create life-saving treatments while keeping our local economy strong.  Their continued success, however, depends on their access to  international marketplaces, especially those in Canada and Mexico. That  is why passing the United States Mexico Canada Agreement, or ``USMCA,''  is so important.   One of the biggest concerns that I hear from innovators in my  district is the protection of their intellectual property (IP) rights  in the international marketplace. President Trump and Trade Ambassador  Lighthizer have delivered on this issue by installing robust IP  protections into this trade agreement with Canada and Mexico. The USMCA  provisions that strengthen patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade  secrets protections mean that innovators can spend less time worrying  about protecting their IP rights and more time creating products and  Texas jobs.   Not only will this job creation boost the American and Texan  economies, but it will also benefit two of our country's strongest  trading partners. In 2017, Texas alone exported $127 billion in  products to Canada and Mexico, with 72 percent of the materials  imported by Texan manufacturers coming from those same countries. The  Texas economy flourishes from its trade relationship with these  countries, and in the end, trade with Mexico and Canada supports  948,900 jobs in our state.   Many Americans are already living in the strongest economy of their  lifetimes, and the USMCA is critical to ensuring that our country's  industries can continue to prosper and sell their goods freely and  fairly across the globe. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting  its passage and ask that it be brought up for a vote as soon as  possible.                            ____________________
