 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to H.R.  1435, the so-called Preserving Choice in Vehicle Purchases Act. The  only choice H.R. 1435 preserves is Big Oil's choice to worsen the  climate crisis.   In California, we boldly led the way on pollution reduction  standards. H.R. 1435 is a direct attack on the progress we are just  starting to make in transitioning cars from fossil fuels to clean  energy.   It would devastate California's goal to transition to EVs by 2035, a  groundbreaking policy I proudly supported while serving in the  California State Legislature.   This bill is a regressive measure that would doom not only  California's goals but also undermine the entire Nation's efforts to  combat the climate crisis.
