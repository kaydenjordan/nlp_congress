 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commend President Trump for  the recent bipartisan deal with Congress to replace NAFTA with a new  and significantly improved free trade agreement, the USMCA.   This deal will create jobs, boost our agriculture exports, and grow  the economy in Kentucky. It is good for our farmers and manufacturers,  and it will benefit all Americans.   The USMCA also encourages innovation, opens new markets for our  farmers, and strengthens enforcement and accountability with our  trading partners in the global economy.   Unfortunately, it took far too long for Speaker Pelosi and the House  Democrats to come to the table and move toward action on an important  priority to the American people. Their excessive, unfounded focus on  impeaching the President has created months of needless delay on a vote  on the USMCA, a vote we continue to await.   However, it is good news that a deal has finally been reached. It is  one that will provide our economy with increased stability and  confidence. But now that we finally have an agreement on a deal  negotiated by the President over a year ago, Democratic leadership must  act quickly and bring the USMCA to the floor for a vote. My  constituents and all Americans deserve no less than a government that  works for them rather than one that plays political games with our  economy.   The need for a modern agreement with our major trading partners has  been neglected for long enough. We must now do our duty and take a vote  on the USMCA, which will help us remain competitive in the 21st century  economy.          Recognizing Cumberland County Judge Executive John Phelps     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize my friend,  Cumberland County Judge Executive John Phelps, for his recent selection  to serve as president of the Kentucky County Judge/Executive  Association.  [[Page H10025]]    This prestigious organization serves as the unified voice for county  judge executives in all of Kentucky's 120 unique counties. Judge Phelps  will do good work in this role to promote the improvements of county  governments all across Kentucky.   In Kentucky, we are fortunate to have strong leaders in our  courthouses and city halls, many of whom serve cities and counties in  the First Congressional District. These include leaders like Judge  Phelps, whose exceptional service and commitment to addressing the  needs of local government stand out.   I am excited to see him get started in this important job and know  that he will be a strong advocate for the many needs of county  governments. His service will benefit not only Cumberland County and  south central Kentucky, but also the Commonwealth of Kentucky as a  whole.   I am honored to recognize Judge John Phelps, whose distinguished  record of service in Cumberland County and his many private-sector  accomplishments in the real estate business will serve him well in this  new role.                            ____________________
