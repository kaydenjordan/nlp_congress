 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the remarkable life and  legacy of North Carolina's Dr. John Gilbert, who recently passed.   From Dr. Gilbert's time serving in the U.S. Army to his tenure on the  Wake County School Board, he devoted his life to serving others.   John Gilbert was a towering figure in Wake County, best known for his  unwavering dedication to the Wake County Public School System.   At a time of enormous change, Dr. Gilbert spearheaded innovative  efforts to combat segregation and bring additional resources to  underserved schools.   After 16 years of service on the school board, John served on the  Wake County Board of Elections where he worked to uphold fair elections  and secure voting rights for all.   Today, John Gilbert's enduring legacy lives on through the many  people and students whose lives he transformed. Our community is  forever indebted to John Gilbert.                            ____________________
