 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize and congratulate  one of my constituents, Easton's own Okezue Bell.   A Moravian Academy graduate, Okezue is making a mark not just on  Pennsylvania's Seventh District, my district, but on our entire country  and our world.   Okezue created ``WeArm,'' a prosthetic limb for below-the-elbow  amputees that has reached more than 4,000 people. He founded an award- winning app called Fidutam that offers microloans to unbanked, low- infrastructure communities. He was a United Nations youth delegate for  climate justice, environmental sustainability, and education, working  on educational initiatives for underprivileged students across the  globe.   He somehow still has the time to be a standout violinist and tennis  championship winner.   I was honored to celebrate his graduation with him this past weekend,  and I cannot wait to see what he does next because his intelligence,  curiosity, and dedication to making the world a better place represent  the best that this country has to offer.                            ____________________
