 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding me time.   Mr. Speaker, COVID-19 should never be a political issue. Yet today,  Democrats have put forward an 1800-page bill filled with a wish list of  policies drafted with zero input from House Republicans.   Now is the time to get serious about helping the American people. We  should be returning to Washington to get back to what we were elected  to do, not vote on a messaging bill that has absolutely no chance of  becoming law. Our country deserves better.   Mr. Speaker, this bill was not a sincere effort to address this  pandemic. It is why I will be voting against Speaker Pelosi's wish list  bill.
