 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  strong diplomatic partnership between the United States of America and  the Republic of India. Our relationship shares important values that  are rooted in democracy.   I had the privilege of meeting with the consulate general of India  last week, and I learned even more about India's partnership with the  United States, their economy, India's challenges with combatting COVID- 19, and their state of international affairs. It was a wonderful  opportunity to listen and learn more about our friends in India and  ways in which we can help each other continue to thrive.   In February, President Trump spoke at the Motera Stadium in India,  filled with 110,000 spectators, and was given a warm welcome to the  country. At the successful event, President Trump discussed ways in  which he has been working with Prime Minister Modi on an array of  topics that will help both of our nations move forward. Some of these  topics include security and defense cooperation, energy, trade, and  promoting women entrepreneurs.   Additionally, India and the United States are both working on  combating terrorism in all forms. I applaud the joint efforts of India  and the U.S. in eradicating terrorism.   Madam Speaker, I thank Prime Minister Modi for being a friend of the  United States.                            ____________________
