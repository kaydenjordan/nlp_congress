 Mr. Speaker, earlier this month, Special Counsel  Robert Mueller indicted 12 Russian intelligence operatives for their  activities hacking Democratic email and computer networks during the  2016 election.   In Illinois, our State Board of Elections was also targeted and its  voter registration database breached. Data on tens of thousands of  Illinois voters was taken. This breach and the taking of voter data is  an unacceptable, malicious attack on our Nation and its people.   We must not only hold the attackers accountable; we need to ensure  that attacks on our next election are defended against. Personally, I  have met with county clerks for the district I represent, and I know  they are taking action, treating this threat seriously.   We need to ensure that our Federal Government is responding with the  same level of urgency. That is why, today, I led my Illinois colleagues  in a letter requesting a briefing from the Department of Justice on  their election security efforts in our State.   Protecting the integrity of our election is fundamental to our  democracy. I urge the Department of Justice to work with Illinois to  secure our election infrastructure and prepare for this serious  national threat.                            ____________________
