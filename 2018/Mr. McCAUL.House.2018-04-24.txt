 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge support for my bill to  hold the Iranian regime accountable for its continued human rights  violations.   I introduced the Iran Human Rights and Hostage-Taking Accountability  Act with Congressman Deutch, and I am grateful for Chairman Royce and  Ranking Member Engel's support in this effort.   The Iranian regime continues to perpetrate gross human rights abuses  against its own people. They continue to suppress and censor their  people's calls for democratic reform. They recklessly use their  nation's resources to expand their destabilizing influence and support  of terrorism. They continue to engage in corrupt practices, and they  continue to illegally detain and imprison our citizens without just  cause. This is simply unacceptable.   Mr. Speaker, this bill serves as a clear signal to the people of Iran  that we support their quest for freedom. It shines a light on the  regime's human rights violations and targets Iranian officials guilty  of corruption, censorship, and the diversion of goods intended for the  Iranian people. It requires the President to work with our  international partners to develop a strategy to end this inhumane  behavior and sanctions those officials complicit in those crimes.  Finally, it sanctions those individuals who take Americans hostage.   Mr. Speaker, today, there are more than six American citizens and  permanent U.S. residents held by the Iranian regime in a shameful  attempt to use innocent human lives as political bargaining chips.  These hostages include: Bob Levinson, Congressman Deutch's constituent,  who has been missing since 2007 and remains America's longest held  hostage; Siamak Namazi and his 81-year-old father, Baquer, held since  2015 and 2016, respectively; Ph.D. student, Xiyue Wang, held since  2017; internet freedom activist, Nizar Zakka, held since 2016; and  others.   The United States has a moral responsibility to devote resources to  these hostages and make their return a priority. I sent a letter with  Congressman Lieu and 46 other Members of Congress requesting that the  administration keep Congress informed as to what steps they are taking  to guarantee this happens.   So, again, I thank the chairman and ranking member, Congressman  Deutch, for their leadership on this bipartisan effort to hold Iran  accountable.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the letter dated April 23, 2018.                                  Congress of the United States,                                     Washington, DC, April 23, 2018.      Hon. John J. Sullivan,      Acting Secretary of State, U.S. Department of State,           Washington, DC.        Dear Acting Secretary Sullivan: We write to request       information regarding the Administration's efforts to secure       the release of American citizens and permanent U.S. residents       held hostage by the government of Iran.        As you know, Iran has a long history of unjustly holding       hostages in violation of international law dating back to       1979. Over the years, the Iranian regime has arrested dozens       of foreigners on spurious charges and convicted them in sham       trials held in secretive courts. Many of the detained       American citizens and permanent residents are also held in       deplorable conditions, where they experience severe health       and psychological issues.        Today, there are more than six American citizens and       permanent U.S. residents held by the Iranian regime in a       shameful attempt to use innocent human lives as political       bargaining chips. These hostages include Bob Levinson, who       has been missing since 2007 and remains America's longest-      held hostage; Siamak Namazi and his 81-year-old father       Baquer, held since 2015 and 2016, respectively; PhD student       Xiyue Wang, held since 2016; internet freedom activist Nizar       Zakka, held since 2016; and others. The United States has a       moral responsibility to devote resources to these hostages       and make their return a priority.        This past month, the House Foreign Affairs Committee passed       H.R. 4744, the Iran Human Rights and Hostage-Taking       Accountability Act, to increase U.S. leverage by levying new       sanctions on those responsible for detaining U.S. citizens or       legal permanent respondents in Iran. But more sticks must be       complemented with a coordinated diplomatic effort with our       allies.        According to media reports, the State Department has       increased efforts in recent months to secure the release of       these hostages, including outreach to the Iranian regime in       December 2017 that has gone unanswered. On April 6, 2018, the       Department outlined efforts that have been undertaken in a       report to Congress pursuant to Section 110 of the Countering       America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act. We request that       the Department provide some additional details to Congress.       Specifically, please provide answers to the following       questions in either written responses or a briefing:        1. How has Iran responded to the various lines of effort       made by the U.S., as detailed in the April 6 report to       Congress, to raise the detention cases?        2. According to a June 20, 2017, article from the       Washington Post, two senior officials from the Trump       administration stated a range of options were being       considered, which included ``sticks more than carrots.'' What       specific tools are being considered to secure the release of       detained Americans and permanent U.S. residents?        3. Does the Administration require any new authorities from       Congress to utilize these tools?        4. What is the Administration's strategy for       disincentivizing and deterring foreign  [[Page H3469]]       governments, particularly Iran, from taking Americans and       permanent U.S. residents hostage in the future?        Thank you for your attention to this important issue.            Sincerely,        Ted W.
