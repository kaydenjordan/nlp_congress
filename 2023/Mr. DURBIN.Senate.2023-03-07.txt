 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, last week, the Biden administration  announced it was imposing Magnitsky law-related sanctions on several  Putin thugs involved in the jailing of Vladimir Kara-Murza. This is the  move that I, along with Senators Shaheen, Rubio, Tillis, Menendez, and  Risch, had urged.   Kara-Murza is an incredible Russian patriot who, despite being  poisoned  [[Page S662]]  twice by the Kremlin, returned to Russia last year to continue the  peaceful struggle for a more democratic nation and an end to the  disastrous war in Ukraine. I will never forget that he came to talk to  me just before he returned to Russia and reflected on his determination  and optimism for a better future for Russia. Tragically, he was  arrested shortly after arriving in Moscow on the laughable charge of  criticizing Mr. Putin's war.   Kara-Murza, Alexei Navalny, and so many other Russians who are  courageously pursuing a better future for their country deserve our  support, and they deserve to be released from Putin's disgraceful  gulags.   I would also like to take a moment to mention another brave person.  This gentleman, Oswaldo Paya, a brave Cuban, died under suspicious  circumstances 11 years ago. Oswaldo Paya had spent years advocating for  peaceful, democratic change in Cuba, including submitting thousands of  signatures calling for greater political freedoms using a process  allowed by the Cuban Constitution itself. Not only did the Castro  regime cowardly ignore these modest requests, but it then changed the  constitutional provision that allowed for this kind of political input.   After years of harassment and threats, in July 2012, Oswaldo Paya's  car was run off the road by a government vehicle, leading to his death.  The Cuban Government has never provided a credible accounting of the  incident or charged anyone with his death. So, this week, Senators  Rubio, Kaine, Cassidy, Menendez, Cruz, Cardin, Warner, and I are again  calling on the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights to complete  this investigation. I hope the Commission finally acts to bring light  to Paya's case and to help deter acts of aggression like this in the  future.    I announce that the Senator from California (Mrs.  Feinstein), the Senator from Pennsylvania (Mr. Fetterman), and the  Senator from Arizona (Mr. Kelly) are necessarily absent.    I announce that the Senator from California (Mrs.  Feinstein), the Senator from Pennsylvania (Mr. Fetterman), and the  Senator from Arizona (Mr. Kelly) are necessarily absent.    Mr. President, today, the Senate will vote to confirm  Judge Andrew Schopler, who has been nominated to the U.S. District  Court for the Southern District of California.   Since 2016, Judge Schopler has served as a magistrate judge for the  Southern District of California. To date, he has presided over five  misdemeanor trials. Prior to his Federal judicial appointment, he  served as a judge pro tem for 5 years on the San Diego Superior Court's  Small Claims Court, where he presided over dozens of civil bench  trials. Before joining the bench, Judge Schopler served the Southern  District of California as an Assistant U.S. Attorney for 12 years,  spending 4 years in the general crimes section, four in the criminal  enterprise/narcotics enforcement section, and four in the major frauds  and special prosecutions section, where he served as deputy chief.  Judge Schopler began his legal career in North Carolina as an assistant  public defender at the Orange and Chatham County Public Defender's  Office and in private practice. He tried approximately 55 cases to  verdict or judgment and was sole counsel in 39. Since 2014, Judge  Schopler has also served this country as a major in the U.S. Army,  California Army National Guard. In 2018, he deployed to Afghanistan for  8 months.   Born in Chapel Hill, NC, Judge Schopler earned his J.D. cum laude  from Harvard Law School in 1997 and his B.A. summa cum laude from  Dartmouth College in 1994. Senators Feinstein and Padilla strongly  support Judge Schopler's nomination. The American Bar Association has  also unanimously rated him ``well qualified'' to serve on the Southern  District of California.   I urge all of my colleagues to join me in supporting this highly  qualified nominee.    I announce that the Senator from California (Mrs.  Feinstein), the Senator from Pennsylvania (Mr. Fetterman), the Senator  from Arizona (Mr. Kelly), and the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Sanders)  are necessarily absent.

Mr. President, today, the Senate will vote to confirm  Arun Subramanian to the U.S. District Court for the Southern District  of New York.   Mr. Subramanian attended Case Western Reserve University and Columbia  Law School. After graduating, he went on to clerk at all levels of the  Federal judiciary--first for Judge Dennis Jacobs on the Second Circuit  Court of Appeals, then for Judge Gerard E. Lynch on the U.S. District  Court for the Southern District of New York, and finally for Justice  Ruth Bader Ginsburg on the U.S. Supreme Court.   Mr. Subramanian then entered private practice in Manhattan, where he  has focused on complex civil litigation. His work has covered a wide  variety of issue areas, including State and Federal false claims,  commercial and employment contract disputes, tort actions, securities,  antitrust, fraud, and patent litigation. Mr. Subramanian has also  dedicated hundreds of hours to his pro bono work, and he also  coordinates his law firm's pro bono activities.   He was unanimously rated ``well qualified'' by the ABA and received a  bipartisan vote in committee. In addition, he has the strong support of  his home State Senators--Mr. Schumer and Mrs. Gillibrand--and his  Supreme Court co-clerks. His fellow clerks emphasized that they had  witnessed Mr. Subramanian's ``collegial, candid, and fair-minded  temperament.''   Given his significant litigation experience and strong ties to the  Southern District of New York, Mr. Subramanian will make an excellent  addition to the District Court bench. I strongly support his nomination  and urge my colleagues to do the same.    I announce that the Senator from California (Mrs.  Feinstein), the Senator from Pennsylvania (Mr. Fetterman), and the  Senator from Arizona (Mr. Kelly) are necessarily absent.

Mr. President, today, the Senate voted to confirm Judge  Robert Ballou to the U.S. District Court for the Western District of  Virginia.   Born in Roanoke, VA, Judge Ballou received both his bachelor's degree  and J.D. from the University of Virginia. After clerking for Judge  Peter H. Beer on the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of  Louisiana, Judge Ballou began his legal career at Christian, Barton,  Epps, Brent & Chappell as an associate, where he worked on a variety of  matters, including insurance defense, products liability, and traffic  and misdemeanor offenses. He then went on to work for Johnson, Ayers &  Matthews, PLC as an associate, where he tried more than 50 cases to  verdict before a jury, including matters involving personal injury,  products liability, and construction defects. In 2011, Judge Ballou was  appointed to serve as a U.S. magistrate judge for the same district to  which he is now nominated. As a magistrate, he has presided over  approximately 300 cases.   The American Bar Association rated Judge Ballou unanimously ``well  qualified,'' and he has the strong support of Senators Warner and  Kaine. Judge Ballou's deep ties to the Virginia legal community,  combined with his significant courtroom experience, will make him an  excellent addition to the Federal district court bench.   I was pleased to support his nomination.                            ____________________
