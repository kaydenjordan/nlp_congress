 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the  Reverend Dr. Jonathan L. Weaver on his 30th pastoral anniversary.   As the pastor of the Greater Mt. Nebo African Methodist Episcopal  Church, which was founded 140 years ago, Reverend Weaver provides  outstanding spiritual leadership in Maryland's Fourth Congressional  District and the entire region.   Pastor Weaver has a deep and active faith, and lives that faith not  just with words, but with deeds. He has committed his life to lifting  up people--to feeding the hungry and caring for the poor, comforting  the afflicted and making peace--where there is strife. He has overseen  not only the church's growth, but the charitable works of more than 50  ministries that serve its members and the wider community.  [[Page H8156]]    Pastor Weaver has led missions to Africa, serves as national  president of a 500-church ecumenical association, and board chairman of  the oldest and largest African-American community bank in the national  capital region.   Mr. Speaker, as Reverend Weaver continues his service to our  community, I am confident that he will continue ``to do justice, and to  love kindness, and to walk humbly with our God.''                            ____________________
