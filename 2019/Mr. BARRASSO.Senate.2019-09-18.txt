 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, for the information of Senators, the  cloture vote on the compound motion to go to conference on S. 1790 will  occur at this time. I ask unanimous consent that if the compound motion  is agreed to, it be in order for the following motions to instruct,  which are at the desk--Van Hollen, Cotton, Jones, Schatz, Peters,  McSally, McConnell or designee--to be considered at a time to be  determined by the majority leader in consultation with the Democratic  leader, but prior to September 26, in the form of Senate resolutions  taken up and considered on the same day with no amendments in order.
