 Mr. President, I am here on a very important  bipartisan bill, but I first wanted to address the fact that I am proud  to be supporting Judge Jackson.   I think she has incredible legal experience--more experience as a  judge going into the job than four of the people had when they went on  to the Supreme Court.   She is in the top two for trial experience. She showed incredible  grace under pressure when one over-the-top, inappropriate question was  asked of her after another.   She will be walking into that Supreme Court with her head held high,  and she is going to be confirmed next week.   As I said, I will speak more to this later. I spoke a lot about it in  the Judiciary Committee, but she is going to be a great Supreme Court  Justice.                          Ocean Shipping Reform Act    Mr. President, I rise today to highlight my bill with Senator Thune,  which just passed the Senate, the Ocean Shipping Reform Act.   We worked for months together on this bill to come to an agreement.  We did everything right and got cosponsors on both sides of the aisle.  I particularly want to thank Baz, my staff member on the Commerce  Committee, who did such a great job in working on this. And I also want  to thank Senators Cantwell and Wicker for their support of the bill as  the chair and ranking member on the Commerce Committee. We worked  together on some changes to the bill, and I appreciated their input.   As U.S. Senators representing Minnesota and South Dakota, Senator  Thune and I know how crucial it is for American businesses to be able  to export throughout the country and across the globe. American farmers  feed the world, and consumers and businesses look to them for in-demand  agricultural goods like soybeans, corn, dairy, poultry, pork, and beef,  just to name a few. And American manufacturers support so many of the  essential parts and products that fill our jobs, businesses, and store  shelves.   As I look at our economy as we come out of this economic downturn, we  must be an economy and a country that makes stuff, that invents things,  that exports to the world. No matter how much American ingenuity we  have--and there is a lot of it--if ships owned by foreign interests are  going to other countries with empty containers and exporting nothing  but air and then come to our country filled with foreign goods, that is  not exactly an even playing field.   As the past 2 years have highlighted, significant supply chain  disruptions and vulnerabilities have occurred. There are many answers  here, one of them being workforce, one of them being port  infrastructure and rail infrastructure and the like, but what we have  seen when it comes to shipping--and I am so glad my colleague from  South Dakota has joined me here on the floor--what we have seen in the  middle of the country, where people are pretty sensible, all of a  sudden they are looking at this, and they see the price of shipping  containers increase by four times in just 2 years. Four times--that is  not normal.    We have also heard from U.S. companies that they have only been able  to ship 60 percent of their orders because they can't access the  shipping containers. At the same time, these ocean carriers--almost all  foreign-owned--have reported record profits. It is estimated that the  container shipping industry made a record $190 billion in profits in  2021, a sevenfold increase from the previous year.   Their financial performance isn't a result of improved performance  when our manufacturers and farmers can't ship out their goods, no. They  are fleecing consumers and exporters because they know they can get  away with it, and this is all while exporters and consumers are  literally paying the price for the supply chain disruptions caused by  unreliable service.   (Ms. CORTEZ MASTO assumed the Chair.)   We need to get exports to those who need them, but it is plainly  obvious that the ocean carriers are prioritizing non-American shipments  at the expense of both American exporters--as in manufacturers, so many  of them in Minnesota and South Dakota, as Senator Thune knows, being  small businesses--as well as farmers and American consumers. It isn't  sustainable, and it isn't acceptable. We can't let ocean carriers slow  down our supply chain while shaking down our American businesses and  farmers for their own profit.   That is why we introduced the Ocean Shipping Reform Act. It just  passed the Senate. Our bill protects American farmers and manufacturers  by making it easier for them to ship ready-to-export goods waiting at  our ports. Our bill aims to level the playing field for American  exporters by updating the Federal rules for the global shipping  industry.   It will give the Federal Maritime Commission greater authority to  regulate harmful practices by these big international carriers. It  directs the Federal Maritime Commission to issue a rule prohibiting  international ocean carriers from unreasonably declining shipping  opportunities for U.S. exports. This will make it harder for them to  leave our products behind, just sitting there at a port, in favor of  shipping over to China, sailing over to China, and then bringing their  products back to us.   In addition to giving the FMC more authority to investigate bad  practices by ocean carriers, the bill also directs the Federal Maritime  Commission to set new rules for what the international carrier  companies can reasonably charge and require them to certify and  ultimately prove that fees that they charge are fair. As rates continue  to climb, this is more urgent than ever.  [[Page S1897]]    And I personally believe that, even before this rule goes into  effect, the fact that we passed this unanimously in the U.S. Senate  sent a pretty strong shot across the bow because there is so much more  we could do and we will do if this practice continues.   As I was working on this bill with Senator Thune, I heard about  exporters who wanted to speak out against these predatory practices but  were scared into silence because they feared that the ocean carriers  would retaliate. That is why our bill includes strong anti-retaliation  protection for shippers. In short, this bipartisan legislation says to  the foreign-owned shipping alliances: Charge fair prices, stop  profiting off our backs, and fill your empty crates with American-made  products.   Senator Thune and I have a bipartisan group of 29 cosponsors  representing a variety of regions: Senators Cantwell; Wicker; Baldwin;  Hoeven; Stabenow; Marshall; Peters; Moran; Blumenthal; Young; Kelly;  Crapo; Smith of Minnesota; Blackburn; Booker; Ernst; Cortez Masto, the  Presiding Officer; Braun; Warnock; Risch; Bennet; Cramer; Wyden; Blunt;  Van Hollen; Boozman; Fischer; Padilla; and Hickenlooper.   The legislation earned the endorsement of the American Association of  Port Authorities, which represents more than 130 Port authorities  across North and South America, including my own port of Duluth. This  bill is also endorsed by more than 100 organizations, including the  Agriculture Transportation Coalition, the National Retail Federation,  the American Trucking Associations, and the Consumer Technology  Association.    I also want to mention the House leaders on this bill-- Representatives   John Garamendi and Dusty Johnson of South Dakota-- whose companion legislation has already passed the House. I see this as  a truly bipartisan solution to a problem that is impacting millions of  Americans and a great example of what is possible when we work  together.   I want to congratulate Senator Thune for his great leadership. He may  be a bit taller than I, but we have worked together on many, many  things across our borders.
