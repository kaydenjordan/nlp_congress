 Mr. Speaker, our so-called Commander in Chief is over  in Europe where he criticized some of our closest allies as being  delinquent. What is wrong with him? Hypocrisy is clearly not a  constraint to behavior.   TrumpCare, the Republican healthcare plan that would strip away  protections for preexisting conditions and will cause premiums, copays,  and deductibles to go up, is delinquent. The Republican tax scam, where  83 percent of the benefits go to the wealthiest 1 percent in America to  subsidize the lifestyles of the rich and shameless is delinquent. The  fake Republican infrastructure plan that will do nothing to fix our  Nation's crumbling bridges, roads, and tunnels is delinquent.   Republicans have a raw deal. Democrats have A Better Deal. We are  going to do everything possible to make life better for the people.                            ____________________
