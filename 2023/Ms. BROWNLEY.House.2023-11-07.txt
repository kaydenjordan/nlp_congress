 Madam Speaker, it is with a heavy heart that I come  before this body to remember the 12 innocent lives lost 5 years ago  today at Borderline Bar and Grill in Thousand Oaks, California.   Our community was forever changed by this tragedy inflicted by the  plague of gun violence that continues to permeate every corner of our  country.   While House Republicans wasted precious time fighting with each other  over electing a new Speaker for 21 days and 21 hours, there were 33  more mass shootings, 1,030 people died from gun violence, and another  2,072 people were injured.   Within hours of Speaker Johnson being elected, there was a mass  shooting in Maine that resulted in the tragic loss of 18 lives and left  13 others injured.   Madam Speaker, the American people are no longer satisfied with empty  offers of thoughts and prayers in times of such tragedies. They want  action, not meaningless words.   In memory of the Borderline 12, I call on Speaker Johnson and my  Republican colleagues to bring commonsense, lifesaving gun safety  legislation, including a ban on assault weapons, to the floor now.                            ____________________
