 Madam Speaker, it is with great pride I rise today to  recognize Steve Kramer from Dyer, Indiana, as the 2020 recipient of the  United Steelworkers' Leo Gerard Visionary Award.   Steve has been a proud union member in the United Steelworkers  District 7 for over 36 years. He is the former president of the USW  Local 9777 and  [[Page H4383]]  now serves as vice president. He is also a councilman for the town of  Dyer in the First District.   Steve's hard work and dedication to our steelworkers' labor unions  and his community is what makes his work truly visionary and  commendable.   I am proud that northwest Indiana is home to so many hardworking and  dedicated members of the United Steelworkers. Every day, I appreciate  their invaluable contributions to the strength of our economy, our  workforce, and our community.   Congratulations, Steve, for your exemplary leadership of the  steelworkers and all workers.                            ____________________
