 Mr. President, I rise this morning on a few topics, but  I first want to mention that last night many of us spent some time at  the White House where we were regaled by the wonderful Marine and Army  chorus, where there was talk about renewing a spirit of bipartisanship  in Washington.   I am all for it. Of course, we Democrats hope that the President and  Republicans in Congress will sit down with us in a true spirit of  bipartisanship because so far in this Congress--the Republicans in this  Congress so far--the Republican idea of bipartisanship has meant to  both the President and the Republicans in Congress: We come up with our  plan, and you Democrats should support it. That is not bipartisanship.   The Republican leader, the House Speaker, have come up with issue  after issue, including a Supreme Court nominee, with no Democratic  consultation, and then said: The only way you can achieve  bipartisanship is just to vote with us.   You can't improve the healthcare system with only Republican votes on  reconciliation, without consulting any Democrats, without a single  sentence of Democratic input, and call that an attempt at  bipartisanship.   You can't do an infrastructure package of tax credits and no real  spending, and then ask for bipartisan support. And you certainly can't  out-source your entire selection of Supreme Court Justices to be  handpicked by the hard-right, special interest-dominated Heritage  Foundation and Federalist Society, and then ask for us to vote for that  nominee as a show of bipartisan support.   Bipartisanship means sitting down with the other side, getting our  ideas, and hashing out a compromise. It does not mean proposing your  policy--particularly when these policies and nominees are so far to the  right--and then making an exhortation for bipartisanship and bemoaning  the absence of it when Democrats don't go along with your way. I truly  hope that the President and Republicans want to renew a spirit of  bipartisanship, but it has to be real, it has to be meant, and their  actions have to follow suit.                          Nomination of Neil Gorsuch    Well, Mr. President, let's talk about the Supreme Court because that  exemplifies exactly what I am talking about. Over the last several  weeks, my Republican friends have tried to paint Judge Neil Gorsuch as  the beau ideal of a neutral and impartial judge. They insist that Judge  Gorsuch is a straight down-the-middle guy, someone who will call the  balls and strikes. The majority leader likes to cite a letter of a  friend of the judge who says ``there is no principled reason'' to  oppose his nomination. Of course, there are several principled reasons  to object to Judge Gorsuch. Today I would like to focus on one in  particular: Judge Gorsuch's long career ties to conservative interests  and conservative ideological groups.   The idea that Judge Gorsuch would simply be a neutral, mainstream  Justice is belied by his career, his judicial record, and, perhaps most  of all, the manner by which he was selected to serve on the Supreme  Court. He was culled from a list handpicked by the Federalist Society  and the Heritage Foundation, conservative organizations that have spent  the last few decades simply trying to shift the balance of the courts  way to the right. Most of my colleagues on the other side know how far  to the right the Heritage Foundation is, and they often grumble at how  they are pulling the party too far over, but Judge Gorsuch was  handpicked by that group, along with the Federalist Society.   Instead of consulting the Senate, President Trump outsourced his  Supreme Court pick to the Federalist Society and the Heritage  Foundation long before an election even took place. The Constitution  does not say the President shall appoint the Supreme Court Justices  with the advice and consent of rightwing special interest groups. It  says he should appoint them with the advice and consent of the Senate.  President Trump didn't consult the Senate; he never even considered it.  He just consulted this list.    Surely my dear friend from Utah, Senator Hatch, must remember when  President Clinton consulted him about his Supreme Court picks. Senator  Hatch told the President not to select Bruce Babbitt and offered  instead the names of Ginsburg and Breyer. President Clinton listened to  Senator Hatch and nominated them instead. Surely my good friend from  Utah also remembers when he suggested to President Obama that Merrick  Garland be nominated to the Supreme Court, calling him a fine man.  President Obama listened and made him his pick.   President Trump is different from all of the past Presidents in so  many ways, so many of them unfortunate, and here is one: Even before  being elected to office, President Trump swore off the entire process  and outsourced the advice and consent process to a list selected by two  ultraconservative organizations.   Take the Heritage Foundation, for example. Are they down the middle?  Are they unbiased? Well, let's listen to some of the things they  believe in, which are way different from most Americans. It is a group  that believes ``freedom'' means businesses have the right to  discriminate against LGBT people. This is a group that believes  ``limited government'' means eliminating resources for the Violence  Against Women Act. This is a group that believes a strong national  defense means discriminatory Executive orders that bar immigrants and  refugees from Muslim-majority countries. This is a group that holds  extreme-right positions, a group that is far, far out of the American  mainstream--and is even out of the Republican mainstream so many  times--and they have handpicked Neil Gorsuch to have a seat on the  highest Court in the land.   Does anyone think the Heritage Foundation or the Federalist Society  would put on their list a judicial moderate who would only call balls  and strikes? Does anyone think there would be all this outside, dark,  undisclosed money being spent to support Judge Gorsuch's nomination if  he were just someone who called balls and strikes? No. There is a  reason all of this dark money is being spent to support him. There is a  reason the Federalist Society and the Heritage Foundation liked Judge  Gorsuch enough to put him on the President's short list. There is a  reason the President pledged to select only from this list. He wanted  to curry favor with skeptical hard-right, special interest-dominated  conservatives during his campaign. So the idea that Judge Gorsuch would  simply be some neutral Justice does not hold water.   When Republicans say that if Democrats will not support Judge  Gorsuch, we will not support any Republican-nominated judge, that is  simply not true. We have several reasons to be concerned with Judge  Gorsuch specifically, and specifically one of those things we are  concerned about is that he was pushed forward from the Heritage  Foundation and Federalist Society, groomed by billionaire conservatives  like Mr. Anschutz, another hard-right, special interest person.   Judge Gorsuch had a chance. Most of us waited till after the hearings  because at the hearings he had a chance to distance himself from these  views, but he refused to substantively answer question after question.   So if Judge Neil Gorsuch fails to reach 60 votes, which, by the way,  the American people believe is the appropriate standard for a Supreme  Court nominee, it is not because Democrats are being obstructionists;  it is because he failed to convince 60 Senators that he belongs on the  Supreme Court. In that event, the answer is not to permanently change  the rules and traditions of the Senate; the answer is to change the  nominee and do what President Clinton and President Obama did before  they nominated people: Consult the other party for some semblance of  bipartisanship.   The majority is trying to make this a binary choice: Confirm Gorsuch  or change the rules. It is not so; it is just not so. The idea that if  Judge Gorsuch can't get 60, we must immediately move to change the  rules is a false narrative. If the majority chooses to go that route,  they do so at their own volition. No one is forcing them to do so,  [[Page S2058]]  except maybe the Heritage Foundation and groups like the Federalist  Society.                                 Border Wall    Mr. President, there is one thing I want to say about the wall. I  talked about the wall yesterday, and I am not going to elaborate, but I  would like to add to the Record a quote about the wall from none other  than the Secretary of Interior, former Republican Congressman, Mr.  Zinke, from Montana. Here is what he said. This is his quote about the  wall, and I hope my colleagues will listen:         The border is complicated, as far as building a physical       wall. . . . The Rio Grande, what side of the river are you       going to put the wall? We're not going to put it on our side       and cede the river to Mexico. And we're probably not going to       put it in the middle of the river.                             Affordable Care Act    Mr. President, finally, on the Affordable Care Act, today, 44 Senate  Democrats are sending a letter to the President who puts onto paper our  official offer to work with him to improve the existing law.   Last Friday, in the wake of TrumpCare's defeat in the House, I was  deeply concerned to hear the President say that he wants the Affordable  Care Act to ``explode.'' The President and his HHS Secretary, Tom  Price, have significant latitude to either improve the law or undermine  it. So far, the President has undermined the law. These were all before  the vote: He discontinued the advertising campaigns to get people to  sign up for coverage and worked behind the scenes to give insurers  flexibility to offer less generous care, and, still, the President's  Executive order directing agencies to help him repeal and replace the  ACA is hanging out there after the defeat or lack of a vote in the  House, causing instability in the market and giving Federal agencies  permission to undermine the law. That should be rescinded.   What our letter says today is simple: If the President drops these  efforts to undermine the law, we Democrats stand ready to sit down with  him and with our Republican friends across the aisle in good faith to  discuss a bipartisan approach to improving our healthcare system.   It is time to work together to make healthcare even more affordable  but not to encourage or root for the failure of the law that would have  devastating consequences for millions of Americans.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.                          Reservation of Leader Time    The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the leadership time  is reserved.   The Senator from Utah.
