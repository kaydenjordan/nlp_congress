 Madam President, I thank my colleague from Texas. I  appreciate his leadership on this.   Juneteenth is among the oldest celebrations of emancipation and is  certainly worthy of a Federal holiday. I want to read an op-ed from the  Washington Post, written by the musician Usher, which I think  eloquently sums up why it is not only important to honor this day as a  Federal holiday, but it is also important to recognize it as a part of  American history.   I ask unanimous consent to introduce the Washington Post op-ed in  full into the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                              [June 18, 2020]   Usher: Why It's So Important That Juneteenth Become a National Holiday                           (By Usher Raymond IV)         Usher Raymond IV is a musician, actor and entrepreneur.        At the 2015 Essence Music Festival in New Orleans, I wore a       T-shirt that caught a lot of people's attention. The design       was simple. The words ``July Fourth'' were crossed out and       under them, one word was written: ``Juneteenth.'' I wore the       shirt because, for many years, I celebrated the Fourth of       July without a true understanding that the date of       independence for our people, black people, is actually June       19, 1865: the day that the news of the Emancipation       Proclamation finally reached some of the last people in       America still held in bondage.        I have no issue with celebrating America's independence on       July 4. For me, wearing the shirt was an opportunity to       inform others who may not necessarily know the history of       black people in America, and who are not aware that       Juneteenth is our authentic day of self-determination. It is       ours to honor the legacy of our ancestors, ours to celebrate       and ours to remember where we once were as a people. And it       should be a national holiday, observed by all Americans.        Growing up in Chattanooga, Tenn., I was taught in school       one version of U.S. history  [[Page S4613]]       that frequently excluded the history of my family and my       community. The black history I learned came from the ``Eyes       On the Prize'' documentary that aired during Black History       Month. That was where I learned about Emmett Till, Rosa Parks       and the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. When I moved to Atlanta       at age 13, I went deeper and discovered more about the       movement, the horrors of slavery and the resilience of our       people. I came to understand Juneteenth's history a decade       ago during a period of reflection and in pursuit of any       ancestral history that would tell me who I am.        The liberation Juneteenth commemorates is cause for       celebration, but it also reminds us how equality can be       delayed. On June 19, 1865, on the shores of Galveston, Tex.,       Union Gen. Gordon Granger arrived by boat to announce to       enslaved African Americans that the Civil War had ended and       they were now free. While President Lincoln's Emancipation       Proclamation was issued two and a half years prior, and the       Civil War had ended in April of that year, it wasn't until       June 19, 1865, that almost all of our ancestors were free. We       should honor their lives and celebrate that day of freedom       forever.        I cherish the words of Nina Simone. I respect the legacy of       Harry Belafonte and the unapologetic blackness of James       Brown. I admire the entrepreneurship of Madam C.J. Walker. I       have learned from my elders. Their wisdom has taught me to       use my voice to support my people, so many of whom are       hurting right now. Making sure that our history is told is       critical to supporting and sustaining our growth as a people.       The least we deserve is to have this essential moment       included in the broader American story.        I am humbled by the platform that has been given to me       because of my musical talents, but I know I must do more with       it. As an artist, it is my duty to reflect the trying times       in which we live. My heart is shattered by the ongoing       injustices in this country, incited by its long history of       racism that has led to deadly outcomes for too many of our       people. This country must change.        And it must change quickly.        Recognizing Juneteenth as a national holiday would be a       small gesture compared with the greater social needs of black       people in America. But it can remind us of our journey toward       freedom, and the work America still has to do.        We could observe it, as many black Americans already do, by       celebrating both our first step toward freedom as black       people in America and also the many contributions to this       land: the construction of Black Wall Street; the invention of       jazz, rock n' roll, hip-hop and R&B and all the       entrepreneurship and business brilliance, extraordinary       cuisine, sports excellence, political power and global       cultural influence black Americans have given the world.        And rather than observing Juneteenth as we do other       holidays, by taking it off, we can make it a day when black       culture, black entrepreneurship and black business get our       support. A national Juneteenth observance can affirm that       Black Lives Matter!        What changes do you hope will come out of protests and       debates about police and race? Write to us.        I proudly join the incredible people and organizations who       have been working on this for years, among them the inspiring       Opal Lee, a 93-year-old from Fort Worth, Tex., who has       campaigned for the recognition of Juneteenth at the state and       local level. There has never been a more urgent time than now       to get this done. On Thursday, Sens. Tina Smith (D-Minn.),       Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.), Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.)       and Cory Booker (D-N.J.) announced that they are introducing       legislation to make Juneteenth a federal holiday. Congress       must pass this bill immediately.        As we celebrate today, let's stay open to possibility.       Let's support black-owned businesses today and every day.       Let's uplift our resilient history. Let's honor our people.       Happy Juneteenth, America.     Usher wrote:         The liberation Juneteenth commemorates is cause for       celebration, but it also reminds us of how equality can be       delayed.

So thank you to my colleague from Texas. I am glad to stand with him  in making Juneteenth a Federal holiday.    Mr. President, reserving the right to object, it is  notable to me that we are gathered here today, while in Atlanta we are  celebrating the life of  John Lewis. In this moment, I think it is  worth remembering that when Congress was debating whether to make a  Federal holiday honoring Martin Luther King, Jr.--Dr. King, in the  1980s--people made this same kind of argument about its potential cost.  Ronald Reagan made this argument. But President Reagan came around, and  he signed into law this bill, and now that holiday is celebrated  nationwide as a day of reflection and rededication to progress toward  racial justice. Just as the civil rights movement is honored as an  important milestone in the history of this country, so should be  emancipation.   Just as the argument that it is too expensive to give Federal  employees a day off was wrong regarding Martin Luther King Day, it is  wrong for Juneteenth. And just as Ronald Reagan got on the right side  of history, I think that we will get on the right side of history, and  we will finally have a full holiday to commemorate Juneteenth, not as a  holiday with an asterisk, not as a half holiday, but as a full holiday;  therefore, I object to this modification    Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the career  of Minnesota Adjutant General Jon Jensen and to congratulate him on the  next step in his career. On Friday, Major General Jensen will be  promoted to lieutenant general and become our Nation's next Director of  the Army National Guard. In this position he will oversee the national  activities of the Army National Guard and work to ensure the Army Guard  remains one of our finest public institutions.   General Jensen joined the Iowa National Guard's 168th Infantry  Regiment in 1989 before later transferring to the Minnesota National  Guard in 2002. Through hard work and dedication, he rose to become the  Minnesota National Guard's 31st Adjutant General in November, 2017. In  this role, General Jensen has served as the head of Minnesota's Army  and Air National Guard, where he has demonstrated the highest levels of  duty, honor, and service.   I have had the pleasure of working with General Jensen during my time  in office at the State and Federal levels. He is a proven leader who  has seen the Minnesota Guard through deployments, natural disasters,  and preparing the Minnesota Guard to meet future challenges. We worked  closely to preserve the National Guard's access to the Readiness and  Environment Protection Initiative, REPI, a program which both ensures  the Guard's ability to carry out critical training and also works to  conserve the natural habitat surrounding military bases. General Jensen  has been a strong advocate for this program and worked with my office  to ensure National Guard installations across the Nation have continued  access to the REPI Program. This is just one example that demonstrates  General Jensen's dedication to service which makes him an outstanding  choice to be the next Director of the Army National Guard.   In addition to the outstanding job General Jensen has done running  the Minnesota National Guard, he is also inspiring, intelligent, and  optimistic--all important qualities in a strong leader and qualities  that have helped General Jensen make outstanding contributions  throughout his more than 30 years of service. Given his strong  qualifications, leadership qualities, and extensive experience, I  cannot think of a better candidate to become our Nation's next Director  of the Army National Guard.   On behalf of myself and all Minnesotans, thank you for your dedicated  service to Minnesota and our Nation. I know you will excel in your new  role, and I look forward to continuing to work with you for many years  to come.                            ____________________
