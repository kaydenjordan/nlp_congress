 Mr. President, as the Senate reconvenes to cross more  items off our to-do list, we should take pride in all we have already  accomplished this summer.   This month alone, we have already advanced the Senate's farm bill to  conference and named conferees to finalize this important legislation.  We have also passed another set of appropriations measures. The Senate  has now approved 7 of the 12 measures for next year, and we finalized  the John S. McCain National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year  2019, which President Trump signed into law on Monday of this week.   The reason we are convening today is that important work remains for  the weeks ahead. That includes more progress on appropriations, and it  includes confirming more of the President's nominees.   Last week, Chairman Grassley announced that Judiciary Committee  hearings for Judge Brett Kavanaugh, whom the President has nominated to  serve on the Supreme Court, will begin September 4.   Judge Kavanaugh's testimony will only add to the enormous wealth of  information about his legal qualifications, his professional  reputation, and his jurisprudence that is already available. Already  the committee has received nearly 200,000 pages of material that relate  to this nomination. By all accounts, this is already the most material  ever submitted for any Supreme Court nomination--the most material  ever.   Of course, the best indicator of how Judge Kavanaugh will approach  the role of a Federal judge is the way he has discharged his duties as  a Federal judge in the 12-plus years he served on the DC Circuit  Court--12-plus years, more than 300 opinions.   I can hardly articulate this point better than my friend the senior  Senator from Vermont. Back when the Senate was evaluating the  nomination of then-Judge Sonia Sotomayor to the Supreme Court, Senator  Leahy said: We do not have to imagine what kind of a judge she will be  because we see the kind of judge she has been.   A number of other prominent Democrats echoed that sentiment,  including my friend the Democratic leader. He called Republican  requests for additional documents related to the Sotomayor nomination a  ``fishing expedition'' and said Republicans were ``grasping at  straws.'' My friend from New York said ``everybody knows'' that then- Judge Sotomayor's ``record on the bench'' was ``the best way to  evaluate'' her nomination.   So I hope that our Democratic colleagues who are demanding even more  documents have taken the time to read the 12 years of opinions from  Judge Kavanaugh that they already have. That, of course, will  underscore exemplary service on the second highest court in the Nation.   When it was the Supreme Court nominee of a Democratic President, they  themselves insisted that judicial opinions were more important than any  other papers for evaluating a Supreme Court nominee. Well, well, we  have Judge Kavanaugh's opinions, and we have this record-breaking pile  of additional materials--far more materials than were produced for the  Sotomayor nomination, by the way--12 years of opinions and the most  material in history. Every Senator who is actually willing to give this  nominee fair consideration will be more than fully equipped to do just  that.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to legislative session and be in a period of morning business,  with Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, I ask the Chair to lay before the  Senate the House message to accompany S. 717.   The Presiding Officer laid before the Senate the following message  from the House of Representatives:         Resolved, That the bill from the Senate (S. 717) entitled       ``An Act to promote pro bono legal services as a critical way       in which to empower survivors of domestic violence.'', do       pass with an amendment.     I move to concur in the House amendment, and I ask  unanimous consent that the motion be agreed to and that the motions to  reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 9:30 a.m.,  Thursday, August 16; further, that following the prayer and pledge, the  morning hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved  to date, the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later  in the day, and morning business be closed; further, that following  leader remarks, the Senate proceed to executive session and resume  consideration of the Quattlebaum nomination and that notwithstanding  rule XXII, all postcloture time on the nomination be considered expired  at noon.    Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned  under the previous order.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 6:34 p.m., adjourned until  Thursday, August 16, 2018, at 9:30 a.m.                            ____________________
