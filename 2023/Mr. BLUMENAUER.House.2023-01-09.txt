 Mr. Speaker, I appreciate how Mr. Neal laid out the  facts here.   The Family and Small Business Taxpayer Protection Act is a sham. The  facts are that this legislation will shield tax cheats at the expense  of working families.   The last time Republicans were in charge, they systematically  defunded the IRS. The agency lost nearly 20 percent of its funding,  shed more than 20,000 employees, and the audit rate for millionaires  dropped 70 percent. We heard one of our Republican colleagues make that  point.   This legislation will enable those at the top of the heap to be able  to remember the taxes they should have reported. It raises, as we have  heard, $187 billion in revenue. This bill, if enacted, would add to the  deficit $114 billion because it is misguided and misdirected and wrong.   Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge the rejection of this legislation  enforcement of the laws for everybody.
