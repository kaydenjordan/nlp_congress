 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have my opinion  memorandum in the impeachment trial of President Donald J. Trump be  printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:      Opinion Memorandum of United States Senator John F. Reed in the              Impeachment Trial of President Donald John Trump                                 I. FINDINGS         On January 13, 2021, the United States House of       Representatives passed House Resolution 24,\1\ ``Impeaching       Donald John Trump, President of the United States, for high       crimes and misdemeanors.''        Based on the evidence in the record, the arguments of the       House Impeachment Managers, and the arguments of President's       Counsel, I conclude as follows: Mr. Trump has violated his       oath to take care that the laws be faithfully executed and       has acted in a manner that is fundamentally incompatible with       the constitutional order. The House Impeachment Managers have       proven that Mr. Trump's incitement of insurrection amounts to       the constitutional standard of ``high Crimes and       Misdemeanors'' for which the remedy of conviction and       disqualification is warranted.                II. THE CONSTITUTIONAL GROUNDS FOR IMPEACHMENT         ``The Senate shall have the sole Power to try all       Impeachments.'' \2\ With these few words, the Framers of the       Constitution entrusted the Senate with the most awesome power       within a democratic society: whether to remove an impeached       president from office.      A. High Crimes and Misdemeanors        The Constitution states, ``The President, Vice President       and all civil Officers of the United States, shall be removed       from Office on Impeachment for, and Conviction of, Treason,       Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.'' \3\        ``Treason'' and ``Bribery'' are foundational impeachable       offenses. No more heinous example of an offense against the       constitutional order exists than betrayal of the nation to an       enemy or betrayal of duty for personal enrichment. A       President commits treason when he levies war against the       United States or gives comfort or aid to its enemies.\4\ As       the House Judiciary Committee explained, a President engages       in impeachable bribery when he ``offers, solicits, or accepts       something of personal value to influence his own official       actions.'' \5\        In interpreting ``high Crimes and Misdemeanors,'' we must       not only look to the Federalist Papers and the records of the       Constitutional Convention, but also to the contemporary and       foundational writings on Impeachment available to the       Framers.        Sir William Blackstone, whose influential Commentaries on       the Laws of England were published from 1765-1770, discussed       a classification of crimes he termed ``public wrongs, or       crimes and misdemeanors'' that he defined as breaches of the       public duty an individual owed to their entire community.\6\       Blackstone viewed treason, murder, and robbery as ``public       wrongs,'' not only because they cause injury to individuals       but also because they ``strike at the very being of society.       '' \7\        Richard Wooddeson, a legal scholar who began giving       lectures on English law in 1777, defined impeachable offenses       as misdeeds that fail to clearly fall under the jurisdiction       of ordinary tribunals. These wrongs were ``abuse[s] of high       offices of trust'' that damaged the commonwealth.\8\        Much the same as Blackstone and Wooddeson, Alexander       Hamilton included the dual components of abuse of public       trust and national harm in his definition of impeachable       crimes and misdemeanors. In Federalist Paper No. 65, Hamilton       defined an impeachable offense as ``those offenses which       proceed from the misconduct of public men, or in other words       from the abuse or violation of some public trust. They are of       a nature which may with peculiar propriety be denominated       POLITICAL, as they relate chiefly to injuries done       immediately to the society itself.'' \9\      B. The Constitutional Debates        Adding impressive support to these consistent views of the       meaning of the constitutional term, ``high Crimes and       Misdemeanors,'' is the history of the deliberations at the       Constitutional Convention.        The convention delegates considered limiting Impeachment to       treason and bribery. However, they concluded that these       enumerated offenses alone could not anticipate every manner       of profound misconduct that a future president might engage       in.\10\ George Mason, a delegate from Virginia, declared that       ``high crimes and misdemeanors'' would be an apt way to       further capture ``great and dangerous offences'' or       ``[a]ttempts to subvert the Constitution.'' \11\        This wording would also set the necessarily high threshold       for Impeachment that would be proportional to the severe       punishment of removing an elected official and       disqualification from holding future public office. Further       insight is provided by James Iredell, a delegate to the North       Carolina Convention that ratified the Constitution, who later       served as a Justice of the United States Supreme Court.       During the Convention debates, Iredell stated:         The power of impeachment is given by this Constitution, to       bring great offenders to punishment . . . This power is       lodged in those who represent the great body of the people,       because the occasion for its exercise will arise from acts of       great injury to the community, and the objects of it may be       such as cannot be easily reached by an ordinary tribunal.\12\         Iredell's understanding sustains the view that an       impeachable offense must cause ``great injury to the       community.'' Private wrongdoing, without a significant,       adverse effect upon the nation, cannot constitute an       impeachable offense. James Wilson, a delegate to the Federal       Constitutional Convention and, like Iredell, later a Supreme       Court Justice, wrote that Impeachments are ``proceedings of a       political nature . . . confined to political characters, to       political crimes and misdemeanors, and to political       punishments.'' \13\        Later commentators expressed similar views. In 1833,       Justice Joseph Story quoted favorably from the scholarship of       William Rawle, who concluded that the ``legitimate causes of       impeachment . . . can have reference only to public       character, and official duty . . . In general, those       offenses, which may be committed equally by a private person,       as a public officer, are not the subject of impeachment.''       \14\        This line of reasoning is buttressed by the careful and       thoughtful work of the House of Representatives during the       Watergate proceedings. The Democratic staff of the House       Judiciary Committee concluded that, ``[b]ecause impeachment       of a President is a grave step for the nation, it is to be       predicated only upon conduct seriously incompatible with       either the constitutional form and principles of our       government or the proper performance of constitutional duties       of the presidential office.'' \15\        The deliberations at the Constitutional Convention also       demonstrate a conscious movement to narrow the terminology as       a means of raising the threshold for the Impeachment process       to require an offense against the State.        Early in the debate on the issue of presidential       Impeachment in July of 1787, it was suggested that       Impeachment and removal could be founded on a showing of       ``malpractice,'' ``neglect of duty,'' or ``corruption.'' \16\       By September of 1787, the issue of presidential Impeachment       had been referred to the Committee of Eleven, which was       created to resolve the most contentious issues.        The Committee of Eleven considered whether the grounds for       Impeachment should be ``treason or bribery.'' \17\ This was       significantly more restricted than the amorphous standard of       ``malpractice,'' too restricted, in fact, for some delegates.       George Mason objected and suggested that       ``maladministration'' be added to ``treason and bribery.''       \18\ James Madison opposed this suggestion as being       ``equivalent to a tenure during pleasure of the Senate.''       \19\ Mason responded by further refining his suggestion and       offered the term ``other high crimes and misdemeanors against       the State.'' \20\ The Mason language was a clear reference to       the English legal history of Impeachment. Mason's proposal       explicitly narrowed these offenses to those ``against the       State.'' The Convention itself further clarified the standard       by replacing ``State'' with the ``United States.'' \21\        At the conclusion of the substantive deliberations on the       constitutional standard of Impeachment, it was obvious that       only serious offenses against the governmental system would       justify Impeachment and subsequent removal from office.       However, the Committee of Style applied the final stylistic       touches to the Constitution. This Committee had no authority       to alter the meaning of the carefully debated language and  [[Page S927]]       could only impose a stylistic consistency through, among       other things, the elimination of redundancy. In its zeal to       streamline the text, the words ``against the United States''       were eliminated as unnecessary to the meaning of the       passage.\22\        The weight of both authoritative commentary and the history       of the Constitutional Convention combines to provide       convincing proof that the Impeachment process was reserved       for serious breaches of the constitutional order that       threaten the country in a direct and immediate manner.      C. An Impeachable Offense is Not Limited to Criminal           Liability or a Defined Offense        Article I, Section 3 of the United States Constitution       provides that ``Judgment in Cases of Impeachment shall not       extend further than to removal from Office, and       disqualification to hold and enjoy any Office of honor, Trust       or Profit under the United States: but the Party convicted       shall nevertheless be liable and subject to Indictment,       Trial, Judgment and Punishment, according to Law.'' \23\ As       Delegate James Wilson wrote, ``impeachments, and offenses and       offenders impeachable [do not come] within the sphere of       ordinary jurisprudence. They are founded on different       principles, are governed by different maxims, and are       directed to different objects: for this reason, the trial and       punishment of an offense on an impeachment, is no bar to a       trial and punishment of the same offence at common law.''       \24\ The independence of the Impeachment process from the       prosecution of crimes underscores the function of Impeachment       as a means to remove a president from office, not only       because of criminal behavior, but because the president poses       a threat to the constitutional order. Criminal behavior is       not irrelevant to an Impeachment, but it only becomes       decisive if that behavior imperils the balance of powers       established in the Constitution.        The assertion that an impeachable offense must be       predicated on a criminal act goes against the well-      established consensus of the legal community. For example,       Mr. Trump's former Attorney General, William Barr, wrote in a       2018 memo to the Department of Justice (DOJ) when he was       still in private practice, that the President ``is answerable       for any abuses of discretion and is ultimately subject to the       judgment of Congress through the impeachment process [which]       means that the president is not the judge in his own cause.''       \25\ As Mr. Barr makes clear, Impeachment does not need to be       based on a crime.        Furthermore, any assertion that an impeachable offense must       involve the violation of an ``already known or established''       law, even if not criminal, is not supported by the       constitutional record. In advocating for the inclusion of       Impeachment at the Constitutional Convention, James Madison       made the case that the country must be protected against any       number of abuses that a president could engage in and which       might cause permanent damage to the country. Madison wrote       that:         [It was] indispensable that some provision should be made       for defending the Community [against] the incapacity,       negligence or perfidy of the chief Magistrate. The limitation       of the period of his service, was not a sufficient security[.       . .] He might pervert his administration into a scheme of       peculation or oppression. He might betray his trust to       foreign powers.\26\         Confining Impeachment to criminal or even codified offenses       goes against the mainstream consensus on the meaning of       ``high Crimes and Misdemeanors'' and would fail to capture       the universe of harms to the constitutional order in which a       President could engage.      D. Conclusion        Authoritative commentary on, together with the structure       of, the Constitution makes it clear that the term, ``other       high Crimes and Misdemeanors,'' encompasses conduct that       involves the president in the impermissible exercise of the       powers of his office to upset the constitutional order.       Moreover, since the essence of Impeachment is removal from       office, rather than punishment for offenses, there is a       strong inference that the improper conduct must represent a       continuing threat to the American people and the       Constitution.                            IV. STANDARD OF PROOF         In an Impeachment trial, each Senator has the obligation to       establish the burden of proof he or she deems proper.\27\ The       Founding Fathers believed maximum discretion was critical for       Senators confronting the gravest of constitutional       choices.\28\ Differentiating Impeachment from criminal       trials, Alexander Hamilton argued, in Federalist Paper No.       65, that Impeachments ``can never be tied down by such strict       rules . . . as in common cases serve to limit the discretion       of courts in favor of personal security.'' \29\ In this       regard, Hamilton further distinguished Impeachment       proceedings from a criminal trial by stressing that an       impeached official would be subject to the established rules       of criminal prosecution after Impeachment.\30\        However, what exact constitutional standard should be used       remains debatable. Practical concerns related to utilizing       the Impeachment power should be considered when determining       the standard of proof required. Too low of a standard may       lead to removal, even if significant doubts exist. A ``. . .       high `criminal' standard of proof could mean, in practice,       that a man could remain president whom every member of the       Senate believed to be guilty of corruption, just because his       guilt was not shown `beyond a reasonable doubt.' '' \31\        When uncertain about the standard of proof to apply, it is       worth reviewing the writings of eminent scholars. In doing       so, I have found a closer approximation to what the standard       should be in many Impeachment trials as compared to those       used in general legal practice: `` `[o]verwhelming       preponderance of the evidence' . . .'' \32\ Yet, I believe       that the severity of removing a president of the United       States warrants an even higher bar. As such, a definition       slightly modified, but modeled on that proposed standard, is       more applicable: overwhelmingly clear and convincing       evidence. This standard more closely comports with historical       analysis of the Founders' desire to separate criminal law and       Impeachment and the arguments made by scholars, while       reflecting the serious constitutional harms alleged in the       Article of Impeachment before the Senate.                  V. CONSTITUTIONALITY OF IMPEACHMENT TRIAL         The President's Counsel has argued that an Impeachment       trial conducted after a president leaves office is       unconstitutional. Specifically, they write, in their trial       brief, ``It is denied that the quoted provision [Article I,       Section 4] currently applies to the 45th President of the       United States since he is no longer `President'.'' \33\ The       President's Counsel hinge their argument on the wording of       Article II, Section 4, which reads, ``The President, Vice       President and all Civil Officers of the United States, shall       be removed from Office on Impeachment for, and Conviction of,       Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.''       The President's Counsel argue that since Mr. Trump is no       longer the president,         ``[T]he clause `shall be removed from Office on Impeachment       for . . .' is impossible for the Senate to accomplish, and       thus the current proceeding before the Senate is void ab       initio as a legal nullity that runs patently contrary to the       plain language of the Constitution . . . Since removal from       office by the Senate of the President is a condition       precedent which must occur before, and jointly with,       `disqualification' to hold future office, the fact that the       Senate presently is unable to remove from office the 45th       President whose term has expired, means that Averment 1 is       therefore irrelevant to any matter before the Senate.'' \34\         Such logic ignores the historical context in which the       Impeachment power was drafted, willfully misinterprets the       language of the Constitution, rejects the precedent set by       previous Senates, and promotes the dangerous concept of a       ``January Exception.'' \35\        Impeachment was not a revolutionary concept at the time the       U.S. Constitution was drafted. The concept had long been part       of English political custom, which framed much of the       Founder's understanding of government.\36\ Indeed, Alexander       Hamilton explicitly stated in Federalist No. 65 that the       Impeachment power was borrowed from English political       history.\37\ Thus, we can understand the bounds of the       Impeachment power from precedents set in English political       history. Two examples from the 18th century are illustrative       of the impeachability of former officials. First, ``[i]n       1725, former Lord Chancellor Macclesfield was impeached and       convicted for acts of bribery committed during his tenure in       office.'' \38\ Second, at the time of the Philadelphia       Convention, Parliament was preparing to conduct an       Impeachment trial against Warren Hastings, the former       Governor General of Bengal. These proceedings commenced after       Hastings had retired from his office. ``The Framers were       acutely aware of the Hastings proceeding, with George Mason       raising it as an example during debate on the Impeachment       clauses.'' \39\ If the Framers had misgivings about       Impeachment of former officials, a concept that would have       been on the public mind given Mr. Hastings' impending       Impeachment trial, surely they would have clarified the       wording of the Impeachment power in the U.S. Constitution.        The practice of impeaching former officers was also common       in the early state governments. ``Between 1776 and 1787, 10       of the newly independent states adopted constitutions that       included impeachment provisions. Five specifically permitted       late Impeachment; no state explicitly forbade it.'' \40\       Moreover, some state constitutions only allowed the       Impeachment of former officials, meaning that future       disqualification from office was central to the very purpose       of Impeachment.\41\ For example, Thomas Jefferson underwent       an Impeachment inquiry in 1781 after his tenure as governor       ended.\42\ What purpose could such a late inquiry have except       to attempt to disqualify a former official from holding       office again in the future? The influence of the early state       constitutions on the drafting of the U.S. Constitution is       widely accepted. This influence no doubt extended to the       Framer's understanding of the Impeachment power as including       former officials.\43\        Indeed, the language of the U.S. Constitution proves this       out. Article I, Section 3, Clause 6 states, ``The Senate       shall have the sole Power to try all Impeachments.'' That is,       the Senate has the power to conduct a trial for any       Impeachment commenced by the House of Representatives without       qualification regarding its timing. The House impeached Mr.       Trump, and it is now in the constitutional power of the       Senate to conduct an Impeachment trial. Article I further       outlines two possible penalties in any Impeachment trial:       removal and disqualification.  [[Page S928]]       The Senate cannot exceed these penalties, nor are these       penalties necessarily linked by the language of the text. The       Senate has the power to remove a president without also       disqualifying him or her from future office. Likewise, legal       scholars assert that disqualification from office need not       follow removal from office.\44\ Such a reading would neuter       the ability of the Senate to disqualify officials from future       office upon their resignation. Hence, an official accused of       crimes against the political order could simply resign to       avoid punishment and potentially retake office in the future.       The Framers understood that the power of a demagogic       president extends beyond his tenure of office. The       disqualification component of the Impeachment power is the       constitutional method for addressing this dangerous       potentiality, for it establishes ``a perpetual ostracism from       the esteem and confidence, and honors and emoluments of his       country.'' \45\        In accordance with English political history, the early       state constitutions, and the clear language of the U.S.       Constitution, the Senate has repeatedly asserted its right to       conduct an Impeachment trial of former government officials.       The first Impeachment trial concerned Senator William Blount       of Tennessee on the charge of conspiracy. After the Senate       expelled Blount from the body in July of 1797, the House       brought five articles of Impeachment against the former       senator in January of 1798 with the intention of       disqualifying him from holding office in the future.\46\ Most       scholars agree that the Senate dismissed the case on the       grounds that the Impeachment power does not extend to Members       of Congress.\47\ The Senate did not, however, dismiss the       case on the basis that Blount was a former official.\48\ The       Senate once again asserted its right to conduct an       Impeachment trial of a former official in the 1876 case of       ex-Secretary of War William Belknap. The House voted to       impeach Belknap after he resigned. The Senate then debated       the constitutionality of late impeachability before asserting       in a 37-29 vote that it had the power to try an ex-      officer.\49\ Though Belknap was not ultimately convicted, the       Senate had decided that it had the power to convict and       disqualify an ex-official. Congress acted once more in the       1926 case of federal judge George English. The House of       Representatives chose not to further pursue Impeachment after       English's resignation, but the House Managers declared ``the       resignation of Judge English in no way affects the right of       the Senate, sitting as a court of impeachment, to hear and       determine [the case].'' \50\ Several Senators similarly       declared the jurisdiction of the Senate in the case of Judge       English.\51\ As these cases demonstrate, the Senate has       repeatedly declared its late-Impeachment powers, though it       has rarely chosen to purse Impeachment.\52\        Finally, the denial of late impeachability promotes the       dangerous and unconstitutional idea of a ``January       Exception.'' One of the central concerns of the Framers was       the diffusion of power across branches in a system of checks       and balances to prevent any one branch, but particularly the       executive, from gaining too much power. Impeachment is the       last line of defense created to hold officials accountable       for their abuse of those powers. Hence the time between       election and inauguration is not a consequence-free period       for an outgoing president. A president who commits an       impeachable offense on the night before his term ends is       still accountable for those actions when he leaves the Oval       Office. After his term as president, John Quincy Adams       proclaimed, ``I hold myself, so long as I have the breath of       life in my body, amendable to impeachment by [the] House for       everything I did during the time I held any public office.''       \53\ The Framers of the Constitution did not intend to grant       Mr. Trump a January reprieve from accountability. He must be       held accountable for his actions during the last weeks of his       presidency.                               VI. DUE PROCESS         The President's Counsel assert that the Impeachment inquiry       is defective because of a lack of due process protections for       Mr. Trump. However, the Constitution does not provide any       guidance about what procedures are proscribed in an       Impeachment trial. Article II, Section 3 states, ``The Senate       shall have the sole power to try all Impeachments.'' \54\       Alexander Hamilton provides context to this in Federalist       Paper No. 65, saying that Impeachments ``can never be tied       down by such strict rules . . . as in common cases serve to       limit the discretion of courts in favor of personal       security.'' \55\        Specifically, President's Counsel asserts that the Speaker       of the House purposefully held onto the Article of       Impeachment, passed by the House of Representatives, in order       to ensure that Mr. Trump's term would end before a Senate       trial commenced. However, at the time H. Res. 24 passed, the       Senate was in recess and not scheduled to return until       January 19th. The Senate Minority Leader urged the Senate       Majority Leader to bring the Senate back into session       immediately in order to receive the Article of Impeachment.       However, the Senate Majority Leader rejected this request,       meaning that even if the House of Representatives had tried       to send the Article to the Senate immediately after passage,       it would not have been considered until the Senate was back       in session.\56\        President's Counsel also assert that the House of       Representatives did not provide proper due process because it       did not hold hearings on the Article of Impeachment. Manager       Lieu analogized the present facts to a case where crimes are       committed in plain view, and prosecutors do not have to spend       a prolonged time investigating before pressing charges.\57\       In this case, the events in question--the ``Save America''       rally, the Electoral Certification, and the ensuing       insurrection--were widely broadcast on television and in news       publications. Those who took part in the attack also       documented their participation over social media including on       Twitter, Instagram, and YouTube.\58\ In the aftermath of the       insurrection, participants were arrested and indicted for       their unlawful and violent actions, and their charging       documents were available to the public.\59\        In addition, President's Counsel, throughout this case, has       conflated the requirements of an Impeachment proceeding with       that of a criminal case, where the Due Process Clause of the       Fifth Amendment applies. These claims are spurious at best.       As constitutional scholar Michael Gerhardt stated in regards       to Mr. Trump first Impeachment, ``First, the [Due Process]       clause does not apply because none of the interests protected       by the due process clause are being denied here--the       sanctions are removal and disqualification but not the       deprivation of life, liberty, or property, which the clause       protects. Second, even if due process applies, it has been       satisfied here: The minimal requirements of due process are       an impartial decision-maker and notice. The president has had       plenty of notice about the impeachment effort, and the       Constitution designates senators as the impartial decision-      makers.'' \60\        ``The Supreme Court has explained . . . that due process is       not a `technical conception with a fixed content unrelated to       time, place, and circumstances.' Instead, the concept is       `flexible and calls for such procedural protections as the       particular situation demands.' '' \61\ In an Impeachment, the       obligation of the Senate is to accord the president, as the       accused, the right to conduct his defense fairly, while       respecting the House of Representative's exclusive       constitutional prerogative to bring Articles of Impeachment.       At the core of the Senate's task is the fundamental       understanding that our system of laws recognizes the rights       of defendants and the responsibilities of the prosecution to       prove its case.        Based on the above analysis, I find that there is       overwhelmingly clear and convincing evidence that Mr. Trump       was afforded due process in this Impeachment proceeding.                       VII. INCITEMENT OF INSURRECTION         House Resolution 24 alleges that, in the conduct of his       office, Mr. Trump incited an insurrection, in violation of       his constitutional duty to take care that the laws be       faithfully executed, and in subversion of the constitutional       order. I find that there is overwhelmingly clear and       convincing evidence that Mr. Trump committed impeachable       conduct. As I will further explain, Mr. Trump must be       convicted and disqualified from holding office for the       conduct described in H. Res. 24.      A. Legal Standards for Incitement        As explained in Section III, Congress is bound neither by       civil nor criminal law in determining whether an offense       meets the standard of ``high Crimes or Misdemeanors.''       However, existing legal frameworks for ``incitement'' are       helpful for analyzing and putting Mr. Trump's words and       conduct into context.        Black's Law Dictionary defines incitement generally as       ``the act or an instance of provoking, urging on, or stirring       up.'' \62\ Specifically in regards to criminal law, Black's       Law Dictionary defines incitement as ``the act of persuading       another person to commit a crime.'' \63\        A group of constitutional law scholars explained that, for       the purposes of Impeachment, a determination of whether a       president's speech or conduct is protected must primarily       take into account whether a president's words are consistent       with the Constitution \64\ and the oath to ``faithfully       execute the office of President of the United States, and . .       . preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United       States.'' \65\ For example, if a president said ``I no longer       promise to support and defend the Constitution of the United       States'' or ``I no longer recognize Congress as a co-equal       branch of government,'' these statements would certainly be       inherently antithetical to the constitutional order that the       president swore to uphold. While these statements may be       lawful and protected by the Constitution in another context,       they would certainly be impeachable.        Turning to the definition of ``insurrection'' itself, the       Corpus Juris Secundum defines it as ``the act of rising in       open resistance against established authority or government,       or as any open and active opposition of a number of persons       to the execution of the laws of the United States of so       formidable a character as to deny, for the time being, the       authority of the government, even though not accompanied by       bloodshed and not of sufficient magnitude to render success       probable.'' \66\        Based on these sources, I will examine the following       questions, in order to determine whether Mr. Trump incited       his supporters to commit insurrection,        (1) What was Mr. Trump's pattern of speech or conduct prior       to the January 6th ``Save America'' rally?        (2) Did Mr. Trump foreseeably or recklessly solicit his       supporters to believe his election lies, and know that his       supporters would take action based on these lies?  [[Page S929]]         (3) Did Mr. Trump's speech or conduct drive his supporters       to commit unlawful or violent acts on January 6th?        (4) What steps did Mr. Trump take once the rioters had       breached the Capitol?      B. Leading Up to January 6, 2021, Mr. Trump Propagated a           False Narrative that the Election Had Been Stolen and           Supported Violent Rhetoric        To determine whether Mr. Trump engaged in incitement, it is       instructive to look at a timeline of Mr. Trump's statements,       direct acts, and actions taken at his behest, leading up to       January 6th.        a. Statements and Conduct Regarding Voter Fraud Before the             2020 Election        Even before the November 2020 election, Mr. Trump gave       credence to the idea that mass voter fraud would be       inevitable, and the only way he would lose was if the       election were stolen. For example, in July, Mr. Trump tweeted       ``With Universal Mail-In Voting (not Absentee Voting, which       is good), 2020 will be the most INACCURATE & FRAUDULENT       Election in history.'' \67\ At an August rally in Wisconsin,       Trump said ``The only way we're going to lose this election       is if the election is rigged, remember that . . . It's the       only way we're going to lose this election. So we have to be       very careful.'' \68\ In September, he told reporters, from       the White House lawn, ``I'm not sure that it [the election]       can be [honest], I don't know that it can be with this whole       situation, unsolicited ballots, they're unsolicited, millions       being sent to everybody.'' \69\        Before the election took place, Mr. Trump also refused to       say whether he would accept the election results. In a July       interview with Chris Wallace, when asked directly whether he       would accept the results of the election, Trump said ``Look,       you--I have to see. No, I'm not going to just say yes.'' \70\       In September, when asked by a reporter if he would commit to       a peaceful transfer of power, Mr. Trump implied that he would       not, saying ``Get rid of the ballots and you'll have a very       peaceful--there won't be a transfer, frankly. There will be a       continuation.'' In the same month, when asked by a reporter       whether the election results would be legitimate only if he       won, Mr. Trump did not give a direct answer, saying, ``So we       have to be very careful with the ballots. The ballots--that's       a whole big scam.'' \71\        b. Statements and Conduct Regarding Voter Fraud After 2020             Election        Once the 2020 election was over, Mr. Trump made it clear       that he would concede under no circumstances, and continued       his full-court press urging Americans not to accept the       election results. In a statement after Mr. Biden was       projected the winner, Mr. Trump said, ``The simple fact is       this election is far from over . . . Beginning Monday, our       campaign will start prosecuting our case in court to ensure       election laws are fully upheld and the rightful winner is       seated. The American People are entitled to an honest       election: that means counting all legal ballots, and not       counting any illegal ballots. This is the only way to ensure       the public has full confidence in our election.'' \72\        Mr. Trump escalated his attack on the election results by       posting a speech on December 2nd, which he taped from behind       the presidential lectern and characterized as potentially       ``the most important speech I've ever made.'' \73\ Over the       course of 46 minutes, Mr. Trump repeated the same baseless       claims of voter fraud, and refused to acknowledge his loss.       Mr. Trump said the nation's election system was ``under       coordinated assault and siege'' and declared that it was       ``statistically impossible'' for him to have lost to Mr.       Biden.\74\ His overall claim was that, ``This election is       about great voter fraud, fraud that has never been seen like       this before.'' \75\        The day after Christmas 2020, Mr. Trump sought to escalate       his narrative that there was a mass effort to deprive him of       a second term. He sent out a series of tweets attacking       executive branch agencies, the federal judiciary, and Senate       Republicans, claiming that they had not done enough to       prevent voter fraud. He tweeted that the Supreme Court ``has       been totally incompetent and weak on the massive Election       Fraud that took place.'' He also tweeted that ``The `Justice'       Department and the FBI have done nothing about the 2020       Presidential Election Voter Fraud.'' Furthermore, he leveled       the claim that ``If a Democrat Presidential Candidate had an       Election Rigged & Stolen, with proof of such acts at a level       never seen before, the Democrat Senators would consider it an       act of war, and fight to the death. Mitch & the Republicans       do NOTHING.'' \76\        As late as January 4th, Mr. Trump held a rally before the       Georgia Senate runoff saying, ``When you win in a landslide       and they steal it and it's rigged, it's not acceptable. Not       acceptable.'' The crowd chanted, ``Fight for Trump!'' and Mr.       Trump responded, ``They're not going to take the White House.       We're going to fight like hell.'' \77\        In addition to his dishonest rhetoric on election fraud,       Mr. Trump took concrete steps to bend reality to match what       he wanted. As I will explain in more detail in Section VIII,       Mr. Trump used any means necessary to cajole, intimidate, and       threaten individuals at all levels of government to use their       authority to reject, and in some cases alter, the electoral       votes for Mr. Biden.\78\        It is important to note that Mr. Trump forcefully pushed       these lies, no matter how divorced from reality they became.       In the weeks after the election, it became painstakingly       clear that Mr. Biden was the winner, as states moved to       certify his results. In states where the Trump campaign asked       for election audits, subsequent recounts provided no       compelling evidence that Mr. Trump had won by a       landslide.\79\ He and his allies filed and lost over 60       lawsuits alleging voting irregularities in state and federal       court, including the Supreme Court.\80\ His Attorney General       attested that the Justice Department discovered no voting       fraud ``on a scale that could have effected a different       outcome in the election.'' \81\ Top election officials put       out a statement saying, ``The November 3rd election was the       most secure in American history . . . There is no evidence       that any voting system deleted or lost votes, changed votes,       or was in any way compromised.'' \82\ The day before the       Capitol insurrection, even Vice President Mike Pence told Mr.       Trump that he had a constitutional duty to certify the true       winner of the election, which was Mr. Biden.\83\        Yet, throughout all of this and despite undeniable evidence       to the contrary, Mr. Trump doggedly claimed that he had won       the election, and that his supporters should help vindicate       him. He lied to the American people, and did so knowingly and       deliberately.        c. Mr. Trump Invoked Violent Means to Further His Re-            Election        Leading up to January 6th, Mr. Trump supported--either       tacitly or outright--the use of violent and menacing tactics       by his supporters. For example, in the spring of 2020, Mr.       Trump embraced the backlash against COVID-19 policies to aid       his re-election. Following armed protests over stay-at-home       orders, he tweeted ``LIBERATE MINNESOTA!'', ``LIBERATE       MICHIGAN!'' and ``LIBERATE VIRGINIA, and save your great 2nd       Amendment. It is under siege!'' \84\ During some of the anti-      lockdown protests, armed groups attempted to derail the       legislative proceedings at statehouses in Michigan, Idaho,       and Oregon.\85\ These disruptive and aggressive methods were       in essence a prelude to what happened during the assault on       the Capitol.        This anger boiled over when six men plotted to kidnap       Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer because they were angry       about the state's coronavirus policies.\86\ When the Federal       Bureau of Investigation foiled the plot, Mr. Trump added fuel       to the fire, and attacked Governor Whitmer over Twitter. He       tweeted, ``Governor Whitmer of Michigan has done a terrible       job. She locked down her state for everyone, except her       husband's boating activities . . . My Justice Department and       Federal Law Enforcement announced . . . today that they       foiled a dangerous plot against the Governor of Michigan.       Rather than say thank you, she calls me a White Supremacist--      while Biden and Democrats refuse to condemn Antifa,       Anarchists, Looters and Mobs that burn down Democrat run       cities.'' \87\        Furthermore, in November 2020, Mr. Trump embraced a group       of his followers who sought to intimidate supporters of his       political opponent. He posted a video of his supporters in       different cars surrounding a Biden campaign bus in Texas. Mr.       Trump cheered this kind of intimidation, tweeting, ``I LOVE       TEXAS'' and ``In my opinion, these patriots did nothing       wrong.'' \88\ At a rally in Michigan, Mr. Trump even praised       his supporters' actions saying, ``Did you see the way our       people, they were, ya know, protecting this bus . . . because       they're nice . . . They had hundreds of cars. Trump! Trump!       Trump and the American flag.'' \89\        After Mr. Biden was declared the winner, Mr. Trump focused       his ire in the following weeks on changing the election       results in Georgia. Mr. Trump's relentless claims of voter       fraud in Georgia were followed by a wave of death threats       against state election officials. Gabriel Sterling, an       election official in Georgia, pleaded with Mr. Trump to       denounce the threats of violence, clearly articulating the       risks of failing to do so. Sterling said, ``Mr. President, it       looks like you likely lost the state of Georgia. We're       investigating. There's always a possibility, I get it, and       you have the rights to go through the courts. What you don't       have the ability to do--and you need to step up and say       this--is stop inspiring people to commit potential acts of       violence. Someone's going to get hurt. Someone's going to get       shot. Someone's going to get killed. And it's not right.''       \90\        d. Mr. Trump Supported Extremist Groups        Mr. Trump made statements supporting, or failing to condemn       members of extremist groups, many of whom came together to       storm the Capitol on January 6th.        Famously, during the first presidential debate on September       29th, when asked to condemn white supremacist groups, like       the Proud Boys, Trump refused. Instead, he announced, ``Proud       Boys--stand back and stand by.'' \91\ The Proud Boys group       took this as an explicit endorsement of their violent tactics       and ideology.\92\ A known social media account associated       with the Proud Boys made ``Stand back and stand by'' its new       slogan, and Proud Boys leader Joe Biggs likewise posted that       he was ``standing by.'' \93\        Mr. Trump also made statements and used social media to       pander to Q'Anon, a conspiracy movement, including by       retweeting messages from Q'Anon followers on Twitter hundreds       of times before his account was suspended.\94\ When pressed       on his views on Q'Anon, Mr. Trump appeared to defend the       movement. On August 19th, Mr. Trump tacitly endorsed QAnon       at a press conference, saying, ``I don't know much about       the movement, other than I understand they like me very       much. Which I appreciate.'' \95\ In a town  [[Page S930]]       hall on October 15th, Mr. Trump praised Q'Anon members       again, this time saying, ``Let me just--let me just tell       you, what I do hear about it, is they are very strongly       against pedophilia. And I agree with that. I mean, I do       agree with that. And I agree with it very strongly.'' \96\        e. Mr. Trump Organized the January 6th ``Save America''             Rally        In the days leading up to January 6th, Mr. Trump sent out       numerous tweets promoting the ``Save America Rally'' and gave       his supporters specific instructions on when and where to       attend. On December 19th, he tweeted, ``Big protest in D.C.       on January 6th . . . Be there, will be wild!'' \97\ On       December 27, he tweeted ``See you in Washington, DC, on       January 6th. Don't miss it. Information to follow.'' \98\ On       January 1, 2021, he tweeted, ``The BIG Protest Rally in       Washington, D.C. will take place at 11:00 A.M. on January       6th. Locational details to follow. StopTheSteal!'' \99\ The       day before, he posted, ``I will be speaking at the SAVE       AMERICA RALLY tomorrow on the Ellipse at 11AM Eastern. Arrive       early--doors open at 7AM Eastern. BIG CROWDS!'' \100\        Mr. Trump not only knew, but actively coordinated the       January 6th rally in order to disrupt the congressional       proceedings that day. First, Mr. Trump chose to convene a       rally on the same day as the electoral certification, and       then explicitly urged his supporters to attend what he       predicted would be a ``wild'' and ``historic'' day. Manager       Plaskett underscored that it was only after Mr. Trump chose       that day that the Pro-Trump group, Women for America First,       obtained a permit for what became the ``Save America'' rally       at the Ellipse.\101\ The day after Women for America First       announced the rally, Mr. Trump reposted their invitation and       replied ``I will be there Historic day!'' \102\ Manager       Plaskett stated that the Trump campaign even ``became       directly involved with the planning of the event, including       the speaking line-up and even the music to be played and       brought in the same people who spoke at the second Million       MAGA rally to help.'' \103\ Notably, Vice President Pence's       sister-in-law is on the advisory board of Women for Trump,       which has ties to Women for America First--thus blurring the       lines between the Trump administration and the organizers of       the January 6th rally.\104\        Manager Plaskett also emphasized that Mr. Trump's top       advisors and the Trump communications team were actively       monitoring posts from mainstream websites such as Twitter and       Facebook, as well as pro-Trump message boards on Reddit and       4Chan.\105\ Posters wrote about preparations for the rally in       Washington, D.C. to take their election back, by violent       means if necessary, on these message boards. His supporters       posted hundreds of messages outlining their plans for January       6th. They discussed how to physically breach the Capitol       grounds, which individuals to target once inside, and which       weapons and tactical gear to take with them.\106\        In this section, I outlined Mr. Trump's words and actions       leading up to the attack on the Capitol. I will now move onto       examining whether Mr. Trump foreseeably or recklessly       persuaded his supporters into believing his voter fraud lies       and taking action at his behest to prevent what he considered       a stolen election.      C. Mr. Trump Foreseeably and Recklessly Persuaded His           Supporters That the Election Was Stolen        Mr. Trump spread lies, conspiracy theories, and incendiary       rhetoric before and after the 2020 election. He did so with       the understanding that it would inflame his supporters and       enlist their aid in helping him disrupt the electoral       process. The effect was to foreseeably and recklessly goad       his supporters into action. We know this because there is       evidence that his supporters were buying into his       delegitimizing the election, his encouragement of taking       action to overturn the electoral process, and his support for       violent tactics.        Mr. Trump's promotion of themes such as ``Stop the Count''       and ``Stop the Steal'' served to gin up his supporters.       Manager Swalwell pointed out that Mr. Trump spent ``millions       of dollars to amplify that lie . . . [I]n mid-December,       President Trump announced the release of ads, including ones       entitled `'The Evidence is Overwhelming--FRAUD!'' and ``STOP       THE STEAL.'' He spent $50 million from his legal defense fund       on these ads to stop the steal and amplify his message. They       were released nationally, played in video ads, online       advertising, and targeted text messages.'' \107\        His supporters took these ideas literally--angrily       converging upon vote centers on November 5th to protest the       continued counting of ballots after Election Day.\108\ Trump       supporters formed ``Stop the Steal'' online groups, which       became a hotbed for sharing false claims and misleading       videos about voter fraud. In November and December, his       supporters held ``Stop the Steal'' rallies around the       country. It was widely publicized that, at some of these       events, participants were armed and belligerent. Notably, on       December 12th, they staged the Second Million MAGA March in       Washington, D.C., which resulted in violent clashes between       Proud Boy members and counter protestors.\109\ Mr. Trump       promoted these rallies on his social media, and, in some       instances, heaped praise on his supporters for fighting.\110\        The evidence showed that Mr. Trump's promotion of the       ``Save America'' rally succeeded in convincing his supporters       to show up at the time and place he named on January 6th.       Many of Mr. Trump's supporters said that they felt summoned       to Washington, D.C. to take retaliatory action. In a Parler       post before the insurrection, a supporter shared one of Mr.       Trump's tweets and wrote, ``This isn't a joke, this is where       and when we make our stand. #January6th, Washington DC. Be       there, no matter what. Nothing is more important.'' \111\ In       a statement taped on a livestream video taken during the       insurrection, a man is heard saying, ``Our president wants us       here We wait and take orders from our president.'' \112\ In       court papers and interviews given after the insurrection,       pro-Trump rioters said they joined the march because the       president encouraged them to do so.\113\        I find overwhelmingly clear and convincing evidence that       Mr. Trump and his allies foreseeably and recklessly solicited       his supporters to help him overturn the election results--      including most prominently by attending the January 6th rally       to disrupt the Electoral College certification.      D. Mr. Trump's Supporters Committed Unlawful Acts of           Insurrection on January 6th        a. Trump Speaks at the ``Save America'' Rally        After months of fomenting anger over his false claims of       election fraud, Mr. Trump gathered his supporters at the       ``Save America'' rally on January 6th. Once there, Mr. Trump       told the crowd ``We're going to walk down to the Capitol       because you'll never take back our country with weakness. You       have to show strength and you have to be strong.'' \114\ This       was a continuation of a pattern of violent rhetoric by Mr.       Trump leading up to the events at the Capitol. For example,       Mr. Trump had previously told followers to ``Fight like       Hell'' at rallies. He repeated this language at the rally at       noon on January 6th stating, ``[W]e fight. We fight like       hell.'' \115\ His supporters got the message. By 12:53pm, a       large group of Trump supporters approached a fenced off area       in front of the Capitol and began to engage with Capitol       police officers, many of whom were armed only with mace and       their side arms.\116\        b. The Insurrection Begins        The crowd pushed past the barricade, knocking down police       officers in the process, in an attempt to get closer to the       building. Within minutes, protestors began swarming other       entrances of the Capitol.\117\ Inside the Capitol, Vice       President Pence presided over the joint session of Congress.       Contrary to the wishes of Mr. Trump, Vice President Pence       began the process of certifying the election results. Outside       the Capitol, the crowd of protestors grew more violent.       ``Rioters wearing Trump paraphernalia shoved and punched       Capitol Police officers, gouged their eyes, assaulted them       with pepper spray and projectiles, and denounced them as       `cowards' and `traitors.' '' \118\ Law enforcement officers       were attacked with baseball bats, crutches, hockey sticks,       flag poles, and fire extinguishers.\119\ Some rioters came       armed with handguns, pepper spray, knives, and brass       knuckles.\120\ Congressional staff and reporters were warned       to stay away from windows and doors.\121\        c. Rioters Storm the Capitol        Between 2pm and 2:30pm, rioters broke through multiple       entrances and began pushing deeper into the Capitol, flooding       the Rotunda, Crypt, Statuary Hall, and other locations.\122\       Videos captured by rioters show the crowd, many in Trump       paraphernalia, chanting ``Stop the Steal'' and ``U.S.A.'' as       they breached the Capitol and overpowered security.\123\        Meanwhile, the Joint Session had separated into different       chambers. The Senate was in the midst of a debate regarding       an objection to certifying Arizona's Electoral College       votes.\124\ Secret Service rushed Vice President Pence out of       the Senate chambers and took him and members of his family to       a secure location within the Capitol.\125\ Capitol Police       officer Eugene Goodman led rioters away from the entrance to       the Senate chambers, narrowly avoiding a potentially deadly       encounter between Members of the Senate and rioters.\126\       Senators were then evacuated from the Chamber.\127\        On the other side of the Capitol, the House went into       recess and members were told to lock down and shelter in       place.\128\ By 2:45 pm, members of the Capitol Security Team       were forced to barricade the doors to the Chamber as       insurrectionists attempted to break in. House Members were       instructed to put on gas masks and some attempted to build       makeshift shelters in case the mob broke through the       doors.\129\ Members who were on the ground level were       evacuated through the Speaker's Lobby as Capitol Security       guarded the door with guns.\130\ Ashli Babbitt, an Air Force       veteran, was fatally shot as she and others tried to break       through the barricaded glass door.\131\ Members, reporters,       and staff in the Gallery remained trapped one floor above the       rioters. Videos taken during the events on January 6th show       this group sitting and lying down in the aisles in an attempt       to shelter behind the chairs.\132\ One particularly moving       photo shows Representative Jason Crow (D-CO), a former Army       Ranger, comforting Representative Susan Wild (D-PA) as the       pair sheltered in the Gallery.\133\ Rep. Crow recounted that       he was doing what any friend would do, telling Rep. Wild       ``that I was there for her, and that we would get through       it.'' \134\ Another video shows Rep. Lisa Blunt Rochester (D-      DE) praying loudly in the Gallery for safety and peace as she       and other lawmakers, including Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-WA),       watched Capitol Police officers barricade the door to the       Chamber.\135\  [[Page S931]]             d. The Rioters Target Vice President Pence and Speaker             Pelosi        As members of Congress moved to secure locations or       sheltered in place, rioters walked the halls carrying       Confederate flags, vandalizing the building, and breaking       into congressional offices, including the office of Speaker       of the House Nancy Pelosi.\136\ One rioter said that he and       other rioters ``kicked in Nancy Pelosi's office door'' and       that ``Crazy Nancy probably would have been torn into little       pieces but she was nowhere to be seen.'' \137\ The use of the       term ``Crazy Nancy'' is significant, for this is Mr. Trump's       nickname for the Speaker of the House. Vice President Mike       Pence was another primary target for the most violent       sections of the mob. ``Once we found out Pence turned on us       and that they had stolen the election, like, officially, the       crowd went crazy,'' said one rioter.\138\ Rioters called for       Pence's death.\139\ Throughout the Capitol, Members and their       staff barricaded themselves in offices, hid under tables,       called loved ones, and prayed for safety.\140\        e. The President Fails to Respond to or Condemn the             Violence at the Capitol        President's Counsel argue that the President did not intend       or anticipate for violence to take place. If that were the       case, one would expect that--as soon as it was clear that the       rioters had begun engaging in unlawful or violent acts--Mr.       Trump would quickly and clearly condemn these actions and       take every action possible to stop further violence.       Arguably, once the lawbreaking began, it was only Mr. Trump       that had the most potent power at that point to get his       supporters to stop. However, instead of acting expeditiously,       it took him more than two hours after the rioters stormed the       Capitol to make a statement. In this time, it is reported       that lawmakers and Trump advisors pleaded with him to call       off the angry mob and denounce the violence.\141\ Mr. Trump       was seemingly unmoved by these pleas for help, and it is even       reported that he was pleased by the actions of his       supporters.\142\ Rather than call off his supporters, it is       reported that Mr. Trump called a Member of the Senate asking       him to raise additional objections to certifying the       Electoral College results.\143\ Not until 4:15pm did Mr.       Trump release a pre-recorded message, telling supporters to       go home. The video statement did not condemn the rioters'       actions at the Capitol.        Mr. Trump's delay in responding to the insurrection is       unsurprising, for many of the rioters thought they were       ``answer[ing] the call of my President.'' \144\ In a       livestreamed video from inside the Capitol, one rioter       declared that ``[o]ur president wants us here. . . . We wait       and take orders from our president.'' \145\ Another rioter       claimed that she ``thought I was following my President. He       asked us to fly there, he asked us to be there, so I was       doing what he asked us to do.'' \146\ One supporter, who was       later arrested for his actions on January 6th, stated through       his lawyer that he, ``acted out of the delusional belief that       he was a `patriot' protecting his country . . . He was       responding to the entreaties of the-then commander in       chief, President Trump. . . . The President maintained       that the election had been stolen and it was the duty of       loyal citizens to `stop the steal.' '' \147\ To paraphrase       the House Managers, Mr. Trump sold his followers the big       lie of a stolen election and then provoked those followers       to violent action to ``stop the steal.''        In his late statement on the events at the Capitol, Trump       urged his followers to ``Please support our Capitol Police       and law enforcement stay peaceful.'' Of course, the       insurrection was never peaceful, and the Capitol Police were       treated cruelly by the mob. Over the course of the       insurrection, 140 police officers were injured and one       officer, Brian Sicknick, was killed. Four rioters also died.       Congressional Leadership offices were trashed, the walls of       the Capitol bore the marks of bullets, monuments were       destroyed, windows were smashed and broken in, Members and       staff were terrorized, Senate desks were ransacked, and smoke       hung in the air. Mr. Trump should have pleaded with the crowd       to stand down and leave the Capitol as soon as the       insurrection began. The fact that he waited to address the       rioters, and downplayed the severity of the insurrection to       the point of even praising the patriotism of the rioters, was       not just dereliction of duty. It was malicious disregard for       the lives of Capitol Police, Members of Congress, staff, and       Capitol workers threatened by the mob that he incited.        f. The Capitol is Cleared and the Election Results are             Certified        It took more than four hours after the rioters first       entered the building to secure the Capitol and another three       hours before the Joint Session could resume.\148\       Nevertheless, Joseph R. Biden Jr. was confirmed the winner of       the 2020 election at approximately 4am.\149\ Democracy       prevailed.      E. The First Amendment Is Not a Defense to Mr. Trump's           Incitement of Insurrection        President's Counsel argued at trial that Mr. Trump was       exercising his First Amendment rights in expressing his views       at the ``Save America'' rally, and thus cannot be convicted       in this proceeding. I conclude that there is overwhelmingly       clear and convincing evidence that the First Amendment does       not inoculate him from the current Impeachment charge.        a. The First Amendment Is Not a Bar to Impeachment        As I explained in Section II, the relevant standard in an       Impeachment trial is whether a president committed       impeachable ``high Crimes and Misdemeanors.'' An impeachable       offense need not violate a criminal or other established law.       Indeed, even an action that is lawful or otherwise protected       by the Constitution can still be an impeachable offense.       Rather the appropriate standard in this proceeding is whether       an offense is ``incompatible with either the constitutional       form and principles of our government or the proper       performance of constitutional duties of the presidential       office.'' \150\ In addition, as I explained in Section IV,       there is no defined standard of proof in an Impeachment, and       there are no requirements to adhere to the same standards as       in a criminal prosecution.        As a result, in an Impeachment trial, the Senate is simply       not bound by a determination of whether Mr. Trump is       protected by the First Amendment, nor must the Senate demand       a showing that every element of a criminal charge of       incitement has been met.        b. Mr. Trump's Speech Likely Satisfies the Standard of             Incitement        Although I have concluded that the First Amendment does not       necessarily serve as a shield in this proceeding, I find it       persuasive that the bedrock principle of free speech has a       long history in our country. Therefore, I undertook an       examination of the governing case precedent regarding       incitement. I have concluded that, even if the First       Amendment were to apply in this case, Mr. Trump's overall       course of conduct would satisfy the standard for incitement.        The First Amendment prohibits any law ``abridging the       freedom of speech.'' \151\ However, even at our country's       founding, it is clear that the First Amendment was not       intended to provide absolute protection for every utterance.       Of the fourteen states that ratified the Constitution by       1792, thirteen had laws limiting libelous or blasphemous       speech.\152\ In addition, the Supreme Court has recognized       specific categories of speech that are not protected by the       First Amendment and which the government may regulate because       of their content. These categories are ``obscenity,       defamation, fraud, incitement, fighting words, true threats,       speech integral to criminal conduct, and child pornography.''       \153\        The relevant legal framework for incitement was established       by the U.S. Supreme Court in the 1969 case of Brandenburg v.       Ohio.\154\ In that case, a Ku Klux Klan leader, Clarence       Brandenburg, was convicted after making a speech at a Klan       rally that apparently broke an Ohio law against       ``advocat[ing] crime, sabotage, violence, or unlawful methods       of terrorism as a means of accomplishing industrial or       political reform.'' \155\ The Supreme Court overturned       Brandenburg's conviction and struck down the statute on First       Amendment grounds. In doing so, the Court articulated a new       test for when advocating for violence or lawbreaking could be       criminally prosecuted. The Brandenburg test defines       unprotected incitement as speech that is ``directed to       inciting or producing imminent lawless action and is likely       to incite or produce such action.'' \156\        Subsequent cases further clarified the ``imminence''       standard set out in Brandenburg. In the Supreme Court case of       Hess v. Indiana, Gregory Hess was attending an anti-Vietnam       war protest when the police moved a group of protesters from       the street onto the sidewalk.\157\ Hess said, ``We'll take       the [effing] street later'' and was convicted for disorderly       conduct.\158\ The Supreme Court reversed Hess' conviction,       concluding, ``Since the uncontroverted evidence showed that       Hess' statement was not directed to any person or group of       persons, it cannot be said that he was advocating, in the       normal sense, any action. And since there was no evidence, or       rational inference from the import of the language, that his       words were intended to produce, and likely to produce,       imminent disorder, those words could not be punished by the       State on the ground that they had `a tendency to lead to       violence.' '' \159\        The Supreme Court subsequently explained that a finding of       ``imminence'' also hinged upon the context and timing       connecting speech and subsequent acts of lawbreaking. In       NAACP v. Claiborne Hardware Company, a local branch of the       National Association for the Advancement of Colored People       (NAACP) organized a boycott of white-owned stores in       Mississippi.\160\ The boycott was largely supported by       impassioned speeches encouraging nonviolent picketing--      including by boycott organizer Charles Evers--but some acts       and threats of violence did occur.\161\ The Court concluded,       ``There are three separate theories that might justify       holding Evers liable . . . First, a finding that he       authorized, directed, or ratified specific tortious activity       would justify holding him responsible for the consequences of       that activity. Second, a finding that his public speeches       were likely to incite lawless action could justify holding       him liable for unlawful conduct that in fact followed within       a reasonable period. Third, the speeches might be taken as       evidence that Evers gave other specific instructions to carry       out violent acts or threats.'' \162\ In the specific case of       Evers' speech, the Court concluded ``In the course of       [Evers'] pleas, strong language was used. If that language       had been followed by acts of violence, a substantial question       would be presented whether Evers could be held liable for the       consequences of that unlawful conduct. In this case, however       the acts of violence identified in 1966 occurred weeks or       months after [his] April 1, 1966, speech.'' \163\  [[Page S932]]         There is overwhelmingly clear and convincing evidence that       Mr. Trump's overall course of conduct meets the spirit of the       Brandenburg test. As laid out in the Claiborne case, a       finding of ``imminence'' should take into account the context       and timing of Mr. Trump's January 6th rally speech. After       months of fueling the narrative that the election was stolen       from him, Mr. Trump asked his supporters to assemble on the       day that Congress would be certifying the election results.       Once Mr. Trump had gathered his supporters--knowing that they       would listen--he directed the crowd to ``walk down       Pennsylvania Avenue,'' ``fight like hell,'' and ``stop the       steal.'' Unlike the speech in Claiborne, which was far       removed in time, the lawlessness was imminent because it       happened a short distance and short time after Mr. Trump's       speech. Unlike the indefinite speech in Hess, Mr. Trump's       speech was directed at a specific group of persons, and       subsequent acts of violence are directly traceable to people       who had listened to Mr. Trump's calls to action.        On the issue of Mr. Trump's intent, whether or not Mr.       Trump specifically intended every act of violence, he set       these events in motion. If Mr. Trump truly did not intend for       lawbreaking, what did he expect his supporters would do once       they reached the Capitol? How did he expect his supporters to       lawfully achieve the aim of preventing electors from being       counted? From this evidence, we can infer that Mr. Trump       understood there was a high likelihood that his supporters       would break the law once they got to the Capitol.        Further revealing his state of mind, Mr. Trump did not       publicly disapprove of the insurrection as it was happening,       or take concrete steps to clear the mob. The first public       statement he made, once the mob had breached the Capitol, was       to disparage Vice President Pence for failing to block the       certification. Instead of acting expeditiously, it took him       nearly two hours to acknowledge the attack. In his three       statements that day, he repeated false claims that the       election was stolen and sympathized with his followers. There       are reports that he even called a sitting Senator to ask him       to object to additional states, as the insurrection was       taking place. In addition, there is no evidence that Mr.       Trump tried to activate the National Guard, and even rebuffed       requests to do so. The question becomes how did Mr. Trump       expect these actions--criticizing the Vice President, urging       additional electoral objections, and praising his       supporters--to calm down tensions? How did he foresee that       the overwhelmed Capitol police would be able to push back the       mob without additional law enforcement assistance? From this       evidence, we can infer that Mr. Trump was satisfied, or at       least was not displeased, that his actions had inflamed his       supporters to violently disrupt the electoral certification.        c. Mr. Trump's Speech Was Held to a Higher Standard as a             Public Official        It is further important to note that Mr. Trump was not       making statements in his capacity as a private citizen but as       president of the United States. In the Supreme Court case,       Garcetti v. Ceballos, the Court held that ``when a citizen       enters government service, the citizen by necessity must       accept certain limitations on his or her freedom.'' \164\ In       this case, the respondent was disciplined for a memorandum he       wrote as part of his employment in a district attorney's       office, and asserted that his supervisors violated his First       Amendment rights.\165\ The Court concluded ``We hold that       when public employees make statements pursuant to their       official duties, the employees are not speaking as citizens       for First Amendment purposes, and the Constitution does not       insulate their communications from employer discipline.\166\        In Mr. Trump's case, it would be difficult to argue that he       gave a political speech at the ``Save America'' rally outside       the course of performing his official duties. The purpose of       the speech was to use his role as president to urge his       supporters to stop the certification of Biden's electoral       win. In addition, there is evidence that members of the crowd       had taken Mr. Trump's invocations to attend the rally, and       his insisting that they head to the Capitol, as instructions       coming from the president.\167\        Moreover, as Manager Raskin explained, a president takes an       oath to uphold the laws, the Constitution, and the principles       of our republic.\168\ In exchange, the president is given       tremendous power and prestige--more so than any other person       in the country. That is why, in an instant, a president's       words can calm, agitate, or otherwise change the landscape on       issues ranging from foreign affairs, to the economy, to the       rule of law. Not only can the president's words have an       expansive ripple effect, they are more likely to succeed in       inciting action from the public. These potent powers can be       wielded by the president for the good of the country, or can       be exploited to subject it to the gravest abuses. That is       why--for the protection of our laws and democratic       institutions--a president's primary obligation is to uphold       their oath of office, and any freedom of expression must       yield to that higher duty.        In this case, Mr. Trump did not have a First Amendment       right to fuel a mass disinformation campaign, foreseeably fan       the flames of political division, and then direct a mob to       disrupt a congressional proceeding.                    VII. OBSTRUCTION OF ELECTORAL COLLEGE         In inciting the insurrection on January 6th and attempting       to overturn the 2020 election, Mr. Trump attempted to destroy       our democratic system and negate the will of the American       people.        The Electoral College process is laid out in the Twelfth       Amendment of the Constitution, which states:         ``The Electors shall meet in their respective states and       vote by ballot for President and Vice-President, one of whom,       at least . . . they shall make distinct lists of all persons       voted for as President, and of all persons voted for as Vice-      President, and of the number of votes for each, which lists       they shall sign and certify, and transmit sealed to the       seat of the government of the United States, directed to       the President of the Senate;--the President of the Senate       shall, in the presence of the Senate and House of       Representatives, open all the certificates and the votes       shall then be counted[.]''         Just as the Electoral College has been carried out and       affirmed since the first presidential election of President       George Washington,\169\ the 2020 election took place       according to the requirements of the Constitution. Voters in       each respective state and territory chose their electors to       serve in the Electoral College,\170\ with Mr. Biden winning a       majority of 306 electoral votes.\171\ On December 14, 2020,       the appointed electors convened state-by-state to cast their       ballots for the President and Vice President of the United       States, and certified the results.\172\ On January 6th to 7th       of 2020, Congress counted the certified votes, and declared       Mr. Biden and Kamala Harris the winners. \173\        Throughout the Electoral College process, Mr. Trump       attempted to interfere and nullify the outcome. For example,       as discussed in Section VII, Mr. Trump was at the head of a       mass disinformation campaign to discredit the election       results before the election had even gotten underway, and       then filed dozens of lawsuits alleging widespread voter       fraud.\174\ In addition, as I will outline, he wielded his       overwhelming power as president to cajole and intimidate       members of federal, state, and local government to start       investigations, file lawsuits, and reject electoral votes in       a bid to overturn the 2020 election.      A. Mr. Trump Attempted to Use Federal Law Enforcement           Agencies to Carry Out Investigations and File Lawsuits        After losing the 2020 election, Mr. Trump pushed the       Justice Department to investigate his meritless allegations       of election irregularities.\175\ He also pushed the Justice       Department to ask the Supreme Court to invalidate Mr. Biden's       victory, which his appointees refused to do, citing the lack       of evidence.\176\ Mr. Trump even disparaged his own FBI and       DOJ, implying that they were working against him. In an       interview, Mr. Trump said, ``This is total fraud. And how the       F.B.I. and Department of Justice--I don't know, maybe they're       involved--but how people are allowed to get away with this       stuff is unbelievable. This election was a total fraud . . .       Missing in action . . . Can't tell you where they are.''       \177\        Succumbing to this pressure, Attorney General William Barr       issued a memorandum to U.S. attorneys across the country       allowing them to pursue any ``substantial allegations'' of       voting irregularities before the 2020 presidential election       was certified.\178\ The memorandum gave prosecutors the       ability to sidestep longstanding Justice Department policy of       not taking overt steps on possible election fraud before       results are certified. In response, career DOJ prosecutors       called on Mr. Barr to rescind the memo, because it was not       based on fact and there was no evidence of widespread voter       fraud.\179\        After Mr. Barr stepped down as Attorney General, Mr. Trump       then reportedly pressured Barr's successor, Acting Attorney       General Jeffrey Rosen, to file legal briefs seeking to       overturn his election loss.\180\ He wanted Mr. Rosen to       appoint special counsels, including a counsel who would look       into Dominion Voting Systems--which is at the center of a       right-wing conspiracy theory accusing the company of       conspiring with the Venezuelan government to tip the election       toward Mr. Biden. Mr. Rosen refused the president's       entreaties. Mr. Trump then plotted with Jeffrey Clark, a       Trump loyalist and the head of the DOJ's civil division, to       oust Mr. Rosen as acting attorney general, and replace him       with Mr. Clark, who was willing to do Mr. Trump's bidding in       trying to overturn the Georgia election results. This plan       was only unsuccessful because Mr. Trump's advisors convinced       him the move could potentially lead to mass resignations       within DOJ's leadership and lead to congressional       investigations.\181\      B. Mr. Trump Exerted Inappropriate Pressure on State Elected           Officials        Article II, Section 1, Clause 2 provides that each state       shall appoint electors ``in such Manner as the Legislature       thereof may direct.'' \182\ However, the decisions on how and       when to choose electors is left up to the states. The       Electoral Count Act only requires that states be required to       certify their elections at least six days before the electors       meet to vote.\183\ After his loss on Election Day, Mr. Trump       sought to exploit the ambiguous language of the Electoral       Count Act that gives states discretion in choosing electors.       Most state laws require the appointment of electors who vote       according to the outcome of the popular vote in each       state.\184\        However, Mr. Trump sought to use the weight of his office       to persuade and, in some  [[Page S933]]       cases, intimidate state officials. For example, he invited       GOP members of the Michigan state legislature to the White       House, in a brazen bid to get them to throw out the state's       election results.\185\ He also called two members of the       Wayne County Board of Canvassers, including its Republican       chairwoman, who had already voted to certify that Joe Biden       won their county.\186\ Within 24 hours of the call, the       Republican chairwoman announced that she wanted to       ``rescind'' her vote.\187\ Her reasoning mirrored Mr. Trump's       claims that the election may have been rife with fraud. In       another instance, he called the speaker of the Pennsylvania       House of Representatives, Bryan Cutler, and inquired about       the electoral process. According to Cutler's spokesperson,       Mr. Trump blatantly asked, ``I'm hearing about all these       issues in Philadelphia, and these issues with your law What       can we do to fix it?'' \188\        Mr. Trump's effort hit its crescendo when the Trump       campaign convinced supporters in several states to create an       alternate slate of electors to send for the congressional       certification.\189\ The Trump campaign helped organize       alternate Electoral College meetings in Wisconsin, Arizona,       Pennsylvania, Georgia, New Mexico, and Nevada.\190\ However,       election law experts dismissed the validity of these false       electors, which had ``neither been certified by state       executives nor purportedly appointed by state legislators.''       \191\        Mr. Trump also took extra effort to influence the outcome       of the Georgia election, a fierce battleground state. In       early December, he called Governor Brian Kemp and asked him       to hold a special session of the Georgia legislature to       appoint Trump electors to reverse Mr. Biden's win. Mr. Trump       also wanted Kemp to order an audit of absentee ballot       signatures. When Kemp told the former president he would not       be complying with either demand, Mr. Trump told a crowd of       supporters at a Georgia rally that, ``Your governor could       stop it very easily if he knew what the hell he was doing . .       . So far we haven't been able to find the people in Georgia       willing to do the right thing.'' \192\        In the most extraordinary example of his inappropriate       interactions with state lawmakers, Mr. Trump outright tried       to coerce Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, ``to       find'' 11,780 votes--which would amount to the one vote       margin he needed to win the state.\193\ Mr. Trump spent       roughly an hour haranguing Raffensperger and Ryan Germany,       the Georgia secretary of state's general counsel, about doing       another vote count and insisting on baseless conspiracy       theories. Even when presented with facts to the contrary by       Raffensperger and Germany, who are both Republicans, Mr.       Trump did not relent.        Mr. Trump also made veiled threats of how his supporters       would punish Republicans if the Georgia election officials       did not go along with what he was asking. Specifically, he       told Raffensperger, who will be up for reelection in 2022,       ``[T]hey hate the state, they hate the governor, and they       hate the secretary of state. I will tell you that right now.       And the only people that like you are people that will never       vote for you. You know that, Brad, right?'' \194\        Mr. Trump even suggested that Raffensperger and Germany       would face criminal consequences if they refused to       intervene, saying ``[T]he ballots are corrupt. And you're       going to find that they are--which is totally illegal, it is       more illegal for you than it is for them because, you know       what they did and you're not reporting it. That's a       criminal--that's a criminal offense. And you can't let that       happen. That's a big risk to you and to Ryan, your lawyer. ''       \195\        In the end, Mr. Trump made so many false claims about the       Georgia election, a top state official had to publicly debunk       the claims one-by-one to restore public trust in the       integrity of their election.\196\      C. Mr. Trump Lobbied Vice President Pence to Reject Electoral           Votes        Vice President Pence presided over the January 6th       certification of electoral votes. This role is spelled out by       Article II, Section 1 of the Constitution, which dictates       that ``The President of the Senate shall, in the presence of       the Senate and House of Representatives, open all the       certificates and the votes shall then be counted.'' \197\ In       conducting this duty, the Vice President has no more power       than to determine whether the certificates submitted by each       state are authentic and then to count the votes.\198\        In the days leading up to and on January 6th, Mr. Trump       denied the constitutional reality of the Vice President's       role and made it clear that he wanted Vice President Pence to       block electoral votes for Mr. Biden. At his behest, a group       of Republican lawmakers filed a lawsuit against Vice       President Pence. The lawsuit alleged that the Twelfth       Amendment gave the Vice President, and not states, unilateral       power to determine which among competing slates of electors       may be counted.\199\ Mr. Trump's own Justice Department       stepped in to defend Mr. Pence, and a federal judge tossed       out the lawsuit after finding that the Republican lawmakers       lacked standing to sue in this case.\200\        Still, Mr. Trump unabashedly and repeatedly tried to coerce       Vice President Pence into unilaterally rejecting the election       results. On January 2nd, he falsely proclaimed over Twitter       that, ``The Vice President has the power to reject       fraudulently chosen electors.'' \201\ Two days later, Mr.       Trump said at a rally in Georgia that, ``I hope Mike Pence       comes through for us, I have to tell you . . . Of course, if       he doesn't come through, I won't like him as much.'' \202\       Trump reportedly met with and called Pence multiple times--      plying him to object to Biden's victory, including at least       one time with threatening language.\203\ Trump reportedly       solicited others in his orbit to put pressure on the Vice       President, including Rudy Giuliani and trade adviser Peter       Navarro.\204\ Despite the enormous pressure, Mr. Pence told       Mr. Trump that he planned to certify the election results for       Mr. Biden.\205\        In response, Mr. Trump tweeted on the morning of January       6th that, ``All Mike Pence has to do is send [the votes] back       to the States, AND WE WIN. Do it Mike, this is a time for       extreme courage!'' \206\ He also tweeted ``If Vice President       @Mike--Pence comes through for us, we will win the       Presidency. Many States want to decertify the mistake they       made in certifying incorrect & even fraudulent numbers in a       process NOT approved by their State Legislatures (which it       must be). Mike can send it back!'' \207\ In his remarks at       the ``Save America'' rally itself, Mr. Trump said, ``I hope       Mike is going to do the right thing. I hope so. I hope so.       Because if Mike Pence does the right thing, we win the       election. . . . And I actually--I just spoke to Mike. I said:       'Mike, that doesn't take courage. What takes courage is to do       nothing. That takes courage.' '' \208\        Once the electoral vote count had begun, it was clear that       Vice President Pence was not going to comply with his       demands. Mr. Trump attacked him on Twitter writing, ``Mike       Pence didn't have the courage to do what should have been       done to protect our Country and our Constitution, giving       States a chance to certify a corrected set of facts, not the       fraudulent or inaccurate ones which they were asked to       previously certify. USA demands the truth!'' \209\      D. Mr. Trump Encouraged Members of Congress to Deny and           Overturn the Election Results        Once it was clear that Mr. Trump had no plans of conceding,       even after Mr. Biden had been declared the presumptive       winner, Republicans were faced with a choice. Manager Lieu       explained that Mr. Trump targeted Members of Congress on       social media making it clear he saw their siding with him as       a loyalty test. Mr. Trump reminded Republicans that he, in       his view, had gotten them elected and he expected their       gratitude.\210\ Under these threats of retribution, Mr. Trump       was successful in getting Republicans to line up with him--in       either refusing to acknowledge that Mr. Biden had won or       worse, enabling his baseless claims of a rigged       election.\211\        In early December, Mr. Trump also identified an ally in the       House of Representatives who was circulating a Dear Colleague       letter asking Republican members to sign onto an amicus brief       supporting a lawsuit filed by the Texas Republican Attorney       General in the Supreme Court to void the election results of       other states.\212\ Mr. Trump began to personally lobby House       Republicans asking them to sign the amicus brief.\213\ In the       end, one hundred and twenty six Republican members of       Congress signed on, including the House Minority Leader.\214\       The U.S. Supreme Court rejected the lawsuit saying the state       of Texas lacked standing to pursue the case.\215\        As an extension of Mr. Trump' pressure campaign, Republican       Members of Congress began to similarly view the certification       of the Electoral College as a loyalty test to Mr. Trump. A       few days before January 6th, eleven current and then-incoming       Republican senators announced that they would vote to reject       the Electoral College votes of some states as not ``lawfully       certified,'' unless Congress appointed a commission to       conduct an emergency, ten day audit of the election       results.\216\ One hundred and forty Republican Members of the       House planned a similar effort.\217\ Together, the Senate and       House Members planned to object to the counting of       electors from Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada,       Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin.\218\        The question is not whether these Members had the legal       right to object to electors but whether there were facts to       support the objections. At that point, the results of the       election and lack of substantive voting irregularities was       affirmed by dozens of judges, the U.S. Supreme Court,       governors, and election officials.\219\ In addition,       Department of Homeland Security officials put out a statement       that said, ``The November 3rd election was the most secure in       American history.''\220\ Attorney General Barr put out a       similar statement that said, ``[We] have not seen fraud on a       scale that could have effected a different outcome in the       election.''\221\ In the face of all this evidence, the       subsequent objections could be seen as little more than a       ploy to lend specious legitimacy to Mr. Trump's allegations       of voter fraud and avoid provoking Mr. Trump's ire.      E. Mr. Trump Sought to Block the Peaceful Transfer of Power        Mr. Trump's overall course of conduct embodied the exact       kind of behavior that the Framers built constitutional       protections to thwart. The Framers knew that an executive who       amassed too much power might replicate the abuses of a       monarchy. At the Constitutional Convention, James Madison       explained the risks of appointing an executive--saying ``loss       of capacity or corruption was more within the compass of       probable events, and either of them might be fatal to the       Republic.''\222\ An exchange between two delegates, William       Richardson Davie and James Wilson, highlights the importance       of safeguarding against a corrupt president that would cheat       to get reelected. Davie stated, ```[i]f he be not impeachable       whilst in office, he will spare no efforts or means  [[Page S934]]       whatever to get himself reelected.' [Davie] considered this       as an essential security for the good behaviour of the       Executive.''\223\ Wilson concurred with Davie ``in the       necessity of making the Executive impeachable while in       office.''\224\        Without mechanisms to keep an out-of-control president in       check, there was little binding him to the law. This, in       part, prompted the Framers to design the system of checks and       balances and Congress's Impeachment power. Another       intentional hallmark of our democracy is the peaceful       transfer of power, which is especially important when an       incumbent loses re-election.\225\ This assures that an       executive acquires and maintains power only through lawful       means. It also ensures that power is given to a president,       and taken back, according to the will of people. It began       when President John Adams--defeated by his bitter political       rival Thomas Jefferson--quietly left the White House on the       morning of the new president's inauguration.\226\ Since then,       no president has ever refused to accept an election result or       defied the lawful processes for resolving electoral disputes,       until Mr. Trump.        Mr. Trump, unable to accept the will of the people,       categorically rejected the decision of Americans as expressed       in the 2020 election. Even more than refusing, he repeatedly       sought to undermine processes at the federal, state, and       local level that would advance a peaceful transfer of power.       As the House Managers noted, Mr. Trump tried to obstruct the       election process through non-violent means.\227\ When these       attempts failed, he directed a mob to help him wrest power by       launching an attack on the legislative branch.                    IX. VIOLATION OF SEPARATION OF POWERS         One of the key principles rooted in our democratic system       is the separation of powers between the co-equal branches of       government. This is apparent from the way the Framers devised       a system of federal government that diffuses and divides its       core functions across the legislative, executive, and       judicial branches.        The doctrine is rooted in a political philosophy that aims       to keep the government, as a whole and each branch, both       limited and empowered, so that the government can function       effectively, while the branches can prevent one another from       acting arbitrarily or recklessly. As James Madison explained       in Federalist Paper Number 47, ``The accumulation of all       powers, legislative, executive, and judiciary, in the same       hands, whether of one, a few, or many, and whether       hereditary, selfappointed, or elective, may justly be       pronounced the very definition of tyranny.''\228\        Therefore, when any one branch of government seeks to       obstruct an essential function of another branch, it       threatens the separation of powers.\229\ In a case where a       president seeks to derogate the authority of another branch,       it can also undermine the president's constitutional       obligation to ``take Care that the Laws be faithfully       executed.''\230\        In inciting the armed assault on the Capitol on January       6th, Mr. Trump knowingly and recklessly threatened a       constitutional proceeding of the Congress. In all this, Mr.       Trump gravely endangered the security of the United States       and its institutions, and imperiled a coequal branch of       government.                        X. VIOLATION OF OATH OF OFFICE         Manager Castro outlined the numerous ways that Mr. Trump       abandoned his post as the insurrection began, and even hours       after it was underway.\231\ Capitol Police were overwhelmed       and violently assaulted by the armed mob. Members of Congress       and congressional staff feared for their lives, many of them       hiding or barricaded in offices, as the mob wreaked mayhem on       the Capitol grounds. It was all unfolding on television,       leaving little doubt that Mr. Trump saw it happening in real       time.        Manager Castro emphasized that Mr. Trump could have simply       told the rioters to stop and leave the Capitol.\232\ As I       explained in Section VII, Mr. Trump did not acknowledge the       attack for nearly two hours, while Republican lawmakers and       the people closest to him implored him to call off the       attack. Instead, he tweeted out criticism of Vice President       Pence. When he finally acknowledged the attack, he did not       denounce the mob or rioters, but asked them to ``stay       peaceful,'' even though it was clear that they had undertaken       an unlawful siege at the Capitol. At this time, Mr. Trump       still did not ask the rioters to stop. Three and half hours       in, he released a video reaffirming the same voter fraud       lies, and told his supporters, ``We love you. You're very       special.'' While Mr. Trump did tell the rioters to go home       this time, he still refused to disavow the ongoing attack or       the attackers themselves.        In addition to inciting the insurrection, Mr. Trump       abandoned his duties to defend the American people, even       after the events of the day turned deadly. Manager Castro       noted that he did not deploy the National Guard, nor any       other law enforcement.\233\ He was so disengaged from       discussions with the Pentagon about deploying the National       Guard that Vice President Pence had to intervene to help move       the request forward.\234\        Taken together, Mr. Trump's conduct was an astonishing and       willful dereliction of duty. He had sworn an oath to       ``faithfully execute the office of President of the United       States and preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of       the United States.''\235\ Yet on that day, he commanded his       supporters to inflict grave harm to the constitutional order,       by telling them to disrupt the electoral certification and       the peaceful transfer of power. He sat back and watched as       his supporters took part in an attack on the government       institutions that he swore to defend. Then, he entirely       failed to stop or condemn the widespread lawbreaking that his       supporters took part in. As such, I find that there is       overwhelmingly clear and convincing evidence that Mr. Trump       violated his oath of office.     XI. CONCLUSION: CONVICTION AND DISQUALIFICATION OF MR. TRUMP IS AN                             APPROPRIATE REMEDY         Conviction and disqualification of a president from office       requires a high standard and should only be arrived at when       there are no other remedies available.        First, I would refute several assertions by President's       Counsel that the Impeachment proceeding, and the remedies       thereof, are not the appropriate way to hold Mr. Trump       accountable for his actions. President's Counsel and the       Senate Minority Leader argue that the more proper forum is a       criminal proceeding because of the criminal implications of       his offenses. Taken to its logical extreme, their views would       absurdly mean that if a president's malfeasance could be       prosecuted, the president should be protected from the       Impeachment process.         In addition, Manager Raskin correctly differentiated the       purpose and independence of the Impeachment process from the       prosecution of crimes. As Manager Raskin stated,       ``[Impeachment] was created to prevent and deter elected       officials who swear an oath to represent America but then       commit dangerous offenses against our republic.''\236\ An       Impeachment, unlike a criminal case, is not meant to punish       the defendant, but to guard the country and the Constitution       from an unfit executive. As I have explained, by his conduct,       Mr. Trump violated his oath of office and refused to defend       the Constitution itself. Therefore, an Impeachment is the       most appropriate forum to protect the integrity of the       presidency and the constitutional order.        President's Counsel also contend that Impeachment is       unnecessary in this case because the 2020 election was the       remedy for his conduct. Of course, when Mr. Trump incited a       mob to violent action at the U.S. Capitol, it was an attempt       to delay the certification of the election results. This       followed months of Mr. Trump's public refusal to concede the       election on the grounds that it was stolen from him. Clearly,       the election process is insufficient in this case because Mr.       Trump does not recognize the validity of any election outcome       that does not favor him.        Failing to convict the former president would result in       several constitutional perils. First, Mr. Trump may once       again run for president. If re-elected, there is no reason to       believe that he would feel constrained by any limitations. An       acquittal essentially would provide him permission to commit       the same abuses or worse, without fear of accountability.       That includes leveraging all the powers of the presidency to       stay in power or wage an assault on a coequal branch of       government. Presidents must be held accountable when their       lust for power does violence to bedrock principles.       Disqualification from public office is the only remedy left       to prevent such behavior from Mr. Trump in the future.        A failure to convict would also be a lesson to future       presidents with authoritarian tendencies that they can attack       our democratic principles and institutions without       consequence. Even beyond a ``January Exception,'' a future       president might reason that otherwise impeachable conduct       will not be challenged during any part of their presidency.       In addition to rank abuse of power, a future president may       not submit to the peaceful transfer of power and the sacred       will of the people. In terms of the legislative branch,       Congress would send a message that it is unwilling to use its       own oversight powers functionally and effectively, and is       unwilling to uphold a meaningful separation of powers.       Disqualification is the necessary method for protecting the       republic from such democratic decay within the executive and       legislative branches.        This chapter in history reminds us that democracy is       fragile and we must diligently safeguard its principles. To       this end, I have a responsibility to defend the truth, the       rule of law, and our democratic institutions. I am compelled       to vote to convict President Donald J. Trump of committing       ``high Crimes and Misdemeanors'' and support his       disqualification from ever again holding an office of public       trust.
