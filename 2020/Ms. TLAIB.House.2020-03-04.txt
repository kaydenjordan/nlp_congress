 Mr. Speaker, today's Special Order is a call for  reproductive justice for women, those who can become pregnant and  families everywhere who believe, as I do, that reproductive rights are  a human right.   This Special Order hour comes as the Supreme Court, today, considers  yet another attack on our right as women and those who can become  pregnant to determine what we do with our own bodies. Worse, it comes  less than a month after Senate Majority Leader McConnell's thankfully  failed attempt to pass, not one, but two, abortion bans.   Never mind the 250-plus bills to reduce prescription drug costs,  improve access to the ballot box, and more that would make a real  difference in the lives of the American people that he could have taken  up; instead, he tried to control women's bodies.   The obsession with telling women, transgender folks, and nonbinary  people what to do with their own bodies must end. The obsession with  trying to legislate what those who can become pregnant can do and  cannot do with their own body must end.   I represent one of the most beautiful, most Black cities in the  country, the city of Detroit. The issue of reproductive justice is one  that is very much affecting Black women and women of color and  transgender people all around the world.   Of all female title X patients, for example, 32 percent are Latinas,  21 percent are Black, and 4 percent are Asian American and Pacific  Islander.   For the 2 million transgender people in the United States, this  funding makes access to the hormone replacement therapy and other  transition-related care that they need very much possible for their  health.   How? With over 100 clinics across 17 States offering HRT, Planned  Parenthood is one of the largest transition care providers in the  country. This money, this funding that is often threatened by anti- abortion rights advocates is actually a critical source of healthcare  for these women who already face health disparities.   Indeed, title X providers are one of the few places where women of  color can access reproductive and preventive healthcare services. It is  really critical in this institution, in this Chamber, that we ensure  that those health disparities are not exacerbated by a reduction or  revocation of that funding.   When we talk about 20-week abortion bans, the stories illustrating  why access to them is so important are as heartbreaking as they are  harrowing.   Take Jenni L. from my home State of Michigan as a perfect example. At  her 18-week ultrasound, Jenni and her husband were given the  devastating news that their unborn son had severe brain malfunction.  For weeks after that appointment, she visited multiple specialists and  genetic counselors who all gave her unborn son the same prognosis: He  was unlikely to survive a full term. So, at 21 weeks, Jenni terminated  her pregnancy.   Jenni said: ``Deciding to end my much-wanted pregnancy was difficult  and deeply sad, but also deeply personal. At no point during that  process did I consider my legislators a part of the conversation. I  listened to my doctors, genetic counselors, my family, and my heart.''   Women like Jenni should absolutely have the right to listen to their  doctors and their hearts when it comes to the health of themselves,  their unborn children, and their bodies.   Had the GOP had their way, Jenni would have spent the remainder of  her pregnancy term living in fear that at any moment her son would pass  away from this awful prognosis or the fear that she would give birth  and watch him suffer.   As a mother of two boys myself, I cannot imagine what Jenni went  through or her emotional trauma as she considered or made that very  personal choice. If she had to carry her son or not is up to her.   She is just one story of many in which a mother, through no fault of  her own, has had to make heartbreaking decisions about her pregnancy.   Sadly, nearly 99 percent of abortions actually do occur before this  deadline of 20 weeks into pregnancy, but they decide to ignore that.  They decide to make this a political issue, and it is not. It is a  human issue, a women's issue.   For Jenni and the countless other mothers like her, this legislative  body must keep their hands off of women's bodies. It is so critically  important to know, when we talk about this issue, that it is an  economic justice issue. It is a racial justice issue. It is  interconnected to so much of what we fight for as women in this  country, to have ourselves be able to make very important choices, not  only about our jobs, with no fear of discrimination, but also about our  health, which is so interconnected to so many other social justice  issues that we face.    So it is critically important that we really try to push back against  this continued agenda that has been politicized and making the issue of  choice and the issue of healthcare for women something that they are  vilifying and trying to use to a process.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Ocasio- Cortez).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr.  Garcia).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from the great State  of California (Mr. Lowenthal).    Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Pressley for her  incredible leadership on this important  [[Page H1502]]  issue across the world and not just here in the United States.   Also, this has been a wonderful experience for all of us new Members  to experience a Special Order that has been coordinated and created by  the Congressional Progressive Caucus to help many of us be able to give  a voice to many folks at home.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Massachusetts (Ms.  Pressley) for closing remarks.    Mr. Speaker, I thank my good colleague from Massachusetts  for her incredible, much-needed voice here in this Chamber.   As we all know, this Sunday is International Women's Day. So let's  celebrate all the women all over the world who stand up for what they  believe in, who speak truth to power, and who fight for their  communities as activists, voters, candidates, and elected officials.   This International Women's Day I want to uplift an issue that is  personal to me and so many of my sisters in service. Violence against  women in politics is a global problem. Research shows that women around  the world are subjected to physical, sexual, economic, and  psychological violence for choosing to participate in politics. When I  say around the world, I also mean here in the United States.   As one of the first Muslim women in Congress, my family and I face  constant death threats and harassment. But this will not stop me from  fighting and being a voice for 13 District Strong. But let's be clear.  Harassment, abuse, and assault are not the cost of doing politics.   Women deserve to have their voices heard. They deserve a seat at the  table. So this Sunday for International Women's Day let's finally  commit to stopping violence against women in politics.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 5 o'clock and 55 minutes  p.m.), the House adjourned until tomorrow, Thursday, March 5, 2020, at  9 a.m.                            ____________________
