 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to honor and thank the Patriot  Guard Riders, who live on Long Island and all across our country. The  Patriot Guard Riders, a nonprofit organization, consists of a diverse  group of motorcycle enthusiasts and patriots who share a deep  appreciation and commitment to honoring our U.S. servicemembers,  veterans, and their families.   Rooted in their unwavering patriotism and respect for our Nation's  military men and women, the Patriot Guard Riders go above and beyond  daily to ensure everyone, from our Nation's veterans to our  communities' first responders and their families, receive the  appreciation they deserve.   When a veteran arrives at Calverton National Cemetery for burial in  my district, the Patriot Guard Riders are there. On Veterans Day,  Memorial Day, the Fourth of July, and 9/11 events, the Patriot Guard  Riders are there. When our communities' veterans are returning from  their Honor Flight trips to Washington, D.C., our Patriot Guard Riders  are there. No matter rain or shine or snow, whether it is freezing cold  or scorching hot, the Patriot Guard Riders are there.   Last month, our Nation lost seven airmen in the line of duty, four of  whom were from the 106th Rescue Wing on Long Island. As their families  gathered at Gabreski Air National Guard Base to receive their sons,  brothers, husbands, and our heroes, several dozen Patriot Guard Riders  gathered to escort these fallen airmen from the base. It is in these  moments, the most difficult moments in the lives of the families of  these fallen airmen, when the Patriot Guard Riders, as detailed in  their motto, stand for those who stood for us.   The family members of these fallen servicemembers may not know the  names of these Patriot Guard Riders, but recognition is not what drives  [[Page H3157]]  them. As these fallen airmen were escorted from the base, a sea of  American flags rose up to flank their caskets. As their families  prepared to say their final good-byes, an unquestionable, unwavering  sense of patriotism swelled, carried on the backs of the Patriot Guard  Riders' bikes.   They have especially made our Nation's heroes their priority when  others have neglected to show their appreciation. Time after time, when  a veteran of World War II, Korea, Vietnam has been buried without  family or friends, you can count on the Patriot Guard Riders to have  been there. We need more Pete Jepsons in our world, who is the senior  ride captain for all of Suffolk County. There's Mary-Ann, LW, Wayne,  John, Eugene, Susan, Nancy, Marc, Dennis, Richard, Warren, Karen, and  so many others who would drop everything at a moment's notice to stand  for those who stood for us.   The Patriot Guard Riders are made up of hundreds of thousands of  everyday people all across America. With the inspiration that consumes  us whenever we see them in action, we should all aspire to the ideals  and dedication each and every one of them embody. To our Patriot Guard  Riders, thank you for your service to our great country.                            ____________________
