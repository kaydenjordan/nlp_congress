 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak on a topic that I  think is important to everyone in this institution. As most of my  colleagues know, June is National Alzheimer's and Brain Awareness  Month.   Mr. Speaker, if Members have been fortunate enough that they have not  had a family member affected, then I hope they remain fortunate in that  way because statistics suggest that each and every one of us is going  to have a family member who is affected by Alzheimer's or brain health  in one way or another.   The bill we are voting on today is our opportunity to fund that  research. If Members have been following Alzheimer's research over the  past 12 months, then they know it has been a disappointing 12 months  not because we haven't been funding it properly--we have--and not  because the research has not been going on--it has--but because things  we thought were so promising have turned out not to be so. We are  starting over again in a lot of different ways.   Mr. Speaker, if there is one thing I believe the American people can  count on amidst all the partisan strife is the way that we come  together to fund that fundamental health research that only the Federal  Government can stand behind and succeed in.   I thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for their support of  those accounts thus far. I hope that as we continue this appropriations  season, that will continue as well.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from California for yielding me the  time.   We finished up in the Rules Committee, I think, before 10 p.m. last  night. I was optimistic that we finished up that early.   It is not the Members you need to worry about, Mr. Speaker. It is the  staff of the Rules Committee you need to worry about, because they had  hundreds upon hundreds upon hundreds of amendments submitted that they  were going through all weekend long, trying to sort out what are those  amendments that could be made in order, what are those amendments that  would need waivers of the rules, what are those amendments that could  be considered on the floor and not be repetitive.   It is an amazing burden on the staff to have to go through all those  amendments, Mr. Speaker, and it is an unnecessary burden.   You weren't here at the time, Mr. Speaker, but I am looking right  down here below me at the gentleman from Kentucky. He used to be the  chairman of the Appropriations Committee and was the chairman of the  Appropriations Committee the last time we came to the House floor under  regular order, as my friend from California suggests, and we allowed  every Member of this institution--everyone who had been elected by  their constituents back home, everyone who has a voting card--to come  and offer any idea that they had to improve upon the underlying bill.   I don't take issue with much of what my friend from California said  about many of the good things in this bill. There are many good things  in this bill.   But what I love about the Appropriations Committee, Mr. Speaker,  different from the Rules Committee, is they come to the House year  after year and say we have done an amazing job working together in a  bipartisan way in the Appropriations Committee, but the other Members  of the House who don't serve on that committee, if they have some  expertise that they think can improve the bill, bring it on. Bring it  on. Let's go down to that House floor. Let's have that festival of  democracy. Let's test those ideas, and let's send the best product that  we can to the President's desk.                                time  1330    My friend from California says that this is a good bill and that it  should absolutely be signed by the President. She could be right. I  would probably disagree with her, Mr. Speaker, but she could be right.   The fact of the matter is, the law of the land, as it exists today,  won't let us implement this bill. This bill spends above those caps,  the statutory spending caps passed by the Congress and signed by the  President.   This bill cannot become law at these levels. If it were to, we would  have an automatic sequester that brings the levels down.   That is a terrible way to govern. We have learned that lesson over  the past 10 years together.   Mr. Speaker, I wish I didn't have to point to the gentleman from  Kentucky and say remember the days when  [[Page H4447]]  everybody's voice mattered in this institution. Remember those days.  That day should be today. It is not an easy pathway to get back to.   I remember when we were trying to do open rules on the Republican  side. My Democratic colleagues would come to the floor and offer  amendments that they knew would pass with a minority of Republican  votes and a lot of Democratic votes. Then they would vote in favor of  that amendment to change the bill, but they would vote against the  final bill, knowing it would not be able to pass without their support.   That is a great strategy, and it has been used by both sides, if my  colleagues want to be in the business of making a point. It is an awful  strategy if my colleagues want to be in the business of making a  difference. If Members came to this institution to govern instead of to  get the next sound bite, that is a terrible path to be on.   Mr. Speaker, if Members went through those hundreds of amendments the  way that the Rules Committee staff went through them over the weekend,  they would see good idea after good idea after good idea that has been  turned away before it could be considered on the floor of this House. I  don't know whether those amendments would have passed or failed. I know  some of them would have passed; I know some of them would have failed.   There was a time in this institution when we let the votes decide,  when we let the membership decide.   Mr. Speaker, we have changed those rules. It is now 13 men and women  who sit on the Rules Committee who decide.   I value my friend from California's suggestion that we get back to  regular order, and I know it is not an easy path to follow. This bill  is the most open we have had so far this year, and yet, it still denies  Member after Member, on both sides of the aisle, an opportunity to have  their constituents' voices heard.   Mr. Speaker, we can do better. If we speak with one voice in this  body and reject this rule, we will do better. All it takes is the  courage of our convictions to do that.   I hope my Members will stand with me in aspiring to do better today  than we did yesterday and better still tomorrow.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Minnesota (Mr. Stauber), a colleague of mine on the bipartisan  Transportation and Infrastructure Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from Minnesota.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Minnesota (Mr. Emmer), a gentleman who offered a germane amendment that  was rejected.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from Minnesota.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Spano).    Mr. Speaker, I would just like to ask my friend if she  would like to change her last statement.    Mr. Speaker, I know my colleague well, and I thoroughly  enjoy working with her on the Rules Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I am reserving the right to object.    Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from California. I do not  object.    Mr. Speaker, while we have many champions of life in  this institution on both sides of the aisle, none is stronger than the  gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Smith).   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr.  Smith), a tireless fighter for life.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Roy) for the purpose of a unanimous consent request.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Minnesota  (Mr. Stauber) for the purpose of a unanimous consent request.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Arizona (Mr.  Biggs) for the purpose of a unanimous consent request.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Weber) for the purpose of a unanimous consent request.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 15 seconds just to remind  the Chamber that we tried to offer an amendment last night in committee  that would have addressed this funding.  [[Page H4450]]    The Rules Committee rejected the consideration by the whole House of  a measure that would provide what we all agree is urgently needed  funding. We are seeing some of that passion here at this moment.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Gosar) for  the purpose of a unanimous consent request.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania  (Mr. Perry) for the purpose of a unanimous consent request.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Arizona  (Mrs. Lesko), one of my colleagues on the Rules Committee, for the  purpose of a unanimous consent request.                                time  1400     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 15 seconds to say when we  had this conversation in the Rules Committee yesterday--again, my  friend from California is on the Appropriations Committee--and she said  we talked about bringing forward an emergency funding bill that is more  comprehensive. We are working on expediting that.   I would say to my friend, agreeing to one of these unanimous consent  requests would be the absolute fastest way to expedite that if she  would like to reconsider her position.    Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of a unanimous consent  request, I yield to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Johnson).    Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of a unanimous consent  request, I yield to my neighbor from the great State of Georgia (Mr.  Hice).    Mr. Speaker, at this time, I yield for the purpose of a  unanimous consent request to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Cline).    Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of a unanimous consent  request, I yield to the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Duncan).    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, if we defeat the previous question, I will amend the  rule to bring H.R. 3056 immediately to the floor under an open rule.   I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my amendment in the  Record immediately prior to the vote on the previous question.    Mr. Speaker, we spent a great deal of time today talking  about the humanitarian crisis on the border, and that is because,  despite all of the very positive things that are in this bill that my  friend from California has mentioned, what is not in this bill is one  single penny to go to the border today. There is not a Member of this  institution who does not know that we need that money going to the  border today.   I am not talking about contentious issues like border security,  though that shouldn't be a contentious issue. That should be an issue  of agreement, as well. I am talking about an issue on which we are  unanimous, which is taking care of those people who are in the  [[Page H4451]]  custody of the United States of America.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 3056 would provide $4.5 billion. Mr. Speaker, as a  fiscal conservative, I don't say that lightly--$4.5 billion. That is  not $4.5 billion to get us through another year, Mr. Speaker. That is  not $4.5 billion to start in October and run us through the next fiscal  year. That is $4.5 billion today to address needs that exist today, to  fill shortfalls that are happening today, to solve problems that demand  solutions today.   There is not one word in this bill to provide a single solution  anywhere in America today. But if we defeat the previous question and  amend the rule as I have suggested, we can provide those solutions  today, and we can do it in a partnership way that will make America  proud.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    I would advise my friend that I do not see any speakers  remaining, and when the gentlewoman has exhausted her speakers, I will  be prepared to close.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, we are talking about two kinds of issues down here  today. When I listen to my friend from California talk about all the  wonderful things that are in the underlying bill, I can't tell you how  much I wanted to stand up and celebrate with her that appropriations  season is often that way.   Mr. Speaker, you haven't seen it in your time, but there was a time  in this institution where the way we spent America's money reflected  America's priorities, and it turned out--you wouldn't know it by  reading the newspaper, Mr. Speaker, but it turned out those priorities  didn't hinge on whether you had an R or a D behind your name. It didn't  hinge on whether you came from the Deep South or the Northwest.   It turned out, when we started voting on issues one dollar at a time,  we began to find that we had agreements with one another that had not  yet been explored. We began to find, Mr. Speaker, that we could  celebrate achievements together in ways that had not yet been explored.   Mr. Speaker, the year I came to Congress, and many of my other  colleagues here came that very same year, you may remember the  appropriations process hadn't been finished by the Democrats. When  Republicans took over, the young freshman class of which I was a part  said we need to get down there, and we need to finish that job. It was  a Tuesday, Mr. Speaker. We brought up the entire Federal discretionary  budget.   Now, that is a lousy way to do business. It is a lousy way to do  business. We used to bring up bills one appropriations bill at a time.   There are 12 bills, Mr. Speaker. We have gotten in a bad habit of  omnibus bills. As you know, what we switched to last year and what the  Democratic majority is continuing this year is bringing up groups of  four or five bills together.   But at that time, in the spring of 2011, Mr. Speaker, we brought them  all up. We brought them all up together. And do you know what we said,  Mr. Speaker, the brand-new Republican majority?   You know how it is when majorities change, Mr. Speaker. Folks have  gotten their feelings hurt. They feel like they were a little wronged  by the previous majority. My friend from California knows what I am  talking about.   You might have expected the Republican majority to say, ``We are  going to jam our priorities through, diversity of ideas be damned,''  but we didn't. It was Speaker John Boehner at that time, Mr. Speaker,  and he said we are bringing up the entire Federal discretionary budget,  and any Member, Mr. Speaker, any Member from either side of the aisle  who has an idea about how to make it better, their ideas are welcome  here on the floor of the House.   Oh, you want to talk about a festival of democracy, Mr. Speaker? We  started on a Tuesday. We thought we were going to be done by a  Thursday. We ended up going 24 hours a day, finishing in the early  hours of Saturday morning.   And by ``finishing,'' Mr. Speaker, I mean we allowed every single  Member's voice in this body be heard on every single issue that their  constituents sent them here to address. Every Member of this  institution left tired, Mr. Speaker, but every Member of this  institution left feeling like they had had a chance to represent their  constituents the way the United States Constitution intended.                                time  1415    It doesn't always work that way, Mr. Speaker. I sit on the Rules  Committee. We decide what amendments are made in order and what  amendments aren't.   In the last Congress, when the Republicans controlled this  institution, we didn't make every amendment in order. We did not make  every amendment in order, Mr. Speaker.   But what we did do is we made more Democratic amendments in order  than Republican amendments. We did. But because, for obvious reasons,  when you are in the leadership, it is easier to push your agenda. When  you have opportunity not to be in the leadership, it is harder to push  your agenda. We made more Democratic amendments in order last Congress,  Mr. Speaker, than Republican amendments in an effort to bring a  diversity of ideas.   This Congress, Mr. Speaker, when Republicans are in the minority and  the Democratic majority is writing the rules, 70 percent of all  amendments that have been made in order have been Democratic  amendments. Eighteen percent of the amendments have come to  Republicans. Five times more amendments were given to the majority than  to the minority. Again, we gave more to the minority than the majority.   I see my friends from Minnesota down here saying, ``I had an  amendment. It was a good idea. My constituents asked me to offer it. It  is germane to the underlying bill. I just want my day on the floor to  vote.'' That day has been denied, Mr. Speaker, for amendment after  amendment after amendment after amendment. Hundreds of amendments. Good  ideas, bipartisan ideas.   My friend from Illinois, Mr. Shimkus, had an amendment, Mr. Speaker,  that required that we fund nuclear waste disposal licensing. Nuclear  waste is  [[Page H4452]]  spread out all across this country. I don't know if it is in your  district, Mr. Speaker, but I have got it right next door to me. It is  stored as best we can across the Nation. We are trying to license a  national repository. We have spent billions as a nation preparing for  that. All he wanted was a vote on an amendment that has wide and deep  bipartisan support. I think it would have won, but we will never know  because the powers that be denied him even the chance to discuss it.   The question isn't, is there something good in this underlying bill?  The question is, do you believe any of the rest of us have anything to  add to make it better?   My friends made in order some Republican amendments. I told you that  so far this year there have been five times more Democratic amendments  made in order than Republican amendments. This bill today is better. It  is only twice as many Democratic amendments than Republican amendments.  It is still nowhere close to fair, it is still not representative, but  this is where we are.   There is not one dollar, Mr. Speaker, for the humanitarian crisis on  the border. The New York Times in an editorial on Sunday said, ``The  financial reality is that this agency is overwhelmed.'' Talking about  the Office of Refugee Resettlement.   ``So far this fiscal year, it has taken charge of nearly 41,000  unaccompanied children, a 57 percent increase over last year. The  entire program could run out of funding by the end of June.''   There is not one dollar in this bill for that. That is what my  colleagues came to ask unanimous consent to do. That is what defeating  the previous question would do.   We all agree there is a crisis at the border.   The editorial goes on for the New York Times, Mr. Speaker.   ``There should be no ambivalence about the urgency of addressing the  humanitarian needs. While lawmakers wring their hands and drag their  feet, tens of thousands of migrant children are suffering.   ``Congress needs to get serious about dealing with that suffering.''   There is no bill on its way to the floor, Mr. Speaker, except for the  one you heard my colleague ask Member after Member after Member for  unanimous consent to bring. And you heard my colleagues on the other  side of the aisle deny that. I understand. We don't usually get  unanimous consent requests to prove during Rules Committee debate.   I don't fault my colleague for objecting. But if we defeat the  previous question as I am proposing, Mr. Speaker, and we add an  amendment to the rule, we will continue to consider the bill that my  friend from California is so proud of. But we will also consider the  bill that provides immediate funding to the men and women serving us on  the border as they seek to address this humanitarian crisis.   It gives me no pleasure to bring it up during Rules Committee debate,  Mr. Speaker, because I don't think we disagree on this. I think we are  together on this. I cannot, for the life of me, understand why the  leadership on the Democratic side of the aisle is saying no and no and  no and no to doing something that they know needs to be done. I do not  understand it.   But I know this. Here, on Wednesday, we have got one shot to fix it:  one. Not two, not three. There aren't a dozen different options. We  have got one shot to fix it.   Defeat this previous question, add an amendment to the rule, and  bring up this emergency funding supplemental. Do what we all know needs  to be done. If it stretches from the editorial page of the New York  Times to a conservative Republican from the deep south, Mr. Speaker,  you know it has broad bipartisan appeal.   We get so used to saying no in this Chamber. We get so used to  running each other out in politics. Let's take yes for an answer. Let's  do something we all know needs to be done. Let's take a shot at doing  better today than we did yesterday. Maybe we will come back and do  better still tomorrow.   Defeat the previous question. Add this amendment to the bill. In the  absence of that, I will have to ask that we oppose that rule, Mr.  Speaker, and give us a chance to go back to the drawing board one more  time.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.
