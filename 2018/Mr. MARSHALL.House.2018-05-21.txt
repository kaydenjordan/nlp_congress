 Mr. Speaker, good afternoon and welcome back to  Washington, D.C. I am sure, like me, you spent some time back in your  district this weekend.   Every year, on Memorial Day, this country pauses to honor and  remember those soldiers who have made the ultimate sacrifice for our  freedoms and liberties.   If I could, I would like to share a story from my own district, from  my own State of Kansas, which I got to participate in this past  weekend.   For over 30 years now, Vietnam veterans have participated in the  ``Run for the Wall.'' I am sure this is something that many of us are  all familiar with. Starting in California, some 1,500 Vietnam veterans  hop on their motorcycles and they take three different routes across  the country, with the goal to end up in Washington, D.C. at the Vietnam  Veterans Memorial over Memorial Day weekend.   Every year, one of their stops is in Goodland, Kansas, which is in  the northwest corner of my State. I was allowed to participate in the  hospitality extended by those folks in Goodland. If you could, imagine  a small city of 4,000 to 5,000 people and having 600 motorcycles show  up on a Saturday afternoon. They had been driving all the way from  Albuquerque, New Mexico, through 30-mile-an-hour winds and rain, so  they were starving by the time they got to Goodland, Kansas. And when  they get there, we have a welcome reception for them with a complete  dinner: a hot meal, fresh fruits, vegetables, the whole works.   With one simple Facebook message, over 600 homemade deserts were  brought from across Goodland to feed and recognize those Vietnam  veterans.   Then Sunday morning, the veterans wake up, after having been provided  housing at Northwest Technical College for free, they wake up to a hot  pancake and sausage breakfast, provided by the local Rotary Club.   Then those veterans hop on their motorcycles, and they drive on the  interstate across Kansas. At every interstate where there is an  overpass, there are Kansas citizens waving at them and giving them the  heroes welcome that they never got some, I guess, 40 years ago.   They end up at Fort Riley, ``Home of the Big Red One,'' and there,  Fort Riley makes a super welcome for those soldiers, and again, gives  them a hero's welcome. These soldiers are going to show up here on  Friday and they are going to get together at the Pentagon. At that  point, over 500,000 motorcycles will be going across the mall of the  United States Capital and on to Arlington Cemetery.   I hope and pray that our news media will share that story of all  those soldiers who are now trying to close the chapter, trying to honor  those who went before them, to honor their fellow soldiers who never  made it back from that war.   I just ask that the House and this country pause to remember our  Vietnam veterans, and all of our veterans going back to the Civil War,  all those soldiers that have made the ultimate sacrifice.                            ____________________
