 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, as the Trump shutdown drags on, more  and more Americans are getting hurt. Public servants have been working  without pay, critical Agencies are unable to perform the functions they  are supposed to perform for the American people--whether that is  inspecting food supply, protecting our airports and prisons, or helping  farmers and small businesses get loans. We are now approaching tax  season with the IRS under severe limitations.   When will the President's ridiculous manufactured crisis come to an  end?   I have three words for President Trump, Leader McConnell, and our  Republican Senators: Open the government.   We can debate border security. We have debated it for a month and a  half. We haven't come to a conclusion. Open the government, and we can  debate border security while the government is open.   Now, for weeks, as I said, we have been at a standstill. We have  offered the President several ways to uncouple his demand for a border  wall from a government shutdown. The President has been obstinate,  insisting on a $5.7 billion wall he promised that Mexico would pay for.   The few times that his deputies--the Vice President and the Chief of  Staff--have made proposals to Democrats, the President contradicted  them soon thereafter. Just yesterday, the President flatly refused to  consider a proposal from his close ally in the Senate, Senator Graham,  to open the government temporarily while we debate border security.   Sadly, neither Republicans in Congress nor the President's own staff  seem willing to tell him what everyone else already knows: The  President does not have the votes in either House of Congress for his  expensive, ineffective wall.   The reason we have been unable to make any progress is that President  Trump is not yet interested in making progress.   So there is only one person who can help America break through this  gridlock: Leader Mitch McConnell. For the past month, Leader McConnell  has been content to hide behind the President, essentially giving him a  veto over what comes to the floor of the Senate. It has put him in the  ridiculous position of refusing to consider legislation to reopen the  government that nearly every Senate Republican has voted for-- legislation that leader McConnell has proudly voted for; legislation  that the American people favor by a 2-to-1 margin, including nearly 40  percent of Republicans.   The American people suffering the dire consequences of this shutdown  can no longer afford to wait for the President to come around. The  President must be shown the will of the Congress, and I believe that if  Leader McConnell were to put the House-passed bills on  [[Page S189]]  the floor, they would receive a significant majority in the Senate, a  veto-proof majority.   So I would appeal to Leader McConnell: Do what is right for the  country. Do what is right for hundreds of thousands of Federal  employees laboring without pay. Do what is right for our farmers and  small businesses, homeowners, and taxpayers. Do what is right for  America.   President Trump may not care about the harm he is doing to all of  these people, but our Republican Senators, including Leader McConnell,  should.   A few years ago, Leader McConnell remarked: Remember me? I am the guy  that gets us out of shutdowns.   Well, Leader McConnell, now is the time. Leader McConnell, allow a  vote on legislation and reopen the government.   In a short time, a few of my Democratic colleagues will ask the  Senate for that chance. Will Leader McConnell help us reopen the  government? Will some of our Republican Senators actually join us, not  in nice words but in actually voting to reopen the government? Or will  Leader McConnell block it yet again, aiding and abetting President  Trump's desire to extend his government shutdown?   One final point here, President Trump thinks if he holds out long  enough, he will win the fight with the American people. Every day he is  losing. The Gallup poll today had him at a near-record low of 37  percent popularity. Even some of his base is losing face.   President Trump, you are not going to win this fight with the  American people. Every day it drags on, you are less popular. Every day  it drags on, people blame you and the Republicans, not the Democrats.  You are not winning the fight. You may be in your own untruth bubble,  but you are not winning the fight. Everyone knows that. We certainly  do.                          Nomination of William Barr    Madam President, on another matter, as we speak, the Senate Judiciary  Committee is conducting its hearing on the nomination of William Barr  to be the next Attorney General of the United States. It is an august  position that demands the highest degree of credibility, transparency,  and fidelity to rule of law, even during a normal Presidency.   But given President Trump's actions, his disdain for rule of law, his  derision of the rulings of an independent judiciary, his public  contempt for law enforcement procedures of the Justice Department, the  burden of proof for William Barr is higher than it would be for other  Presidents.   This is not a normal Presidency. We don't need an Attorney General  who will just comply with this President. That is a danger to the  Republic.   The Senate should expect unequivocal and explicit commitments from  Mr. Barr to resist President Trump. Mr. Barr cannot merely give  perfunctory, boilerplate assurances. Saying ``I am for transparency''  is not good enough.   Will he release Mueller's report--yes or no? If he can't answer  ``yes,'' he doesn't deserve the position. Will he not interfere in any  way with Mueller's investigation as opposed to saying he likes Mueller  and thinks he is doing a good job? If Mr. Barr can't say ``yes,'' that  he will not interfere in any way with the Mueller investigation, he  doesn't deserve the job, particularly in light of his writings.   We should expect unequivocal commitments from Barr to defend the  integrity of the FBI and our Federal law enforcement officers, not  vague statements that give him plenty of wiggle room to do President  Trump's dirty work if he gets to be Attorney General, and we should  expect an unequivocal commitment from Mr. Barr to allow the special  investigation to proceed and conclude without any--underline ``any''-- interference.   One last point, the expectations for Mr. Barr are even more demanding  given the recent revelation that he wrote a detailed, unsolicited memo  to the Justice Department criticizing the Mueller investigation,  despite having no knowledge of its workings. The memo revealed that  Barr holds an astonishingly broad--almost imperial--view of executive  power. That should also be a serious line of inquiry for our colleagues  on the Judiciary Committee.   The next Attorney General will take charge of a Justice Department  that has been embroiled in near-constant chaos for 2 years at a  critical moment for our democracy. The Senate should only approve an  Attorney General of unimpeachable integrity and unimpeachable fidelity  to the rule of law, with the strength and conviction to resist the  worst impulses of this President, who, probably, when it comes to the  Justice Department, has the worst impulses of any President we have  ever had.                              Russian Sanctions    Madam President, finally, on Russia sanctions, later this afternoon  the Senate will move to consider a motion to proceed to a resolution of  disapproval on the Treasury Department's proposal to relax sanctions on  three companies owned and controlled by sanctioned Russian oligarch  Oleg Deripaska. The case against the Treasury Department's proposal is  strong. It fails to sufficiently limit Deripaska's stake in the three  companies. It merely reduces his ownership to 45 percent. Many U.S.  companies are heavily influenced by an owner who controls much less  than a 45-percent share. Why didn't they reduce it to 10 or 15? But  they didn't.   Treasury's plan also allows for Russian shareholders with family and  business ties to Deripaska to retain shareholder interest. Considering  that Deripaska's ex-wife and father-in-law control 7 percent of the  company, add that to the 45, and he has total control. So Treasury does  not come close to going far enough.   Beyond the weak terms of the deal, the Senate must consider that  Deripaska has deep ties to President Putin and his intelligence  apparatus, organized crime, and Mr. Paul Manafort, a subject of the  special counsel's investigation.   It is deeply suspect that the Trump administration would propose  sanctions relief for Deripaska's companies before the special counsel  finished his work. We should not allow any sanction relief for  President Putin's trusted agents or the companies they control before  the conclusion of the investigation.   Finally--and maybe most seriously of all--there is a foreign policy  issue here at stake. President Putin's government, one of Russia's  largest banks, and the Russian economy have a direct interest in  sanction relief for Deripaska's companies. Why is the Trump  administration proposing sanctions relief when President Putin has not  yet made any move to curtail or constrain his maligned activities  around the globe?   Now, this morning, my friend from Kentucky called this a political  stunt and a farce. That is appalling. After all Putin has done, this is  a stunt and a farce? And why are we doing it now?   He said: Why are Democrats doing it?   Because the underlying law that allows for this resolution has a 30- day alarm clock on it. The alarm clock goes off Thursday. Democrats are  not forcing this vote; the law is.   I would say to the leader, Democrats were not the ones who decided to  relax sanctions on Putin's cronies just before the Christmas holiday,  hoping no one would notice. That was the Trump administration. If  Leader McConnell wants to know why we are voting on Russian sanctions  this afternoon, he should go talk to the White House.   So allow me to appeal directly to my Republican colleagues. Whatever  your view on this issue, there are enough questions--enough questions-- that we should vote for the motion to proceed so that you can hear the  debate. It is an important debate. Putin is laughing with the damage he  is doing to America. We cannot go along.   In the past, one of the finer moments of this Senate, which Leader  McConnell talks about all the time, was when we joined in a bipartisan  way to impose sanctions on Russia. Well, we should not relax that view.  We should not relax that vigilance. The details here are complex. The  Senate and the American people ought to have a real understanding of  the facts before voting. If that debate is allowed to proceed, I  believe my Senate colleagues will see the wisdom of keeping the current  sanctions in place.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I am not going to talk about the  substance of what we are here for.   To my dear friend, Johnny, whom I love and who serves the best  barbecue I ever have every year, among his many other attributes, I  will just make this point.   He says it is not a Democratic shutdown or a Republican shutdown. It  is a Trump shutdown. We all know it. Donald Trump has called for the  shutting down of the government 25 times. He said at our meeting he is  proud to shut down the government.   We Democrats do not want to shut down the government. In fact, our  slogan--our watchword--is ``open up the government.'' We have a  difference on border security. We are for it. You are for it. You are  for something different than we are, but we are not shutting down the  government, and everyone knows it. The public opinion polls know it.  There are 40 percent of all Republicans, let alone Democrats and  Independents, who are for the wall, and most of those people say the  government shouldn't be shut down over the wall.   I know how aggravated my colleague is. I would suggest to him that  the best solution is to vote for what he voted for--or the whole  Republican Party did by unanimous consent--which is to open up the  government. Then we can discuss our border security issues.   I yield to my dear friend.    Madam President, I thank my colleague.   There is just one difference between what happened then and what is  happening now: Neither side was shutting down the government until it  got its way.   I will make my statement, I guess, and wait for Leader McConnell and  the motion to proceed.                                 S.J. Res. 2    Madam President, before we take a vote on the motion to proceed on  this resolution, I will make two brief points, and I know my colleagues  have discussed this very well.   First, my friends the Republican leader and former Republican whip  Senator Cornyn are being incredibly disingenuous to suggest this is a  political stunt and to accuse Democrats of forcing this vote out of the  blue. The timing of this vote was not determined by me or by Leader  McConnell. It was determined by the wall. The law says that we only  have 30 days to disapprove of sanctions relief on Russia. This was  filed right before Christmas.   I would suggest the administration and the Treasury hope to get away  with it because they know how unpopular it would be to remove sanctions  on Deripaska or on the companies he controls. They knew how unpopular  it would be, so they snuck it in right before Christmas, right before  we left. We have only 30 days, and those 30 days expire on Thursday. If  we wait, those 30 days will expire--they will be gone--and we will have  no opportunity. So this is no accident.   If Leader McConnell and Senator Cornyn want to know why this vote is  today, they should talk to the White House, because it is the one that  filed this on December 21.   Second, there are serious, substantive reasons to oppose the Treasury  plan. It fails to sufficiently limit Mr. Deripaska's stake in these  three Russian companies. It gives Vladimir Putin exactly what he  wants--sanctions relief on three major producers of aluminum and other  metals. That is wrong for the country. Putin's Russia continues to run  rampant over international norms, to meddle in democratic elections,  and to destabilize the world. Russia has violated the sovereignty of  Ukraine, has interfered in our elections and the Brexit vote, has  propped up the brutal Assad regime, and has been implicated in nerve  agent attacks on the soil of our closest ally. Yet the Trump  administration proposes reducing sanctions on Putin and his cronies.   Show me the behavior from Vladimir Putin that warrants such relief. I  can't think of any, and I will bet 90 percent of all Americans can't  think of any.   Let me be clear. A vote against this resolution--a vote to not allow  us to proceed--is a vote to go easy on President Putin and his  oligarchs.   I understand my friend the leader, the Republican leader, will move  to table the motion to proceed to the resolution. I remind my  colleagues that  [[Page S201]]  the timeline runs out on Thursday--48 hours from now. We have to take  this vote now. I strongly urge my colleagues to vote no on the motion  to table and yes on the motion to proceed.                              Motion to Proceed    Madam President, I move to proceed to Calendar No. 13, S.J. Res. 2.    I ask for the yeas and nays.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 15  seconds.    Madam President, the leader's rhetoric belies his words.  If you believe Putin is a thug, you don't vote to table this  resolution.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                   S. 115         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. PERMANENT RESIDENT STATUS FOR ALEMSEGHED MUSSIE                     TESFAMICAL.

(b) Adjustment of Status.--If Alemseghed Mussie Tesfamical       enters the United States before the filing deadline specified       in subsection (c), Alemseghed Mussie Tesfamical shall be       considered to have entered into and remained lawfully in the       United States and, if otherwise eligible, shall be eligible       for adjustment of status under section 245 of the Immigration       and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1255) as of the date of the       enactment of this Act.        (c) Deadline for Application and Payment of Fees.--      Subsections (a) and (b) shall apply only if the application       for issuance of an immigrant visa or for adjustment of status       is filed by Alemseghed Mussie Tesfamical with appropriate       fees not later than 2 years after the date of the enactment       of this Act.

(e) Budgetary Effects.--The budgetary effects of this Act,       for the purpose of complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go       Act of 2010 (Public Law 111-139), shall be determined by       reference to the latest statement titled ``Budgetary Effects       of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act, submitted for printing       in the Congressional Record by the Chairman of the Committee       on the Budget of the Senate, provided that such statement has       been submitted prior to the vote on passage.                                  ______                                         By Mr. SCHUMER (for himself, Mr. Gardner, Ms. Baldwin, Mr.          Bennet, Mr. Blumenthal, Ms. Cantwell, Mr. Casey, Mr. Coons, Ms.          Duckworth, Mrs. Gillibrand, Ms. Harris, Ms. Hassan, Mr. Jones,          Mr. Leahy, Mr. Markey, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Van Hollen, Ms. Warren,          Mr. Tester, Mr. Sanders, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Booker, Mr. Merkley,          and Ms. Smith):   S. 117. A bill to prohibit discrimination against individuals with  disabilities who need long-term services and supports, and for other  purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                   S. 117         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Disability Integration Act       of 2019''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.         (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:        (1) In enacting the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990       (referred to in this Act as the ``ADA''), Congress--        (A) recognized that ``historically, society has tended to       isolate and segregate individuals with disabilities, and,       despite some improvements, such forms of discrimination       against individuals with disabilities continue to be a       serious and pervasive social problem''; and        (B) intended that the ADA assure ``full participation'' and       ``independent living'' for individuals with disabilities by       addressing ``discrimination against individuals with       disabilities [that] persists in critical areas'', including       institutionalization.        (2) While Congress expected that the ADA's integration       mandate would be interpreted in a manner that ensures that       individuals who are eligible for institutional placement are       able to exercise a right to community-based long-term       services and supports, that expectation has not been       fulfilled.        (3) The holdings of the Supreme Court in Olmstead v. L.C.,       527 U.S. 581 (1999), and companion cases, have clearly       articulated that individuals with disabilities have a civil       right under the ADA to participate in society as equal       citizens. However, many States still do not provide       sufficient community-based long-term services and supports to       individuals with disabilities to end segregation in       institutions.        (4) The right to live in the community is necessary for the       exercise of the civil rights that the ADA was intended to       secure for all individuals with disabilities. The lack of       adequate community-based services and supports has imperiled       the civil rights of all individuals with disabilities, and       has undermined the very promise of the ADA. It is, therefore,       necessary to recognize in statute a robust and fully       articulated right to community living.  [[Page S222]]         (5) States, with a few exceptions, continue to approach       decisions regarding long-term services and supports from       social welfare and budgetary perspectives, but for the       promise of the ADA to be fully realized, States must approach       these decisions from a civil rights perspective.        (6) States have not consistently planned to ensure       sufficient services and supports for individuals with       disabilities, including those with the most significant       disabilities, to enable individuals with disabilities to live       in the most integrated setting. As a result, many individuals       with disabilities who reside in institutions are prevented       from residing in the community and individuals with       disabilities who are not in institutions find themselves at       risk of institutional placement.        (7) The continuing existence of unfair and unnecessary       institutionalization denies individuals with disabilities the       opportunity to live and participate on an equal basis in the       community and costs the United States billions of dollars in       unnecessary spending related to perpetuating dependency and       unnecessary confinement.        (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--        (1) to clarify and strengthen the ADA's integration mandate       in a manner that accelerates State compliance;        (2) to clarify that every individual who is eligible for       long-term services and supports has a federally protected       right to be meaningfully integrated into that individual's       community and receive community-based long-term services and       supports;        (3) to ensure that States provide long-term services and       supports to individuals with disabilities in a manner that       allows individuals with disabilities to live in the most       integrated setting, including the individual's own home, have       maximum control over their services and supports, and ensure       that long-term services and supports are provided in a manner       that allows individuals with disabilities to lead an       independent life;        (4) to establish a comprehensive State planning requirement       that includes enforceable, measurable objectives that are       designed to transition individuals with all types of       disabilities at all ages out of institutions and into the       most integrated setting; and        (5) to establish a requirement for clear and uniform annual       public reporting by States that includes reporting about--        (A) the number of individuals with disabilities who are       served in the community and the number who are served in       institutions; and        (B) the number of individuals with disabilities who have       transitioned from an institution to a community-based living       situation, and the type of community-based living situation       into which those individuals have transitioned.       SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS AND RULE.         (a) Definitions.--In this Act:        (1) Activities of daily living.--The term ``activities of       daily living'' has the meaning given the term in section       441.505 of title 42, Code of Federal Regulations (or a       successor regulation).        (2) Administrator.--The term ``Administrator'' means--        (A) the Administrator of the Administration for Community       Living; or        (B) another designee of the Secretary of Health and Human       Services.        (3) Community-based.--The term ``community-based'', when       used in reference to services or supports, means services or       supports that are provided to an individual with an LTSS       disability to enable that individual to live in the community       and lead an independent life, and that are delivered in       whichever setting the individual with an LTSS disability has       chosen out of the following settings with the following       qualities:        (A) In the case of a dwelling or a nonresidential setting       (such as a setting in which an individual with an LTSS       disability receives day services and supported employment), a       dwelling or setting--        (i) that, as a matter of infrastructure, environment,       amenities, location, services, and features, is integrated       into the greater community and supports, for each individual       with an LTSS disability who receives services or supports at       the setting--         (I) full access to the greater community (including access       to opportunities to seek employment and work in competitive       integrated settings, engage in community life, control       personal resources, and receive services in the community);       and        (II) access to the greater community to the same extent as       access to the community is enjoyed by an individual who is       not receiving long-term services or supports;         (ii) that the individual has selected as a meaningful       choice from among nonresidential setting options, including       nondisability-specific settings;        (iii) in which an individual has rights to privacy,       dignity, and respect, and freedom from coercion and       restraint;        (iv) that, as a matter of infrastructure, environment,       amenities, location, services, and features, optimizes, but       does not regiment, individual initiative, autonomy, and       independence in making life choices, including choices about       daily activities, physical environment, and persons with whom       the individual interacts; and        (v) that, as a matter of infrastructure, environment,       amenities, location, services, and features, facilitates       individual choice regarding the provision of services and       supports, and who provides those services and supports.

There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                   S. 117         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Disability Integration Act       of 2019''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.         (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:        (1) In enacting the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990       (referred to in this Act as the ``ADA''), Congress--        (A) recognized that ``historically, society has tended to       isolate and segregate individuals with disabilities, and,       despite some improvements, such forms of discrimination       against individuals with disabilities continue to be a       serious and pervasive social problem''; and        (B) intended that the ADA assure ``full participation'' and       ``independent living'' for individuals with disabilities by       addressing ``discrimination against individuals with       disabilities [that] persists in critical areas'', including       institutionalization.        (2) While Congress expected that the ADA's integration       mandate would be interpreted in a manner that ensures that       individuals who are eligible for institutional placement are       able to exercise a right to community-based long-term       services and supports, that expectation has not been       fulfilled.        (3) The holdings of the Supreme Court in Olmstead v. L.C.,       527 U.S. 581 (1999), and companion cases, have clearly       articulated that individuals with disabilities have a civil       right under the ADA to participate in society as equal       citizens. However, many States still do not provide       sufficient community-based long-term services and supports to       individuals with disabilities to end segregation in       institutions.        (4) The right to live in the community is necessary for the       exercise of the civil rights that the ADA was intended to       secure for all individuals with disabilities. The lack of       adequate community-based services and supports has imperiled       the civil rights of all individuals with disabilities, and       has undermined the very promise of the ADA. It is, therefore,       necessary to recognize in statute a robust and fully       articulated right to community living.  [[Page S222]]         (5) States, with a few exceptions, continue to approach       decisions regarding long-term services and supports from       social welfare and budgetary perspectives, but for the       promise of the ADA to be fully realized, States must approach       these decisions from a civil rights perspective.        (6) States have not consistently planned to ensure       sufficient services and supports for individuals with       disabilities, including those with the most significant       disabilities, to enable individuals with disabilities to live       in the most integrated setting. As a result, many individuals       with disabilities who reside in institutions are prevented       from residing in the community and individuals with       disabilities who are not in institutions find themselves at       risk of institutional placement.        (7) The continuing existence of unfair and unnecessary       institutionalization denies individuals with disabilities the       opportunity to live and participate on an equal basis in the       community and costs the United States billions of dollars in       unnecessary spending related to perpetuating dependency and       unnecessary confinement.        (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--        (1) to clarify and strengthen the ADA's integration mandate       in a manner that accelerates State compliance;        (2) to clarify that every individual who is eligible for       long-term services and supports has a federally protected       right to be meaningfully integrated into that individual's       community and receive community-based long-term services and       supports;        (3) to ensure that States provide long-term services and       supports to individuals with disabilities in a manner that       allows individuals with disabilities to live in the most       integrated setting, including the individual's own home, have       maximum control over their services and supports, and ensure       that long-term services and supports are provided in a manner       that allows individuals with disabilities to lead an       independent life;        (4) to establish a comprehensive State planning requirement       that includes enforceable, measurable objectives that are       designed to transition individuals with all types of       disabilities at all ages out of institutions and into the       most integrated setting; and        (5) to establish a requirement for clear and uniform annual       public reporting by States that includes reporting about--        (A) the number of individuals with disabilities who are       served in the community and the number who are served in       institutions; and        (B) the number of individuals with disabilities who have       transitioned from an institution to a community-based living       situation, and the type of community-based living situation       into which those individuals have transitioned.
