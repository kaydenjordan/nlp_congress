 Mr. President, we are considering the nomination of  Dan Brouillette to be the Deputy Secretary for the Department of  Energy. Mr. Brouillette has a long history of distinguished service to  our Nation. He is a veteran. He has served in the Department of Energy.  He has been the staff director for the House Energy and Commerce  Committee. More recently, he has held high-level posts in the private  sector--first, as vice president at Ford, currently as senior vice  president at USAA.   He has strong experience and thorough knowledge of the Department he  has chosen to return to. He understands the work that its thousands of  scientists undertake and the importance of maximizing their research  efforts, especially in a time of constrained Federal budgets.   He recognizes the importance of our 17 National Labs and the  Department's responsibility for environmental management, including the  cleanup of Cold War-era legacy sites. As second in command to Secretary  Perry, Mr. Brouillette will oversee programs critical to our Nation's  cyber security, energy innovation, and scientific discovery.   Based on his hearings before the Energy and Natural Resources  Committee, I am confident he is up for the challenge and ready for this  role. I would urge all of my colleagues to support the nomination of  Dan Brouillette to be the Deputy Secretary of the Department of Energy.   Mr. President, I yield all time.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to executive session for the en bloc consideration of the  following nominations: Executive Calendar Nos. 101 and 102.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  vote on the nominations en bloc with no intervening action or debate;  that if confirmed, the motions to reconsider be considered made and  laid upon the table en bloc; that the President be immediately notified  of the Senate's action; that no further motions be in order; that any  statements relating to the nominations be printed in the Record; and  that the Senate then resume legislative session.    Mr. President, I want to take just a moment and thank  those who have worked so hard to make sure that the Federal Energy  Regulatory Commission will have a functioning quorum--and more than  just having a functioning quorum, the quality of individuals we are  sending to the FERC as Commissioners is truly impressive to see.   Neil Chatterjee, whom, without doubt, almost all of us on this floor  know, has been working here in the Senate, working in the leader's  office for years, and has been an invaluable asset to me and my staff  on the Energy and Natural Resources Committee. He is extremely  knowledgeable, extremely committed and dedicated, and it has been a  real pleasure to work with him.   I don't know Mr. Powelson as well, but having had an opportunity to  advance his name before the Energy and Natural Resources Committee for  confirmation, too, I know that the expertise and the credentials he  will bring to the Commission are greatly appreciated.   I think we recognize that there is much we are anxious to see happen  throughout the country in a new administration where we are talking a  lot about infrastructure--when we are talking about our energy assets  and what we can do to help facilitate the build-out of an aging  infrastructure and the add-on of new infrastructure. But in order to  proceed with much of this, you have to have the FERC actually  operating, working to review the permits, working through the rate- making cases. It is substantive work, it is challenging work, and it is  work that has now been stacked up for months and months. So knowing  that the FERC will be able to commence its operations again with a  quorum is really good news today.   I think it is also important to note that the White House sent just  this week two additional names--those of Mr. Glick and Mr. McIntyre.  The Energy and Natural Resources Committee will be considering those in  early September when we return so that, hopefully, we can get a full  complement to this very important Commission.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  be in a period of morning business, with Senators permitted to speak  therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  Committee on Energy and Natural Resources be authorized to meet during  the session of the Senate in order to hold a hearing on Thursday,  August 3, 2017 at 10 a.m. in Room 366 of the Dirksen Senate Office  Building in Washington, DC.
