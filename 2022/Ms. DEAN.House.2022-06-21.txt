 Madam Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding time.   Like many of you, I am struggling as we see day after day, night  after night, more lives lost to gun violence in America.   On Sunday, a 15-year-old boy was killed and three other people shot  in a mass shooting 15 minutes from where we stand right now.   On Monday, just after midnight, a 21-year-old college student was  killed in a hail of gunfire that also wounded eight others in Harlem.   Last week, in the Judiciary Committee, I talked about the three young  men who were killed and 11 wounded in the single biggest shooting in  Philadelphia in 7 years. Are we safe anywhere in this country anymore?   Many of us are determined to fight for radical change to combat a  dangerous obsession with guns and gun violence.   In the Judiciary Committee, we voted for extreme risk protection  orders. Republicans in that committee voted ``no.'' We voted to raise  the age for purchase of semiautomatics to 21. Republicans said ``no.''  We voted to safely store guns. Republicans said ``no.'' We voted to get  rid of ghost guns. Republicans said ``no.'' We voted for background  checks. Republicans said ``no.''   Now, today, we are trying to pass text alerts--alerts--for active  shooters. I am thankful that this small measure has some bipartisan  support.   Yet, some Republicans in Congress support guns so much that they will  find a way to say ``no'' and hide behind the Second Amendment.   I am struggling, but determined, inspired by the overwhelming number  of  [[Page H5704]]  Americans who are demanding action: Republicans, Democrats, gun owners,  non-gun owners, independents. Demand action, not excuses.   This is a sad, yet important step. I thank the chairman for bringing  it forward. I urge my colleagues across the aisle to wake up. Our  children's lives are at stake every day.
