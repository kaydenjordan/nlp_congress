 Mr. Speaker, I would also like to echo a few of the  comments Members have already heard this morning.   The Appropriations subcommittees have, indeed, spent many months and  countless hours in developing a bill that really and truly invests in  our critical national needs, and that is from defense to rural  infrastructure to major health crises, such as opioids.   Mr. Speaker, as chairman of the Agriculture, Rural Development, Food  and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies Subcommittee on  Appropriations, let me add that this division of the bill has solid  wins for agriculture, for the food sector, for the healthcare  community, and for rural America.   Members from rural districts with agriculture constituents, like I  have down in Alabama, can be proud of the many accomplishments that are  included in this bill. We are restoring funding and greatly adding to  the needed infrastructure upgrades.   This bill also provides necessary relief for American farmers and  ranchers, who continued to experience a significant reduction in income  over the past few years.                                time  1130    This bill today contains a downpayment on ensuring that rural America  is not left behind. The rural development account in this bill today  contains $625 million of commitment to expanding rural broadband in an  effort to close the rural digital divide for the 23 million Americans-- more than 40 percent of all Americans--who do not have access to  broadband.   In addition to broadband, the bill invests in water and wastewater  needs for our rural constituents. The bill provides a total of $3  billion in loan authorizations and $1 billion in grants--an increase of  $500 million over last year--to provide clean and reliable water  resources in rural America.   In closing, it has been said here this morning that there are a lot  of concerns about how we have moved forward in this process and a lot  of matters that have been added to the bill. But it is my hope that we,  as we move forward, can take a different approach to the bills we are  preparing as we look forward to the new fiscal year. But this is the  process that we have today, and the simple fact remains that we have to  fund the Federal Government. We have to do it, and we have to do it  today.   In closing, I ask my colleagues to support this bill as we rebuild  America's defenses and provide vital health and safety needs to all  Americans.
