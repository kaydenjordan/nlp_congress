 Madam Speaker, last week, on the floor of  this Chamber, I released a transcript of the interview of Bruce Ohr  from our investigation into apparent wrongdoing at the FBI and DOJ. At  that time I said I would make additional transcripts from the  committee's investigation public, and I am here today to keep that  promise.   As I stated then, our interview transcripts were pertinent to a  congressional investigation, but the 115th Congress ended, the  investigation was closed, and copies were shared with certain Members  of Congress.   Madam Speaker, I include in the Record the link  www.dougcollins.house.gov/page so the American people can review the  transcript of Lisa Page.   The American people deserve to know what transpired in the highest  echelons of the FBI during that tumultuous time for the Bureau.   Out of an abundance of caution, the transcript has a limited number  of narrowly tailored redactions, relating only to confidential sources  and methods, nonpublic information about ongoing investigations, and  nonmaterial personal information.   I will continue to work to release as many transcripts as possible.  The American people deserve transparency.                            ____________________
