 Madam Chair, unfortunately, muscle memory is very strong  in Washington, D.C.   Unfortunately, Wall Street and K street are very powerful in  Washington, D.C.    Fortunately, we have people on the Republican side that are willing  to stand up for Main Street, willing to challenge their own leadership  to deliver on issues of national security.   This institution went through tougher times. We deliberated a lot of  issues, but we used to be able to come together on issues of national  security and our border security. Our destructive debt situation is  destroying American lives.   I hope the other side will join Republicans to win this battle for  the American people. It shouldn't be a political issue, politicized. If  this government cannot deliver maybe it is worth it to shut it down.  What is it for then? If we cannot come together on this, then we are  not worthwhile to represent the American people.   So I hope that the other side stops being sheep and starts to  actually not be afraid to challenge their own leadership and do  something for this country because American people are sick and tired  of us being worthless. We need to protect this country because if we  don't save this Republic, no one else around the world will be able to  defeat a lot of enemies, foreign and domestic.   I will tell you one thing, there is nothing unreasonable or extreme  to serve the people, to secure the border, and deal with our debt.   I would appreciate it if the other side wakes up and supports  Republicans.
