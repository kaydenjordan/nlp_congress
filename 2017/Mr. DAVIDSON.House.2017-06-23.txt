 Mr. Chairman, I rise to offer an amendment.   The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         Page 5, line 21, strike ``and''.        Page 5, line 25, strike the period and insert ``; and''.        Page 5, after line 25, insert the following:        (F) specifies the number of eligible recipients who       received a subsidy who concurrently received other Federal or       State means-tested benefits during their subsidized       employment.    The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 396, the gentleman from Ohio  [[Page H5121]]  (Mr. Davidson) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Ohio.    Mr. Chairman, I rise today to offer an amendment that,  if enacted, would provide additional data on the performance and  effectiveness of the programs created under H.R. 2842, the Accelerating  Individuals into the Workforce Act.   In particular, my amendment would require States to include in their  annual reports to the Health and Human Services Department whether  individuals who participated in this demonstration project still need  additional forms of Federal or State assistance after the fact. The  data point really shows whether they are truly independent of the  safety net.   The most meaningful solution to poverty is a job. I believe the data  point outlined in my amendment will further help Congress measure the  performance of this program in the scope that should apply to all of  our Nation's welfare programs: placing people into meaningful work and  helping them and their families achieve self-sufficiency. We need this  data to ensure the project is truly working.   When I worked in manufacturing, data was a vital component to solving  problems. It showed me what worked best, what failed, and, most  importantly, what needed to be changed and how to get to the root  cause. The same science applies to solving problems here and to this  program.   Too often we measure the success of our safety net programs based on  dollars spent rather than effectiveness. Fixing our welfare system is a  sentiment shared by both sides of the aisle. This is a bipartisan bill,  and I believe this legislation is a great step forward.   Additionally, my office has been working on another bill, the Welfare  BRAC Act, which would create a bipartisan commission to review the 90- plus means-tested programs that spent nearly $850 billion a year. I  hope one day to have a vote on that bill just as we are having one on  this today.   We need more deeds and not just words. This bill is a great step  forward to solving the problem. There is widespread agreement on both  sides of the aisle that our safety net is not accomplishing all it  needs to. If enacted, my amendment would help us here in Congress  identify new methods to help our Nation's most vulnerable by getting  them into the workplace.                                time  1000    It is crucial that everyone has an equal opportunity to engage in our  communities and contribute by earning financial independence through  the dignity of work.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to vote in support of my amendment,  and I reserve the balance of my time.   Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to  the amendment.   The CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.   Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Chairman, this amendment would  require States to collect and report information on whether  participants were receiving income-related assistance like health  insurance; child care assistance; school lunch; or the Supplemental  Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, benefits; rental subsidies; or  perhaps even the earned income tax credit.   The information the amendment requests is not relevant to what we are  trying to learn from these demonstration projects, which is whether  different approaches improve earnings and employment. Asking for it is  an invasion of the privacy of the individuals, with no research  benefit.   Collecting this information also seems burdensome for States, and  would likely require them to ask participating employers to ask their  employees inappropriate personal questions that they would not ask of  any other employee.   Most importantly, I am concerned that requiring States to collect  information on these important work supports would make some States  think that they are supposed to discourage participants from accessing  these supports.   Both research and common sense clearly tell us that access to  supports like child care assistance, healthcare, and wage supplements  that pay for transportation and other work expenses make it more likely  that individuals will succeed in work. We should do nothing that might  discourage States from providing these supports to help workers  succeed. We should do nothing that might cause individuals to not make  use of what is available to them.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this amendment, and  I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Nebraska (Mr. Smith).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Nebraska (Mr. Smith).    Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on  this.   Sunlight brings truth. Truth will set you free. My hope is truth will  set folks free from the trap that many people find in multigenerational  poverty. We really, truly want to help solve the problem and get the  information that will help us make our systems work effectively.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.   The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman  from Ohio (Mr. Davidson).   The question was taken; and the Chair announced that the ayes  appeared to have it.   Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.   The CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on  the amendment offered by the gentleman from Ohio will be postponed.                    Amendment No. 6 Offered by Mr. Khanna    The CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 6 printed in  House Report 115-187.
