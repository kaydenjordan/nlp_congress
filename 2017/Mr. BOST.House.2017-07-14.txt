 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to advocate for the victims of  human trafficking and for the law enforcement and organizations who are  on the front lines combating this growing problem. Human trafficking is  a growing problem in Illinois where we rank ninth in the Nation in  reported trafficking cases.   Cases are on the rise nationwide. As a father of three and  grandfather of 11, I am angry. We must wipe out this evil before it  does any more harm.   I am proud that Republicans and Democrats came together to pass three  antitrafficking bills this week.   Our work is far from over, but these bills are vitally important to  help protect American families.                            ____________________
