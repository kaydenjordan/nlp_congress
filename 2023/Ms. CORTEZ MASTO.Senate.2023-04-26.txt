 Mr. President, first of all, I have to thank my  colleagues, Senator Cardin along with Senator Murkowski, for bringing  S.J. Res. 4 that we will be voting on tomorrow. We need the Equal  Rights Amendment today more than ever.   What we have been seeing across the country, the far-right using  every opportunity they can to roll back women's rights. We are seeing  this happen in real time with access to abortion care, and we know it  won't stop there.   So it is shameful that in 2023 there are so many extremists who want  to make women second-class citizens, but that is why we need a  constitutional amendment to protect women from discrimination and  guarantee their equality under the law.   Few States understand this better than my home State of Nevada.  Nevada put the Equal Rights Amendment back on the table when it became  the first State in the modern era to ratify the ERA in 2017.   Nevadans stood up and made it clear that our State believes men and  women should have equal legal rights. And they didn't stop there. In  2022, Nevada adopted the most comprehensive ERA in the country in its  State constitution, putting protections in place to ensure equal rights  for all.   Over and over again, Nevadans have led the charge for equality and  women's rights at both the State and the Federal level. Now, since  Nevada kicked off the push in recent years to ratify the ERA federally,  we now have the 38 States we need to codify the Equal Rights Amendment  in the U.S. Constitution. The only thing that is stopping us is a  deadline Congress made up in 1972 that was already extended once. That  is why we must vote to remove this deadline and adopt the Equal Rights  Amendment into our Constitution because, quite honestly, there is too  much at stake and to let an arbitrary time limit hold women's rights  hostage is just wrong.   So with that, along with my colleagues here this afternoon, I, too,  urge the adoption tomorrow of bipartisan S.J. Res. 4.   I yield the floor.
