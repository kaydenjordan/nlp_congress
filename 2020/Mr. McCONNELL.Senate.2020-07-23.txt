 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  order for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I know of no further debate.    Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, as I said on Tuesday, our Nation stands  at a critical midway point in our fight against the coronavirus. We  made it through the springtime lockdowns. Americans' sacrifices saved  our medical system. The Senate's historic CARES Act helped millions of  families make it through, but this terrible virus is still with us. It  kills more Americans every day. Some areas that have reopened have seen  cases spike. Our hospitals, healthcare providers, and especially our  vulnerable citizens are nowhere near out of the woods.   Meanwhile, although the early days of our economic recovery have  beaten expectations and surprised the experts, we have really only  begun to repair the  [[Page S4455]]  damage. More than 17 million Americans are still jobless. Far too many  families are still hurting. This is not over. America's fight  continues, so Congress's support for our people must continue as well.   The Senate majority has assembled a framework for CARES 2. The  administration has requested additional time to review the fine  details, but we will be laying down this proposal early next week. We  have an agreement in principle on the shape of the package. It is the  framework that will enable Congress to make law and deliver more relief  to the American people that is tailored precisely to this phase of the  crisis.   Chairmen Grassley, Alexander, Collins, Rubio, Shelby, and Blunt, and  Senators Cornyn and Romney have each spearheaded a part of CARES 2. On  Monday, these committee chairmen and Republican Members will introduce  each component. The sum of these efforts will be a strong, targeted  piece of legislation aimed directly at the challenges we face right  now.   Our country is in a middle ground between the strict lockdowns of a  few months ago and the future day when a vaccine will put all of this,  finally, behind us. Our project now is to build a middle ground that is  smart and safe but more sustainable.   We are still waging a healthcare war against the virus, and we cannot  let up on that. We need to continue to strengthen the defenses we have  built--encouraging mask-wearing, supporting testing, and racing toward  treatments and vaccines.   At the same time, the greatest country in world history also needs to  get back on offense. We need to carefully but proactively step back  toward normalcy. This disease has already stolen the lives of more than  140,000 Americans. It has stolen a half a year of our national life. We  cannot let the robbery continue without a fight. We cannot let this  pandemic rob us indefinitely of our children's educations and the  livelihoods of 17 million American workers.   We need to get Americans back to work and school while continuing to  fight for our Nation's health. That is what CARES 2 is designed to do.  Our proposal will not waste the American people's time with go-nowhere  socialist fantasies. We aren't choreographing political stunts or  teeing up the same old partisan trench warfare. Our proposal will focus  on three things: kids, jobs, and healthcare.   No. 1, kids. A functioning society needs to educate its children and  young adults. Our kids need us to invest in their futures, and working  parents need some certainty. We need as many K-12 schools, colleges,  and universities as possible to be safely welcoming students this fall.   Chairman Alexander, Chairman Shelby, and Chairman Blunt are  finalizing an ambitious package of funding and policy to help our  schools reopen. They will lay out a reopening-related funding package  for schools and universities north of $100 billion. That is more money  than the House Democrats proposed for a similar fund.   There will be several important policies to help childcare providers,  to grant new flexibility to elementary and secondary schools, and more.   No. 2, jobs and the economy. Two provisions of the CARES Act worked  especially well to help households stay afloat and help as many workers  as possible stay employed.   As Chairman Grassley will explain, Republicans want to send a second  round of direct payments to American households, and Senator Collins  and Senator Rubio have crafted a sequel to their historic and  incredibly successful Paycheck Protection Program. It would give the  hardest hit small businesses an opportunity to receive second loans if  they continue to pay their workers.   We also intend to continue some temporary Federal supplement to  unemployment insurance while fixing the obvious craziness of paying  people more to remain out of the workforce. Small business owners  across the country have explained how this dynamic is slowing rehiring  and recovery. So we are going to provide help but make sure it is  suited to reopening the economy.   But temporary relief cannot be our endgame. Americans do not just  want to scrape by; they want to thrive again. They want a road back to  the incredible job market we had just a few months ago. So Chairman  Grassley will also lay out bold policies to incentivize retention,  encourage the rehiring of laid-off Americans, and help businesses  obtain PPE, testing, and supplies to protect their employees and entice  customers.   Think of it this way: In the spring, our economy needed life support.  Today, while continuing to support families, we must also get the  economy into physical therapy so it can actually regain its strength.   Finally, in looking to the long term, the COVID-19 crisis has  weakened the critical Federal trust funds that Americans rely on. As  Senator Romney will explain, our proposal includes a bipartisan bill,  cosponsored by Senate Democrats, to help a future Congress evaluate  bipartisan proposals for protecting and strengthening the programs that  Americans count on.   Now, our third pillar is the most important of all--healthcare. Our  entire reopening and recovery depend on knocking this awful virus onto  its heels.   So as Chairmen Alexander, Blunt, Grassley, and Shelby will explain,  CARES 2 will continue to treat the root causes of this medical crisis:  more resources for hospitals and healthcare workers; more help to keep  sprinting toward diagnostics, treatments, and vaccines; new policies to  shield seniors from a spike in Medicare premiums; and new legislation  that will leave us with better surge capacity to produce medical  countermeasures right here at home the next time a crisis strikes.   There is one more essential element that ties schools, jobs, and  healthcare all together--legal protections to prevent our historic  recovery efforts from simply lining the pockets of trial lawyers.   We will preserve accountability in cases of actual gross negligence  or intentional misconduct, but we are going to make sure that nurses  and doctors who fought an unknown enemy are not swamped by a tidal wave  of malpractice suits. And we will make sure that school districts,  colleges, churches, nonprofits, and employers that obey official  guidance do not have to delay reopening because they are afraid they  will spend 10 years in court.   So this is where Senate Republicans are focused--more support for  healthcare, more direct help for American families, and strong policies  to help our country pivot into a safe reopening. We will propose to  continue and renew some of the most successful CARES Act policies,  while adding bold new ideas to help get schools and jobs open for the  American people. This is the package our country needs. This is what we  will introduce.   We are repeating the successful strategy that produced the historic,  bipartisan CARES Act back in March. First, I asked a number of  Republicans to spearhead a serious first draft. Then we put those  elements together and invited our Democratic colleagues to the table.  And guided by our roadmap, working with the administration, the Senate  reached a bipartisan outcome.   Earlier this week, even Speaker Pelosi and Leader Schumer seemed to  concede that things go better when Republicans lead. They themselves  said the real work on this next bill would only begin after Republicans  laid out the framework.   Well, I am glad my Democratic friends see things the same way I do. I  just hope they meet our serious, fact-based proposal with the  productive and bipartisan spirit that got us the CARES Act, rather than  the cynical partisanship that led them to block police reform just last  month.   Doctors and nurses will need Democrats to come to the table.  Unemployed Americans will need Democrats to come to the table. Working  parents and school children will need Democrats to come to the table.   We have known all along the American people would defeat this virus  by understanding that we are all in this together--every single one of  us.   If we want to deliver more historic relief, the Senate will need to  remember the very same thing.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to legislative  session.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to executive session  to consider Calendar No. 647.    Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.

Mr. President, I move to proceed to legislative  session.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to executive session  to consider Calendar No. 707.    Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  mandatory quorum calls for the cloture motions be waived.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the en bloc consideration of the following nominations:  Executive Calendar Nos. 567 and 629.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  vote on the nominations en bloc with no intervening action or debate;  that if confirmed, the motions to reconsider be considered made and  laid upon the table en bloc; and that the President be immediately  notified of the Senate's action.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to legislative session for a period of morning business, with  Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, people of faith across my hometown of  Louisville gathered recently to mark 50 years of fighting for the  unborn in the Bluegrass State. Together, they celebrated the Louisville  Right to Life Association and its inspirational work for the most  vulnerable in our society. I was proud to offer my congratulations to  these champions for life. Today, I would like to look back to the  group's founding and a remarkable Kentuckian's choice to pick up the  phone.   One evening in 1970, Margie Montgomery watched a troubling editorial  on the local news. The segment argued for the removal of legal  restrictions on abortions. To say my friend was shocked would be an  understatement. She called the station to voice her strong opposition.  Before long, Margie appeared on that same news program to deliver a  genuine and heartfelt defense of life.   That broadcast was just the beginning. What followed was a campaign  of advocacy, organizing, and hard work. Margie spoke up, and she began  a movement.   Her passion ignited people of faith and conscience across our  Commonwealth. The Louisville group grew into a statewide organization,  the Kentucky Right to Life Association. Margie helped create a  grassroots network of pro-life volunteers who give voice to the  voiceless.   Their work is certainly making a difference. Today, the majority of  Kentuckians proudly stand on the side of life. Margie's courageous  witness led thousands to join her cause.   For decades, I have had the privilege to work with Margie on many  pro-life issues. I look forward to our frequent meetings, both in  Kentucky and our Nation's Capital. Along with so many Kentuckians, I am  constantly inspired by her passion and drawn in by her compassion. The  movement is lucky to have a steadfast and loving leader like Margie.   Tragically, innocent life is still under threat in our Commonwealth  and our Nation. There is more work that must be done so all people can  enjoy their God-given right to life. As we continue fighting for those  who are unable to fight for themselves, I am grateful Kentucky has  Margie to champion our cause. It is an honor to join all those who  celebrate her golden anniversary of advocacy, and I wish her many more  years of celebrating the gift of life.   Mr. President, the Courier-Journal in Louisville recently published a  profile  [[Page S4460]]  of Margie's leadership for the sanctity of life. I ask unanimous  consent that the column by former Kentucky State Representative Bob  Heleringer be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:            [From the Louisville Courier-Journal, July 14, 2020]  A Determined Margie Montgomery Has Been Defending the Sanctity of Human                             Life for 50 Years                            (By Bob Heleringer)         In 1970, a gentleman named Bob Schulman occasionally       appeared during the late evening news on WHAS-TV to read on-      air editorials (``One Man's Opinion''). Wearing his trademark       bow tie, he looked and spoke like a college professor. One       night, he said it was time to liberalize the abortion laws in       this country, to remove the legal restrictions that had made       this medical procedure a criminal offense.        Watching at home that evening was a 37-year-old wife,       mother, civic volunteer, Rosemont College graduate and former       city editor of the Irvington (New Jersey) Herald newspaper,       Margaret Anne ``Margie'' Montgomery. Alarmed, the then-      president of the League of Catholic PTA called the station       the next morning and was cordially invited by Mr. Schulman       himself to give a response.        After she gave the first of what became thousands of       public, passionate addresses defending the sanctity of all       human life, her telephone rang for a week--some were complete       strangers but all agreed with Mrs. Montgomery that       ``something had to be done.''        Right there in her kitchen, a national, state and local       Right-to-Life movement was born. (The ``right to Life'' is       one of the ``self-evident'' unalienable rights proclaimed by       the Declaration of Independence.) This Thursday evening,       about 700 socially distanced people will gather at the Crowne       Plaza hotel for the 47th annual ``Celebration of Life''       dinner that will also honor Margie Montgomery's remarkable 50       years of service on behalf of the greatest civil rights cause       in our beloved country since the abolition of slavery.        When the movement she began outgrew her house, in 1973,       Mrs. Montgomery opened a full-time operation in St. Matthews,       where she still today, from a tiny and cramped corner office       in a nondescript office building, oversees the state's       lobbying efforts in Frankfort and Washington, D.C., runs an       annual statewide convention, organizes the annual pro-life       rallies in Frankfort and downtown Louisville on the       anniversary of Roe v. Wade, the pernicious Supreme Court       decision that legalized the killing of our preborn sisters       and brothers, coordinates a double full-page ad in this       newspaper on that anniversary with thousands of names of       Louisvillians, organizes the yearly dinner with a national       figure giving a keynote address, presides over the annual       Walk for Life up and down Shelbyville Road, quarterbacks a       political action committee that strives to elect pro-life       candidates to public office (people like her that will ``do       something''), and still appears at every school and civic       group that will have her to give one of her ``talks,'' the       central theme of which is ``abortion stops a beating heart.''        Now into the sixth decade of her vocation, this soft-spoken       but determined woman has been the Gold Star Mother who won't       let America ever forget the staggering human toll of this       heretofore unknown constitutional ``right:'' the 61,628,584       babies' lives ``terminated'' (through 2017). She is still       Kentucky's first responder whenever and wherever human life       is threatened, the full-throated voice for those who have no       voice.        She didn't hesitate to use that voice when she confronted       the very man who wrote the infamous Roe decision: Justice       Harry Blackmun. When the University of Louisville law school       favored Mr. Blackmun in 1983 with its Brandeis Medal, Mrs.       Montgomery was in attendance.        When it was her turn in the receiving line, as he extended       his hand, she asked, ``How can you sleep at night knowing how       many lives have been lost because of your terrible       decision?'' The associate justice of the United States       Supreme Court audibly gasped and, as he withdrew his hand,       Mrs. Montgomery quietly said, ``I will pray for you.''        Thanks to those efforts, and those of thousands of       volunteer women and men from all over this commonwealth,       Kentucky can fairly be called America's most pro-life state       with an overwhelmingly prolife congressional delegation and       state legislature.        Elections have consequences, some good. Pre-natal killings       in our state have declined from a high of 11,000 a year to       ``only'' 3,000. Legislation Mrs. Montgomery advocated, the       ``Choose Life'' license plates, finances more than 50 crisis       pregnancy centers in Kentucky that, if only a woman will       assent to let her baby live, she will be sheltered,       protected, nurtured and financially supported. (As of 2017,       there are 2,752 of these life-affirming centers throughout       the country.)        This, then, is Margie Montgomery's most inspiring legacy:       Her unwavering commitment to preserve, protect and defend all       human life has directly led to an untold and unknown number       of human lives being saved by women in crisis who got a       timely word of encouragement and support, looked at a       leaflet, spotted a billboard message, read an ad in a church       bulletin, called a crisis hotline, saw their unborn baby move       on a sonogram or ultrasound and blessed God's creation by       giving humanity one more life to marvel at, appreciate, love       and cherish. Those saved people walk among us every single       day. As the Talmud says (paraphrasing): ``(S)he who saves a       life, saves the entire world.''                            ____________________     Mr. President, I have 5 requests for committees to  meet during today's session of the Senate.
