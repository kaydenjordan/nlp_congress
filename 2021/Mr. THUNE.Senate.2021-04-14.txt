 Mr. President, shortly before Easter, I joined a number of  my colleagues on a visit to the border to get a firsthand look at the  crisis that we are facing. And make no mistake, this is a crisis.  Customs and Border Protection apprehensions at our southern border last  month were at their highest level in nearly 20 years--20 years.   U.S. Customs and Border Protection reported more than 172,000  encounters with individuals attempting to cross our southern border in  March alone. And that is just the individuals they encountered. We  don't know how many individuals came across without being identified  and are currently residing illegally in our country.   Nearly 19,000 unaccompanied children crossed our southern border in  March alone, the largest number ever recorded in a single month. That  is 19,000 children making an incredibly dangerous journey without their  parents, at the mercy of smugglers, human traffickers, or any other  dangerous individual that they might encounter.   Needless to say, the surge at our border is having very serious  effects. Border Patrol agents have been pulled off the border to deal  with the influx of migrants and unaccompanied children, leaving the  borders undermanned. And the government is straining to deal with  processing the massive number of people who have come across the  border. One facility that we visited was at 16 times its allotted  capacity.   The administration has had to deploy the Federal Emergency Management  Agency--that is right, our government's disaster recovery Agency--to  help deal with the influx of unaccompanied children. And the Department  of Health and Human Services has been forced to open emergency shelters  and ask the Department of Defense for temporary housing on bases.   Despite the pandemic, adequate COVID safety measures have been unable  to be maintained because the numbers needing to be housed have been so  great.   While the administration would like to attribute this crisis to the  previous administration or anything but the current President's  policies, the truth is, President Biden bears a lot of the  responsibility for the situation. His Presidential campaign made it  clear that border security was not going to be one of his priorities.   And since taking office, what signals have he and his administration  sent? On his very first day in office, President Biden rescinded the  declaration of a national emergency at our southern border; he halted  construction on the border wall; and he rescinded a Trump  administration order that called for the government to faithfully  execute our immigration laws, including removals for visa overstays and  limiting funding to sanctuary cities--all on his first day.   And that is not all. The President's Department of Homeland Security  also issued guidelines that same day pausing deportations, except under  certain conditions. The effect of President Biden's actions was to  declare to the world that the U.S. borders are effectively open.   That may or may not have been what President Biden and his  administration intended, but it certainly has been the effect. The  message received by prospective migrants has been, if you can make it  to the U.S. border and claim asylum, whether legitimate or not, even if  you illegally cross the border, you are in.   Trump administration policies like ``Remain in Mexico'' and the third  country asylum rule relieved pressure on our overburdened immigration  casework and enforcement efforts at the southern border. They allowed  for asylum claims to be vetted long before individuals reached the U.S.  border, removing the need for people to uproot themselves and attempt a  dangerous border crossing only to be sent back home again.   But in his rush to distance himself from President Trump and appease  the open borders wing of the Democratic Party, President Biden  eliminated these policies, which has helped create the humanitarian  crisis we are currently facing.   Under the Biden administration, there is little deterrent or fear of  punishment for those who seek to enter the country illegally, knowing  that they can claim asylum and join the backlog of roughly 1.3 million  cases while they wait in the United States. And the humanitarian crisis  that we are seeing at the border is the result.   President Biden and Democrats would like to present themselves as the  compassionate alternative to the Trump administration, but there is  nothing compassionate about policies that invite illegal immigration,  that encourage people to attempt the dangerous border crossing, to run  the risk of death or injury or exploitation or disease.   Inviting the surge at the border also shows a significant lack of  compassion or consideration for Americans, particularly those in border  communities.   While many of those trying to cross our borders illegally are simply  looking for a better life, which is not an excuse for going outside our  established legal pathways, there are also a lot of dangerous people-- dangerous people attempting illegal border crossings: drug traffickers,  weapons traffickers, human traffickers, gang members. And when Border  Patrol agents have been pulled off the border to help manage the  immigration influx, it is not going to be too surprising if we discover  that more of these dangerous individuals have made their way into our  country. And that represents a real danger to Americans.   Americans living in towns and cities along our southern border are at  the greatest risk of having their communities disrupted by border- related criminal activity, but the effects of drug trafficking and  other criminal activity across our southern border are felt throughout  our entire country.   President Biden helped cause this crisis. There are no ifs, ands, or  buts about it. And he could start ending this crisis today by making it  clear that his administration will enforce immigration laws and that  the way to come to this country is to come legally. He could also help  by recommitting our country to serious border security along our  southern border, including construction, continued construction of the  border wall.   For the sake of the unaccompanied children and all those trying to  cross our borders and for the sake of the Americans who have been  endangered by his policies, I hope--I hope that President Biden will  take action.   I yield the floor.    The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator  from South Dakota (Mr. Rounds) and the Senator from North Carolina (Mr.  Tillis).
