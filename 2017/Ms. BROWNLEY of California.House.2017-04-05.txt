 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from  Minnesota, our ranking member, for yielding me time and for his  tireless advocacy on behalf of our Nation's veterans.   As the ranking member of the House Veterans' Affairs Subcommittee on  Health, it has been my privilege to work with the ranking member and my  fellow committee members to establish and conduct rigorous oversight of  the Choice Program.   We enacted the Choice Act in a time of crisis. Those of us who served  on the committee during that time remember all too well the horrific  stories that came to light that moved Congress to enact this law.   Congress passed the Choice Act to ensure that all veterans receive  timely access to quality care. It is clear, however, that, in the rush  to set up the Choice Program, many veterans were still forced to wait  too long and bureaucratic headaches continue to delay needed care.   We need to get Choice 2.0 right and balance the obvious need for care  in the community while protecting the top quality care that the VA  provides. We must also make sure that Choice 2.0 protects the civil  rights of veterans as well as VA employees, contractors, and community  providers caring for our veterans.   Today's bill will allow the VA to continue spending the remaining  funds in the Veterans Choice Program fund. It will also allow the VA to  reimburse community providers faster and improve the sharing of medical  records. It gives us time to continue our bipartisan work to fix the  Choice Program.   Each Member of this body, on both sides of the aisle, agrees that our  veterans have earned the very best care available. Mr. Speaker, I urge  my colleagues to support this legislation so that veterans can receive  care now while Congress uses this opportunity to get this right.
