 Mr. President, I want to extend my deepest  condolences to the family of Alex Villamayor, whose life was cut short  2 years ago in Paraguay. Alex was a son, brother, nephew, grandson, and  friend. At just 16 years old, Alex taught us that we should not lead  our lives with cynicism and hate, but with love and kindness. Even  though Alex is no longer physically with us, he continues to shed light  on the unjust and save lives through his story.   I call upon the Government of Paraguay to do everything in its power  to guarantee an impartial, transparent, and expeditious trial so that  justice is upheld for Alex and his family.                            ____________________
