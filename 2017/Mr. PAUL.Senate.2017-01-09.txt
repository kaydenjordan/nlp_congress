 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.   The Senator from Kentucky.                               Amendment No. 1     Mr. President, tonight we will vote on a conservative  budget that balances within about 5 years and saves the country from  trillions of dollars of new debt.   This budget that will be presented as an alternative also allows us  to repeal ObamaCare at the same time. We have taken the identical  language from the underlying budget, put it into the replacement  budget, but we have done something different. Instead of allowing  spending to continue to grow unabated, instead of allowing spending to  grow at such a rate that we will add $9.7 trillion to the debt, we do  something novel--something that I consider to be the conservative  vision for our country. We actually freeze spending. We just say: no  more spending. Interestingly, the budget will balance. The country's  budget would actually balance, and we wouldn't add $9.7 trillion if we  simply freeze spending. I think there is something in my version of the  budget for both Republicans and Democrats because mine calls for a  freeze in spending but would allow the different Appropriations  subcommittees to decide where the spending would be cut.   So, for example, if you decided that we needed more military spending  but you thought that maybe we could spend less on corporate welfare,  you might cut out the Department of Commerce. You might not know it  once we did it. You might not know that the Department of Commerce  really could be eliminated and you really wouldn't notice that it was  gone.   We look at the budget and we look at the spending every year, and we  recount all of these terrible wasteful episodes of spending. Yet they  never get fixed. Why? Because we continue to give government more  money. The current budget that we will vote on will increase spending  at about 5 percent a year.   You will hear from people this ``Washingtonese''--this language that  says: Well, we are just holding to the baseline. All this is the  baseline. Son, just vote for the baseline. Jump on the team and vote  for the baseline. The problem is that the baseline is not flat. The  baseline is inclined, and that increase in spending every year is what  is bankrupting the country. Spending is going up 5 percent a year. That  is what the baseline is. So when people say that we are going to cut  trillions of dollars or this is a frugal budget, they are talking about  cutting spending from the proposed increases in spending.   To illustrate that, the budget I am offering isn't even a cut of any  kind. It is a freeze. Has anybody in America ever had their income  frozen? Has anybody in America ever had to take a cut? Why shouldn't  government? Why shouldn't we force government to look at their finances  and say: You know what, this spending is good, and this is not so good.   I will give you an example. We spent $700,000 last year studying Neil  Armstrong's statement on the moon. Neil Armstrong landed on the moon  and said: ``That's one small step for man, one giant leap for  mankind.'' Your government, in its infinite wisdom, spent $700,000 to  study that to determine whether Neil Armstrong said ``one small step  for a man'' or ``one small step for man.'' After spending $700,000,  your government concluded that they still don't know.   They spent $500,000 studying selfies. If you take a selfie of  yourself and you smile, will you feel better later? They spent $2  million studying whether or not if you are standing in a food line at a  buffet and the guy in front of you sneezes on the food, are you more or  less likely to eat the food.   You can't make this stuff up. Yet the budget that we are being  offered does nothing to fix any of that. It just puts a stamp down and  says: We are going to keep doing things the same way we have always  done them. Well, my friends I think we should do things differently.   I think a $20 trillion debt is alarming. I think it is the No. 1  problem we face as a country, and someone ought to do something about  it. So I didn't have much luck saying: You know what, guys, we should  produce a balanced budget.   So what we got is $9.7 trillion, and I can't support that. So I offer  an alternative for people who believe that debt is a problem. They can  vote for my alternative, and it still maintains the exact same language  that the underlying budget has for repealing ObamaCare. You can do  both. Why should it be an either/or? Why should it be that, well, we  have to vote for a crummy budget, but that is the only way we can get  to ObamaCare. Why don't we vote for a budget that balances? I thought  that was what we were for.   I remember a time when Republicans talked about not only freezing  spending, but some actually said we should reduce the size and scope of  government. That is what Ronald Reagan said. Yet government grows  inexorably. Over and over, year after year, government grows. We had  Republicans in charge about 10 years ago. Remember? George W. Bush was  President. We controlled, I think, both branches for at least one  period of time, and yet the debt doubled under George W. Bush's  administration from $5 trillion to $10 trillion. Under President Obama,  it has gone from $10 trillion to $20 trillion. Now you have Republicans  saying: Put us in charge. Put us in charge of the House. You did, in  2010. Put us in charge of the Senate. You did, in 2017. Put us in  charge of all three branches, and we will make a conservative vision  for the country. We will balance budgets. We will reduce spending. Yet  this is an all-Republican Congress where only Republicans will vote on  the budget today, and yet we will be voting on a budget that will add  $9.7 trillion.   I am told by some: This really isn't a budget; we are going to call  it the vehicle to repeal ObamaCare.   That is not what it is called. It is sitting right here. It is called  the concurrent resolution on the budget for 2017--because, whoops, we  didn't get to it last year, but we are getting to it this year.  [[Page S137]]    This is the budget. It does have numbers in it, and I think the  numbers in the budget are of significance. I think, when we look at the  numbers, we should make them mean something. But people say to me:  Well, numbers don't mean anything. Just vote for it so we can repeal  ObamaCare. We have to repeal ObamaCare. So just vote for the numbers,  no matter what they are.   I guess my response is this: If the numbers don't mean anything, why  don't we put good numbers in there? If the budget is inconsequential  and means absolutely nothing and only Republicans are going to vote for  it, why don't we put numbers in it that lead to balance, because then  we can go home to the people who voted for us and said they wanted us  to balance the budget and wanted us to restrain ourselves and we can  say we did what you told us to do. Instead, I have to go home and tell  people that the Republicans introduced a budget that allows $9.7  trillion. I am told that we are going to do a better job, and 3 or 4  months from now we will do it again. I fear that in 3 or 4 months, when  we come back, they will say: Well, you already voted for it once. Why  don't you vote for it again? It is the same thing you voted for last  time, and it is just a baseline. Well, the baseline is not flat. The  baseline is increasing at 5 percent a year, and that is a problem.   We have to look at spending across the board. All of the spending has  to be looked at. The great thing about what I offered as an alternative  is that, whether you are a liberal or conservative, it doesn't define  exactly where you have to have the cuts come from. It says what the  overall number will be, and it will keep us from increasing spending.  What you could do to get to a freeze is you could cut or eliminate some  parts of the government, like maybe the $700,000 we spent studying Neil  Armstrong's statement, which could be eliminated completely, and maybe  the $30 billion we spend on corporate welfare in the Department of  Commerce. Maybe that can be eliminated and not one poor person would go  hungry. Maybe a couple of rich CEOs will have to fly in their own jet  instead of flying in a taxpayer jet when they are flying around the  world. You could eliminate the Department of Commerce and you could  keep spending for other items. If you think the military is bloated,  you can actually cut money in the military and spend it on other items  in the budget.   The bottom line is, if you vote for this amendment, you will be  voting for fiscal conservatism that says: Enough is enough. We have a  $20 trillion debt. We are borrowing $1 million a minute, and enough is  enough. If you are a fiscal conservative, if you are worried about the  debt of the country, I hope you will support my amendment, which  replaces the underlying budget with a Federal on-budget spending freeze  and actually leads the budget into balance in the near future.   Thank you, Mr. President.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.    Mr. President, I propose the Senate vote for this budget  because it leads to balance, it is fiscally conservative, it allows the  Senate and the Congress to decide where money will be spent and where  it will not be, it will eliminate waste, and--above all--will get us on  the right track toward eliminating or at least staying the expansion of  a $20 trillion debt. I think this is the biggest problem we face as a  country.   As much as I think ObamaCare is a mistake, just ignoring the debt to  get to ObamaCare is also a mistake.   For those who are or claim to be fiscally conservative, I ask that  you will consider voting for a budget that actually balances and  continues to have the underlying language in it that would also allow  us to repeal ObamaCare.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.    Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?   There appears to be a sufficient second.   The clerk will call the roll.   The legislative clerk called the roll.
