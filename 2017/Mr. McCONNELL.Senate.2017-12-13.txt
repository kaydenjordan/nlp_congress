 Madam President, this week, the Senate is continuing  to consider President Trump's outstanding judicial nominees. Yesterday,  we confirmed a talented individual to be a circuit court judge, and  soon we will confirm another. Next, we will advance the nomination of  James Ho to be a judge of the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. Mr. Ho is  another well-qualified individual, and, like all of President Trump's  judicial nominees, he is dedicated to upholding the rule of law and  serving as an impartial arbiter on the bench.   Similar to Justice Willett, whom I discussed yesterday, Mr. Ho has an  inspirational story. Immigrating to the United States from Taiwan at  the age of 1, he learned English by watching ``Sesame Street.'' He went  on to graduate from the University of Chicago Law School with high  honors and earned a clerkship with Judge Jerry E. Smith of the Fifth  Circuit. In 2001, Mr. Ho joined the Department of Justice as the  Special Assistant to the Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights  and later worked in the Office of Legal Counsel. In addition to his  service in the executive branch, he worked here in the Senate as chief  counsel for the Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on the Constitution.  Afterward, he went across the street to clerk for Associate Justice  Clarence Thomas.   After his distinguished and successful legal career in Washington,  Mr. Ho returned to Texas, joining a top law firm and specializing in  appellate litigation. He then served as the solicitor general of Texas,  succeeding our colleague Senator Ted Cruz. It was while he was serving  in that role that he won the Supreme Court Best Brief Award from the  National Association of Attorneys General. He went on to earn the award  two more times. After his time in State government, Mr. Ho returned to  his private practice firm and currently serves as the cochair of its  appellate and constitutional law group. He has presented oral arguments  in State and Federal courts around the country, including the Supreme  Court.   It is clear that Mr. Ho possesses impressive credentials, with the  experience necessary to excel on the Fifth Circuit. He also earned the  praise of prominent Democrats who believe he will make an excellent  addition to the Federal court.   Ron Kirk, the Obama administration's Trade Representative and the  former mayor of Dallas, supported Mr. Ho's nomination to the Judiciary  Committee. He wrote:         Jim possesses the temperament, integrity, and intellect       that anyone, Republican or Democrat, should insist on in a       federal judge. He is wickedly smart, and is among the most       brilliant appellate lawyers in the United States. If there is       one thing that my liberal and conservative colleagues agree       on, it is that Jim just has it in his DNA to be a great       judge.    A Commissioner on the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights appointed by  President Obama also recommended Mr. Ho in a letter to the Judiciary  Committee. She knows him from his volunteer work with the National  Asian Pacific American Bar Association. She wrote that he ``has a  strong reputation as an intelligent, reasonable, fair and principled  lawyer.''   I would like to commend President Trump for another very strong  nomination. I would also like to express my gratitude to Chairman  Grassley and the members of the Judiciary Committee for their work to  process the President's judicial nominees.   I look forward to advancing Mr. Ho's nomination soon.                            ____________________     Madam President, one of the great advances of our time  has been the development and expansion of the internet and wireless  technologies. The internet connects people across the globe in an  unprecedented way. It brings together producers and consumers, students  and educators, and even Members of the Senate with our constituents.   It is difficult to exaggerate the impact the internet has on our  society  [[Page S7980]]  and our economy each and every day. Even a few decades ago, the  technologies many of us take for granted today would have been totally  unfathomable.   But the success of the Internet wasn't an accident. Today's  internet--and all the incredible innovations that utilize it--aren't  the product of unnecessary and burdensome government regulations that  hindered growth. Instead, they were the direct result of a bipartisan  desire to create an environment of advancement--one that utilized a  light regulatory touch. Innovators were free to create and develop what  they wanted to, without having to think about complying with  overbearing Washington regulation.   As the internet grows, so does the United States. Our Nation has led  the world in internet technology, and citizens throughout the country  and the world have enjoyed the benefits.   However, the previous administration seemed bent on subjecting the  internet to a whole host of new regulations--rules designed in the age  of the rotary phone and rooted in the railroad era of the 1800s.  Through unprecedented government overreach, the Obama administration  argued that this change would fix a problem. But there wasn't a problem  that needed fixing.   Therefore at the behest of President Obama in 2015, the partisan  majority at the Federal Communications Commission rejected our decades- old approach and reclassified broadband internet access. This overreach  subjected it to new burdens and regulations and threatened the  marketplace freedom and innovation that brought us the internet we have  come to know today.   It shouldn't shock any of my colleagues to hear that an increase in  burdensome regulations created uncertainty for businesses of all sizes  and negatively impacted investment. In the last 2 years, broadband  investment has suffered a serious decline, even though many Americans,  including large numbers in rural States like Kentucky, lack access to  crucial internet services at home.   Earlier this year, President Trump changed direction from the  previous administration. He elevated Ajit Pai to serve as the Chairman  of the FCC, and tomorrow, the Commission will vote to repeal the  misguided 2015 rule.   Chairman Pai submitted a proposal to restore freedom to the internet  and to classify broadband internet access once again as an information  service, just like it was until 2015.   When the FCC votes tomorrow, they will be voting to return the  internet to a consumer-driven marketplace free of innovation-stifling  regulations.   Opponents of Chairman Pai's plan have expressed their concerns about  unfair or disruptive business practices that may hurt consumers' access  to the internet. However, his proposal will actually restore the  Federal Trade Commission's authority to protect consumers and police  companies that engage in unfair practices.   Chairman Pai's proposal will also require internet service providers  to clearly disclose how they treat their customers' data so that  consumers can choose the services that are right for them.   I look forward to their vote in support of the open internet and to  Congress's actions in the future to keep the internet open for  consumers in a lasting way.   Before I continue onto another matter, I feel that it is necessary to  take a moment to discuss the vitriolic and divisive debate over this  topic.   As my colleagues know, I am a strong defender of political speech,  and I have fought for decades to protect the rights of all Americans to  question government policies. However, the discussion on this issue  took on a new tone. While the First Amendment protects political  speech, it is no excuse for bad conduct.    Instead of debating the effects of a proposal, some of the far left  engaged in personal attacks, even going as low as to promulgate attacks  citing Chairman Pai's children. This type of behavior does nothing to  elevate our Nation's discourse or forward a particular policy. I hope  that we can all agree that this type of harassment deserves universal  condemnation.                            ____________________     Now, on another matter, Madam President, over the last  eight years, our foreign policy was guided by a Commander in Chief who  wished to draw down conventional military power from across the globe.  Iran, China, and Russia have sought to fill this vacuum and exploit the  perception that America was withdrawing.   This Republican Congress has made a commitment to work with President  Trump to rebuild our military and give our men and women in uniform the  resources they need to face the challenges of a dangerous world.   We know there is more work to do in restoring our military's combat  readiness and meeting the full needs of the force. Earlier this year,  we passed a funding measure that was an important departure from the  Obama years.   The President has renewed our commitment to Afghanistan, and is  trying to train and equip a force that can meet the daunting challenge  posed by North Korea.   To begin rebuilding our military, we ignored the Obama-era demand  that any increase in defense funding must be equally matched to  nondefense increases. We did that earlier this year, and we must do it  once again.   As we continue to discuss a plan to fund the government, we must  prioritize efforts to provide for our warfighters. The Defense  Department suffered a disproportionate reduction under the Budget  Control Act--one that has real consequences for readiness. If we are  not able to come to a funding agreement, our military--and many other  critical functions of the Federal Government--will suffer intolerable  budget cuts next year.    I hope that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle will work  with us in a serious manner to make sure that we are able to  responsibly fund the government so that our military has the tools it  needs to keep us safe.                            ____________________     Now, on one final matter, Madam President, later  today, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act conference committee will host an open  meeting to discuss its progress in resolving the differences between  the House and Senate versions of the bill.   The conferees have been working diligently to produce a report that  both Chambers can vote on soon. Once they complete their work, Congress  will be able to fulfill our commitment to the American people and  deliver real tax reform.   For too long, the hardworking men and women of Kentucky and our  Nation have endured a struggling economy and a broken tax code. Rates  are too high. The structure is too complicated to understand, and it is  too easy for the wealthy and the well-connected to exploit. Incentives  are so nonsensical that some actually encourage corporations to ship  American jobs overseas.   It is time for a change. Passing pro-family and pro-growth tax reform  is the single most important action we can take right now to grow our  economy and help the middle class get ahead.   Families deserve a tax system that works for them; and along with  President Trump and his team, this Republican-led Congress is working  to deliver. This is our chance to set a new course--to undo the damage  that our outdated Tax Code has inflicted on the economy over the last  decade.    For the Americans who were left behind by the Obama economy, this is  our opportunity to provide relief. We want to make your taxes lower,  simpler, and fairer. We want to bring investment and jobs back home and  keep them here. The bottom line is this: We want to take more money out  of Washington's pocket and put more money into the pockets of the  middle class. I am confident the conference committee will finalize a  bill that does just that.   It will also repeal ObamaCare's individual mandate tax, delivering  relief to low- and middle-income Americans who have struggled under an  unpopular and unworkable law.   In addition to this once-in-a-generation tax relief, our legislation  will also provide for our Nation's energy future. By further developing  Alaska's oil and gas potential, this bill will help create jobs,  support energy independence, and promote our national security.   The forthcoming conference report represents our chance to provide a  real  [[Page S7981]]  benefit to families and small businesses across the Nation. I am  grateful to the members of the conference committee for their hard work  to resolve the differences between the two bills. I look forward to  voting for the final product soon.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at a time  to be determined by the majority leader, in consultation with the  Democratic leader, the Senate proceed to executive session for  consideration of Calendar No. 193, the nomination of Owen West to be an  Assistant Secretary of Defense. I further ask that there be 30 minutes  of debate on the nomination, equally divided in the usual form; that  following the use or yielding back of time, the Senate vote on  confirmation with no intervening action or debate; and that, if  confirmed, the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon  the table and the President be immediately notified of the Senate's  action.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at a time  to be determined by the majority leader, in consultation with the  Democratic leader, the Senate proceed to executive session for  consideration of Calendar No. 241, the nomination of J. Paul Compton to  be General Counsel of the Department of Housing and Urban Development.  I further ask that there be 120 minutes of debate on the nomination,  equally divided in the usual form; that following the use or yielding  back of time, the Senate vote on confirmation with no intervening  action or debate; and that, if confirmed, the motion to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table and the President be  immediately notified of the Senate's action.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to legislative session for a period of morning business, with  Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 10 a.m.,  Thursday, December 14; further, that following the prayer and pledge,  the morning hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be  approved to date, the time for the two leaders be reserved for their  use later in the day, and morning business be closed; further, that  following leader remarks, the Senate proceed to executive session and  resume consideration of the Ho nomination; finally, that all time  during recess, adjournment, morning business, and leader remarks count  postcloture on the Ho nomination.    Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned  under the previous order, following the remarks of our Democratic  colleagues.
