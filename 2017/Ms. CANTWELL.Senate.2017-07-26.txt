 Mr. President, I saw the remarks of the President of  the United States in Youngstown, OH, and it has brought me to the floor  this morning because the focus of some of his speech was on the economy  and job creation. Well, I can tell the President right now that we need  his urgent attention to making sure that we create jobs right now. It  is not about something in the future; it is about right now.   There are over 40 projects worth $30 billion being held up because  the Export-Import Bank does not have a quorum. It is incredibly  important to get a functioning bank and to get a board that supports  having the support of a credit agency to work with the private sector  to finance the sale of U.S.-made products.   The President seems to embrace the notion that we should make things  in America. I think we should make things in America, but I don't think  that we sell them only in America. I actually want to sell the great  manufactured products of the United States of America to overseas  markets, to the 95 percent of consumers who are outside the United  States. But because this administration has not shown the leadership to  get a functioning Export-Import Bank, we continue to struggle. Those  $30 billion in projects are being held up because we don't have a  functioning quorum.   GE Aviation in Ohio--I wish he would have visited them because they  decided to move part of their operations to Canada and Brazil, instead  of expanding in Ohio, to take advantage of countries that actually have  a credit agency. GE Aircraft Engines decided to open a turbine prop  engine facility in Europe for the same reason. We are losing jobs  simply because we don't have a tool to work with private-sector banking  to make sure that the sale of U.S.-manufactured products actually gets  done to countries and organizations in those countries that don't have  the proper financing. GE supposedly said that they weren't going to  move their corporate headquarters to Ohio because they did not support  the reauthorization of the Export-Import Bank.   Between 2012 and 2016, the Export-Import Bank supported more than 255  export deals in Ohio from all sizes of companies, such as Haltec, which  exports auto parts, and Anglo American Hardwoods, which exports wood  products to the GE Aviation that I mentioned and GE Aircraft Engines.  These deals were worth more than $2 billion.   What I am so frustrated about is that this administration has not  kept its word in support of the Export-Import Bank. We continue today  with the folly of having our Trade Ambassador show up before the  Finance Committee and say that the Export-Import Bank is controversial.  I reminded him that it was actually supported by a majority of  Democrats and a majority of Republicans in the U.S. Senate. It was also  supported by a majority of Republicans in the House of Representatives  and the Democrats in the House of Representatives. So how could it be  so controversial if we reauthorized it?   But the White House has continued to have a double-edged strategy,  pretend that they support the Export-Import Bank, and yet send up the  name of a nominee to chair the bank who wants to destroy the bank and  has made that intention clear.   If we want jobs in Ohio, we need to get the Export-Import Bank  approving deals from manufacturers that are ready to close sales and  create more jobs, so let's focus on the task at hand. I hope the  President will stand up and clearly articulate the need and support for  an Export-Import Bank and stop sending us the name of someone who just  wants to destroy it.   I thank the Presiding Officer.   I yield the floor.    Thank you, Madam President.   I come to the floor--I know my colleague from Indiana, Senator  Donnelly, is going to be down here to talk a little bit about his  motion, and I want to support him in that, along with the Senator from  Pennsylvania, Mr. Casey, because we are here to say we need to stop  this war on Medicaid.   Throughout this healthcare process, it has been very clear that there  are many on the other side of the aisle who just want to cut or gut  Medicaid. What we are saying is, if you are serious about protecting  Medicaid and stopping the war on Medicaid, then you should support the  Donnelly-Cantwell-Casey amendment, which would recommit the bill to the  Finance Committee with instructions to strike the language about  Medicaid. It would make sure a state can expand Medicaid Program, and  it would say: Don't cost-shift to the States.   With this motion, we are saying to our Republican colleagues: We  don't want to cut people off of Medicaid. We want the committee to do  exactly what the Republican Governors are saying, which is, quit  beating up on Medicaid and focus instead on fixing the individual  market. The individual market is 7 percent of the overall market for  health insurance.   What we have found with the expansion of Medicaid that has been done  by both Democratic and Republican Governors is great success.  [[Page S4242]]    I hope my Republican colleagues will heed the warnings of our  Nation's Republican Governors and Democratic Governors. In June, a  letter from seven bipartisan Governors was sent to Senate leaders. This  is a letter by the Governors of Ohio, Montana, Nevada, Louisiana,  Colorado, Massachusetts, and Pennsylvania. It shows the diversity of  both our Nation and political parties. It says:         We believe that, first and foremost, Congress should focus       on improving our nation's private health insurance system.    Then they say:         Medicaid provisions included in this bill [that has been       proposed by the House] are particularly problematic. Instead,       we recommend Congress address factors we can all agree need       fixing.    So the message was clear from these Governors, including Republican  Governors, and I hope my colleagues will listen to them. The Nation's  Governors know because they have had to provide and be a partner on  Medicaid for their citizens. They know how it affects their economy,  and they know what it does when families in their States get access to  healthcare. It reduces the bankruptcy rate. It helps people stay  employed. It boosts GDP. All of these things are benefits of Medicaid  expansion that we have seen in Washington State. It cut the  uncompensated care cost in half. It also resulted in the creation of  new jobs.   A nonpartisan study found that if the current bill we are debating,  the House bill, is passed, state economies will shrink by $93 billion.  So pulling the rug out from under Medicaid recipients would hurt jobs  and hurt economies in Nevada, Alaska, and West Virginia. West Virginia  would lose more than 10,000 jobs, more than $1 billion in gross State  product, and more than $1.7 billion in business output. Nevada would  lose 3,300 healthcare jobs and Alaska would lose 2,600.   So all of these things are ways for us to say: If you are serious  now--before you go home for the August recess--about protecting  Medicaid and stopping this ridiculous war on Medicaid, vote for our  motion. Stand up and say you understand that we may have challenges in  the individual market, but it doesn't mean that we should cut people  off of access to healthcare through Medicaid.   I thank the Presiding Officer.   I yield the floor.
