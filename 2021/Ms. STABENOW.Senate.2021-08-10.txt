 Madam President, unfortunately, I cannot support the  amendment offered by my good friend and ranking member.   This amendment would restrict the USDA's ability to support a  transition to clean fuel economies. Rural communities, especially rural  utilities and rural electric co-ops, can help lead the transition to  clean energy and create good-paying, clean energy jobs at the same  time. We know that. We need to provide the USDA with the tools and the  resources and the flexibility to make that happen.   It is important to know that our rural partners are asking to be a  part of this transition. They don't want an amendment that locks them  from being able to do that.   We all know that tackling the climate crisis is imperative. Just  yesterday, the U.N. put out another report showing that the climate  crisis is spiraling out of control.   Our budget will ensure that the United States will not only compete  but lead the world's race toward a clean energy future, and certainly  rural America is an important part of that.   So I would urge a ``no'' vote.                          Vote on Amendment No. 3103     Mr. President, first, this amendment is just plain  anti-pickup trucks. Let's start there. When our farmers and small  businesses and families are buying their next pickup truck or SUV, we  want them to have the incentive to purchase a new all-electric truck  like we have seen now being produced by the companies.   With the price ceiling in this amendment--there is a price ceiling-- they would not be allowed to receive the incentive that consumers  buying small cars would receive.   The fact is, more people buy pickup trucks and large vehicles than  people who buy small vehicles. So we eliminate more carbon pollution  when people who drive trucks and SUVs choose all-electric vehicles like  the great ones that are now coming out into the marketplace.   So I would ask you to vote no and stand with pickup truck owners  across the country.   (Applause.)
