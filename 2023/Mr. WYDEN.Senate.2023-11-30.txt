 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, I must regretfully object to the  promotion of Lt. Gen. Timothy Haugh to the grade of general and,  consequently, to be the Director of the National Security Agency--NSA-- and Commander of U.S. Cyber Command.   In January of 2021, I made public an unclassified memo I received  from the Defense Intelligence Agency revealing that it was purchasing,  retaining, and using location data revealing the movements of  Americans. After receiving that information, I pressed the Department  of Defense to identify which other Agencies within the Department are  buying Americans' personal data, including location data and web  browsing records.   The Department provided me with that information in March of 2021,  but marked the information ``Controlled Unclassified Information''-- CUI--a made-up designation with no basis in law. The administration is  abusing the C-U-I designation to keep this unclassified information  from the American public. In May of 2021, I wrote to Secretary of  Defense Austin to urge him to remove the restrictions on that  information, so that the American people can be told which Agencies are  buying their information without court oversight and so that Congress  can conduct appropriate oversight. In August of 2021, I received a  response letter from the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence  and Security, declining to clear the information for public release.   In connection with Lieutenant General Haugh's pending promotion to  lead the NSA, I narrowed my request. I asked that the American people  simply be provided yes or no answers as to whether the NSA is buying  their location data and web browsing records. Unfortunately,  intelligence officials have been unwilling to release even that basic  information.   The American people have a right to know whether the NSA is  conducting warrantless domestic surveillance of Americans in a manner  that circumvents the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution. Particularly  as Congress is currently debating extending section 702 of the Foreign  Intelligence Surveillance Act, Congress must be able to have an  informed public debate about the scope of the NSA's warrantless  surveillance of Americans.   Until the NSA publicly releases the information described above, I  must object to the Senate proceeding with the Haugh nomination.                            ____________________     Madam President, I am going to spend a few minutes  discussing the three words on this chart next to me: buy, borrow, and  die. These three little words are allowing billionaires across America  to legally get away with paying little or nothing in taxes for years  and years on end.   Here is how it works: A billionaire buys and holds assets, like works  of art, more houses than they can possibly live in, stocks and bonds,  you name it. They increase in value untaxed.   The billionaire then borrows against these assets to support a lavish  lifestyle, and they can borrow at a fraction of the consumer rate due  to the enormous holdings of these valuable assets. That loan is  untaxed. The billionaire's assets appreciate at a higher rate than the  interest on the loan--that is not hard to do. So the billionaire can,  essentially, do all of this until they die, and then their kids can  start all over again.   So let's now contrast buy, borrow, and die with the tax system in  America for firefighters and nurses. Nurses and firefighters, for  example, living in Philomath, OR, are required to pay taxes out of  every paycheck. Working people don't get to play by these billionaire  rules. They don't get to call up an army of high-priced lawyers and  accountants every time they don't feel like paying their taxes.   Right now, the average billionaire can wriggle their way into a low 8  percent tax rate while a nurse or a firefighter making $45,000 is  paying a 22 percent tax on their wages. Now, here is the gut punch for  everybody who is following this and works for a wage: Current buy,  borrow, and die practices under our tax law are perfectly legal. That  is a pretty sickening reality. Tax laws simply don't apply to  billionaires in the same way they do to firefighters and nurses.   Nurses, firefighters have mandatory tax rules. The billionaires can  pretty much pay what they want, when they want to. How is that fair?  Americans overwhelmingly believe it is not. So it is time to look to  solutions that restore fairness to the Tax Code while still rewarding  success. After all, that is what our country was founded on. We believe  deeply in success and the ethic of giving everybody a chance to get  ahead.   Luckily, there is a solution that achieves both fairness and economic  growth. Today, I, along with 15 other Members of the Senate, am  introducing the first comprehensive Billionaires' Income Tax that would  finally end buy, borrow, and die. This is going to put a stop to one of  the most common schemes billionaires can use to pay little or no taxes  for years and years on end.   Now, as to implementation of our bill, there is a way already on the  tax books that allows you to do it. In the Tax Code there are mark-to- market rules and policies.   Now, for the tax wonks out there, people who think tax policy and its  root-canal-like pain are enjoyable, here are the sections: Mark to  market is in section 475, it is in section 877A, it is in section 1256,  and it is in section 1296. So there is your model. That is how you do  it. You use rules and policies that are on the books today, a blueprint  right in front of us to use as a model for taxing billionaires fairly.   Mark to market under the Billionaires' Income Tax would require  billionaires to pay taxes every year, just like those firefighters and  nurses. It is time to close the loopholes and make sure that everybody  at the very top is paying taxes on their income as it is earned, and  our Billionaires' Income Tax is the way to do it.   This Congress, our staff on the Finance Committee and I have  investigated a number of tax schemes that the very wealthy, with the  help of armies of tax lawyers and accountants, use to pay virtually no  Federal tax. The Finance Committee has investigated crooked Swiss  bankers hiding wealthy Americans' income; $34 billion in unpaid taxes  from the very wealthy, who won't even file a tax return--we are not  even talking about schemes, they won't even file a return; unpaid taxes  for millionaires; tax-dodging schemes between Leon Black and the  notorious Jeffrey Epstein; and Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas's  wealthy buddy secretly forgiving a massive private loan. Billionaires  looking to dodge their taxes are thriving today under the current tax  laws.   So I want a tax policy, as chairman of the Finance Committee, that  gives everybody in America the chance to get ahead. Our friend, our  former colleague, Senator Bradley from New Jersey--has a better jump  shot than I do--that is what he talked about, is opportunity, giving  everybody a chance to get ahead. Unfortunately, the flawed tax policies  that billionaires take advantage of promote wealth building in the  hands of a fortunate few.   This is leaving a lot of people behind. Over one-third of families in  America don't have the cash on hand to pay for a $400 emergency if they  had to. Meanwhile, during the pandemic, when families were forced make  tough choices between paying rent and buying groceries, billionaires  increased their wealth by over $1 trillion.   We have big needs in this country--obviously, the Medicare solvency  crisis. We have seniors at the risk of losing the Medicare guarantee  unless there is a way forward for paying for it. If Medicare becomes  financially insolvent, seniors and Americans who counted on those  guaranteed health benefits need look no further than billionaires, tax  cheats, and their Republican allies who refuse to say that the  billionaires could pay their fair share.   The Billionaires' Income Tax raises an estimated $557 billion over 10  years. If the ultra-wealthy started paying their fair share under my  Billionaires' Income Tax proposal, we could be on our way to making  Medicare financially sound, protecting the Medicare guarantee for  millions of Americans.   I am going to close with this: The Billionaires' Income Tax is not an  attack on success; it is a fundamental strike for fairness. We want a  successful economy, and to have a successful economy, you have to have  a Tax Code that ensures that everybody in America gets a fair shake,  and treats everybody fairly.   It is time, in my view, to close the gap between the billionaires at  the top and everybody else, and our Billionaires' Income Tax is a way  to make that happen.                                  ______                                         By Mr. PADILLA:   S. 3375. A bill to establish a program so that business concerns  owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged  individuals may achieve proficiency to compete, on an equal basis, for  contracts and subcontracts in Department of Transportation projects,  and for other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and  Transportation.                                  ______                                         By Mr. PADILLA (for himself and Mr. Warnock):   S. 3377. A bill to provide for disadvantaged business enterprise  supportive services programs at modal administrations of the Department  of Transportation, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.
