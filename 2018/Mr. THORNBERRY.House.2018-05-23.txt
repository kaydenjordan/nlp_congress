 Mr. Speaker, parliamentary inquiry.    Mr. Speaker, the House is currently in the Committee  of the Whole. Correct?    Mr. Speaker, I have been confused by the mace coming  and going here.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and insert extraneous material on H.R. 5515.    Mr. Chairman, pursuant to House Resolution 908, I  offer amendments en bloc.    Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent that amendment  No. 53 printed in House Report 115-702 be modified in the form I have  placed at the desk.  [[Page H4655]]    The ACTING Chair. The Clerk will report the modification.   The Clerk read as follows:   Modification to amendment No. 53 offered by Mr. Curbelo of Florida:         The amendment as modified is as follows:        Page 877, insert after line 9 the following new section       (and redesignate the succeeding sections accordingly):       SEC. 2822. AUTHORITY FOR LEASING REAL PROPERTY AT THE NAVAL                     AIR STATION KEY WEST, FLORIDA.         (a) Authority.--The Secretary of the Navy (hereafter in       this Act referred to as the ``Secretary'') may lease       approximately 19 acres at the Naval Air Station Key West,       Florida, for the purpose of constructing, operating,       improving, and maintaining housing units (including altering       or demolishing existing housing units) under such terms and       conditions as the Secretary considers will promote the       national defense or to be in the public interest.        (b) Duration of Lease.--The lease entered into under this       section shall be for such period as may be agreed to by the       Secretary and the lessee, except that such period may not       exceed 50 years unless the Secretary determines that a lease       for a longer period is necessary to meet the purpose of the       lease.        (c) Payments Under Lease.--The Secretary shall require the       lessee to make payments under the lease entered into under       this section in cash for fair market value.        (d) Deposit and Use of Proceeds.--The Secretary shall       deposit and use any cash proceeds from the lease under this       section as prescribed in section 2667 of title 10, United       States Code.        (e) Leaseback Prohibited.--During the period in which the       lease entered into under this section is in effect, the       Secretary may not lease any of the space constructed by the       lessees on the property leased under this section.        (f) Right of First Refusal for Purchase of Property.--The       lease entered into under this section may provide the lessee       of the property with the first right to purchase the property       if the Secretary revokes the lease in order to permit the       United States to sell or transfer the property as authorized       under any other provision of law. Nothing in this subsection       may be construed to provide a lessee with the first right to       purchase the property if the Secretary revokes the lease for       any other cause, including the failure of the lessee to meet       the terms and conditions of the lease.        (g) Description of Property.--The exact acreage and legal       description of the property to be leased under this section       shall be determined by a survey satisfactory to the       Secretary.        (h) Additional Terms and Conditions.--The Secretary may       require such additional terms and conditions in connection       with the lease under this section as the Secretary considers       appropriate to protect the interests of the United States.        (i) Inapplicability of Certain Provisions.--The following       provisions of law do not apply to this section, the lease       entered into under this section, or the property which is       subject to the lease under this section:        (1) Section 2662 of title 10, United States Code.        (2) Section 2696 of title 10, United States Code.        (3) The Randolph-Sheppard Act (20 U.S.C. 107 et seq.).        (4) Title V of the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act       (42 U.S.C. 11411 et seq.)    Mr. THORNBERRY (during the reading). Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous  consent the modification be considered as read.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. McCaul), the chairman of the Homeland Security Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Maine (Mr. Poliquin).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman  from Missouri (Mrs. Hartzler), the distinguished chair of our  Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations.    Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent that amendment  No. 55 be removed from the en bloc package.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Chairman, I appreciate and understand all Members' desire to not  only support jobs in their district, but to support American  manufacturing. I share, of course, that goal. At the same time, I must  oppose this amendment because there is simply no national security  justification to mandate where DOD buys its plates and mugs.   Now, there was a view in the past that textiles, food, and certain  tools were essential for the health and well-being of our military and  related to their combat effectiveness. It is absolutely true that we  have had troops die from exposure to tainted food, and that not having  the appropriate tools has had an effect on the quality of our weaponry.                                time  1515    I have never heard that argument apply when it comes to plates and  bowls and knives or forks and spoons that we are about to discuss with  the next amendment.   Mr. Chairman, adding this mandate hurts our troops because if these  suppliers of plates are the best price, then that is what DOD buys. But  if it costs more to buy these plates, that money has to come from  somewhere. And that money will come from bullets or fuel or other  things that are essential for our troops to have. I cannot tell you how  many fewer bullets the Pentagon will be able to buy because they have  to pay more for their bowls and plates and mugs.   I also can't tell you how much more exactly the Pentagon will expend  in ensuring compliance with this mandate, to do the studies to check  the quality, to have a report if they should fall in one of the  exceptions, which are all there within the law. But I know it will be  some.   Some money, some added bureaucracy is too much. As a matter of fact,  the underlying bill is trying to go the other way and get more  resources into the hands of our warfighters to increase what we send to  the tooth and reduce the tail.   I would just say one other point at this point, Mr. Chairman.   Where does this stop? Where does this end?   Last year, we had knives and forks and spoons. This year, we have got  plates and mugs. Does it next go to the trays that they carry their  food on? What about the plastic cups that they may drink from?   Do we just keep rolling with this and go all the way to the hand soap  and toilet paper in the bathroom?   I don't know where it stops. If there is not a national security  justification to put this added cost and added mandate, we should not  do it to our troops. Therefore, I must oppose the gentleman's amendment  and other amendments that are not related to national security.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time  simply to say: Mr. Chairman, before we add this additional burden on  our troops and what we provide to them, there ought to be a scintilla  of evidence that this is a problem with the military.   Saying, well, somebody might get sick some day is not sufficient to  say we are going to take more money away from your needs and put it  into plates and mugs. We have got to have a sense of priority and a  sense of evidence of where the real problems are.   Mr. Chairman, therefore, I oppose the gentleman's amendment, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 30 seconds to the gentlewoman  from New York (Ms. Tenney).    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Chairman, I again want to express my admiration for the  gentlewoman from New York and her advocacy for workers and businesses  in her district. But I must oppose the amendment.   The fundamental question before the House is: Are we going to inflict  higher costs on the Department of Defense with a mandate that requires  where the Department buys its forks and spoons and knives and plates  and mugs?   That is the question.   If any of these suppliers provide the best price, that is where DOD  is going to go buy them. So these amendments, both the last one and  this one, only become relevant if the costs are higher and we are  making DOD buy the higher-priced items anyway.   Now, as I mentioned, there may be some justification for that when  there is a vital national security concern. But when it comes to forks  and plates, I don't think that exists.   So the only way these amendments matter is if it forces DOD to pay  more. And when it forces DOD to pay more for plates and bowls and forks  and knives, then you are taking money away from bullets and fuel and  guns and ships and the things that help keep America safe.   Mr. Chairman, creating domestic jobs is not the primary mission of  the Department of Defense. Our focus, the Department's focus and our  focus in this bill when it comes to this Congress, is to protect the  Nation and to support the men and women who risk their lives for us. We  have got to give them everything they need to do their job. We should  not do anything that would divert from that.   So I, again, with all admiration for the gentlewoman from New York  and the gentleman from West Virginia, I just say, if we are going to  tell DOD where they have to buy their forks and knives and plates,  where does it end?   I have a manufacturer, I am sure, in my district that would love to  supply the Department of Defense with something or another.                                time  1530    We cannot go down this road. We must let the Department buy the best  value. That is what I think all Members should support.   Mr. Chair, I oppose the amendment, and I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chair, the men and women of NNSA are like the  military: they are going to get the job done under whatever conditions  are required. But this amendment affects their work environment, their  health and safety, and whether we can attract and retain top-quality  people. It is the people who would suffer under this; it is not the  mission. I understand people are antinuclear, but it is the people who  would suffer.   As both gentlemen have said, we have a tremendous backlog. This just  helps us catch up a little bit.    Mr. Chairman, I move that the Committee do now rise.   The motion was agreed to.   Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr.  Carter of Georgia) having assumed the chair, Mr. Marshall, Acting Chair  of the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported  that that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R.  5515) to authorize appropriations for fiscal year 2019 for military  activities of the Department of Defense and for military construction,  to prescribe military personnel strengths for such fiscal year, and for  other purposes, had come to no resolution thereon.  [[Page H4673]]                                ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that during  further consideration of H.R. 5515 in the Committee of the Whole  pursuant to House Resolution 908, the fourth set of amendments en bloc  offered by myself pursuant to section 3 of House Resolution 905 be  considered to have been adopted with the modification I have placed at  the desk.    Mr. Chairman, pursuant to House Resolution 908, I  offer amendments en bloc.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman  from Missouri (Mrs. Hartzler).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Washington (Mr. Newhouse) for the purpose of a colloquy.    Will the gentleman yield?    Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for raising this  issue.   As the gentleman and I have discussed, there are significant hurdles  to legislating land transfers of the Department of Defense. Among the  issues that must be addressed are:   What and where is the property in question?   Who is the intended recipient?   Are there multiple parties who are also interested in acquiring this  property?   Are there ongoing legal proceedings related to the property?   Are there cleanup costs and liabilities associated with the property?   Have the interested parties met with the Department of Defense, and  if so, with whom?   Does the Department support conveying the property, and do they have  a continuing need for it?   If supported, why can't the Department dispose of the property  through its surplus/excess process?   What are the proposed reuses of the property?   Are there any earmark issues--no-cost conveyances to private entities  or for economic development can be subject to points of order.   Has CBO been consulted for any mandatory scoring implications?   And, if outside committees have equities, have they been consulted  for approval or concerns?   I will be happy to continue working with the gentleman moving  forward, but I would ask that he and any other Member looking at land  transfers take these factors into account and give all relevant  committees plenty of time and opportunity to vet their proposal.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Lance).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Stefanik), who is the chair of the  Subcommittee on Emerging Threats and Capabilities.    Mr. Chairman, I have no further speakers on this en  bloc package, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I also yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chairman, pursuant to House Resolution 908, I  offer amendments en bloc.    Mr. Chairman, I have no speakers on this set of  amendments en bloc.   Mr. Chairman, I urge its adoption, and I yield back the balance of my  time.                                time  1715     Mr. Chairman, I move that the Committee do now rise.   The motion was agreed to.   Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr.  LaMalfa) having assumed the chair, Mr. Marshall, Acting Chair of the  Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that  that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 5515) to  authorize appropriations for fiscal year 2019 for military activities  of the Department of Defense and for military construction, to  prescribe military personnel strengths for such fiscal year, and for  other purposes, had come to no resolution thereon.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that when the  House adjourns today, it adjourn to meet at 9 a.m. tomorrow.
