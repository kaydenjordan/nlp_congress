 Mr. Speaker, I do appreciate the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I come before the House today to talk about a tragic  situation involving Justine Damond. Justine Damond was a young woman  who saw what she believed to be a sexual assault outside of her home.  She then made a call to the police and asked them to come to give  assistance.   Ms. Damond then went outside to try to meet with the police to report  what she saw, and for some reason, which no one really knows quite yet,  she was shot in the abdomen and died.   Ms. Damond, 40 years old, she was due to be married in only a few  weeks. She leaves behind a fiance, her fiance's son, her family, her  parents, and here we are again dealing with a tragic situation in which  an unarmed civilian has been shot by a member of law enforcement.   Now, as I speak today, Mr. Speaker, I want to be very clear. I know  many police officers personally. I know how hard they work. I know the  dangers that they incur. I know that they, by and large, join the force  because they want to help people, because they are courageous and brave  and are willing to put themselves in harm's way in order to protect  other citizens. And I myself, and many people I know, have called on  the police to stop crimes from happening, to report them, and we are  grateful when they report.   But it is also true, Mr. Speaker, that officer-involved shootings  happen with tremendous frequency, and it is not even a matter of  blaming the officer. We have to ask ourselves what is going on with the  system of policing which allows us to return to this tragic scenario  again and again and again.   Justine Damond, again, was reportedly in her pajamas, and she was  trying to help another person, yet somehow the officer, who was on the  passenger side of the squad car, shot through the door or the window,  and that is not clear, and she sustained lethal injuries.   One of the most disturbing things about this particular case, Mr.  Speaker, is that the officer's body cameras were not turned on. The  dash cam did not capture the interaction between Justine and the  officers, and the body cams were, again, as I mentioned, not on. This  is despite the fact that all Minneapolis police officers have worn body  cameras since the end of 2016. Why the body cameras were not on, we can  only speculate.   But I urge, with everything I have, that the Minnesota Bureau of  Criminal Apprehension, Minneapolis Police Department, and everyone and  anyone who has jurisdictional authority investigate the reason for  these tools to not be in use.   Justine is dead. Justine is not coming back. And it is true that  innocent people get killed by criminals all day, and that is a sad  reality of our world. It doesn't just happen in my city of Minneapolis.  It happens all over the country. It happens all over the globe.   But I think that citizens expect that members of law enforcement, who  are sworn to protect us, would take due care to protect life, not end  it, unless there was a legal basis to do so.   Now, again, I don't know what happened here. Nobody really knows what  caused the officer to somehow reach over his partner and shoot Ms.  Damond in the abdomen and kill her when she is unarmed and wearing  pajamas and is the reporter of a crime. The weeks and days ahead will  reveal what happened. But I assure you that this will not be the last  time that it happens unless, as a society, we begin to ask ourselves  why these things are happening.   In our community in Minnesota, we are still trying to figure out how  to  [[Page H6031]]  deal with it, how to cope with the death of Philando Castile. Philando  Castile was shot and killed on videotape, captured on live-stream  Facebook. To the credit of John Choi, who was the prosecutor, district  attorney in Ramsey County, Minnesota, that officer was charged with the  criminal offense of manslaughter, and after a jury trial, that officer  was acquitted.   When I looked at the dash cam and saw the officer discharge his  firearm into the body of Philando Castile, it was absolutely  horrifying, and I couldn't possibly understand why this happened. I  don't know what the jurors saw, and I am a lawyer myself, and I support  the jury system, but I can tell you that Philando Castile, who did have  a firearm, said: Officer, I have a firearm; I have a license to carry a  firearm. And the next thing you know, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, young  man dead.   Philando Castile was a beloved member of his community. He was the  lunch attendant. He was the lunch manager at Hill Elementary School in  St. Paul, and the children needed counseling, and the families needed  somebody to explain why was Philando Castile shot this way.   The children are raised to respect the police, but they knew Philando  Castile and they loved him, and they couldn't reconcile why the police,  who they respect, would hurt Philando Castile, who they also respected  and admired and loved.   Jamar Clark, another one from Minnesota, unarmed, shot, killed,  tremendous outpouring of community frustration around this, brought an  18-day protest outside of the Fourth Precinct in Minneapolis, and you  know, drew the attention of the entire community. And I can assure you  that many people, particularly young people, were angry, upset,  frustrated, feeling very vulnerable because they just felt that there  was no accountability in that their lives just didn't matter very much  in the eyes of the people who were sworn to protect and defend them.    We have a community problem, Mr. Speaker. We have to come together  and deal with it, and it is simply not enough to say it is all the  cops' fault or it is all the citizens' fault. This is a social problem  that calls for a social solution.   Part of it will be changes in law. Part of it will be departmental  changes. Part of it will be changes in the way we do business. But we  have got to have these changes. And if people just say, ``It is not my  fault, you know, it was an accident, this person had it coming,'' we  will never get to the bottom of these kind of things.   Mr. Speaker, in 1967, there were a state of civil disturbances, some  people call riots, throughout our urban areas, and the government  responded by issuing something called a Kerner Commission Report, K-E- R-N-E-R. And one of the findings of that is that police community  relations were incredibly bad, that communication was poor, and that  the police were essentially sent into areas that were economically and  socially isolated and deprived in order to keep order, and what really  should have been happening is that we should have been investing in  jobs and opportunity and social inclusion, and we just asked the police  to sort of just solve this problem without making the investments that  our society should have made.                                time  1830    I am sad to say that we really don't seem to have advanced very far.  The fact is that often civil disturbances, which are often referred to  as riots, occur after these tragic shootings. Civil judgments are paid  out. Citizens tend to distrust the police and are less willing to call  them when they need them.   There are tremendous social costs to not addressing these officer- involved shootings involving unarmed civilians, and we have to be there  to do something about it.   We have seen a number of tragic circumstances all across the country,  whether it is Sandra Bland or whether it is Walter Scott in South  Carolina, whether it is Eric Garner who died begging for a breath or  whether it is all of the victims of Officer Holtzclaw who routinely and  systematically sexually abused women in Oklahoma City. The fact is  there is great discretionary latitude conferred on our law enforcement  officers.   We need more oversight and accountability. We need people to be held  accountable when they break the law, and I mean people who are police  and people who are not. We need to say that there is one standard of  justice and that everyone has to adhere to it.   We know about Michael Brown, 17 years old, shot in 2014, or we could  say Tamir Rice. There are so many cases. They just go on and on and on.  We are at a point where we have to address this crisis.   Now, Ms. Damond is one of more than 500 fatal shootings by police  this year alone. I will say it again, Mr. Speaker. Ms. Damond is one of  more than 500 people who have been fatally killed by the police this  year. Some of them, the officer may have had legal justification, some  not; but when you have got 500 people across this country being shot  and killed, it is a crisis that we have to do something about.   This year, I could simply tell you, Mr. Speaker, that offering  prayers simply isn't going to get it done. We have a systemic problem,  and whether we have to talk about addressing body cameras more and  insisting upon their use or whether we need implicit bias training for  police to raise awareness of unconscious or implicit biases, whether we  need to train officers on the deescalation of force and have training  in that regard and, yes, prosecutions of people who just commit crimes  with a uniform on, we have got to take decisive action.   We need more diversity in police departments, and we need more  diversity in jury selection. We need grand jury reform, and we need the  Department of Justice to keep account of all the cases that involve  officer-involved shootings.   One thing we absolutely do not need is for the Attorney General,  Jefferson Beauregard Sessions, to abandon consent decrees, which have  brought some level of understanding and communication between  communities and the police departments. We need a partner in the  Federal Government, Mr. Speaker. What is at stake is too important.   We also need quality schools. We need investment in neighborhoods. We  need quality jobs and affordable housing. We need healthcare for all,  and we need to have clean air and water for everyone. We need those  things as part of the ecosystem that human beings live in. But none of  these things are a replacement for decent, respectful treatment people  deserve from law enforcement.   I am not here to give up. I am here to engage police in a dialogue  about how we reduce these shootings, how we increase the trust, how we  make sure that no one feels that they can't go to the police because  the trust has been so severely damaged.   I believe we have got to come together as a society and recognize  that this problem is serious. It is not getting better; in fact, it is  getting worse.   When you think about cases involving people like Mya Hall, or Alexa  Christian, Meagan Hockaday, Sandra Bland, Natasha McKenna, all African- American women killed by or after encounters with the police, it is not  just men; it is women, too. It is not just African Americans; it is  whites, too. Justine Damond was a white female. It is Latinos. It is  people of different economic stations. It is not just one community. If  Ms. Damond's case proves anything, it is that officer-involved  shootings of unarmed civilians don't only occur in certain  neighborhoods of certain people.   The time is now for us to act. And I do put out a call for police and  communities to engage in an intensive discussion about how we restore  trust, how we increase accountability, and how we really make it true  when we write on the side doors of our police vehicles all across this  country, ``to protect and serve.''
