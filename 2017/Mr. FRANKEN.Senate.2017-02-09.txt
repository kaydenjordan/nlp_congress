 Mr. President, my understanding was that the Democratic  leader wanted to come and speak for 5 minutes between Senator Stabenow  and myself. But he is not here, so I am going to speak.   Before I start my remarks that I have prepared, I want to say  something specifically to the Presiding Officer because he is a new  Senator from Indiana.   I read a front-page article in the New York Times just a few weeks  ago. It featured Indiana University Hospital and the health physicians  there. It was an article about the savings and the delivery reform that  have been driven by the Affordable Care Act, things that will be  staying with us even if this is repealed, which I hope it isn't. But  this is a quote I would like to read for the Presiding Officer from Dr.  Gregory Kira, cochief of primary care, Indiana University Health  Physicians.   I would ask the Presiding Officer for his attention for a second.  This is what it says: `` `I've been a registered Republican my whole  life, but I support the Affordable Care Act,' said Dr. Gregory C.  Kiray, co-chief of primary care for IU Health Physicians, `because it  allows patients to be taken care of.' ''   I admit, I didn't have 49 others for every State, but I had  remembered reading this.  [[Page S1025]]    On February 3, 2009, Tom Daschle, President Obama's nominee for  Secretary of Health and Human Services, withdrew his nomination because  he hadn't paid his taxes on his car service. On January 9, 2001, Linda  Chavez, President George W. Bush's nominee for the Department of Labor,  withdrew her nomination after questions were raised about her decision  to shelter an undocumented immigrant. Most recently, Vincent Viola,  President Trump's nominee to be--   Would the leader like me to yield to him for a few minutes?    Really?    Would that be good for me and my career?    Well, I am going to yield to our leader in just a  moment, when he manages to get there, and it will be the esteemed  Senator from New York, Charles Schumer. I will narrate as he is  stepping over there, walking now to the podium--the leader, whom I will  yield to.    Thank you, Mr. Leader.    Mr. President, I have to start this over fresh. I don't  know if the Congressional Record needs to have this first half  paragraph twice, but so be it.   On February 3, 2009, Tom Daschle, President Obama's nominee for  Secretary of Health and Human Services, withdrew his nomination because  he hadn't paid his taxes on his car service. On January 9, 2001, Linda  Chavez, President George W. Bush's nominee for the Department of Labor,  withdrew her nomination after questions were raised about her decision  to shelter an undocumented immigrant. Most recently, Vincent Viola,  President Trump's nominee to be the Secretary of the Army, withdrew his  nomination after it proved too difficult for him to distance himself  from his business ties.   Congressman Price's conflicted financial investments and his  affiliation with conspiracy-theory-peddling extremists should be enough  to disqualify his nomination. On top of that, Congressman Price's  policy agenda squarely contradicts what the majority of the American  people want and the key promises President Trump made during his  campaign. It is, frankly, hard to believe that we are seriously  considering someone who has advanced policies that would privatize  Medicare, gut Medicaid, and rip coverage away from millions of  Americans.   For all of these reasons, I strongly oppose Congressman Price's  nomination for Secretary of Health and Human Services.   Let's take these issues one by one.   First, Congressman Price's stock trades. Public documents show that  between 1993 and 2012, Congressman Price owned shares in tobacco  companies worth tens of thousands of dollars. At the same time,  Congressman Price voted against landmark legislation in 2009 that gave  the Food and Drug Administration the authority to regulate tobacco and  bring down the death toll inflicted by tobacco products. That means  Congressman Price, a physician who swore to uphold the Hippocratic oath  of ``do no harm,'' voted against public health and for Big Tobacco.  This is the person who is slated to become the next Secretary of Health  and Human Services, someone who personally profited from increased  sales of deadly, addictive products.  [[Page S1026]]    When asked about this during his hearing in the Health, Education,  Labor, and Pensions Committee, Congressman Price's best defense was  that his broker made the stock trades on behalf without his knowledge.   Here is the problem with that defense:   First, Congressman Price annually reported his financial holdings,  signing off on documents acknowledging his investments in tobacco  companies, meaning that he would have knowledge of the fact that his  vote to block tobacco regulation could have a direct financial benefit  to him.   Second, these were not investments in diversified funds; these were  individual stocks that he owned for nearly 20 years and that he  reported paid him dividends. Let me repeat that. Congressman Price,  medical doctor, owned individual tobacco company stocks that paid him  dividends.   Owning tens of thousands of dollars of tobacco stocks while voting to  help tobacco companies was not Congressman Price's only questionable  investment. In late December, the Wall Street Journal reported that  over the past 4 years, Congressman Price has traded stocks worth more  than $300,000 in about 40 health-related companies while at the same  time serving on the House Ways and Means Committee, where he drafted  and cosponsored legislation that could affect his investments.   Let's talk about one example that is particularly troubling.  Congressman Price made his largest ever stock purchase in a company  called Innate Immunotherapeutics, a small biotech company based in  Australia. This is a company that has only one experimental therapy in  the early stages of testing, has never generated revenues from drug  sales. It is not exactly a household name. How did Congressman Price  get in on this sweetheart deal? He was told about Innate by Congressman  Chris Collins, who, in addition to being a Member of the House of  Representatives, serves on the board of directors for Innate  Immunotherapeutics and is the company's largest shareholder.   The Wall Street Journal reported that Congressman Price was part of a  small group of fewer than 20 U.S. investors who participated in the  private stock sale. The New York Times and the Buffalo News reported  that many of those people had close ties to Congressman Collins,  including Collins' chief of staff, a prominent DC lobbyist, and several  of Congressman Collins' campaign contributors.   On August 31, Congressman Price reported that as part of this special  private stock sale, he bought about 400,000 shares of Innate stock for  as little as 18 cents a share. That same day, the stock was trading on  the Australian Stock Exchange for the equivalent of 31 cents per share.  That is a 42-percent difference--42 percent below the market price--and  Congressman Price now stands to make a profit of more than $200,000.  That is quite a stock tip.   Richard Painter, George W. Bush's chief ethics lawyer, describes  Price's stock trades as ``crazy. . . . We wouldn't have put up with  anybody in the Bush administration buying and selling health care  stocks.'' Painter went on to explain that ``if you, as a member of  Congress, buy and sell health care stocks at the same time you are  possessing non-public information about that legislation, you are  taking the risk of being charged with criminal insider trading.''   Let me repeat that. Mr. Painter, who was George W. Bush's chief  ethics official, suggested that Mr. Price's actions risk a criminal  insider trading charge.   Congressman Price could have directed his broker to stay away from  tobacco stocks. He could have directed his broker to stay away from  health care stocks or individual stocks altogether given that health  care was one of his legislative priorities. But he did not. Why would  Congressman Price take this risk?   My colleagues and I have sent Congressman Price a number of letters  asking for more information about his stock trades and investments. If  this is all aboveboard, then Congressman Price should have nothing to  hide. I also submitted questions for the record as a member of the HELP  Committee. In response to all of these questions, I have received  nothing. It makes no sense that his nomination has been brought to the  floor despite his refusal to respond to committee questions.   Congressman Price has demonstrated a lack of judgment with his stock  trades and now is stonewalling the committee, refusing to answer our  inquiries, but Congressman Price's questionable stock trades aren't the  only area raising red flags.   My second set of concerns stems from Congressman Price's longstanding  association with conspiracy-peddling, anti-science extremists. For more  than 25 years, Congressman Price has been a dues-paying member of the  Association of American Physicians and Surgeons. He has spoken at the  organization's conferences and even described the organization's  executive director as one of his personal heroes. This organization is  way out of the mainstream. It promotes anti-vaccine pseudoscience and  denies the scientific fact that HIV causes AIDS. It is an organization  that blames ``swarms'' of immigrant children for disease and has  published scientifically discredited theories linking abortion to  breast cancer. At one point, it even accused President Barack Obama of  hypnotizing voters with ``neuro-linguistic programming.''   Let me repeat that. It accused President Barack Obama of hypnotizing  voters with ``neuro-linguistic programming.''   That is not all. The statement of principles for the Association of  American Physicians and Surgeons has an entire section devoted to  urging doctors to refuse to participate in Medicare, in which it says  the effect of such government-run programs is ``evil, and participation  in carrying out his provisions is, in our opinion, immoral.''  Congressman Price--the person poised to become the next Secretary of  Health and Human Services, the person responsible for leading  Medicare--has been an active, engaged member of this organization for  25 years.   Just in case you don't think he has bought into these ideas, let me  read you what Congressman Price wrote in 2009 in an op-ed: ``I can  attest that nothing has had a greater negative effect on the delivery  of health care than the federal government's intrusion into medicine  through Medicare.''   Since Congressman Price will not answer my questions, I will pose  this to one of my Republican colleagues: How are the American people  supposed to trust Congressman Price as Secretary of Health and Human  Services given that he has belonged to an organization for over 25  years that has such blatant disregard for science and a propensity for  putting partisanship and ideology above evidence?   Lastly and most importantly, the policy reforms that Congressman  Price has put forward are so extreme that they should be disqualifying  in and of themselves. As an editorial recently published in the New  England Journal of Medicine stated, ``As compared with his  predecessors' actions, Price's record demonstrates less concern for the  sick, the poor, and the health of the public and much greater concern  for the economic well-being of their physician caregivers.'' That is  from the New England Journal of Medicine.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have the article printed in  the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:         [From the New England Journal of Medicine; Jan. 12, 2017]  Care for the Vulnerable vs. Cash for the Powerful--Trump's Pick for HHS           (By Sherry A. Glied, Ph.D. and Richard G. Frank, Ph.D)         Representative Tom Price of Georgia, an orthopedic surgeon,       will be President-elect Donald Trump's nominee for secretary       of health and human services (HHS). In the 63-year history of       the HHS Department and its predecessor, the Department of       Health, Education, and Welfare, only two previous secretaries       have been physicians. Otis Bowen, President Ronald Reagan's       second HHS secretary, engineered the first major expansion of       Medicare, championed comparative effectiveness research and,       with Surgeon General C. Everett Koop, led the fight against       HIV-AIDS. Louis Sullivan, HHS secretary under President       George H.W. Bush, focused his attention on care for       vulnerable populations, campaigned against tobacco use, led       the development of federally sponsored clinical guidelines,       and introduced President Bush's health insurance plan, which       incorporated income-related tax credits and a system of risk       adjustment. In their work at HMS, both men, serving in       Republican administrations, drew on a long tradition of       physicians as advocates for the most vulnerable, defenders of  [[Page S1027]]       public health, and enthusiastic proponents of scientific       approaches to clinical care.        Tom Price represents a different tradition. Ostensibly, he       emphasizes the importance of making our health care system       ``more responsive and affordable to meet the needs of       America's patients and those who care for them. But as       compared with his predecessors' actions, Price's record       demonstrates less concern for the sick, the poor, and the       health of the public and much greater concern for the       economic wellbeing of their physician caregivers.        Price has sponsored legislation that supports making armor-      piercing bullets more accessible and opposing regulations on       cigars, and he has voted against regulating tobacco as a       drug. His voting record shows long-standing opposition to       policies aimed at improving access to care for the most       vulnerable Americans. In 2007-2008, during the presidency of       George W. Bush, he was one of only 47 representatives to       vote against the Domenici Wellstone Mental Health Parity       and Addiction Equity Act, which improved coverage for       mental health care in private insurance plans. He also       voted against funding for combating AIDS, malaria, and       tuberculosis; against expansion of the State Children's       Health Insurance Program; and in favor of allowing       hospitals to turn away Medicaid and Medicare patients       seeking nonemergency care if they could not afford       copayments.        Price favors converting Medicare to a premium-support       system and changing the structure of Medicaid to a block       grant--policy options that shift financial risk from the       federal government to vulnerable populations. He also opposed       reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act and has       voted against legislation prohibiting job discrimination       against lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people       and against enforcement of laws against anti-LGBT hate       crimes. He favors amending the Constitution to outlaw same-      sex marriage.        In addition, he has been inconsistent in supporting       investments in biomedical science. He opposes stem-cell       research and voted against expanding the National Institutes       of Health budget and against the recently enacted 21st       Century Cures Act, showing particular animus toward the       Cancer Moonshot.        Price has also been a vociferous opponent of the Affordable       Care Act (ACA) and a leader of the repeal-and-replace       movement. His proposal for replacing the ACA is H.R. 2300,       the Empowering Patients First Act, which would eliminate the       ACA's Medicaid expansion and replace its subsidies with flat       tax credits based on age, not income ($1,200 per year for       someone 18 to 35 years of age; $3,000 for someone 50 or       older, with an additional one-time credit of $1,000 toward a       health savings account). Price's plan is regressive: it       offers much greater subsidies relative to income for       purchasers with high incomes and much more meager subsidies       for those with low incomes. In today's market, these credits       would pay only about one third of the premium of a low-cost       plan, leaving a 30-year-old with a premium bill for $2,532,       and a 60-year-old with a bill for $5,916--along with a       potential out-of-pocket liability of as much as $7,000. By       contrast, subsidies under the ACA are based on income and the       price of health insurance. Today, a low-income person (with       an income of 200% of the federal poverty level) pays, on       average, a premium of $1,528 per year (regardless of age) for       a plan with an out-of-pocket maximum of $2,350, and that       payment does not change even if health insurance premiums       rise.        To put the plan's subsidies into perspective, consider that       in 1992, when per capita health expenditures were just one       third of what they are today, President Bush and HHS       Secretary Sullivan proposed a slightly larger individual tax       credit ($1,250) for the purchase of insurance than Price       proposes today. Even in 1992, analysts reported that the       credit would be insufficient to induce most people to buy       coverage.        The Price plan would eliminate the guaranteed-issue and       community-rating requirements in the ACA and create anemic       substitutes for these commitments to access to comprehensive       coverage for Americans with preexisting conditions. These       replacements include an extension to the nongroup market of       the continuous-coverage rules that have long existed in the       group market with little benefit; penalties on reentering the       market for anyone who has had a break in coverage; and a very       limited offer of funding for states to establish high-risk       pools. In combination with relatively small tax credits,       these provisions are likely to lead low-income and even       middle-class healthy people to forgo seeking coverage until a       serious health problem develops. Without the income- and       premium-based subsidies in the ACA acting as market       stabilizers, Price's provisions would erode the non-group       health insurance market.        Price's plan would withdraw almost all the ACA's federal       consumer-protection regulations, including limits on insurer       profits and requirements that plans cover essential health       benefits. By allowing the sale of health insurance across       state lines, the plan would also effectively eliminate all       state regulation of health insurance plans, encouraging a       race to the bottom among insurance carriers. Finally, Price       would fund his plan by capping the tax exclusion for       employer-sponsored health insurance at $8,000 per individual       or $20,000 per family. These caps are well below those       legislated through the Cadillac tax in the ACA, a provision       that Price himself has voted to repeal.        In sum, Price's replacement proposal would make it much       more difficult for low-income Americans to afford health       insurance. It would divert federal tax dollars to people who       can already buy individual coverage without subsidies and       substantially reduce protections for those with preexisting       conditions. The end result would be a shaky market dominated       by health plans that offer limited coverage and high cost       sharing.        Whereas Price's actions to date have not reflected the       tradition of the physician as advocate for the poor and       vulnerable, they do harken back to an earlier tradition in       American medicine: the physician advocate as protector of the       guild. His Empowering Patients First Act would directly       advance physicians' economic interests by permitting them to       bill Medicare patients for amounts above those covered by the       Medicare fee schedule and allowing them to join together and       negotiate with insurance carriers without violating antitrust       statutes. Both these provisions would increase physicians'       incomes at the expense of patients. Price has consistently       fought strategies for value-based purchasing and guideline       development, opposing the use of bundled payments for lower-      extremity joint replacements and proposing that physician       specialty societies hold veto power over the release of       comparative effectiveness findings. These positions reduce       regulatory burdens on physicians at the cost of increased       inefficiency and reduced quality of care--and reflect a       striking departure from the ethos of his physician       predecessors, Secretaries Bowen and Sullivan.        The HHS Department oversees a broad set of health programs       that touch about half of all Americans. Over five decades and       the administrations of nine presidents, both Democratic and       Republican secretaries have used these programs to protect       the most vulnerable Americans. The proposed nomination of Tom       Price to HHS highlights a sharp contrast between this       tradition of compassionate leadership and the priorities of       the incoming administration.     This article cites his votes against mental health  parity--think about what that means in terms of treatment during this  opioid crisis--against funding for AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis,  against the expansion of the State Children's Health Insurance Program,  against tobacco regulation, against the reauthorization of the Violence  Against Women Act, and more.   Price has also been a champion of efforts to repeal the Affordable  Care Act. The Congressional Budget Office recently estimated that if  the ACA is repealed, nearly 20 million Americans will lose their health  care coverage immediately, with the number growing to 32 million over  the next 10 years, and 300,000 of those individuals live in my State of  Minnesota. Let me tell you about at least two of them.   Leanna has a 3-year-old son named Henry. Henry has been diagnosed  with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and his treatment will last at least  until April of 2018. Henry often needs around-the-clock care to manage  his nausea, vomiting, pain, and sleepless nights. This is a 3-year-old  boy. Henry's immune system is so compromised that he is not supposed to  go to daycare. So Leanna left her job to take care of him. Leanna's  family is supported by her spouse, but they couldn't pay for Henry's  treatment on one salary. Leanna says:         It is because of the ACA that Henry gets proper health       care. Henry can get therapy and the things he needs to       maintain his health and work toward beating cancer. Henry is       still with us because of the ACA.    Let me say that again: ``Henry is still with us because of the ACA.''   I have asked Republicans repeatedly to show me the plan they have to  make sure Leanna and her son Henry and the hundreds of thousands of  Minnesotans who have gained coverage don't lose the care they need. I  have yet to see their plan. What I have seen Congressman Price advocate  for so far is pretty awful. His proposals would strip away coverage for  people with preexisting conditions, strip away preventive health  benefits, strip away protections from annual and lifetime limits, strip  away coverage for young adults. Moreover, Congressman Price views  Medicaid and Medicare as government expenditures to be cut, rather than  lifelines to millions of seniors, disabled populations, children and  families. As chairman of the House Budget Committee, Congressman Price  introduced proposals to cut funding for Medicaid by more than $2  trillion.   In my State, Medicaid provides health insurance to 14 percent of the  residents. That includes two out of five low-income individuals, one in  four children, one in two people with disabilities, and one in two  nursing home residents. Think about that. One in two  [[Page S1028]]  people in nursing homes are covered by Medicaid in my State.   What is going to happen to these people--our parents, our children,  our spouses, our families--if Congressman Price and his colleagues  succeed in slashing Medicaid's budget? I can guarantee you, it will not  be kind and it will not be just and Americans are going to lose out.   Congressman Price's assault on our health care system doesn't end  there. He wants to slash Medicare's budget by hundreds of billions of  dollars, undermining our basic guarantee of coverage to our Nation's  seniors, and no wonder. Let me remind you, this is the same person who  wrote: ``I can attest that nothing has had a greater negative effect on  the delivery of health care than the Federal government's intrusion  into medicine through Medicare.''   Do we really want the person who wrote this to be running Medicare?  Price's determination to gut Medicaid and Medicare is directly opposed  by the vast majority of Americans and in direct opposition to President  Trump's campaign promise never to cut Medicaid or Medicare.   When Tom Daschle withdrew from consideration for HHS Secretary, he  talked about the challenges of health care reform and said:         This work will require a leader who can operate with the       full faith of Congress and the American people, and without       distraction. Right now, I am not that leader, and will not be       a distraction.    So I say to Congressman Price, you do not have the full faith of the  Congress, and you do not have the full faith of the American people.  You are not the leader this country needs, and you should not be a  distraction. Since you have not withdrawn your nomination, I urge my  colleagues to do the right thing and oppose this controversial  nomination.   I yield the floor to my colleague from Hawaii.
