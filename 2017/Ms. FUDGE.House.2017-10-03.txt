 Mr. Speaker, let me first begin by thanking my friend and  colleague Rep. Bennie Thompson for leading today's effort in honoring  the life and legacy of Fannie Lou Hamer. October 6th marks the 100th  anniversary of her birth in Montgomery County, Mississippi.   An honorary member of Delta Sigma Theta, Fannie Lou Hamer dedicated  her life to the fight for civil rights. Born in 1917, she was the  daughter of sharecroppers and the youngest of 20 siblings. By the age  of six, she was helping her family in the cotton fields.   Fannie Lou Hamer was a woman of courage. She used her voice to raise  awareness about the plight of African Americans in the Mississippi  Delta. She was a woman of strength who was able to channel the  injustices committed against her into activism.   Working for the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, Hamer  helped African Americans register to vote and worked to end  segregation.   After attempting to register to vote herself in August 1962, Hamer  lost her job and was kicked out of her home. The following year, she  and fellow activists returning from a training workshop were unjustly  jailed and severely beaten. While the beating left permanent damage,  the officers were later acquitted by an all-white jury.   Hamer was also a trailblazing political activist. She helped to found  the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party and the National Women's  Political Caucus. She almost derailed the re-election of President  Lyndon Johnson and changed the Democratic Party's delegate selection  process. In 1968, she would become the first African American to serve  as an official delegate at a national-party convention since  Reconstruction and the first woman ever from Mississippi.   Although unsuccessful in her bids for elected office, Hamer remained  committed to voting rights and antipoverty efforts. She filed a lawsuit  to push forward desegregation efforts in local schools, led the cotton  pickers resistance movement and helped to bring a Head Start program to  her community.   Fannie Lou Hamer's contributions to the American Civil Rights  movement and our nation are undeniable. As then UN Ambassador Andrew  Young eulogized at her funeral, ``None of us would be where we are now  had she not been there then.'' His words still ring true 40 years  later.
