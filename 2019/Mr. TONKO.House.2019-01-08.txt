 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Chemical Facility Anti- Terrorism Standards Program Extension Act. This bipartisan bill is  supported by the full committee and relevant subcommittee chairs and  ranking members of the Committee on Energy and Commerce and the  Committee on Homeland Security.   The Department of Homeland Security's Chemical Facility Anti- Terrorism Standards, or CFATS, program is an important part of our  Nation's counterterrorism efforts to secure high-risk chemical  facilities.   The program was created in 2006 and it had its first long-term  reauthorization in 2014. Unfortunately, without further congressional  action, CFATS will terminate later this month.   The bill before us would grant a clean, 2-year extension of the  program. I believe this will give the new Congress ample time to  continue program oversight and make any reforms necessary for the next  long-term extension.   For one, I strongly believe we should be looking at all aspects of  risks at chemical facilities, not just terrorism. Chemical fires,  explosions, and releases can have serious consequences, regardless of  whether an incident was an accident, a natural disaster, or an act of  terrorism. A holistic approach to chemical risks, which obviously  includes security, should also account for workers and communities'  safety and facilities' resilience.   Recent natural disasters have exposed previously unaccounted for  vulnerabilities at some facilities. During Hurricane Harvey, we saw the  potential for devastation, when a power outage and equipment failure  led to a significant chemical fire at the Arkema facility in Crosby,  Texas.    Ensuring that these critical sites are resilient to risks associated  with climate change and extreme weather events will be critical for the  long-term safety and security of not only the sites, but also  surrounding communities.   I want to recognize the efforts of Jacqueline Cohen and other members  of the Energy and Commerce Committee Democratic staff for their work on  this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 251, and I hope we  can continue bipartisan efforts to improve the program as we work  toward a long-term reauthorization in the 116th Congress.    Madam Speaker, I rise to congratulate Luigi Battaglioli, a  visionary senior at Burnt Hills-Ballston Lake High School, whose app  was recently selected as the winner of the 2018 Congressional App  Challenge for New York's 20th Congressional District.   Luigi's submission stood out in an impressive field from students  across our district. His app, CodeGeek.org, is an online classroom that  teaches novice students how to code through video lessons, educational  texts, and challenge assignments.   Growing a modern, sustainable, and competitive economy requires  exceptional STEM training and education. Luigi's commitment to making  coding accessible to anyone on the internet truly embodies the spirit  of the Congressional App Challenge. He has earned the pride and praise  of our entire capital region community. May his work inspire others to  share his passion in the coming year and beyond.                            ____________________
