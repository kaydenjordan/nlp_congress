 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to honor the life of Tim  Staples, a devoted husband, brother, son, and teacher. Tim gave his  life working to save the life of another.   As a volunteer for search and rescue team of the San Bernardino  County Sheriff's Department, Tim joined the search for a missing hiker  last month on California's Mount Baldy. Tragically, this would be Tim's  final rescue operation.   Despite the risks, Tim's endless dedication to serving others guided  him through 9 years as a volunteer with the search and rescue team,  where he assisted countless operations to help save the lives of fellow  San Bernardino County residents.   But his passion for search and rescue was not the extent of Tim's  desire to serve his community. Tim's desire to serve the community  spanned across education and community and civic activities.   He grew up in San Bernardino County, attending Damien High School in  La Verne before getting his college education at Gonzaga University in  Spokane, Washington.   Tim was a Cub Scout and Boy Scout before becoming an Eagle Scout. He  completed the Buckskin Leadership training and dedicated his time to  training other Scouts.   Tim was an educator, spending his career as a teacher and coach at  both St. Lucy's High School in Glendora and at his alma mater in  Damien.   He is remembered by his family and friends for his love of helping  others and often helping complete strangers. From stopping traffic to  help push a car through a crowded intersection to driving over 2,000  miles to help a friend move, Tim was always willing to put his full  energy and effort behind helping other people, including on his last  day.   He is survived by his two sisters, his parents, and his loving wife,  Katie.   Tim's students, athletes, friends, family, and all of San Bernardino  County are better off as the result of Tim's endless compassion and  drive to serve others.                            ____________________
