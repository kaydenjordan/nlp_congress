 Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I thank my dear friend from the  Commonwealth of Kentucky, a stalwart when it comes to freedom, a  champion of free people, free States, and free markets. And I  appreciate my dear friend for hosting this very important and timely  discussion to articulate the virtue and the values of freedom.   It is hard to believe we can stand in this great Chamber with any  need to distinguish between a free system and a free country and what  happens when you lose those freedoms.                                time  1845    America is the most powerful, most prosperous, and most generous  nation in the world, and it is because America is the freest nation in  the history of the world and on the face of the planet. The quickest  way for America to lose her shine, her brilliance, her exceptionalism  is for her to lose her freedoms.   Mr. Speaker, when our Founding Fathers were framing the more perfect  [[Page H10011]]  union, they made the central determination that our constitutional  Republic would limit the Federal Government's role in our lives. They  believed that if they limited government, they would unleash the  limitless potential of the American people, free people created in the  image of God.   While we recognize the challenges of our fallen human condition in  any system of government, nothing has been a greater force for good,  save and except the love of God, than freedom. Indeed, nothing has  elevated and empowered the human spirit in this country and across the  globe like the free enterprise system. Over the course of the 20th  century, we can see the profound impact of free markets on the lives of  Americans.   In 1900, the average life expectancy of Americans was 47 years. By  the end of the century, it was 78 years.   At the beginning of the 20th century, 56 percent of American families  were considered poor, but by 1967, before the expansion of the American  welfare state through the Great Society programs, the number of  American families considered poor was only 13 percent.   I would also insert there that we have spent trillions of dollars  since the advent of Big Government welfare programs, well-intended, of  course, over $20 trillion since the 1960s. We spend 16 times today what  we spent in the 1960s on welfare programs, and we haven't moved the  needle a bit. The poverty rate is the same.   If we look at the 20th century alone, we can see that free markets  have given Americans the most opportunities, the highest standard of  living, and the best quality of life anywhere in the world.   Contrast this with Venezuela, previously one of the wealthiest  nations in the hemisphere, blessed with an abundance of oil and gas  reserves, which is the basis of their economic prosperity. Today, 82  percent of Venezuelans live in poverty, thanks to the legacy of  socialist policies implemented by the late dictator Hugo Chavez and his  successor Nicolas Maduro.   Contrast that with what we have been doing recently with President  Trump over the last few years and in my first term in the 115th  Congress. We have promoted freedom, freer markets, and fairer trade. We  have put in place progrowth, free market policies that have unleashed  even greater economic potential of these United States. We have seen  historic unemployment rates, historic wage increases. We have seen  trillions of dollars in wealth created in the stock markets for those  who need pensions and 401(k)'s, for folks saving for retirement.   The list is long, but the message is that if you get off the backs  and out of the way of our entrepreneurs, our innovators, our risk- takers, they will do what they do best, and that is create  opportunities.   But all of these opportunities, this record growth, and these  benefits for American families are at risk. Our country, my dear  friend, Mr. Barr, is at an ideological inflection point. We can  continue to build on the success and prosperity from free markets, or  we can go down the road to serfdom that you mentioned.   I don't think we need to look any further than the poll that Mr.  Johnson mentioned where 7 in 10 millennials are ``somewhat or extremely  likely to vote for a socialist candidate.'' Eighty million strong, and  70 percent of the generation that will make up the largest voting bloc  in the next election is leaning toward voting for a socialist, not in  Cuba or in Venezuela, right here in the United States of America.   John Adams told us: You will never know how much it cost my  generation to preserve your freedom. I hope you will make good use of  it.   Folks, right now, we are in grave danger of forsaking the freedoms  for which our Founders fought if we go down this ruinous road of  socialism. The choice we make as Americans will determine our Nation's  identity for the remainder of the 21st century. It is a choice between  whether our future will be forged by freedom and faith both in God and  in our founding principles, or whether we are going to submit to the  rise of socialism and the tyranny of Big Government.   We have to be vigilant and do everything in our power to ensure the  arc of the future bends toward freedom, not government control over  every aspect of our lives. Only if we do this, only if we protect these  precious freedoms, will we give our children and grandchildren the  freedoms and opportunities that every generation of Americans has  enjoyed.   I thank Mr. Barr for the opportunity to join in this Special Order. I  thank him for his intentionality to bring this topic for discussion and  for including me.
