 The campaign this time around, if       foreigners, if Russia and China, if someone else offers       information on an opponent, should they accept it or should       they call the FBI?        President TRUMP. I think maybe they do both. I think you       might want to listen. There is nothing wrong with listening.       If somebody called from a country--Norway: We have       information on your opponent--I think I would want to hear       it.         You want that kind of interference in       our elections?        President TRUMP. It's not an interference. They have       information. I think I would take it.        Unidentified SPEAKER. Let's move to the third excerpt there       related to Vice President Biden, and it says, ``The other       thing, there's a lot of talk about Biden's son--'' this is       President Trump speaking--``that Biden stopped the       prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that       so that whatever you can do with the Attorney General would       be great. Biden went around bragging that he stopped the       prosecution so if you can look into it . . . It sounds       horrible to me.''        President TRUMP. Well, I would think that if they were       honest about it, they'd start a major investigation into the       Bidens. It's a very simple answer.        President TRUMP. If we feel there is corruption, like I       feel there was in the 2016 campaign, there was tremendous       corruption against me--if we feel there's corruption, we have       a right to go to a foreign country.        President TRUMP. And by the way, likewise, China should       start an investigation into the Bidens because what happened       in China is just about as bad as what happened with--with       Ukraine.    Mr. Manager CROW. The American people deserve to know what happened.  [[Page S698]]  The American people deserve to know when they go to bed tonight that  there is a President that has their interests in mind, that will put  the national security of the country above his own political self- interest. The American people deserve answers. And, yes, it is still a  good time to call Ambassador Bolton to testify.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, Mr. Manager.   The Senator from Ohio.
