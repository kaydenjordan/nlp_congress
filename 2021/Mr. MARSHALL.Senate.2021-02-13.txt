 Mr. President, point of order. Can you read the motion  back to us?   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Points of order and debate are not allowed  during the vote. That is established Senate procedure, and we always  follow that.   On the question of whether it shall be in order to consider and  debate, under the rules of impeachment, any motion to subpoena  witnesses and documents, the motion is agreed to by a vote of 55 to 45.   The majority leader.
