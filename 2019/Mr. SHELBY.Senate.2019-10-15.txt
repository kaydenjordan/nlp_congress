 Madam President, today I wish to honor the  retirement of Perry Hand, an Alabama native, from Volkert, Inc. Perry  is a recognized leader in the engineering field with nearly 50 years of  experience in the industry. He has provided decades of service to  improve the quality of life in his community and across the State of  Alabama.   Mr. Perry Hand previously served as senior vice president and chief  marketing officer at Volkert in Mobile, AL. He was appointed president,  chief executive officer, and chairman of the board in 2011. In 2018,  Mr. Hand appointed a new president and CEO to the company, and he  retained the role of chairman. Prior to his work with Volkert, Perry  served as Alabama's highway director, Alabama's secretary of state, and  a two-term State senator. He also founded Perry Hand & Associates, Inc.   Perry has earned many recognitions throughout his career, among them  are his induction into the Alabama Construction Hall of Fame, the  Alabama Engineering Hall of Fame, earning the Chairman's Award at  Volkert, multiple Auburn University awards, and many more. He earned  his bachelor's degree  [[Page S5789]]  in civil engineering from Auburn University and holds an honorary  doctorate from Lincoln Memorial University in Tennessee.   What is truly remarkable are Perry Hand's many accomplishments and  contributions to the State. I am proud to take this time to recognize  him for his service at Volkert, which has greatly benefitted the people  of Alabama. His achievements and dedication to advancing the industry  have not gone unnoticed. I join Perry's friends, family, and colleagues  in wishing him the best of luck as he transitions into a new chapter of  his life, and I thank him for his commitment to Alabama.                            ____________________
