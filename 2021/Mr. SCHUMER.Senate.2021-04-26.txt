 Madam President, I thank my good friend--our Senate pro  tempore, our chairman of Appropriations, our longtime chairman and  ranking member of the Judiciary, who has done a lot on patent work, et  cetera--for his graciousness.    Madam President, I move to proceed to legislative  session.    Madam President, I move to proceed to executive session  to consider Calendar No. 61.    Madam President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  mandatory quorum call for the cloture motion filed today, April 26, be  waived.    I yield the floor and once again thank my friend from  Vermont.
