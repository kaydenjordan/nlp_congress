This proposed sale will support the foreign policy and       national security objectives of the United States. Australia       is one of our most important allies in the Western Pacific.       The strategic location of this political and economic power       contributes significantly to ensuring peace and economic       stability in the region. It is vital to the U.S. national       interest to assist our ally in developing and maintaining a       strong and ready self-defense capability.        The proposed sale will continue Australia's capability to       interoperate with U.S. forces by maintaining alignment with       the U.S. Navy's MH-60R program and maintain mission readiness       to deter regional threats and strengthen its homeland       defense.

The       production of the conversion kits has experienced material       cost increases, obsolescence, hardware failures, and hardware       rework, which have delayed delivery to Canada. The estimated       total MDE value will remain $25 million. The non-MDE value       will increase by $48 million, resulting in a new estimated       total value of $89 million.        (iv) Significance: This notification is being provided as       the pricing for the original notification was outdated and       requires an increase. Additional funding is required to       provide technical support throughout the entire delivery       schedule.        (v) Justification: This proposed sale will support the       foreign policy and national security objectives of the United       States by helping to improve the military capability of       Canada, a NATO ally that is an important force for ensuring       political stability and economic progress, and a contributor       to military, peacekeeping and humanitarian operations around       the world.

POLICY JUSTIFICATION           Finland--Guided Multiple Launch Rocket Systems (GMLRS)         The Government of Finland has requested to buy one hundred       fifty (150) M30A1 Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System       (GMLRS) Alternative Warhead (AW) (Steel Case), or M30A2       Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System (GMLRS) Alternative       Warhead (AW) Missile Pods with Insensitive Munitions       Propulsion System (IMPS), or a combination of both; and two       hundred fifty (250) M31A1 GMLRS Unitary (GMLRS-U) Warhead       (Steel Case), or M31A2 GMLRS-U IMPS, or a combination of       both. Also included is a Quality Assurance Team (QAT);       transportation services; and other related elements of       program and logistics support. The total estimated cost is       $535 million.        This proposed sale will support the foreign policy and       national security of the United States by improving the       security of a trusted partner, which is an important force       for political stability and economic progress in Europe. It       is vital to the U.S. national interest to assist Finland in       developing and maintaining a strong and ready self-defense       capability.        Finland intends to use these defense articles and services       to increase its national stock, bolstering the land and air       defense capabilities in Europe's northern flank. The       increased national stock is critical to Finland's defense and       deterrence due to the deteriorated security situation in       Europe. Finland will have no difficulty absorbing this       equipment into its armed forces.        The proposed sale of this equipment and support will not       alter the basic military balance in the region.        The principal contractors will be Lockheed Martin Corp,       Missile and Fire Control, Grand Prairie, TX. There are no       known offset agreements in connection with this potential       sale. There is a request pending for diversion of 50% of this       procurement from U.S. stock. That final decision will       determine which version GMLRS could potentially be procured.        Implementation of this proposed sale will not require the       assignment of U.S. Government or contractor representatives       to Finland.        There will be no adverse impact on U.S. defense readiness       as a result of this proposed sale.                            Transmittal No. 22-61       Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of Offer Pursuant to           Section 36(b)(1) of the Arms Export Control Act                             Annex Item No. vii         (vii) Sensitivity of Technology:        1. The M30A2 GMLRS-Alternative Warhead (AW) is a Department       of Defense Cluster Munitions Policy compliant area       suppression munition. The AW carries a 200-pound       fragmentation assembly filled with high explosives which,       upon detonation, accelerates two layers of preformed       penetrators optimized for effectiveness against large area       and imprecisely located targets. The M30A2 is a material       change to the M30A1 GMLRS AW, incorporating the Insensitive       Munition Propulsion System (IMPS) complaint motor. The IMPS       motor minimizes the probability of inadvertent initiation and       severity of collateral damage when subjected to damage,       enhances survivability of launch systems and reduces risk of       injury to personnel. The M30A2 shares a greater than 90%       commonality with the M30A1. Commonalities include the Global       Positioning System/Precise Positioning Service (GPS/PPS)       aided inertial guidance and control systems, fuzing       mechanisms, and multi-option height of burst fuze  [[Page S6653]]       capability. They have an identical range of 70km + and a       minimum range of 15km.        2. The M31A2 GMLRS Unitary Warhead is the Army's primary       munition for the M142 HIMARS and M270A1/M270A2 Multiple       Launcher Rocket System (MLRS) Launchers. The M31A2 Unitary is       a material change to the M31A1 Unitary incorporating the       Insensitive Munition Propulsion System (IMPS) complaint       motor. The IMPS motor minimizes the probability of       inadvertent initiation and severity of collateral damage when       subjected to damage, enhances survivability of launch systems       and reduces risk of injury to personnel. The M31A2 shares the       same Global Positioning System/Precise Positioning Service       (GPS/PPS) aided inertial guidance and control systems, fuzing       mechanisms, and multi-mode fuzing capability. They have an       identical range of 70km + and a minimum range of 15km.        3. The highest level of classification of defense articles,       components, and services included in this potential sale is       SECRET.        4. If a technologically advanced adversary were to obtain       knowledge of the specific hardware and software elements, the       information could be used to develop countermeasures that       might reduce weapon system effectiveness or be used in the       development of a system with similar or advanced       capabilities.        5. A determination has been made that Finland can provide       substantially the same degree of protection for the sensitive       technology being released as the U.S. Government. This sale       is necessary in furtherance of the U.S. foreign policy and       national security objectives outlined in the Policy       Justification.        6. All defense articles and services listed in this       transmittal have been authorized for release and export to       the Government of Finland.                            ____________________     Mr. President, section 36(b) of the Arms Export Control  Act requires that Congress receive prior notification of certain  proposed arms sales as defined by that statute.

Six (6) contractors would be deployed to Kuwait for       approximately three (3) years for follow-on support of       equipment.        There will be no adverse impact on U.S. defense readiness       as a result of this proposed sale.                            Transmittal No. 22-52       Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of Offer Pursuant to           Section 36(b)(1) of the Arms Export Control Act                             Annex Item No. vii         (vii) Sensitivity of Technology:        1. National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile System (NASAMS)       Medium Range Air Defense System (MRADS) Description. This is       a System of Systems (SOS) consisting of the Sentinel Radar,       the Fire Distribution Center (FDC), the AIM-120 Advanced       Medium Range Air-to-Air Missile (AMRAAM), the AIM-120       Extended Range Missile (AMRAAM-ER), and the AIM-9X Missile.       The NASAMS MRADS is designed for mid-range air defense and       can be deployed to engage fixed wing and rotary wing       aircraft, cruise missiles, and unmanned aerial vehicles       (UAVs). The NASAMS MRADS is not a Program of Record (POR) for       the U.S. Department of Defense, but the SOS architecture does       consist of several PORs: the U.S. Army's AN/MPQ-64 Sentinel       radar, the U.S. Air Force's AIM-120 AMRAAM missile, and the       U.S. Navy's AIM-9X Missile. The NASAMS is comprised of both       U.S.- and Norwegian-manufactured components. Norwegian       components will be procured by the Raytheon Company.       Norwegian involvement will be managed by Raytheon using       export authorizations received from the U.S. Department of       State.        2. NASAMS Fire Unit (FU). Consists of one fire distribution       center (FDC), one AN/MPQ-64F1 surveillance, acquisition, and       tracking radar, 3 truck-mounted Canister Launchers (LCHR),       and the High Mobility Launcher (HML) with 6 AMRAAM missiles       each.        3. Fire Distribution Center (FDC). The command & control       entity, FDC, is the major operator interface in NASAMS. It       provides all command and control functionality necessary to       effectively conduct Air Defense missions; both in a stand-      alone (autonomous) configuration as well as in a netted       configuration integrated to other units. The FDC interfaces       and controls the MPQ-64F1 Sentinel radar and the Canister and       High Mobility-Launchers. The FDC also interfaces (voice and       data) to the national command and control structure.        4. AN/MPQ-64F1 Sentinel Radar. This is the organic mobile       Air Defense acquisition and tracking sensor for the United       States Army. Sentinel provides persistent air surveillance       and fire control quality data through command and control       systems to defeat Unmanned Aerial System (UAS), cruise       missiles, and fixed-wind and rotary-wing aircraft threats.        5. AIM-120C-8 Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missile       (AMRAAM). This is a supersonic, air-launched, aerial       intercept, guided missile featuring digital technology and       micro-miniature solid-state electronics. AMRAAM capabilities       include look-down/shoot-down, multiple launches against       multiple targets, resistance to electronic countermeasures,       and interception of high- and low-flying and maneuvering       targets. State-of-the-art technology is used in the missile       to provide it with beyond-visual-range capability. Although       designed as an air-to-air missile, the AMRAAM can also be       employed in a surface-launch mode when integrated on systems       such as NASAMS.        a. The AIM-120C-8 AMRAAM-Extended Range (ER) has the same       capability as the AMRAAM, but with a larger rocket motor and       control section to allow it to travel further.        b. The potential sale will include Captive Air Training       Missiles (CATM) and AMRAAM Guidance Sections.        6. Canister Launcher (CLS). Purpose is to transport, aim,       and fire the U.S. Air Force AMRAAM, AMRAAM-ER, and the US       Navy AIM-9X Sidewinder missiles. Under the remote control of       the Fire Distribution Center (FDC), the launcher permits       rapid launching of one or more missiles against single or       multiple targets and can support 6 engagements       simultaneously. The launcher provides 360-degree, all       weather, day and night, missile launch capability.  [[Page S6656]]             7. AIM 9X Sidewinder Block II Tactical Missiles. The       missile includes a high off-boresight seeker, enhanced       countermeasure rejection capability, low drag/high angle of       attack airframe and the ability to integrate the Helmet       Mounted Cueing System.        8. Multifunction Information Distribution System--Low       Volume Terminal Block Upgrade 2 (MIDS LVT BU2). The MIDS LVT       BU2 is a secure data and voice communication network using       the Link-16 architecture; the MIDS LVT Cryptographic Modules       (LCM) are the Communications Security (COMSEC) portion of the       MIDS LVT BU2 system. The system provides enhanced situational       awareness, positive identification of participants within the       network, and secure voice capability. The system provides the       critical ground link for simultaneous coordination of air,       land, and maritime forces.        9. The highest level of classification of defense articles,       components, and services included in this potential sale is       SECRET.        10. If a technologically advanced adversary were to obtain       knowledge of the specific hardware and software elements, the       information could be used to develop countermeasures that       might reduce weapon system effectiveness or be used in the       development of a system with similar or advanced       capabilities.        11. A determination has been made that the Government of       Kuwait can provide substantially the same degree of       protection for the sensitive technology being released as the       U.S. Government. This sale is necessary in furtherance of the       U.S. foreign policy and national security objectives outlined       in the Policy Justification.        12. All defense articles and services listed in this       transmittal have been authorized for release and export to       the Government of Kuwait.                            ____________________     Mr. President, section 36(b) of the Arms Export Control  Act requires that Congress receive prior notification of certain  proposed arms sales as defined by that statute.

(viii) Date Report Delivered to Congress: November 9, 2022.        * As defined in Section 47(6) of the Arms Export Control       Act.                             POLICY JUSTIFICATION       Lithuania--M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS)         The Government of Lithuania has requested to buy eight (8)       M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS)       Launchers; thirty-six (36) M30A2 Guided Multiple Launch       Rocket System (GMLRS) Alternative Warhead (AW) Missile Pods       with Insensitive Munitions Propulsion System (IMPS); thirty-      six (36) M31A2 GMLRS Unitary High Explosive (HE) Missile       Pods; thirty-six (36) XM403 Extended Range GMLRS (ER GMLRS)       Alternative Warhead (AW) Missile Pods with IMPS; thirty-six       (36) XM404 Extended Range GMLRS (ER GMLRS) Unitary Pods with       IMPS; and eighteen (18) M57 Army Tactical Missile System       (ATACMS) Missile Pods. Also included are M28A2 Low Cost       Reduced Range Practice Rocket (LCRRPR) pods; International       Field Artillery Tactical Data System (IFATDS); battle       management system Vehicle Integration Kits; ruggedized       laptops; training equipment publications for HIMARS and       munitions; and other related elements of program and       logistics support. The total estimated cost is $495 million.        This proposed sale will support the foreign policy and       national security objectives of the United States by helping       to improve the military capability of a NATO Ally that is an       important force for ensuring political stability and economic       progress within Eastern Europe.        The proposed sale will contribute to Lithuania's military       goals of updating its capability while further enhancing       interoperability with the United States and other allies.       Lithuania intends to use these defense articles and services       to modernize its armed forces and expand its capability to       strengthen its homeland defense and deter regional threats.       Lithuania will have no difficulty absorbing this equipment       into its armed forces.        The proposed sale of this equipment and support will not       alter the basic military balance in the region.        The principal contractor will be Lockheed Martin, Grand       Prairie, TX. There are no known offset agreements proposed in       connection with this potential sale.        Implementation of this proposed sale will require U.S.       Government or contractor representatives to travel to       Lithuania for program management reviews to support the       program. Travel is expected to occur approximately twice per       year as needed to support equipment fielding and training.        There will be no adverse impact on U.S. defense readiness       as a result of this proposed sale.                            Transmittal No. 22-60       Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of Offer Pursuant to           Section 36(b)(1) of the Arms Export Control Act, as           amended        (vii) Sensitivity of Technology:        1. The M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS)       is a C-130 transportable wheeled launcher mounted on a 5-ton       Family of Medium Tactical Vehicles truck chassis. HIMARS is       the modern Army-fielded version of the M270 Multiple Launch       Rocket System (MLRS) launcher, and can fire all of the MLRS       Family of Munitions/Missiles (FOM) that includes Guided       Multiple Launch Rocket System (GMLRS), Extended Range GMLRS,       and the Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS). Utilizing the       FOM, the HIMARS can engage targets between 15 and 300       kilometers with Global Positioning System/Precise Positioning       Service (GPS/PPS)-aided precision accuracy.        2. The GMLRS M31A2 Unitary is the Army's primary munition       for units fielding the M142 HIMARS and M270Al MLRS Launchers.       The M31A2 Unitary is a solid propellant artillery rocket that       uses GPS/PPS-aided inertial guidance to accurately and       quickly deliver a single high-explosive blast fragmentation       warhead to targets at ranges from 15-70 kilometers. The       rockets are fired from a launch pod container that also       serves as the storage and transportation container for the       rockets. Each rocket pod holds six (6) total rockets.        3. The M30A2 GMLRS AW shares a greater than 90% commonality       with the M31A1/A2 Unitary. The primary difference between the       GMLRS Unitary and GMLRS AW is the replacement of the Unitary       high explosive warhead with a 200-pound fragmentation warhead       of pre-formed tungsten penetrators which is optimized for       effectiveness against a large area and imprecisely located       targets. The munitions otherwise share a common motor, GPS/      PPS-aided inertial guidance and control system, a multi-      option fuzing height of burst capability, and effective range       of 15-70 km.  [[Page S6657]]             4. The M57 ATACMS Unitary is a conventional, semi-ballistic       missile that utilizes a 500-pound high explosive warhead. It       has an effective range of between 70 and 300 kilometers, and       has increased lethality and accuracy over previous versions       of the ATACMS due to a GPS/Precise Position System (PPS)       aided navigation system.        5. The ER GMLRS missiles provide a persistent, responsive,       all-weather, rapidly deployed, long range, surface-to-      surface, area- and point-precision strike capability. The       XM403 Alternative Warhead (AW), like GMLRS M30A1/A2, carries       a 200-pound fragmentation assembly filled with high       explosives which, upon detonation, accelerates two layers of       preformed penetrators optimized for effectiveness against       large area and imprecisely located targets. The XM404       Unitary, like GMLRS M31A1/A2, has a 200-pound class unitary       with a steel blast-fragmentation case, designed for low       collateral damage against point targets. Both variants of the       ER GMLRS missiles maintain the accuracy and effectiveness       demonstrated by the baseline GMLRS out to a maximum range of       150 km (double that of the GMLRS capability).        6. The highest level of classification of defense articles,       components, and services included in this potential sale is       SECRET.        7. If a technologically advanced adversary were to obtain       knowledge of the specific hardware and software elements, the       information could be used to develop countermeasures that       might reduce weapon system effectiveness or be used in the       development of a system with similar or advanced       capabilities.        8. A determination has been made that Lithuania can provide       substantially the same degree of protection for the sensitive       technology being released as the U.S. Government. This sale       is necessary in furtherance of the U.S. foreign policy and       national security objectives outlined in the Policy       Justification.        9. All defense articles and services listed in this       transmittal have been authorized for release and export to       the Government of Lithuania.                            ____________________     Mr. President, section 36(b) of the Arms Export Control  Act requires that Congress receive prior notification of certain  proposed arms sales as defined by that statute. Upon such notification,  the Congress has 30 calendar days during which the sale may be  reviewed.
