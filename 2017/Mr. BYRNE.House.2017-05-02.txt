 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember the life of a true  American hero, a dedicated veteran, and a successful businessman.   Major John Jacobson enlisted in the U.S. Army in 1940 and fought in  World War II, where he served as quartermaster to General George  Patton.   After his military career, he moved to Kansas and built a Fortune 500  company and became a leader in the meat-packing industry.   After retiring and moving to coastal Alabama in 1999, Major Jacobson  became a local celebrity. Mr. Jack, as he was affectionately known,  spent much of his time working with local veterans organizations where  he would speak with school groups about World War II and the sacrifice  our veterans make.   Sadly, he recently passed away at the age of 106, making him one of  the country's oldest World War II veterans.   Mr. Speaker, all you need to know about Major Jacobson is that he  lived his life by a simple motto: Another day to live is another day to  serve.   To his family, thank you for sharing Mr. Jack with all of us. He made  our community, the United States, and the world a better place.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, by direction of the House Republican  Conference, I offer a privileged resolution and ask for its immediate  consideration.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Alabama is recognized for  1 hour.    Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the  customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Polis),  pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During  consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose  of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the  customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Polis),  pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During  consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose  of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Alabama?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 299 provides for the  consideration of H.R. 1180, the Working Families Flexibility Act. This  resolution provides for a closed rule since no amendments were  submitted to the Rules Committee.   Mr. Speaker, the workforce of the 21st century is a lot different  from the workforce of the thirties and forties when many of our  Nation's labor laws were first written. As such, many of these laws are  outdated and out of touch with the realities facing today's workers.   For example, in nearly half of two-parent households, both Mom and  Dad work full time. That is up from roughly 30 percent in 1970.  Meanwhile, millennials now represent the majority of the workforce.   Given the changes in the workforce, there are new challenges related  to the work-family balance. From children's field trips, to taking care  of an elderly family member, to a single parent juggling different  tasks while their spouse is on a military deployment, the demands are  greater than ever. That is where the Working Families Flexibility Act  comes in.   This commonsense bill would improve the quality of life for many  hardworking men and women by removing outdated Federal restrictions  imposed solely on the private sector.   Already, workers in the public sector at the Federal, State, and  local level have the ability to take comp time in lieu of overtime pay  if they prefer. This bill would give that same option to workers in the  private sector.   Here is how it would work. An employee and their employer would come  together and mutually agree to enter an arrangement where the employee  would receive time and a half in time off or comp time instead of time- and-a-half overtime pay. In other words, employees would have the  choice between paid time off and cash wages for working overtime.   As I mentioned, this provision is already available for workers in  the public sector. That is because, in 1985, Congress amended the Fair  Labor Standards Act to give public sector employees greater  flexibility. In fact, in a report filed by the House Education and the  Workforce Committee more than 30 years ago, our Democratic colleagues  wrote that this change in law recognized the ``mutual benefits'' of  comp time for State and local governments and outlined the ``freedom  and flexibility'' comp time would offer public sector workers.   Shouldn't workers in the private sector be entitled to the same  freedom and flexibility given to government workers?   Now, I know some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle will  say this bill is somehow bad for workers. That could not be further  from the truth. Let me clear up some of the false information put out  by union bosses and special interest groups.   First, this proposal is completely voluntary. Both an employee and an  employer would have to agree to a comp time agreement, and their  agreement would have to be put in writing.   Second, no employer can coerce or intimidate their employees into  taking comp time. An employee who feels they have been mistreated can  file a charge with the Department of Labor, at no cost, or they can  bring their own legal action. Employers who take advantage of their  employees would face the same penalties as they would for other wage  violations.   Now, as a labor and employment attorney, I have been a part of these  kind of legal matters in the past, and I can honestly say that no  sensible employer would take advantage of an employee and risk double  damages, exorbitant attorney fees, and a legal battle with the Federal  Government.   Third, employees have control over when to use their comp time, as  long as reasonable notice is given and the request doesn't unduly  disrupt the workplace. This is the same standard used in the public  sector, and it is the same standard used under the Family and Medical  Leave Act. I imagine it is also  [[Page H3014]]  the same standard used in each of our congressional offices.   Fourth, this bill includes a 5-year sunset that would require  Congress to come back and reaffirm this law after reviewing the impact  of comp time. This would give us the ability to change the law based on  the real-world impact.   Fifth, the bill would set the maximum comp time accrual amount at 160  hours, which is less than what is allowed in the public sector. This  provision was actually included after Democrats expressed concerns that  workers would accrue too much comp time.   Sixth, an employee has the right to cash out their comp time at any  time and for any reason. This is a decision that the employee alone can  make. Additionally, at the end of the year, employees would receive a  cash payment for any unused hours.   Finally, this is not a far-fetched or radical idea. In fact,  President Bill Clinton had his own comp time proposal during his  Presidency.   So this bill is great for workers and actually gives them greater  choice and flexibility in the workplace. In fact, our committee, the  Committee on Education and the Workforce, heard a real-life example of  how comp time would make life easier for families during a recent  hearing on the bill. We heard about a clerical worker for a mental  health company who recently found out she was pregnant and was putting  in a lot of overtime during a transition to a new computer system. This  mom-to-be simply wanted to waive the overtime pay and, instead, be  credited the time for maternity leave.   As her human resources professional testified: ``I had to explain to  her that we were unable to do so because it was against the law. It was  difficult conveying this message to this single mom-to-be who felt she  should be allowed the option to choose for herself whether to take the  overtime pay or paid leave when her child was born.''                                time  1245    That is why this bill is necessary, for people like this working mom.  That is how this bill will make a real difference.   Now, Mr. Speaker, I know comp time won't work for every worker or  family, so if an employee wants to continue receiving time-and-a-half  overtime pay, then they can continue to do so and this bill will have  no impact on them. But this bill would create a new option for  employees to better meet the needs of the 21st century workforce.  Workers today want and need the type of freedom and flexibility that  this bill provides. This bill would allow a working mom or dad to put  in a little extra time at work in order to have that time off to attend  a child's baseball game, dance recital, or field trip. This is all  about freedom, flexibility, fairness, and choice.   Certainly, more work and changes will be needed as we adapt to the  workforce of the 21st century, and I look forward to learning more  about proposals from my colleagues on the other side of the aisle. But  the simple fact that there are other proposals out there should not  stop us from passing this commonsense bill to give working families the  flexibility they need and deserve.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support House Resolution 299 and  the underlying bill.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, the gentleman referred to an old playbook being used  here. He is right. It is an old playbook. It is a playbook that was  used by House Democrats in 1985, by President Bill Clinton during the  1990s. This is not a partisan playbook. This is actually--or used to  be, actually--a bipartisan idea to give workers flexibility in the use  of their time. That doesn't sound radical to me. It is not radical at  all.   What has changed is Democrats used to be for this, and now, for  whatever reason, they are not. They would rather lock workers into  these restrictive arrangements where you have working mothers, like the  one I used in my initial remarks, who can't get their flexible time off  that they want because we do not allow them to do that under the  Federal Labor Standards Act.   Comp time is just not technically optional, as my friend said, under  this  [[Page H3016]]  law. It is optional by law. It is a voluntary thing by law. There is no  question about that. Employers cannot coerce or intimidate an employee  to do that under this law. It is strictly prohibited, and there are  serious legal repercussions for an employer who attempts to do that.   There are no differences in the protections for someone under this  bill and the protections that public employees have when they seek to  have this sort of flextime under the laws that pertain to them. It is  the same protection. So it doesn't matter whether you are in the  private sector or the public sector; under this bill, you are going to  be protected.                                time  1300    Let me tell you something, as someone who has practiced in this area.  It is not an idle threat to an employer to face a regulatory proceeding  from the Wage and Hour Division of the Department of Labor or to face a  private lawsuit. Those are a big deal. If you lose, you have to not  only pay double damages, you have got to pay the employees' attorneys  fees, which can be significant. No sensible employer is going to go out  there and intimidate and coerce and think they can get away with it.  They can't.   Wages, under our bankruptcy laws, are the first priority of what is  paid out during the winding up of a bankruptcy proceeding. Before any  other creditor is paid, wages get paid. In my experience, I don't  remember wages ever not being paid in a bankruptcy. That is always  assumed. They get taken care of quickly. Most employers do the right  thing.   My friend talked about employers needing to do the right thing. Most  employers do the right thing. Just like I know my colleague, when he  had a business in the private sector, did the right thing by his  employees. Most employers do. Yet too often in this body, we act as if  the assumption is that employers are going to do the wrong thing, and  then we come down with this heavy-handed overregulation, punitive  approach that restricts the freedom of both employers and--let's get  back to it--the workers themselves to work these things out.   This is a commonsense solution to a real problem in the new workplace  of the 21st century, where most moms and dads are working and where we  have this new millennial generation that wants flexibility. They expect  it. When you go to them and tell them: Oh, you can't have it because it  is a Federal law, they don't understand.   I have got to tell you, Mr. Speaker, I don't understand. Yes, I  understand that this law was put together in the 1930s. Maybe it made  sense for the workplace in the thirties, but it doesn't make sense for  the workplace of the 21st century.   I am disappointed in my colleagues who used to be in favor of these  sorts of flexible arrangements and no longer favor it, but I get that.  I hope that the rest of us will use our common sense and use what we  all know is really happening in the workplace today and support this  very important bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   My colleague from North Carolina and I worked together on many  things, and I have great respect for her, but I think her argument  ignores a very important fact about this bill, and that is that you  can't be coerced into doing this. You have to do it voluntarily.   If you would rather get your time and a half in pay, that is your  decision. You are going to get it. The law requires that. There is  nothing that forces anybody to get that.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I think my friends on the other side of the aisle don't  understand how this works. An employee comes to their supervisor or the  person who runs the HR office in the company and says: I would like to  get some comp time in return for the overtime I am getting ready to  work because I have got a specific reason to want to use it. The  employer says: Okay, when do you want to get the overtime and when do  you want to take the comp time? They work that out.   The employer has the responsibility for having the system and the  paperwork for showing that they have complied with the law. From an  employer's point of view, that is an extra burden. It is really not in  the interest of an employer to do this. An employer would really prefer  to say: Look, I don't want to have to do this, because if I make a  mistake, I am going to get in trouble with either a private lawsuit or  the Department of Labor. So it is really better for the employer not to  have this option because it is not going to be an option in which they  can make a mistake.   This is for that employee to get the comp time so they can have some  flexibility in their schedule. That is who it is for. If they don't  want to use it, they don't have to use it. They can still be paid the  time and a half that they are paid today. No one can coerce them. The  law says you can't do that, and there are real penalties for it.   To the contrary, when we are hearing that somehow this is something  for the employers, no, it is not. This is for the workers--the new  workers of the 21st century, who sometimes I think we have forgotten  about when we have these debates in this body.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I would say to my colleague and to the House, I did indeed have 11  townhalls 2 weeks ago after the bill he references passed. It didn't  come up one time because the American people understand what that was  all about, that there were two different Federal agencies battling over  something, and it didn't even solve the problem. The agency that put  that regulation out didn't have the authority to do it, and it didn't  solve the problem. The American people are sick and tired of agencies  that don't have the authority to go out there and they do something,  and it doesn't solve the problem.   If we want to get to the issue that my friend wants to get to, which  I think is important, we ought to get to, let's work together in a  bipartisan fashion and come up with a bipartisan, comprehensive bill  that addresses that. I would really like to be a part of that.   But that is not what we are here today about. We are here today about  this bill to provide flexibility to working people in the 21st century,  particularly millennials.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   I thank Congresswoman Roby for being the sponsor of this bill and  bringing it forward. As a young woman herself, she understands what's  going on in the workplace with people her age and how they try to  juggle all the demands of their time. She has come up with a very  commonsense approach to how we can deal with this in a way that makes  sense for everybody.   We just heard a lot about the labor movement and big bosses. I got  transported back in my mind. You would have thought we were in the  1930s and 1940s. I don't know if my colleague from Colorado has been  paying attention, but union membership is at its lowest level since the  1940s right now because, even after 8 years of the most pro-union  administration in decades, union membership continues to fall, and it  continues to fall because workers in America aren't buying what they  are selling because a lot of what they are selling is exactly what we  hear is the opposition to this bill, which is: Let's limit people;  let's restrict people; let's come up with all these things to tell them  what they can't do instead of telling them what they can.  [[Page H3019]]    What the American people want, what I heard in my townhall meetings,  they want the government off their back so that they can make their own  choices and live their lives the way they want to live them. This is  really true with the millennial generation.   I have four children who are adults right now. They are millennials.  They really want to have flexibility in their lives, and this bill,  Congresswoman Roby's bill, gets a little way toward that. I don't see  why we would be against trying to give not just young workers, but all  workers, that flexibility.   I have heard the arguments, and I have heard them several times now.  I have just got to tell you, they make no sense to me. Perhaps they are  something that made sense 50, 60, 70 years ago, but they don't make any  sense in 2017. It is a different time. It is a different day. Let's  give the workers of America some freedom and flexibility because that  is what they really want.   Mr. Speaker, I again urge my colleagues to support House Resolution  299 and the underlying bill.   The material previously referred to by Mr. Polis is as follows:             An Amendment to H. Res. 299 Offered by Mr. Polis          At the end of the resolution, add the following new       sections:        Sec. 6. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the       Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare       the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on       the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R.       1868) to provide that providers of broadband Internet access       service shall be subject to the privacy rules adopted by the       Federal Communications Commission on October 27, 2016. The       first reading of the bill shall be dispensed with. All points       of order against consideration of the bill are waived.       General debate shall be confined to the bill and shall not       exceed one hour equally divided and controlled by the chair       and ranking minority member of the Committee on Energy and       Commerce. After general debate the bill shall be considered       for amendment under the five-minute rule. All points of order       against provisions in the bill are waived. At the conclusion       of consideration of the bill for amendment the Committee       shall rise and report the bill to the House with such       .amendments as may have been adopted. The previous question       shall be considered as ordered on the bill and amendments       thereto to final passage without intervening motion except       one motion to recommit with or without instructions. If the       Committee of the Whole rises and reports that it has come to       no resolution on the bill, then on the next legislative day       the House shall, immediately after the third daily order of       business under clause 1 of rule XIV, resolve into the       Committee of the Whole for further consideration of the bill.        Sec. 7. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H.R. 1868.                                   ____           The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means         This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous       question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote.       A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote       against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow       the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a       vote about what the House should be debating.        Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of       Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the       previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or       control the consideration of the subject before the House       being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous       question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the       subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling       of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the       House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes       the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to       offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the       majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated       the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to       a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to       recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said:       ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman       from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to       yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first       recognition.''        The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous       question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an       immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no       substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.''       But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the       Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in       the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition,       page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous       question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally       not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member       controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of       offering an a amendment, the same result may be achieved by       voting down the previous question on the rule . . . When the       motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the       time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering       the previous question. That Member, because he then controls       the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for       the purpose of amendment.''        In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of       Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special       Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on       such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on       Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further       debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues:       ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a       resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control       shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous       question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who       controls the time for debate thereon.''        Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does       have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only       available tools for those who oppose the Republican       majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the       opportunity to offer an alternative plan.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I  move the previous question on the resolution.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on ordering the previous  question.   The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that  the ayes appeared to have it.
