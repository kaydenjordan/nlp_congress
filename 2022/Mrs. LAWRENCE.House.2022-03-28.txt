 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this  legislation to honor our U.S. Supreme Court Justices Ginsburg and  O'Connor with statues in our U.S. Capitol. I am so proud to hear my co- chair Lois Frankel talk about the importance of our history being  recognized in these hallowed Halls.   Both Justices O'Connor and Ginsburg did exactly that. They showed  what it meant to blaze trails and to break the glass ceilings as the  first and second women to serve on the Supreme Court, the highest  court.   Their story is an American story, and it is one that our country  should be proud of. It is not what you say, it is what you do, and  today we are taking action.   Through their long and legendary careers, they have paved the way for  countless women and girls in the legal and judiciary system. Their  life-changing words and actions will live in the hearts of Americans  across this country. I am grateful and I am excited to be part of the  Democratic Women's Caucus that is helping to lead this effort in  honoring the life and the legacies of these two giants.
