 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the 175th  anniversary of Dominican independence and the birth of the first  country I call home.   On February 27, 1844, the founding fathers of the Dominican  Republican, great statesmen and lovers of freedom and democracy, raised  the flag of a new republic in Santo Domingo and proclaimed their  independence from Haiti, bringing another democratic republic into the  family of nations.   In the words of Dominican icon and independence leader Juan Pablo  Duarte: ``Love of country led us to make sacred commitments with the  next generation,'' and the commitments that he and his fellow patriots  made 175 years ago live on in the hearts of every Quisqueyano, whether  they are still on the island of their birth or whether they have made a  new home abroad.   Today is the day for all of us to celebrate the contributions of the  Dominican people, just as my compatriots celebrate their independence  throughout the country.                            ____________________
