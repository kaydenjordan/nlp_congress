 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in memory of Jakelin Caal Maquin,  a 7-year-old Guatemalan girl, who died in December while in the custody  of our Federal Government.   Seven months ago, Jakelin joined her father in fleeing the extreme  danger and poverty of her village in Guatemala. They fled from  violence. However, Jakelin's life was cut short in December when she  died of sepsis while under the responsibility of our Federal  Government.   As a physician, I know that the inhumane conditions at our Border  Patrol facilities risk the lives of children when under CBP custody.  That is why, this week, I am introducing the Humanitarian Standards for  Individuals in CBP Act, legislation requiring CBP to meet the  humanitarian needs of children and families in their custody.   My bill will require health screenings and improved access to  lifesaving equipment and medications, and it will set minimum standards  to ensure access to food, water, and shelter.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this commonsense bill to  help prevent future deaths of children at the border and restore  humanity to our treatment of asylum seekers and families.                            ____________________
