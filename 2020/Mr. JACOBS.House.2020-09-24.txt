 Mr. Speaker, of the many excellent provisions in the  [[Page H4896]]  CARES Act, which was passed by this body, undoubtedly one of the most  successful was the PPP, the Paycheck Protection Program, which  literally helped thousands of small businesses and over 50 million jobs  be saved during the COVID pandemic.   The PPP was also successful because it partnered with the private  sector, utilizing local banks to disburse the PPP loans. Often these  banks already had existing relationships with the small businesses in  their communities. These existing relationships between banks and small  businesses were invaluable in getting these funds out onto the street  in record speed--again, saving thousands of businesses and millions of  jobs. In my district alone, PPP saved over 50,000 jobs.   It is due to the success of the PPP and the significant need for  additional PPP funds for small businesses around the Nation that I rise  in support of H.R. 8265, sponsored by Representative Chabot.   This is a very commonsense piece of legislation. You see, Mr.  Speaker, there are approximately $130 billion in unspent PPP funds.  This bill simply enables the Small Business Administration to do  another round of PPP awards. There is still incredible demand and need  for this program. So this is not an allocation of additional money.   As both sides debate a much larger and more complicated new stimulus  package, I think this bill is a great first step. It is a program that  has shown itself to be incredibly effective in saving jobs and small  businesses. There is most definitely more demand for PPP funds for the  small businesses and local nonprofits. The model of awarding the funds  has shown itself to be excellent. Finally, it doesn't require an  additional appropriation.   Mr. Speaker, our small businesses are fighting for their survival,  and millions of jobs hang in the balance. We can do this. This money is  there, and the program works.                            ____________________
