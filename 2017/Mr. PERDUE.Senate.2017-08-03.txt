 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Committee  on the Judiciary be discharged from further consideration of S. 765 and  the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Perdue  substitute amendment be considered and agreed to, the bill, as amended,  be considered read a third time and passed, and the motion to  reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table.    Mr. President, this legislation is important because it  will offer the Purple Heart the same types of legal protections  currently in place for the Medal of Honor and help put an end to  profiteering off of the sacrifice of our great American heroes.   I would like to thank those Senators who have cosponsored this bill,  as well, and the chairman and ranking member of the Judiciary Committee  for persisting to get this bill on the floor.   There is no higher honor that we have in the Senate than to honor our  veterans and the people who put their lives on the line every day for  their country.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that if the Senate  receives H.J. Res. 76 from the House, and if the text of H.J. Res. 76  is identical to the text at the desk, that the joint resolution be  considered passed, the preamble be considered agreed to, and the  motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with  no intervening action or debate.
