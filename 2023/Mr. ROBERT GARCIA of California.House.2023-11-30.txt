 Madam Speaker, I rise today to  acknowledge Jennifer Kumiyama, a talented performer, advocate, and  constituent from Long Beach, California.   I am so proud that she was cast as the voice of Dahlia in the new  Disney movie ``Wish.''   Jennifer was born with arthrogryposis and uses a wheelchair. She  broke barriers when she became the first person in a wheelchair to  actually perform on a Disney stage.   In addition to her career as a performer, she does vital work every  day as the accessibility coordinator for the city of Long Beach.   In ``Wish,'' her character, Dahlia, is a courageous leader who also  uses a wooden crutch to help her walk. This is a huge deal for  representation. People with disabilities remain dramatically  underrepresented in the media. Despite over 25 percent of American  adults having some type of disability, movie and TV shows that feature  people with disabilities or hire folks with disabilities are few and  far between. I think we can all agree that this representation,  especially for young people, is so important.    We couldn't be more proud of Jennifer for breaking barriers all  across her life and for this latest performance.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, truth and justice are  crucial components of a healthy and strong democracy. It speaks to the  public trust we hold and the dignity of this institution.   As a freshman Member of Congress, I take the oath very seriously. I  love this country deeply, and we should all have intentions to defend  it.   That is why I rise today to defend the integrity of the House and to  support the expulsion of Representative Santos. I wish no personal harm  to the Representative from New York, and I imagine it is a difficult  moment for him and for the institution. However, I believe strongly  that he must be held accountable for his actions as well as his lies.   He fabricated his qualifications and his background. He lied to the  FEC and participated in unemployment fraud. That is why he is under a  serious 23-count indictment.   The bipartisan report is out. It is damning. It should convince all  Members to vote for this expulsion.   People want better from Congress. They want good and ethical  government. They deserve the truth.   I once again ask the Representative from New York to resign and save  himself and the country from this vote. If not, I encourage a ``yes''  vote to restore integrity to the body and to expel Representative  Santos.
