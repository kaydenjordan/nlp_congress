 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to our Nation's  law enforcement men and women.   I respect and appreciate the important work of our police throughout  the Nation who are charged with the critical work of protecting the  people in our States and our local communities. The heartbreaking  violent targeting of our Nation's police officers, recently,  demonstrates the dangers these men and women face every day.   Every American is so proud as our many neighbors and fellow citizens  get up every morning, put on their local law enforcement uniform and  badge, kiss their families good-bye, and go out and serve us, keeping  our cities and towns safe, trying to build trust and faith among all of  our citizens.   Monday was National Law Enforcement Appreciation Day, and our law  enforcement men and women in Arkansas and throughout the country  deserve our gratitude and respect. I proudly displayed a blue light in  my office window to honor our law enforcement men and women, and I  thank them for their selfless service.                            ____________________
