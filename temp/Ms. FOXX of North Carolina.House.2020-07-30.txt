 Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from  California for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to highlight an issue of great importance  to Americans: the ability to choose high-quality and affordable  healthcare and increase competition among healthcare providers to drive  down costs.   Included in this package is my amendment to codify the  administration's rule requiring hospitals to post the prices they have  negotiated with insurers and their cash discounted prices for about 300  common services. This rule is a step forward towards empowering  patients by giving them the information they need to make informed  decisions and take control of their healthcare.   Pulling back the curtain on hospital charges allows patients to shop  around for the best price and will spur competition and innovation  among hospitals for these services and, ultimately, result in lower  prices for patients. It is a shame that Democrats appear to oppose this  commonsense policy which will save money for patients and our  healthcare system.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this en bloc  amendment.
