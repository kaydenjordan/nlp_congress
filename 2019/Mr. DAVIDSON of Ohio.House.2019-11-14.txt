 Mr. Chair, I claim time in opposition, but I am  not opposed to the amendment.    Mr. Chair, first, let me say Republicans  unanimously voted to support the Waters-McHenry bipartisan deal to  strengthen the Export-Import Bank and combat Chinese aggression, but we  will not support this partisan bill.   This is yet another do-nothing amendment offered by the Democrats so  they can send out a press release claiming they care about national  security or, in this case, the opioid crisis. In fact, it is a poison  pill meant to counter an amendment that will be offered shortly.   ``Amend and pretend'' is going to be a running theme during this  debate. Like another measure offered today by Mrs. Torres, Mr. McAdams'  amendment would simply require Ex-Im users to self-certify that they  are not breaking the law by violating opioid trafficking sanctions.  This way, Democrats can claim that they don't like opioids.   See how it works? They push this bill. It means nothing. Criminals,  of course, are going to say: No. Who, me? I wouldn't violate the law.   The real opioid measure that we have before us today is being offered  by me shortly. Mr. McAdams' amendment would actually prevent Ex-Im  assistance from going to foreign governments that significantly  contribute to opioid trafficking if those governments fail to cooperate  with U.S. antinarcotics efforts. That is a serious amendment. It  prevents taxpayer-backed financing from going to governments that help  to poison taxpayers. It is logical.   Unfortunately, my opioid trafficking amendment was so logical that  Democrats opposed it in committee and have pledged to oppose it here on  the floor shortly.   Again, this McAdams amendment is about a press release for Democrats,  so amend and pretend it is today with the McAdams amendment.                                time  1600    I want to be clear that I do not oppose the amendment, but I am  opposed and disappointed that my Democratic colleagues have offered  another amendment that is another stunt provision for this dead-end  bill.   We had a bipartisan path forward, and Democrats are wasting floor  time with this bill that will never be enacted to law.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, as we will see shortly, to  highlight the fact that this isn't about getting the provision into  law, I am confident a recorded vote will be requested because it is all  theater. It is not meant to change the law in a substantive way; it is  meant to provide cover.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Chairman, I would like to start off by saying that I  wholeheartedly support reauthorization of the Export-Import Bank. It is  an important tool to help ensure American companies can stay  competitive in foreign markets and can be used as an important national  security tool in countering countries such as China.   Unfortunately, there are several commonsense reforms that I think  could dramatically improve the agency but which are not being  considered under this bill, which is why I am offering my amendment.   My amendment is modeled after the bipartisan Fentanyl Sanctions Act,  introduced in the House by Max Rose and cosponsored by our colleague  from Arkansas, French Hill. In the Senate, the Senate minority leader,  Democrat Chuck Schumer, is the lead sponsor, joined by Republican  Senator Pat Toomey and others.   Under the House and Senate fentanyl bills, the President could waive  sanctions against foreign state-owned banks if a foreign government is  closely cooperating with our efforts to prevent opioid trafficking.   This amendment's approach is similar. It simply says that the United  States will oppose Ex-Im Bank assistance to a government and the  entities it controls if the President determines that the government  isn't cooperating with us to stop the flood of opioids into our  country. China and Mexico, in particular, have been identified by the  U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency as primary producers of these opioids.   This amendment is not targeting those who need assistance from the  United States most; in fact, my amendment would provide a waiver where  exports are needed to the government in question for the export of  humanitarian goods or services. We want to help those who need  assistance, but we must be doing all that we can do to confront the  opioid epidemic that is wreaking havoc in the United States.   According to the Centers for Disease Control, opioids are the main  driver of opioid deaths in America, with deaths linked to synthetic  opioids, especially fentanyl, rising exponentially. Areas in southwest  Ohio, where I represent, have some of the highest per capita opioid  overdose deaths in the Nation.   And this is an epidemic impacting all our Nation's communities. In  2017 alone, 28,000 deaths in the United States involved synthetic  opioids, and deaths have risen all across demographic groups in nearly  half of U.S. States.   In short, this is a problem that touches all of us, and close  cooperation with countries receiving Ex-Im assistance from the United  States is essential.   If we care about stopping this epidemic, my amendment is a small but  important step that we should all be able to agree on. I urge my  colleagues to support its adoption.   I want to clarify that countries that have problems, like China or  Mexico, don't need to completely eliminate their problem; what they do  need to do is cooperate with the United States, and when they do, the  Export-Import Bank can continue to function well where it was designed  to function well.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, how much time do I have  remaining?    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my  time.   I would like to make the point that this amendment that I have  offered has substance because it expects something for America's  assistance.   At least some of my colleagues are consistent: They don't want the  President of the United States, whoever  [[Page H8865]]  that is, to expect anything from a foreign power in exchange for  American participation. They want nothing in return for our dollars, no  condition on their behavior.   In fact, rather than trusting the United States of America to  determine whether a country is cooperating with us on our efforts to  stop synthetic opioids, they want to trust the people who may very well  be using the system to create that market for their own benefit, self- certification.   I am sure the Sinaloa Cartel would certify that they don't  participate in trafficking drugs, as well.   That is what the McAdams approach does. That is the version that our  chairwoman has, unfortunately, chosen to support, and I believe it is  the wrong path.   I encourage people to support this amendment if they are serious  about trying to stop opioids and if they are serious about using the  foreign policy tools, including trade, that the United States has to  offer.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.
