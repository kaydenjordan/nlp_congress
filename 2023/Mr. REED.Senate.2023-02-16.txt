 Madam President, I am joined by Senators Brown, Warren, Van  Hollen, Booker, Whitehouse, Baldwin, Padilla, and Merkley in  reintroducing the Respect for Workers Act, a bill that would ensure  that at least one Federal Reserve Governor has demonstrated primary  experience in supporting or protecting the rights of workers.   Today, the Federal Reserve is attempting to curb inflation without  plunging the economy into a recession. Over the past year, it has  increased the Federal funds rate by 4\1/2\ percentage points to cool  the economy and ease prices--its fastest pace of rate hikes since the  early 1980s. But this is a difficult balancing act. If the Federal  Reserve does not get its policies right, it may fail to defeat  inflation or drive us into a recession. Workers would bear the brunt of  the economic fallout attached to either outcome through higher prices  or higher unemployment.   Arguably no group is more affected by the Federal Reserves efforts to  meet its dual mandate to promote stable prices and maximum employment  than workers. But, while the law requires the Federal Reserve Board of  Governors to represent diverse geographic regions and a wide array of  commercial interests, no Federal Reserve Governor is required to have a  background in protecting the interests of workers. Indeed, while the  interests of Wall Street, nonbank financial institutions, and big  business have long been well-represented on the Board, everyday working  men and women have not been given the same voice in monetary  policymaking.   Our bill fills this hole by requiring at least one Federal Reserve  Governor has experience addressing the challenges facing workers. This  is not a new concept. In fact, our bill is modeled on the 2015 law that  requires at least one of the seven Federal Reserve Governors to be an  individual ``with demonstrated primary experience working in or  supervising community banks.''   In short, the Respect for Workers Act would ensure workers' economic  needs are represented at the Federal Reserve. It would build a  stronger, more representative Board of Governors and promote a  healthier economy.   I thank the AFL-CIO, Groundwork Collaborative, National Employment  Law Project, MIT Professor and Former International Monetary Fund Chief  Economist Simon Johnson, and Georgetown Law Professor Adam Levitin for  their support and urge our colleagues to join in pushing to enact this  legislation.                                  ______                                         By Mr. THUNE (for himself, Mr. Cassidy, Mr. Barrasso, Mrs. Britt,          Mr. Cramer, Ms. Ernst, Mr. Grassley, Mr. Marshall, Mr. Scott of          Florida, and Mr. Scott of South Carolina):  [[Page S460]]    S. 506. A bill to amend the Higher Education Relief Opportunities for  Students Act of 2003 to strike the Secretary's unilateral authority  during a national emergency, and for other purposes; to the Committee  on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.
