 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3245,  legislation sponsored by my colleague, friend, and fellow Hoosier, Dr.  Larry Bucshon.   The Harmony Way Bridge connects Indiana to Illinois over the Wabash  River. The bridge is currently managed by the White County Bridge  Commission, which was created by Federal legislation in 1941.   The bridge closed in 2012 due to structural deficiencies, and current  Federal law blocks local officials from taking action to repair the  bridge.   I am proud to join my colleagues in both the Indiana and Illinois  delegations as a cosponsor on this critical legislation.   H.R. 3245 would allow the two States to determine the future of the  bridge.   Madam Speaker, supporting this bill is common sense.   A companion bill, S. 1833, was introduced by the four Senators from  Indiana and Illinois and passed by unanimous consent.   Last year, the House passed a similar bill overwhelmingly. In  addition, both Indiana and Illinois created State commissions to manage  the bridge, and now it is our responsibility to complete the transfer.   I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 3245 and allow the States of  Illinois and Indiana, and the community residents surrounding the  Harmony Way Bridge, to determine the future of this treasured landmark.
