 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1722, the  Grand Ronde Reservation Act Amendment of 2023.   My district is the proud home of the Confederated Tribes of the Grand  Ronde community, who, like Oregon's other indigenous peoples, were the  original stewards of our land and abundant natural resources, yet they  have also faced tremendous injustices at the hands of the Federal  Government.   The Grand Ronde Reservation was established in 1857. In 1871, during  a survey of the reservation, an 84-acre piece of land known as the  Thompson Strip was mistakenly excluded. It took over 100 years for this  error to be delivered, and rectifying it does require an act of  Congress.   At some point in the process of drafting legislation, language was  erroneously inserted that took away Grand Ronde's right to bring any  further land claims in the entire State of Oregon, not just around the  Thompson Strip.                                time  1545    The Grand Ronde community is to this day the only Tribe in Oregon  that is subject to this prohibition.   H.R. 1722 will finally correct this decades-old error and restore  Grand Ronde's ability to pursue land claims. This legislation enjoys  strong bipartisan support in both the House and Senate.   I thank my colleagues here today from the Natural Resources  Committee, as well as the support of the entire Oregon delegation.   Passage of H.R. 1722 would be enormously consequential for the Grand  Ronde community. It would also represent a historic step forward for  indigenous peoples' rights in America. I have always believed that  while we are not responsible for the ills of the past, we are  responsible for remedying them today.   Mr. Speaker, my amendment to the Grand Ronde Reservation Act aligns  with that important pursuit. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the  aisle to join me in supporting this bill.
