 Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Weber for yielding.   Louie, I sat next to you for 16 years, I think, in the Natural  Resources Committee or one or two removed from you, and at the end we  were right next to each other, and you would give me a lot of quips  during hearings, during witness testimony. One thing you always struck  me as being is a happy warrior.                                time  1815    You are a warrior in the sense that you are passionate and committed  to your conservative views and you are happy about it. You have good  humor. We just saw a minute ago you poked fun at yourself in a humorous  way. So that combination is very rare, and we need more of that. We  need people who are happy, positive, and have good humor. You have all  of those attributes.   I won't go into these stories because it would take forever to give  the background, but you remember some times in Israel we were together  floating in the Dead Sea, or you found the dead cat, or other things  like that. There are stories we could go into, and I won't do that.   But it has been a real honor serving with you, and I wish you the  best. The people of east Texas have been very well represented, and I  am sure they will have to make do with somebody else and they will  eventually like that person, but they are going to truly miss you, and  you will be missed here.   We wish you the best and Godspeed.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the topic of this Special Order.    Mr. Speaker, it is a great honor for me to come to the  floor tonight to commemorate the 81st Annual National Bible Week, a  week in which we celebrate the tremendous influence of the Bible on the  freedoms we enjoy today in America.   In 1941, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt declared the week of  Thanksgiving to be National Bible Week, on the eve of World War II. In  the years since, every President has issued a national proclamation, as  have many governors and mayors.   The Bible has had a profound impact on my own life as well. When I  was an 18-year old freshman at the University of Kansas, I was  approached by some people who asked me if I knew what was in the Bible.  I said I believed I knew what it was all about; however, I had never  read any of it for myself.   The only honest thing I could do at that point was to read it for  myself. So when I read the gospel of John, I ended up discovering a  personal relationship with Jesus Christ, who became my Lord and Savior.   In that gospel, He said, ``I am the way, the truth and the life. No  one comes to the Father but through me.''   So we recognize the Bible's powerful message of hope. We cherish the  wisdom of the Bible. We acknowledge its profound role in the founding  of our country; and we thank God for providing this holy book. It has  truly been, as it says, a lamp unto our feet and a light unto our path.   We are here, in keeping with tradition, to recognize National Bible  Week.   Mr. Speaker, we have a number of fellow Representatives from all  across this great country of ours who want to comment on National Bible  Week, on the importance of the Bible to them, to their districts, and  to the country.   We will go now first with Mr.   Robert Aderholt, and then continue  down the list in the order that people arrived here.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. Aderholt).    Mr. Speaker, secondly, we have the gentleman from Texas,  Representative Babin, and then the gentleman from Mississippi after  that.   I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Babin).    Mr. Speaker, next I yield to the gentleman from  Mississippi (Mr. Guest).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Tennessee  (Mr. Rose).    Mr. Speaker, I appreciate what the gentleman had to say.  Tomorrow will be the 81st anniversary of Pearl Harbor Day. That day has  lived in infamy.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Grothman).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his words.   Mr. Grothman mentioned John Adams. I have a great quote here from  John Quincy Adams, the younger of the two that became President: ``I  speak as a man of the world to the men of the world; and I say to you,  Search the Scriptures. The Bible is the book of all others, to be read  at all ages, and in all conditions of human life; not to be read once  or twice or thrice through, and then laid aside, but to be read in  small portions of one or two chapters every day, and never to be  intermitted, unless by overruling necessity.''   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. Bacon).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for sharing that  message from the heart, and I appreciate what the Bible has done in his  life.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Allen).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Georgia for his  words.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Carter).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Georgia (Mr.  Carter) for reminding us of what the reason for the season really is.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Clyde).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for those thoughts on  this commemoration of National Bible Week.   To conclude, Mr. Speaker, I have two more quotes from other  Presidents of the United States.   Ronald Reagan, in his own declaration of National Bible Week when he  was in office, said: ``When I took the oath of office, I requested that  my mother's Bible be opened to 2nd Chronicles 7:14, which reads, `If my  people which are called by my name shall humble themselves and pray and  seek my face and turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear from  Heaven and will forgive their sin and will heal their land.' This  passage expresses my hopes for the future of this Nation and the  world.''   Lastly, to make this bipartisan, President Truman said during an  address at the Attorney General's Conference on Law Enforcement  Problems: ``The fundamental basis of this Nation's law was given to  Moses on the Mount. The fundamental basis of our Bill of Rights comes  from the teachings which we get from Exodus and St. Matthew, from  Isaiah and St. Paul. I don't think we emphasize that enough these  days.''   If that was true in the late 1940s, that is certainly true today.   He continued: ``If we don't have the proper fundamental moral  background, we will finally end up with a totalitarian government which  does not believe in rights for anybody except the State.''   I am going to conclude by saying this, Mr. Speaker: It has been an  honor and a pleasure to commemorate National Bible Week this evening. I  am grateful for all of my colleagues who joined me to honor the Word of  God.   The Bible is the single most important book ever written. It has the  power to change lives. It has liberated many from oppression by its  clear teachings. It is truly an amazing and remarkable piece of  writing. It contains pure truth about God, about life, the nature of  mankind, and our own hearts as human beings.   I am thankful for the Word of God, the impact that it has had on my  life, on the lives of those who have spoken here today, and on the life  of our great Nation.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
