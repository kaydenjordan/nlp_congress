 Madam Speaker, this past Sunday was Bloody Sunday.  For some who are not familiar with that terminology, the Congressional  Black Caucus did a special tribute last evening. But I think it is also  a recognition that elections count, determination counts, conscience  counts.   So this morning I want to emphasize Bloody Sunday and what it really  meant. It was, in fact, to restore or to initiate or to give Americans  the free and equal right to vote. The late John Lewis, our friend, our  brother, the conscience of the Congress, may not have known what  historical steps he was walking in when he stared down the Alabama  State Troopers standing with Hosea Williams and Albert Turner and other  foot soldiers, staring them down because voting counts.  [[Page H1126]]    I rise to pay tribute to that kind of determination. As we proceed to  debate the American rescue package, I want the Members, my friends on  the other side of the aisle, to recognize that elections count, that  people are looking for us to stare down the devastation of COVID-19,  the devastation of poverty, and the devastation of lack of jobs.   They are looking for diversity in terms of vaccinations, reaching out  to neighborhoods. They are looking for the child tax credit, the earned  income tax credit, and that is because John Lewis stood tall for the  1965 Voting Rights Act.   In fact, after that Bloody Sunday, President Johnson rose to this  podium and said: ``I speak tonight for the dignity of man and the  destiny of democracy. . . . At times, history and fate meet at a single  time in a single place to shape a turning point in man's unending  search for freedom. So it was at Lexington and Concord. So it was a  century ago at Appomattox. So it was last week in Selma, Alabama.''   So when we debate, I want us to be reminded that people died for the  Voting Rights Act because elections count: people like Jimmie Lee  Jackson, who was shot by a State trooper in Marion, Alabama, after a  peaceful rally to vote; women like Viola Liuzzo, a Detroit housewife  who was driving people back and forth between Montgomery and Selma.  She, a mother of 5, was shot to death.   So today I rise to emphasize that Bloody Sunday is not just Bloody  Sunday. It is a continuation of the fight for justice and the fight for  voting rights. It is what we will do tomorrow. It is the PRO Act. It is  the Violence Against Women Act. It is the vote for the American rescue  package that does not disallow the fact that all Americans, those  impoverished, those who have lost loved ones to COVID-19, those  teachers who want to get in the classroom and teach. All of this will  be part of the American rescue package.   Thank you, John Lewis, for beginning to tell us what America should  be and what America can be. It is because of that kind of strength that  we are here today. To John Lewis, we commit to you to pass H.R. 1 in  the Senate, to pass the Voting Rights Act enhancement number four,  after Shelby, Alabama, destroyed and undermined the very strength of  the Voting Rights Act. Because we would not be here today; we would not  have the opportunity to have the American rescue package; we would not  have the opportunity to have the Violence Against Women Act; we would  not have the opportunity to have the George Floyd Justice in Policing  Act, whose family was here last week when we debated it, if we did not  have the right to vote.   So it is my belief today that, as we go into this debate, as we go  into the rest of the week, as we vote for the universal background  checks and the Charleston, South Carolina, closing the loophole, it is  not a frivolous authority or power that we utilize. It is because  people were willing to be beaten and to be almost killed, but certainly  unbowed, as Shirley Chisholm said, for the precious right to vote.   Bloody Sunday may be one day, March 7, but all the years that I have  gone and crossed the Edmund Pettus Bridge, chosen to highlight a  Confederate segregationist, but we turned that lemon into lemonade.  When thousands and thousands and thousands every year marched across  that Edmund Pettus Bridge, we weren't marching for segregation, we  weren't marching for the violence that was perpetrated against the foot  soldiers year after year. We were marching for freedom and the right to  vote.   So this right to vote will be exercised on the floor of the House  this week. I ask and beg my colleagues to join us in what is good. Join  us in the American rescue package. Join us in the PRO Act. Join us in  the universal background checks. Join us in closing the Charleston  loophole. Join us next week in the Violence Against Women Act. Join us  to make America the country of John Robert Lewis, standing for what is  good.   Madam Speaker, I know we will do good and get into good trouble.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his  leadership.   Madam Speaker, I rise enthusiastically to support the PRO Act and its  protection against executives and companies who violate workers'  rights, its support for collective bargaining, and also its access to  fair elections with unions.   I rise to support my amendment, number 9. The Jackson Lee amendment  is direct. The amendment explicitly extends whistleblower protections  to employees, both employers, and unions, under the Labor Management  Reporting and Disclosure Act. I am grateful to the unions and to the  committee for working with this very important amendment.   It extends whistleblower protection to all employees of employers or  of unions to encourage and empower them to come forward and make known  that something is wrong.   Ms. Lawson, who was in a fight for $15, worked for a fast food  industry. She was sexually harassed. She needs that kind of protection.  So this amendment is very strong and adds to this very strong  initiative.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of Jackson Lee Amendment No. 9  included in the Chairman's En Bloc Amendment to H.R. 842, the  ``Protecting the Right to Organize Act of 2021,'' or ``PRO Act,'' which  protects the basic right to join a union by (1) empowering workers to  exercise their right to organize; (2) holding employers accountable for  violating workers' rights; and (3) securing free, fair, and safe union  elections.   The LMRDA of 1959 protects union members through a ``bill of rights''  for union members, requires extensive reporting of union finances, and  mandates transparency of arrangements between employers and anti-labor  consultants.   I am pleased that the PRO Act includes reforms to the LMRDA that  clarify that employers must disclose arrangements with consultants on  indirectly persuading employees on how to exercise their labor rights.   Examples of indirect persuasion include planning employee meetings,  training employer representatives, and identifying employees for  disciplinary action or targeting.   The Jackson Lee Amendment No. 9 makes a simple common-sense  improvement to the bill.   The identical version of this amendment was made in order by the  Rules Committee in the 116th Congress and adopted by the House on  February 6, 2020, by a roll call vote of 404-18.   Specifically, the amendment explicitly extends whistleblower  protections to employees of both employers and unions under the Labor  Management Reporting and Disclosure Act.   This is a fair and balanced amendment.   Supreme Court decisions like Janus v. AFSCME, 585 U.S.__138 S. Ct.  2448, 201 L. Ed. 2d 924 (2018), and many others, have severely weakened  the ability for unions to be able to organize and bargain collectively,  or to discharge an essential mediating function upon which a vibrant  democracy depends.   The PRO Act protects the workers who are trying to organize.   But the Jackson Lee Amendment No. 9 extends whistleblower protections  to all employees, of employers or of unions, to encourage and empower  them to come forward and make known something wrong or unlawful that  they have learned or observed.   Let me give you an example.   Last year, I met Kimberly Lawson, who is part of the Fight for $15.   She also came to see me to advise me of the problems she has had with  sexual harassment on her job in the fast-food industry.   She told me, on the record, that if we could pass the PRO Act, she  would not be alone trying to raise our hourly wage or face sexual  harassment without a union to help her.   Madam Speaker, this whistleblower protection is important because it  gives workers like Ms. Lawson the ability to be able to report what is  happening to them without losing or jeopardizing their jobs and the  ability, like Ms. Lawson, to support her children on the income of a  single mother.   Our economy needs a strong middle class, and unions are essential to  rebuilding America's middle class and improving the lives of workers  and their families.   When workers have the power to stand together and form a union, they  have higher wages, better benefits, and safer working conditions.   Protecting workers' rights to organize will help rebuild the middle  class and improve the quality of life for workers and their families.   Unions are essential to rebuilding America's middle class and  improving the lives of workers and their families because they deliver  higher wages, better benefits, and safer working conditions.   Unions deliver bigger paychecks for both union and nonunion workers.   Over the last eight decades, unions have consistently provided  workers with a 10- to 20-percent higher wage.   The benefits of union membership are so strong that even the children  of union workers enjoy greater economic mobility.   When union density is high, even nonunion workers receive higher  wages.   Unions provide workers with a voice on the job to bargain for better  wages and safer working conditions.   While the entire economy has suffered from massive job loss during  the pandemic, union workers suffered fewer job losses because they were  able to bargain with employers on how to respond to the pandemic.   Unions deliver greater access to affordable health care and a more  secure retirement.   Private sector workers covered by a union contract are 27 percent  more likely to be offered health insurance through their employer.  [[Page H1158]]    More than 9 in 10 unionized private sector workers have access to a  retirement plan, compared to just 65 percent of nonunion workers.   Unions narrow both the racial wealth gap and the gender pay gap.   About two-thirds (65 percent) of workers age 18 to 64 who are covered  by a union contract are women and/or people of color.   Union members of color have almost five times the median wealth of  their nonunion counterparts.   Unions are one of the most effective solutions for closing the gender  pay gap.   I urge all members to join me in supporting Jackson Lee Amendment No.  9 by voting for the En Bloc Amendment to H.R. 842, the Protecting the  Right to Organize Act, or PRO Act, of 2021.   I want to remind us that, in the early 1900s, women worked in  factories where they died. They simply died because there were no  provisions, no protections; and they died with drastic fires and other  devastating actions.   Madam Speaker, I ask support of this legislation.   Madam Speaker, I include in the Record a letter of support for the  Jackson Lee amendment from the Government Accountability Project. It  reads that they think that this is an especially important initiative  to be added. I ask that in support.                               Government Accountability Project,                                      Washington, DC, March 8, 2021.      Hon. Sheila Jackson Lee,      Member of Congress, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative Lee: Thank you for your leadership       through legislation to add whistleblower protection rights to       the Labor Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959.       That law strives for union accountability to its members and       in management relations. Your bill reflects best practice       rights that Congress has passed 16 times since 2005 in laws       throughout the private sector. However, the reality is that       not only employers abuse power and undermine worker rights.       This legislation protects those who seek accountability       within and by organizations whose mission is to protect       employees.        As summarized below, your legislation would honor best       practices by--        prohibiting retaliation against applicants, employees or       former employees who are perceived as disclosing or assisting       to disclose violations of the Act's provisions;        protecting both front line and management employees from       retaliation;        extending identical protection to those who refuse to obey       orders to violate the law;        providing an administrative remedy at the U.S. Department       of Labor, with the right to a jury trial in federal court if       there is not a timely decision;        governing enforcement with realistic Whistleblower       Protection Act legal burdens of proof; and        so employees do not lose by winning, providing ``make       whole'' remedies for those who prevail, including cancelation       of all career damage, compensatory damages and costs       including attorney fees.        Unless there are loopholes in the political mandate for       accountability, this legislation should not be controversial.       It merely applies almost identical legal rights in the labor-      management context that Congress has enacted since 2005 for       financial, food safety, consumer protection, energy, medical       insurance and transportation whistleblowers. Thank you for       your leadership. Please consider Government Accountability       Project on call for further assistance.            Sincerely,                                                        Tom Devine,                                                    Legal Director.     Madam Speaker, I ask support of the Jackson Lee  amendment in the en bloc amendment No. 1.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 842, the ``Protecting the  Right to Organize Act of 2021, or ``PRO Act,'' which protects the basic  right to join a union by (1) empowering workers to exercise their right  to organize; (2) holding employers accountable for violating workers'  rights; and (3) securing free, fair, and safe union elections.   Our economy needs a strong middle class, and unions are essential to  rebuilding America's middle class and improving the lives of workers  and their families.   The erosion of America's middle-class is a direct result of decades- long assault on workers' rights, funded by wealthy special interests.   When workers have the power to stand together and form a union, they  have higher wages, better benefits, and safer working conditions.   Workers seeking to organize a union frequently face a surge of  intimidation and retaliation from wealthy special interests.   After decades of anti-worker attacks, union membership is at historic  lows and inequality is at historic highs.   It is imperative that we begin to recognize that the American people  support unions--over 64 percent of Americans and millennials appreciate  the idea of having representation for better quality of life and work.   When workers have the power to stand together and form a union, they  have higher wages, better benefits, and safer working conditions.   Protecting workers' rights to organize will help rebuild the middle  class and improve the quality of life for workers and their families.   Unions are essential to rebuilding America's middle class and  improving the lives of workers and their families because they deliver  higher wages, better benefits, and safer working conditions.   Workers with strong unions have been able to set industry standards  for wages and benefits that help all workers, both union and nonunion.   Over the last eight decades, unions have consistently provided  workers with a 10- to 20-percent higher wage.   The benefits of union membership are so strong that even the children  of union workers enjoy greater economic mobility.   Unions provide workers with a voice on the job to bargain for better  wages and safer working conditions, and never has it been more  important that all workers have a voice in the workplace and access to  a union.   While the majority of workers who are currently working onsite at  their workplaces believe they face considerable risk of COVID-19  infection, Black and Hispanic workers are more likely to fear risks  from work than are White workers.   In fact, Black workers make up one in six of all front-line industry  workers, putting them and their family members at greater risk of  contracting and spreading COVID-19.   Without unions, many workers are forced to work without personal  protective equipment or access to paid leave or premium pay.   When nonunion workers have advocated for health and safety  protections or wage increases, they have often been retaliated against  or even fired for doing so.   Workers' lives and the health and safety of working families depends  on their ability to have a say in how they do their jobs.   While the entire economy has suffered from massive job loss during  the pandemic, union workers suffered fewer job losses because they were  able to bargain with employers on how to respond to the pandemic.   Unions deliver greater access to affordable health care and a more  secure retirement.   Private sector workers covered by a union contract are 27 percent  more likely to be offered health insurance through their employer.   More than 9 in 10 unionized private sector workers have access to a  retirement plan, compared to just 65 percent of nonunion workers   Unions narrow both the racial wealth gap and the gender pay gap.   The right to a union and collective bargaining is also directly  relevant to our urgent national conversation around racial inequality  in its various forms, including economic disparities by race.   Unions and collective bargaining help shrink the Black-White wage  gap, and this means that the decline of unionization has played a  significant role in the expansion of the Black-White wage gap over the  last four decades, and that an increase in unionization could help  reverse those trends.   About two-thirds (65 percent) of workers age 18 to 64 who are covered  by a union contract are women and/or people of color.   Union members of color have almost five times the median wealth of  their nonunion counterparts.   Unions are one of the most effective solutions for closing the gender  pay gap.   Madam Speaker, here are 36 reasons why Americans should be thankful  for unions and remain committed to ensuring there will always be a  strong organized labor movement in the United States:   1. Weekends   2. All breaks at work, including your lunch breaks   3. Paid vacation   4. FMLA (Family and Medical Leave Act)   5. Sick leave   6. Social security   7. Minimum wage   8. Civil Rights Act Title VII (prohibits Employer Discrimination)   9. 8-Hour workday   10. Overtime pay   11. Child labor laws   12. Occupational Safety & Health Act (OSHA)   13. 40 Hour Work Week   14. Worker's Compensation (Worker's Camp)   15. Unemployment Insurance   16. Pensions   17. Workplace Safety Standards and Regulations   18. Employer Health Care Insurance   19. Collective Bargaining Rights for Employees   20. Wrongful Termination Laws   21. Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967   22. Whistleblower Protection Laws   23. Employee Polygraph Protect Act (Prohibits Employer from using a  lie detector test on an employee)  [[Page H1159]]    24. Veteran's Employment and Training Services (VETS)   25. Compensation increases and Evaluations (Raises)   26. Sexual Harassment laws   27. Americans With Disabilities Act (ADA)   28. Holiday Pay   29. Employer Dental, Life, and Vision Insurance   30. Privacy Rights   31. Pregnancy and Parental Leave   32. Military Leave   33. The Right to Strike   34. Public Education for Children   35. Equal Pay Acts of 1963 & 2011 (Requires employers pay men and  women equally for the same amount of work)   36. Laws Ending Sweatshops in the United States   I urge all members to join me in supporting H.R. 842, the Protecting  the Right to Organize Act, or PRO Act, of 2021.    Mr. Speaker, over 500,000 dead; 44,000 or more dead  in the State of Texas.   The State of Texas, throughout the entire pandemic, remained one of  the top hot spots of the Nation. They started testing late. We started  vaccines and still have not reached a certain percentage, but yet,  tomorrow, on March 10, 2021, our Governor has announced that there will  be no mask mandate, and there will be no restrictions on any form of  entertainment, restaurants, any large gatherings.   Tomorrow, March 10, the people of Texas get a death notice. I am  asking my friends in Texas to wear your masks, socially distance, wash  your  [[Page H1179]]  hands. We are vaccinating as fast as we can, but I am letting you know  that Texas has all five of the variants of COVID-19. They have long- haulers in Texas, people who have continued to have COVID-19.   To save lives, I am asking my fellow Texans--as I know President Bush  always used to call us, his ``fellow Texans''--to wear your masks, wash  your hands, socially distance to save lives.   Let's ignore wrong-headed advice and do what is right to save lives.                            ____________________
