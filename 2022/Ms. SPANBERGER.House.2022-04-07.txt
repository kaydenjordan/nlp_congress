 Mr. Speaker, I stand here to recognize the service of  Marcus Tuck of Crewe, Virginia.   During the Korean war, Mr. Tuck served in the United States Army. He  was part of E Company, 223rd Infantry Regiment, 40th Division. He  served honorably and dutifully, but for decades, Mr. Tuck never  received the medals he was owed, the medals he earned.   This year, my office worked with Mr. Tuck and fought to get Mr. Tuck  the medals he rightfully earned nearly 70 years ago. For his brave  service to our country, Mr. Tuck earned the Good Conduct Medal. He  earned the National Defense Service Medal. He earned the Korean Service  Medal with two bronze service stars. He earned the Combat Infantryman  Badge 1st Award, and he earned the United Nations Service Medal.   On behalf of a grateful Seventh District, the Commonwealth of  Virginia, and our country, I thank Marcus Tuck for his commitment to  our beloved Nation. I am humbled to call him a constituent, and I am  honored to be able to deliver these physical reminders of his service  to him and his family.   I also want to recognize the Crewe Gold Star Memorial VFW Post 7189  for getting Mr. Tuck in touch with our office and for making sure he  received the medals and the recognition that had long been deferred.   As an American people, we are stronger when we honor our veterans,  remember their stories, and carry onward the torch of their legacy.  Thank you for your service, Mr. Tuck.                            ____________________
