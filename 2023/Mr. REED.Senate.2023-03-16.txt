 Madam President, today I am introducing the Stronger  Enforcement of Civil Penalties Act along with Senator Grassley. This  bill will help securities regulators better protect investors and  demand greater accountability from market players. Even in the midst of  an unprecedented public health and economic emergency, we continue to  see calculated wrongdoing by some on Wall Street, and without the  consequence of meaningful penalties to serve as an effective deterrent,  I worry this disturbing culture of misconduct will persist.   The amount of penalties the Securities and Exchange Commission, SEC,  can fine an institution or individual is restricted by statute. During  hearings I held in 2011 as chairman of the Banking Committee's  Securities, Insurance, and Investment Subcommittee, I learned how this  limitation significantly interferes with the SEC's ability to execute  its enforcement duties. At that time, a Federal judge had criticized  the SEC for not obtaining a larger settlement against Citigroup, a  major actor in the financial crisis that settled with the Agency in an  amount that was far below the cost the bank had inflicted on investors.  The SEC indicated that a statutory prohibition against levying a larger  penalty led to the low settlement amount. Indeed, in the immediate  aftermath of the financial crisis, then-SEC Chairman Mary Schapiro  explained that ``the Commission's statutory authority to obtain civil  monetary penalties with appropriate deterrent effect is limited in many  circumstances.'' Unfortunately, the SEC's statutory authority remains  unchanged and the Agency's deterrent effect remains limited--even  though securities fraud has not abated.  [[Page S828]]    The bipartisan bill we are introducing aims to update the SEC's  outdated civil penalties statutes. This bill strives to make potential  and current offenders think twice before engaging in misconduct by  raising the maximum statutory civil monetary penalties, directly  linking the size of the penalties to the amount of losses suffered by  victims of a violation, and substantially increasing the financial  stakes for serial offenders of our Nation's securities laws.   Specifically, our bill would broaden the SEC's options to tailor  penalties to the particular circumstances of a given violation. In  addition to raising the per violation caps for severe, or ``third  tier,'' violations to $1 million per offense for individuals and $10  million per offense for entities, the legislation would also give the  SEC more options to collect greater penalties based on the ill-gotten  gains of the violator or on the financial harm to investors.   Our bill also seeks to deter repeat offenders on Wall Street through  two provisions. The first would authorize the SEC to triple the penalty  cap applicable to recidivists who have been held either criminally or  civilly liable for securities fraud within the previous 5 years. The  second would allow the SEC to seek a civil penalty against those who  violate existing Federal court or SEC orders, an approach that would be  more efficient, effective, and flexible to the current civil contempt  remedy. These updates would greatly enhance the SEC's ability to levy  tough penalties against repeat offenders.   The SEC's current Director of Enforcement said several months ago  that ``a centerpiece'' of the Agency's efforts to ``hold wrongdoers  accountable and deter future misconduct . . . is ensuring that we are  using every tool in our toolkit, including penalties that have a  deterrent effect and are viewed as more than the cost of doing  business.'' Our bill will strengthen the SEC's existing tools, which  will further increase deterrence and substantially ratchet up the costs  of committing fraud.   All of our constituents deserve a strong regulator that has the  necessary tools to go after fraudsters and pursue the difficult cases  arising from our increasingly complex financial markets. The Stronger  Enforcement of Civil Penalties Act will enhance the SEC's ability to  demand meaningful accountability from Wall Street, which in turn will  increase transparency and confidence in our financial system. I urge  our colleagues to support this important bipartisan legislation.                                  ______                                         By Mr. THUNE (for himself and Mr. Lankford):   S. 839. A bill to require agencies to complete a regulatory impact  analysis before issuing a significant rule, and for other purposes; to  the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.    Madam President, the Public Company Accounting Oversight  Board, PCAOB, Enforcement Transparency Act, which I am reintroducing  today with Senator Grassley, will bring needed transparency to the  disciplinary proceedings the PCAOB has brought against auditors and  audit firms earlier in the process.   Nearly two decades ago, in response to a series of massive financial  reporting frauds, including those involving Enron and WorldCom, the  Senate Banking Committee held multiple hearings, which produced  consensus on various underlying causes, including weak corporate  governance, a lack of accountability, and inadequate oversight of  accountants charged with auditing public companies' financial  statements. Later, in a 99-to-0 vote, the Senate passed the Sarbanes- Oxley Act of 2002 to address the structural weaknesses revealed by the  hearings. Among its many provisions, this law called for the creation  of an independent board, the PCAOB, responsible for overseeing auditors  of public companies in order to protect investors who rely on  independent audit reports on the financial statements of public  companies.   Today, the PCAOB, under the oversight of the U.S. Securities and  Exchange Commissions, SEC, oversees nearly 1,700 registered accounting  firms, as well as the audit partners and staff who contribute to a  firm's work on each audit. The Board's ability to begin proceedings  that can determine whether there have been violations of its auditing  standards or rules of professional practice is a crucial component of  its oversight. However, unlike other oversight bodies, the Board's  disciplinary proceedings cannot be made public without consent from the  parties involved. Of course, parties subject to disciplinary  proceedings have no incentive to consent to publicizing their alleged  wrongdoing, and these proceedings typically remain cloaked behind a  veil of secrecy. In addition, the Board cannot publicize the results of  its disciplinary proceedings until after the appeals process has been  completely exhausted, which can often take several years.   This lack of transparency invites abuse and undermines the  congressional intent behind the PCAOB, which was to shine a bright  light on auditing firms and practices, deter misconduct, and bolster  the accountability of auditors of public companies to the investing  public.   Our bill will restore transparency by making hearings by the PCAOB  and all related notices, orders, and notices, orders and motions  transparent and available to the public unless otherwise ordered by the  Board. This would more closely align the PCAOB's procedures with those  of the SEC for analogous matters.   Increasing transparency and accountability of audit firms subject to  PCAOB disciplinary proceedings bolsters investor confidence in our  financial markets and better protects companies from problematic  auditors. I hope our colleagues will join Senator Grassley and me in  supporting this legislation to enhance transparency in the PCAOB's  enforcement process.
