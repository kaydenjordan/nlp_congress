 Madam Speaker, I have a parliamentary inquiry.    Madam Speaker, my inquiry is, if it is appropriate to call  the previous President a liar, is it appropriate that we can refer to  the current President as a liar also?  [[Page H4409]]     Does not apply to past Presidents?    Understood. I thank the Speaker.                            Parliamentary Inquiry     Madam Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman yielding.   Madam Speaker, we have weak leadership now and a crisis in  Afghanistan. We have a crisis at our border because of weak leadership.  We have an inflation crisis because of weak leadership. And we have a  crime issue in our cities as a result of weak leadership.   Now, we debate preclearance requirements that are unnecessary and  unconstitutional. We hear that they are necessary because of voter ID  laws.   It takes identification to buy liquor in this country, to buy  marijuana in this country, and to drive a car in this country. To enter  this building, it takes identification.   Yet, it is such a burden that we need to have preclearance with the  Department of Justice because of that heavy burden that is being placed  on citizens, preclearance from an administration that has screwed up  Afghanistan, screwed up the border, screwed up inflation. We are  supposed to go to them and ask them for permission because voter ID is  such a burden.   If there weren't people streaming across this border who could  potentially vote, we wouldn't be asking for voter ID laws across this  country, but we are.   Madam Speaker, you can't screw things up on the one hand and, on the  other hand, try to require preclearance.   It is wrong, and I ask my colleagues to vote ``no.''
