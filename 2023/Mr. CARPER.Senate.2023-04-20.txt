 Mr. President, I am honored to be here on the floor with  the Presiding Officer today.   I rise this afternoon to share my gratitude--and I know I speak for  our Presiding Officer and every Member of this body, all 100 of us--for  those who helped to ensure the passage of the Fire Grants and Safety  Act through the Senate today and the weeks leading up to today.   As we all know, a bunch of us as kids, probably, like my sister and  me, wanted to grow up and be firefighters. We ended up finding other  ways to serve our States and communities, but, in the beginning, we  wanted to be firefighters. I might add that our two sons, who are now  grown and off into the world, wanted to be firefighters. Those were the  role models they emulated and wanted to be more like. I think, maybe,  one of the reasons why is that it is widely known that firefighters put  their lives on the line for us not just occasionally or, maybe, during  holidays or on weekends but every day--every day.   So, today, we honor them by passing this legislation and sending it  to our colleagues in the House of Representatives. I think the final  vote, if I noticed, was, I believe, 95 to 2. It is not every day we  pass a bill with 95 votes. That means that just about every Democrat  and every Republican in this body voted for it.   I know I hear a lot from people not just in Delaware but in other  States that I have visited. People will say: Why don't you just work  together? Why can't you guys and gals just work together and get  something done? I would present this as a great example of what we can  accomplish when we do work together.   I especially want to thank a couple of people among our colleagues  whose hard work actually enabled us to work together and to pull  together and to craft this bipartisan compromise.   Let me just start with our fellow Members of the Congressional Fire  Services Caucus and the colleagues on this bill. They include Senator  Gary Peters, Senator Lisa Murkowski, Senator Susan Collins, and, the  last time I checked, yours truly as well.   I also want to thank the entire Congressional Fire Services Caucus  for their bipartisan work on this issue, including the chair of the  Congressional Fire Services Caucus, Senator Jon Tester of Montana.   There were also many organizations that helped us better understand  the needs of our firefighters, and I want to thank them too. Let me  just mention them briefly, if I may: the Congressional Fire Services  Institute, the International Association of Firefighters, the  International Association of Fire Chiefs, the National Volunteer Fire  Council, the National Fallen Firefighters Foundation, and the National  Fire Protection Association. I don't think it is an exaggeration to say  that we could never have done this without their hard work and their  encouragement even today.   I just want to say that most of us in this body will go to bed  tonight--turn  [[Page S1289]]  off the lights and go to sleep--and not have to worry about being  awakened in the middle of the night to go out and save somebody's life.  We are not going to have to be disrupted in our own families or in our  own personal lives to go out and lend a hand if there has been an auto  accident or a truck accident and put our lives at risk. We are not  going to be drawn into a situation with a house on fire.   We had, not too long ago, in Delaware, a situation wherein  firefighters literally rushed into a house that was on fire with the  feeling that there were people literally in the basement of the house.  The floor of the house collapsed, and we lost the lives of several  firefighters.   But none of us have to worry about that--making that kind of  sacrifice and undertaking those kinds of risks.   None of us will have to worry about being the young woman who was a  volunteer firefighter. She worked in the healthcare field, as I recall,  and was a volunteer firefighter. She worked late at night and was  literally driving home on I-95 in Wilmington. It was when we were doing  a reconstruction of I-95 right through the middle of our city.   There was an accident at about 3 or 4 o'clock in the morning, and the  volunteer firefighter, the woman, pulled off. She stopped to provide  help to those who were impacted. The volunteer firefighter was killed.  She was struck by a passing vehicle and lost her life.   None of us have to worry about any of that happening and having to  put ourselves or members of our families in that kind of jeopardy.   The reason is that there are literally tens of thousands of people  from all corners of this country--all different sizes and colors, men,  women, young, and old--who understand that we all have an obligation to  serve and look out for other people even when it puts us in danger and  at risk with our own lives.   So, in passing this legislation--and it goes to the House of  Representatives now; it is not a done deal--our hope is that the House  of Representatives will see fit to embrace it and pass it and send it  on to the President.   I presume that most Presidents--and I have had the privilege to have  known quite a few of them--have great affection for the firefighters in  their own States, where they come from. Nobody has greater affection in  Delaware than does our President. He and I and Chris Coons, as well as  Mike Castle and Pete du Pont, who came before us, share that affection  and that high, high regard.   I heard our President, when he was a mere Senator, say that there are  actually three political parties in Delaware. One of those is Democrat;  one is Republican; and the other is of the folks who are the  firefighters and their families. They stand out in the crowd.   I will just close with this.   I have asked people why they are willing to put their lives in danger  to help save our lives and the lives of others who are in jeopardy. I  have heard from hundreds of men and women who have said that the reason  they do it is that it gives them joy. It gives them joy to know that  they are making a difference with their lives and that they are serving  other people.   One or two, every now and then, will actually invoke the Golden Rule:  to treat other people the way you want to be treated. How would I want  to be treated if my house were on fire? How would I want to be treated  if my son or my daughter were in a traffic accident? If there were a  forest fire surrounding our community, how would I want to be treated?  Well, that is the way I would like to be; so why don't I treat other  people the same way.   With that, this has been a good week, and we are ending here on a  very high note. I want to thank the Presiding Officer for all of his  good work. It has been a pleasure working with him this week and every  week. To the neighbor right across the Delaware River, I am looking  forward to many, many happy trails in the days to come.   We have these young pages who are sitting down here at the foot of  the Presiding Officer and the floor staff. I don't know if any of them,  when they were little kids, had the desire to be a firefighter. My  guess is--actually, some of them are nodding their heads that, yes,  they did. Hopefully, we will never outgrow the spirit that compels and  encourages people to stand up and play the role of a firefighter  whether it is in the middle of the night with a fire or an accident or  whatever it might be. Hopefully, their example and that spirit will be  contagious and infect all of us in a very, very good way.   With that, I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it stand adjourned to convene for  a pro forma session, with no business being conducted, at 10 a.m. on  Friday, April 21; that when the Senate adjourns on Friday, it stand  adjourned until 3 p.m. on Tuesday, April 25; that on Tuesday, following  the prayer and pledge, the morning hour be deemed expired, the Journal  of proceedings be approved to date, the time for the two leaders be  reserved for their use later in the day, and morning business be  closed; that following the conclusion of morning business, the Senate  proceed to executive session and resume consideration of the Jacobs  nomination; further, that the cloture motions filed during today's  session ripen at 5:30 p.m. on Tuesday, April 25.    Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask that it stand adjourned under the previous  order.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 3:30 p.m., adjourned until  Friday, April 21, 2023, at 10 a.m.                            ____________________
