 Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to this amendment.    Mr. Chair, the gentleman's amendment would block the  EPA from regulating methane emissions from sources in the oil and gas  sector.   Methane is a primary component of natural gas and is a potent  greenhouse gas with global warming potential more than 25 times greater  than carbon dioxide.                                time  1630    In 2013, nearly one-third of the methane emissions in the United  States came from oil and gas production, processing, transmission, and  distribution. There is no doubt, no doubt at all that methane  contributes to the increased levels of greenhouse gas concentrations,  which will contribute to long-lasting changes in our climate such as  rising global temperatures, sea level rising, changes in weather and  precipitation patterns.  [[Page H6503]]    Public health risks include more heat waves and drought, worsening  smog, increased intensity of extreme weather events, and increasing the  range of ticks and mosquitoes, which can spread diseases such as Lyme  disease, West Nile Virus, and Zika.   The disgraced former EPA administrator, Scott Pruitt, tried to delay  this rule, but the courts blocked that effort and ruled that the EPA  cannot delay implementation. When is the majority going to stop the  assault on the environment?   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I believe I have the right to close, and  I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, as I said, I oppose this amendment.  Climate change threatens the health and welfare for current and future  generations.   As the gentlemen have pointed out, Mr. Chairman, industry has moved-- has moved, in part, because of pressure from the EPA, and, in part,  because of just the financial loss of allowing this methane gas to  escape into the atmosphere. It is dollars that are burning up.   These are precious resources that we are taking from the Earth, and  we should make sure that we don't waste any of it, and that is why I  think the EPA rule should not be delayed.   As has been pointed out, industry has the ability to capture this  methane. It has the ability to make money from it, and I want to just  make sure that we encourage everyone in the industry to move forward.   Mr. Chairman, let me the give you an example. The Bakken Oil Field,  which is in North Dakota--I am very familiar with it because I spent  many a summer in that area--burns brighter than the entire metropolitan  area of the Twin Cities at night because of the flares from the methane  that are being burnt. That energy should be captured. It should be  saved. We should be conservationists for future generations. We must  take action, and I encourage my colleagues to oppose this amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.  [[Page H6504]]     Mr. Chairman, this amendment is a very harmful rider,  and it would prohibit the EPA from considering the social cost of  carbon as part of rulemaking. The social cost of carbon is an estimate  of economic damages associated with small increases of carbon dioxide  emissions in a given year.   It represents the best scientific information available,  incorporating the impacts from carbon pollution into regulatory  analyses. Weakening or eliminating use of social cost of carbon as a  tool for Federal agencies that would ignore the sobering cost of  health, environment, and economic impacts of extreme weather, rising  temperatures, intensifying smog, and other impacts.   We cannot afford to abandon science while trying to tackle climate  change, so I strongly oppose this amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chairman, I would just like to reiterate again: We  should be using the best scientific information available, and we  should be incorporating the impacts from carbon pollution into  regulatory analysis.   When we see children being hospitalized because of intense smog, more  people suffering respiratory and heart disease, and other impacts from  that, we all pay for that. Whether we pay for it in emergency room  visits, we pay for it in our insurance, there are many ways in which we  are individually paying for the pollution that is created, let alone  recognizing the effects it has on climate change.   So, simply, again, we cannot afford to abandon science while trying  to tackle climate change, and I strongly oppose the gentleman's  amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to this  amendment.    Mr. Chairman, as has been pointed out, this amendment  would prohibit the implementation of Washington State's revised water  quality criteria. This standard protects communities from exposure to  toxic contaminants, such as PCB, arsenic, and mercury in the fish that  they eat.   Being from Minnesota, Mr. Chairman, I understand fish advisories very  well. I often see signs that limit fish consumption for pregnant women,  and for children in particular.   This action, however, would ignore court decisions and the voices of  Native American Tribes, Asian-Pacific Islander communities, and fishing  interests, all of which agree that seafood consumption standards are  necessary in order to protect public health and water quality. In fact,  the Northwest Indian Fisheries Commission has asked that Congress  reject this amendment because it puts the treaty rights that have been  protected and the resources of Tribes in Washington at risk.   Many native families subsist on the fish that they catch. Passing  this amendment lowering water quality standards puts these families at  greater risk of poisoning from their traditional foods.   There is a lot of funding in this bill and some of the other bills  that we have on the floor, Mr. Chairman, that work to prevent diabetes  or to lower risk from diabetes with high blood sugar. Tribal nations  are finding that returning to native foods, such as fish, is a great  and excellent way of preventing or reducing the effects of diabetes.   But after years of failure by Washington State to propose a  protective standard, EPA finally put forth a standard which is more  protective and meets the Clean Water Act requirements.   Now, I understand that the regulated community has always been uneasy  about what stricter standards might be. The revised water quality  criteria take steps to address their concerns.   The standard approved the use of new implementation tools, including  a longer compliance schedule and intake credits. An intake credit means  that, if the water comes to you with a pollutant and you don't  discharge it, you are not responsible for having to remove it. So if  you didn't pollute it, you are not responsible for cleaning it up.  [[Page H6506]]    This amendment would circumvent all of the work that has been done to  devise a standard that protects public health and water quality.   Furthermore, Washington State officials believe that, despite the  Congresswoman's good intentions--and I do believe that these are good  intentions--this amendment would hurt the State of Washington. It would  not actually help the dischargers.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment.    Mr. Chairman, when humans consume contaminated fish, it  results in serious health impacts, such as cancer, organ damage and  reproductive dysfunction, or impairment in brain development.   High fish-consuming communities--as I have mentioned, Native American  Tribes and Asian-Pacific Islander communities--need the protections  afforded by this revised water quality standard.   I would like to, for the Record, again state that this amendment is  not supported by the State of Washington or the Tribal communities in  the area.   I strongly urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment. Clearly, more  work needs to be done. I look forward to having this amendment not pass  and for people to get down to doing the serious work that needs to be  done to address the gentlewoman's concerns.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to this amendment.    Mr. Chair, this amendment would prohibit the EPA from  implementing or enforcing its greenhouse gas and fuel efficiency  standards for medium-and heavy-duty engines.   Specifically, this amendment carves out an exemption for trailers.  These fuel standards were jointly developed by the EPA and the  Department of Transportation, and they will improve fuel efficiency and  cut carbon pollution to reduce the impacts of climate change.   In fact, the EPA and DOT estimate that these standards will lower  CO2 emissions by approximately 1 billion metric tons and cut  fuel costs by $170 million. And cutting fuel costs is always a good  thing to go do.   These standards will achieve greenhouse gas emission reductions that  are nearly equal to those associated with all the energy used by U.S.  residents in 1 year.   These efficiency fuel standards have been in place since 2016, and  companies around the world have already made massive investments in the  cleaner technology. Blocking the rule now would have negative  consequences for human health and the environment, but also for the  economy.   I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, this rule promotes a generation of cleaner,  more fuel efficient trucks. President Obama was right when he said:  ``We are the first generation to feel the impact of climate change and  the last generation who can do something about it.''   This amendment is harmful, and I urge my colleagues to reject it.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to this  amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   First, I would like to make the case that this is a rider, that this  is authorizing on an appropriations amendment, and that the author of  the amendment is in the majority.   The majority could have a hearing in the authorizing committee. It  could come to the floor. It could pass on the floor. The Senate could  move it. And it appears to me that President Trump is in a position to  sign this into law, should he choose to do so.   So there is another alternative vehicle for moving the gentleman's  amendment forward, and that is to do it legislatively and not put it on  an appropriations bill. The Senate has chosen to put no riders on their  appropriations bill.   But the amendment is before us. As pointed out, it would prohibit the  Fish and Wildlife Service from implementing or enforcing the threatened  species listing of the Preble's meadow jumping mouse under the  Endangered Species Act, and it would restrict the Service from offering  any of the critical protections to preserve the species.   Now, once a species is listed under the Endangered Species Act, it is  the role of Fish and Wildlife, and it is primarily permissive, to help  parties comply with the act as they carry out their activities.   I also want to make sure the Record is clear that Fish and Wildlife  Service reviewed the information claiming an alleged taxonomic error in  the listing of the species and found no evidence that the Preble's  meadow jumping mouse is not a valid subspecies.   But under this amendment, the Service would not be able to continue  to offer to recover this species, though the Endangered Species Act  prohibitions would still apply. The Service  [[Page H6508]]  would not be able to work with agencies. The Service would not be able  to work with developers. The Service would not be able to work with  landowners and others to provide ESA compliance.   The Fish and Wildlife Service would be barred from issuing permits or  exemptions. This means that landowners, industry, and other parties who  might need to take the Preble's meadow jumping mouse incidental to  their otherwise lawful activities, such as urban development, would  become vulnerable to third-party lawsuits.   Additionally, this amendment would also limit the Service from  undertaking the required status reviews of the subspecies or from any  initial rulemaking to downlist or to delist the species, as  appropriate.   Mr. Chair, I think it is pretty obvious that this amendment should go  through a different way of coming to the floor, and that is through the  authorizing committee.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time to  close.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time.   The Service has a statutory requirement to implement the Endangered  Species Act. Defunding the agency's ability to fulfill its legal  requirements makes it more vulnerable to lawsuits, and I know that that  is something that we are all trying to avoid here. When you have  lawsuits, it is an unnecessary cost for the taxpayers.   Now, the gentleman's amendment would undermine the Service's ability  to work collaboratively with States, local governments, communities,  and landowners, to conserve this imperiled species. The amendment would  create uncertainty for landowners and also make them vulnerable to  lawsuits.   So we should not pass this amendment. We should be supporting the  Fish and Wildlife Service efforts and not blocking the agency from  doing its job.   Mr. Chair, my commitment to the chairman and to my walking partner in  the tunnels as we all come over for votes is to work with them to make  the Fish and Wildlife Service more responsible to the gentleman's  concerns. But at this time, I have to oppose the amendment.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chairman, I claim time in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Chair, the Service attempts to comply with the  statutory mandate to review the status of listed species every 5 years  to determine whether their classification as threatened or endangered  is still appropriate. However, the Service has a backlog of such  reviews due to funding limitations, such as the 42 percent listing  `reduction contained in this bill.   In this bill, the work that the Service would need to do to comply  with what you want in this bill alone is cut $8 million, so that just  puts them farther behind.  [[Page H6509]]    In recent years, the Service has only been able to complete 100 to  120 reviews per year, which is less than half of what is needed to keep  up with the requirement to review all the species every 5 years. So  that falls on Congress for us not giving them the funds that they need  to do the job effectively and efficiently as you are requesting, and  the way to fix that is to give them the proper funding.   But as the gentleman might be aware, the chairman was given level  funding this year. He did the very best that he could with what he had  to balance things out in the interests of the requests he had from  Members of the House, but this particular $8 million cut just makes  your problem even worse.   This amendment would not remove species, without reviews, from the  list of the species protected by the ESA. So the ESA prohibition  against take would still remain, as would the ability of citizens to  sue to force compliance.   If funding cannot be used to enforce the ESA for species with late  reviews, that will leave the species unprotected.   While the proposed language would prohibit the Service from working  with agencies, developers, landowners, and others to provide ESA  compliance through section 7 consultations or section 10 permits for  Federal or private projects that could potentially affect the species,  it would not affect the ability of third parties to sue those agencies  or landowners and potentially enjoin their projects due to the lack of  ESA compliance.   Mr. Chairman, as I said about the last amendment, we don't need  another rider or extraneous provision in this bill. It is already  overburdened with many, many riders.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to take this language to the  appropriate committees of jurisdiction and work through and see if we  can make positive changes and create win-wins.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment. And I would  urge my colleagues, if they want the backlog to change, to help the  chairman and me get more money into the allocation of this bill so the  chairman and I can work to achieve those goals together.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chair, this amendment would allow those who pollute  the Chesapeake Bay to ignore the Environmental Protection Agency's  water quality standards.   Restoring the Chesapeake Bay and its watershed continues to be a  priority, and a priority for this committee to fund it. The EPA  established the mandatory water quality standards and Congress has  appropriated over $1 billion for the Chesapeake Bay Program to help  States, localities, and businesses meet those needs. This amendment  would jeopardize that funding and have devastating effects on the  health of the bay.   How long will the States and localities be able to meet their  obligations that they agreed to in 2014 in the Chesapeake Bay Watershed  Agreement if the Federal Government's financial assistance goes away?   This is a partnership. We should keep the partnership moving forward.   Furthermore, if this amendment were to become law, it would block the  EPA's ability to enforce the court-ordered settlement requiring the  farm community and agribusinesses to meet watershed specific pollution  limits. It would not, however, relieve the farms and agribusinesses  from the requirements in the settlement.   The State and local governments want to move forward. They want to  keep the partnership moving. But the Farm Bureau and, in fact, some of  the industrial operators they represent don't think that they should be  responsible for controlling the pollution that they dump into our  rivers and streams across the country.   The courts have sided with the EPA on this matter, and the Farm  Bureau continues their pursuit to stop mandatory cleanups through  judicial appeals and through this amendment.   There are enough special interest provisions for big business in this  bill already. We don't need any more.   Mr. Chair, I urge defeat of this amendment, and I reserve the balance  of my time.    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, for more than 35 years, there has been a  regional partnership created through the Chesapeake Bay Program, and it  sought to restore and protect the Nation's largest and most productive  estuaries. That is a partnership with the Federal Government which  includes funding that is working together to achieve those common  goals.   Now, I have nothing before me saying that the State of Virginia, or  any of the regional partners, want to withdraw from this moving forward  to continue to clean up this estuary. This amendment would undermine  decades of work and decades of Federal dollars that the Federal  Government has put in in partnership, and it would have devastating  effects to the health of the bay and the economy it supports.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chairman, I claim time in opposition to this  amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Chairman, as I said earlier, this amendment, like some of the  other amendments that we have seen, could be handled in the authorizing  committee, which the gentleman is a member of, if memory serves me  correctly.   The gentleman is in the majority. Call up, have a hearing, pass  legislation, and then do it in a way that doesn't add more burdensome  amendments and riders to this bill. The Senate is also controlled by  the same party in the majority, and the President is of that party. So  I would encourage the gentleman to go through what I would call regular  order.   This amendment would prohibit the EPA from hiring scientists using  its title 42 authority, the flexible hiring mechanism that allows  agencies to attract and retain staff with outstanding scientific and  technical skills.   This authority, as has been pointed out, is used by the EPA, the CDC,  the NIH, and other agencies that require candidates who have  specialized degrees in areas such as medicine, science, and  engineering.   It is not always easy for the Federal Government to attract high- level professionals who have invested many years in school and could  easily make more money in private practice or academia. In fact, we  have heard that USGS and BLM quite often have problems keeping highly  educated engineers in place because the private sector comes and offers  them so much more money.   So the Federal Government has found it wise to allow these agencies  to provide some additional funding to retain and recruit these  employees. We should want to have the best and the brightest working  for us and the American people--the best doctors, the best scientists,  and the best engineers. So I am disappointed that the gentleman does  not believe such highly specialized employees deserve the title 42  designation.   With our Nation facing crises like Lyme's disease, PFAS in our  drinking water, and climate change, we should be investing in our  scientists. We should be encouraging them to seek employment with the  Federal Government.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, once again, this amendment could go  through a different order and not be placed onto an appropriations  bill.   This is a shortsighted amendment. I think it deserves to have a fair  and open vetting with the House concentrated on just what this would  mean to the EPA. So I don't think we should attack Federal employees  who sometimes have chosen to not receive as much compensation and  devote their lives to public service.   Mr. Chairman, I urge defeat of the amendment, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim time in opposition.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Chairman, I understand that the amendment is going to be  withdrawn, but let me explain what this language would have done. To  the best of my knowledge, the leases haven't been permanently withdrawn  yet.   This language would have prevented the Forest Service and the  Interior Department from acting to protect our Nation's most visited  wilderness area. The Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness is located  in northern Minnesota, and it is one of the last truly undisturbed wild  places in America.   It is a national treasure, and it is under threat from sulfide-ore  copper mining. The proposed mine is next to the wilderness. There is no  buffer, and there is no barrier here. It is literally in the same  water.   Sulfide-ore mining is the most toxic industry in America. It pollutes  waterways with acid drainage that contains arsenic, mercury, and lead.   The Forest Service recognized how damaging this type of mining could  be to the Boundary Waters, so they proposed a 20-year halt to Federal  mine leases in the watershed. They were urged to study this withdrawal  by our Governor from Minnesota, Tribal Governments, and people from all  across America who were worried that sulfide mining could destroy the  surrounding waters and lands.   They have a right to be worried. All these mines have failed. In  2014, a sulfide-ore mine in British Columbia failed, dumping billions  of liters of toxic sludge, causing permanent environmental damage.   So the Forest Service wisely decided to conduct a science-based  assessment to see if mineral withdrawal would make sense for the water- intensive ecosystem of our Boundary Waters.   Now, Mr. Chairman, despite what you might hear about what the  gentleman said, the proposed mining withdrawal is not some overreach or  some past or current administration being out of line. In 1976,  Congress established this exact review process under the Federal Land  Policy and Management Act. Congress intentionally provided a way to  protect our country's natural treasures and vulnerable places.   If the gentleman's amendment would have come to the floor for a vote  and would have passed again, it would have stopped that review process.  It would make the withdrawal study meaningless, because it dictates the  outcome.   If this amendment had been on the floor and it would pass, the  withdrawal of the Boundary Waters from sulfide-ore mining would have  been off the table no matter what the study would have said is best for  the wilderness.   In every conversation I have had, and I have had many, with Secretary  Zinke and Secretary Perdue, they have told me the same thing: The study  should be completed.   So I hope my colleagues and the President would reject having these  leases go through without having a study.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, may I inquire as to how much time I have  remaining.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from Minnesota (Mr. Paulsen).    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I reserved my time. The gentleman has  withdrawn the amendment. Even though the amendment has been withdrawn,  I don't have the right to close or I would have used my time.   Could the Parliamentarian instruct me as to if my time is actually  gone.    Mr. Chair, I move to strike the last word.    Mr. Chair, we do have a tradition of mining in  Minnesota--taconite mining is the new mining--and I just want to  reiterate the fact that these leases are for mining and the company  that is looking to mine is sulfide-ore mining.   But, Mr. Chairman, I want to close by sharing some words from the  founding members of Kids for the Boundary Waters. I have their  handwritten notes. To have handwritten notes from America's young  adults these days is pretty special.   From Callie: ``This unique place shaped my life. The Boundary Waters  helped me to realize my potential.''   From Henry: ``I have watched year after year as families like my own  have grown together in this wilderness.''   From Julia: ``The pristine, untainted waters of the Boundary Waters  are essential to the quality and uniqueness of the journeys of  visitors.''   From Tommaso: ``I am more committed than ever to help preserve and  protect this beautiful and unique ecosystem for future generations.''   From Elsa: ``Once the watershed faces sulfide-ore copper mining, it  will never be the same.''   From Joseph, who started this organization during his fight with  leukemia: ``What cancer has taught me for sure is that sometimes life  only gives you one chance to get things right, and this is our one  chance to protect the Boundary Waters.''   I urge my colleagues and others to join me in standing with these  young, inspiring people and to oppose the lease renewal.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.                   Amendment No. 56 Offered by Mr. Grothman     Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to this amendment.    Mr. Chairman, the gentleman from Alaska has been  enlightening me more about placer mining, and I appreciate learning  more; but I have some questions that remain unanswered, so that is why  I have opposition to the gentleman's amendment.                                time  1815    I understand that between 400 and 600 miles of BLM-managed streams  have historic or active placer mining impacts, and there is a legacy of  historic claim with reduction of ecosystem function.   Now, BLM continues various outreach activities, including public  meetings and interactions with individual miners, and is working with  industry to incorporate best management practices and new reclamation  techniques to accelerate stream recovery. I think that would be a good  thing.   Of course, reclamation activities may be necessary, and what they are  looking to do is to increase the cost to the miners, which the  gentleman is objecting to, if I understand correctly, in order to get  these streams and ecosystems back up to function.   This amendment would prohibit assessing the cost of the reclamation  areas to placer miners who are profiting from mineral extraction on  BLM-managed land.   I personally believe the American taxpayer should not shoulder the  burden of the restoration costs, that responsible parties should.   So the gentleman will probably be enlightening me over the next  couple of months on what he thinks might be able to be worked out so  that both parties feel that the burden is not over-burdensome, but  there is adequate reclamation going forward.   Mr. Chair, at this time I have to oppose the amendment, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to this  amendment.    Mr. Chair, it has been pointed out that this amendment  would block the EPA from regulating air pollution under section 115 of  the Clean Air Act, which deals with international pollution and allows  the United States to work with other countries on transboundary  pollution issues.   Being a State that borders Canada, we enter into agreements with them  many times to make sure that both of our countries are working together  in the best interest of their citizens.   This gentleman has offered this amendment for a number of years. It  used to be the amendment to torpedo the climate change agreement, but  President Trump took care of that, so I am a little unclear as to why  it is continuing to be offered.   Section 115 could be a tool in our toolbox for a path to achieve  reduction targets for greenhouse gases. The gentleman's amendment would  prohibit both the EPA and the Trump White House from even developing a  well-considered recommendation as to whether or not to use this  authority.   The President might, in some circumstances, want to work with another  country to address something. This to me is just the latest in a long  line of attacks on clean air and on the EPA's authority to respond to  the urgent threat of climate change.   A vote for this amendment is another vote, in my opinion, for climate  denial and to block action to curb carbon pollution that is driving our  dangerous climate change.   We see the hurricanes getting stronger, the wildfires raging  stronger, and now we are seeing the glaciers melt.   Mr. Chair, so I would urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment and  to leave this tool in the toolbox for the Republican administrator at  EPA, as well as for the Republican person who is serving in the White  House. Let's leave them one tool in the toolbox in case they want to  take it out and use it.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to this  amendment.    Mr. Chairman, this amendment clearly would prohibit  Fish and Wildlife Service from implementing or enforcing the endangered  species listing of the New Mexico jumping mouse under the Endangered  Species Act. It would restrict the Service from offering critical  protections to preserve the species.   This amendment is harmful. Once a species is listed under the  Endangered Species Act, the role of Fish and Wildlife is primarily  permissive, helping parties comply with the act as they carry out their  activities.   Now, the majority of the habitat of the New Mexico jumping mouse is  on Federal land, and Fish and Wildlife is working with the Forest  Service to develop conservation measures that will protect the mouse  while allowing livestock grazing on Forest Service lands and assuring  adequate water for these cattle.   Since the endangered species listing, members of the livestock  community  [[Page H6518]]  have voiced concern about their impacts to people who recreate and make  their livelihood on Forest Service lands, which result from addressing  the needs of the mouse.   The Fish and Wildlife Service has established three working groups to  address these concerns, and they have come up with some creative  solutions, like establishing cattle lanes to assure cattle can have  access to water while protecting the vegetation necessary for the  survival of the mouse.   We have been in contact, and we find that there is a lot of  excitement and there is a lot of cooperation going on. So I would like  to work with the Service to make sure that we give this a full chance  of working.                                time  1830    Under this amendment, the Service would not be able to continue to  recover this species, though all the Endangered Species Act  prohibitions would still apply. So the Service wouldn't be able to  continue to recover the species under this amendment, but all the other  activities of the Endangered Species Act would still apply. So the  Service wouldn't be able to work collaboratively any longer with  stakeholders to provide ESA compliance.   The Service has a statutory requirement to implement the Endangered  Species Act. Defunding the Agency's ability to fulfill these legal  requirements just makes the Agency and the Federal Government more  vulnerable to lawsuits, which is an unnecessary cost for American  taxpayers.   Additionally, this amendment would limit the Service from undertaking  a required status review of the subspecies or from initiating any  rulemaking to downlist or even delist this species, when it became  appropriate.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, the gentleman wasn't here earlier,  because he was attending to other work and now has come down to do his  amendment, but I have been making the case that this type of  authorizing language, these types of debates and discussions, should be  taking place in the authorizing committee where we can bring in the  Service, bring in the ranchers, find out what we need to do better to  create win-wins.   When we just come and put things on the appropriations bill, it  doesn't allow for that full vetting. It doesn't allow us that  opportunity to work with the chairman of the Appropriations Committee  after the authorizing committee is coming through and figuring out  where we need to adjust the budget, or what we need to do, or how we  need to do oversight to make sure that the Fish and Wildlife Service is  doing things that the gentleman is talking about.   So, an interesting thing, we got some information from the Service,  and the Service has been working with the research community to expand  the survey of the jumping mouse outside its currently known occupied  areas. The goal of this expansion effort is to document additional  populations. If they document additional populations, we could possibly  move toward downlisting or delisting the species, as appropriate. But  your amendment, unfortunately, would block that.   I would like to see this type of amendment be brought up under the  majority--the majority is the same in the Senate, and the majority is  in control of the White House--and have an opportunity to do the right  kind of oversight to make sure that, when we are doing legislation with  the best of intentions--if this survey were to come back and say that  we could downlist or delist the species, this amendment would prohibit  us from doing it.   So, at this time, I will oppose the gentleman's amendment. But I  thank him for bringing this attention to the floor, and I will look  more into it.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chairman, I claim time in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Chairman, in 2016, the Service officially removed  the lesser prairie chicken from the Federal list of endangered and  threatened wildlife in accordance with the September 2015 court order  vacating the Service's 2014 delisting determination, as the gentleman  pointed out.   Now, the administration action was taken in light of the decision not  to appeal the court's ruling. So they decided they weren't going to  appeal, but they were going to try to move forward.   So the Service is currently conducting a species status assessment to  characterize the current and future conditions of the lesser prairie  chicken. The assessment takes into account both the threats and  conservation efforts.   When I was in Nevada--I wasn't in your State, sir, but I was in  Nevada with one of our other colleagues--I saw amazing work that was  being done in collaboration, in fact, with an energy company, amazing  work being done.   The gentleman from Nevada was unable to produce one prairie chicken  for me to see that morning when we were out, but I believe that they  are there and that the conservation is working, in spite of the fact  that I didn't get to see one lesser prairie chicken.   But going back, the draft report was shared with peer and partner  reviews, and the Service is working with them to get feedback. If the  Service determines the listing of the lesser prairie chicken as  threatened or endangered is warranted, it is unlikely that any  rulemaking could be completed before 2018. So that would take 2 years,  in which Congress could take action.   I would like the Service to be able to continue working closely with  its partners, including State fish and wildlife agencies, the Western  Association of Fish and Wildlife Agency, the U.S. Department of  Agriculture, industry, private landowners, and other partners, in the  interest of conserving the lesser prairie chicken.   So what the amendment does, and why I am objecting to it, it halts,  it stops, that transparent process that is working properly, that I saw  in the field working properly and providing ample opportunity for  public comment in how we could move forward.   So this amendment would make the decision. It would make the decision  final about the conservation of the species on the basis of what is  not, in my opinion, good science. So, at this time, I urge my  colleagues to oppose this amendment, and I hope all partners continue  to work together.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to this amendment.    This amendment seeks to block collaborative water  management in California. Such management is aimed at benefiting all  water users, cities, farmers, Tribes, the fishing industry, and  recreation interests.   Specifically, this amendment blocks Federal compliance with the  California Bay-Delta Plan, which is a plan being developed by the State  of California to prevent the collapse of California's iconic salmon  fisheries, and to preserve all beneficial use of the State's water.  [[Page H6522]]    After a decade of research and public outreach, the State government  is close to finalizing the Bay-Delta Plan. It will increase water flows  into the California Bay-Delta from the San Joaquin River. The increased  flows will improve salmon survival and prevent an unfolding ecological  crisis in the Bay-Delta, which is key for the environment for the Bay  and the Pacific Northwest fisheries, one of the most valuable and  unique ecosystems in the world.   While multiple factors have contributed to recent salmon declines, a  key factor has been unsustainably large water diversions from the  California rivers. The Bay-Delta seeks to address this by reducing  diversions and increasing river flow.   Mr. Chair, this obviously is an amendment which the author is very  passionate about. This also is something that the State of California  has engaged in.   This amendment, in my opinion, once again, should be something that  should be handled in an authorizing committee so the State of  California can come in, the gentleman and his proponents of what the  State is doing can have a discussion, and then the authorizers can work  their will and let the appropriators know whether or not to move  forward on this.   To do this amendment here shuts out a full, transparent discussion  about what should or should not take place in the State of California,  where the California citizens all across the State have had input with  their elected officials on how to move forward.   So this amendment seeks to undermine what appears to be a successful  implementation of the Bay-Delta Plan, which California has seen as a  necessary step toward preventing precious fishery declines and the loss  of thousands of jobs that rely on healthy fish and functioning  ecosystems.   Mr. Chairman, I oppose this amendment, and I reserve the balance of  my time.    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, could I inquire as to how much time both  sides have?    Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. McNerney).    Mr. Chairman, at this time I will make my remarks to  close.   This amendment is an attempt to get the Congress involved in  undermining a State's rights and its prerogatives.   The Federal Government should be assisting California in ways to  restore the State's rivers and recover needed fisheries, instead of  trying to interfere with obstruction from Washington. I often hear my  colleagues say that Washington should get out of the way. In this case,  I totally agree.   I urge my colleagues to defeat this amendment.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to this  amendment.    Mr. Chair, this amendment clearly would prohibit Fish  and Wildlife Service from enforcing limitations or prohibitions on the  use of genetically modified seed in commercial agricultural operations  conducted on national wildlife refuges.   As the gentleman pointed out, in 2014, a decision to curtail the use  of genetically modified seeds or crops, GMOs, for use on National  Wildlife Refuge System lands by 2016 grew out of several years of  litigation successfully brought against U.S. Fish and Wildlife.   During the term of the litigation, the courts did not allow the use  of GMOs. As a result of this restriction, the refuges found that they  were able to meet their biological objectives and accomplish their  wildlife management purposes without the use of GMOs and that GMO use  could be curtailed nationwide.   This approach avoids costly litigation for the taxpayers and the need  for additional site-specific compatibility determinations and NEPA  analysis of GMO crops. It is a saver of the taxpayers' dollars.   Fish and Wildlife Service has proven over several years that they can  accomplish their wildlife objectives without the use of GMOs. However,  Fish and Wildlife policy on biological diversity, integrity, and  environmental health does allow for the use of GMOs when it is  essential to accomplish the refuge purposes and is approved by the  Regional Refuge Chief.   This amendment jeopardizes the current FWS policy that is based on  years of experience. We should be supporting Fish and Wildlife Service  and its efforts, not blocking the agency from doing its job.   Mr. Chair, once again, this is the appropriations portion of Fish and  Wildlife. This clearly is something that has gone through the court  system, that has gone through authorization. It is a policy discussion  and it should be done in the policy committee. It should be done where  people can come in and testify and have their debate in full  transparency. It should be done then and brought to the floor.   Mr. Chair, the majority controls the House, the Senate, and the White  House. I would encourage the author of the amendment to not use the  appropriation bills to put more riders on.   The gentleman may or may not be aware, Mr. Chair, that the Senate has  no riders on its bill at all. And I believe that this could really put  the chairman and myself, as the ranking member, possibly at a  disadvantage when we go to reallocate those precious dollars, with all  the requests that we have had on the floor over the past 2 days, when  we go into doing what our job is, the appropriations.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I thank the gentlewoman from Texas for this  opportunity. I also thank the chairman of our subcommittee for  accepting the amendment.   Mr. Chair, many cities don't have urban wildlife refuges nearby, and  to address that challenge, the Service has 21 Urban Wildlife Refuge  Partnerships spanning the country. These partnerships have nourished an  appreciation of wildlife conservation to new audiences, and I have seen  them in action, empowering local community organizations to inspire  conservation in local parks and other natural areas.   I just want to list a few of these urban partnerships that can be  found: New Haven; Chicago; Houston; Providence; Seattle; Baltimore; Los  Angeles; Albuquerque; Santa Barbara; Yonkers; New Orleans; Denver;  Philadelphia; Atlanta; Springfield, Massachusetts; Anchorage;  Cincinnati; the twin cities of St. Paul and Minneapolis, St. Paul being  my hometown; Elizabeth, New Jersey; West Palm Beach, Florida; San Juan;  and Alamo, Texas.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to learn more about this program.   Once again, I thank the gentlewoman for the time, and I thank  Chairman Calvert for accepting this amendment.    Mr. Chair, I would like to thank the gentlewoman from  Texas for the time, and I would like to commend the chairman of the  subcommittee for accepting this amendment.   The chairman and I know the importance of museums and the wealth of  knowledge that they share with the American public. And when we have  the Smithsonian Day at our hearings, when the chairman puts the gavel  down, everybody is in attendance to see what the Smithsonian is going  to bring to the history lesson that it is going to share with the  Members of our committee.   We are inspired, just as these museums inspire people of all ages, to  better understand our world, and our place in it.   I am very pleased that the Smithsonian is going to be able to go  forward with its public outreach programs, including exhibitions,  programs, and online resources, which anybody can access. It ensures  that as many Americans as possible can benefit from their vast  collections.   At the Science Museum of Minnesota, we call it ``Museum in a Box,''  and I am glad the Smithsonian is going to continue with that.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to this  amendment.    Mr. Chair, I want my colleagues to listen closely to  what this amendment does. It prohibits funds to support the EPA's  Environmental Justice Small Grants Program, which, since its inception  in 1994, has awarded funding to local and Tribal organizations working  with communities facing environmental justice issues.   These grants support and empower low-income communities to understand  and address exposure to environmental harms and risks.   If there is a problem, if there is a grant that hasn't been done  properly, then it is Congress' responsibility to do oversight. So, in  my opinion, there should be no Member of this body that supports  cutting these critical funds. If there are problems, we should be  requesting oversight.   This is a case of David versus Goliath. With this amendment, small  communities would be left defenseless when confronted with corporations  that come in and sometimes cause illness due to their underlying  pursuit of profit over human health.   Examples of these programs supported by these grants are: a program  to promote Baltimore residents' awareness of lead health risks and lead  abatement services. It is important to provide education:   Working with the residents in Puerto Rico to clean up coastal areas  and reduce solid waste and aquatic debris. I was just recently in  Puerto Rico watching the EPA work and clean up the debris, the  unimaginable debris of the hurricanes that went through last year.   Working in Lawrence, Massachusetts, in one of the poorest and most  populated cities in New England to educate families about lead  contamination in soil, and, yes, sometimes that means knowing what is  in the garden, what is in the yard, what is in the playground, as  children touch soil contaminated by lead and then touch their faces and  their mouths. The negative effect of growing vegetables in lead- contaminated soil can be life changing for children.   Mr. Chair, I strongly oppose this amendment, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I would gently remind the gentleman from  Georgia that Puerto Rico is a territory of the United States. It is not  a foreign entity.   I would like to yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from California  (Mr. Calvert), my dear friend and chairman of the committee.    Mr. Chairman, may I inquire how much time I have  remaining?    Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Mr. Chairman, in closing, I just have to ask the  question. Tragedies like the water crisis in Flint, Michigan,  demonstrate the issues surrounding environmental justice to continue to  persist in our country. So the question is: When did it become partisan  to ensure children drink clean water?   This amendment ignores the need to identify and address  disproportionately high adverse human health and environmental effects  on minority and low-income populations. I urge, I implore the gentleman  from Georgia, Mr. Chair, if he suspects that there is waste in this  program, let's do the oversight together.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment, and to  stand with communities and the disenfranchised over corporations.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to this  amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I am a little confused, because it would  be only when the Trump administration would decide to be a party of a  lawsuit that this judgment would ever be used. So I would assume that  you would trust the Trump administration to be overly judicious before  involving itself with any suit, would you not?   I yield to the gentleman from Missouri.    Reclaiming my time, Mr. Chairman, that is why I am  confused, because this would be the Trump administration. The gentleman  said, if I heard him correctly, Mr. Chair, that he would expect the  Trump administration to be very judicious in using this.  [[Page H6530]]    So I find this amendment is extraneous. It puts the same parameters  on attorneys' fees under the ESA, the Clean Air Act, and the Federal  Water Pollution Control Act that are already in place for attorneys'  fees under the Equal Access to Justice Act.   The Equal Access to Justice Act already caps the hourly rate of  attorneys' fees, unless the court determines an increase in the cost of  living or special factors such as limited availability of qualified  attorneys for the proceedings justifies a higher fee. And it requires  the party to be a prevailing party.   Mr. Chairman, we don't need to add an extraneous, redundant provision  to a bill that is already overburdened with harmful legislative riders,  especially when I trust that the Trump administration would be very  limited and very judicious in ever using this.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment. I reserve  the balance of my time and my right to close.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the right to close.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   This amendment is unnecessary and duplicative. The Equal Access to  Justice Act already provides a framework for legal fees related to  cases in which the Federal Government is a party. I find myself  standing here as a Democrat, a person who has been resisting almost  everything that President Trump has been trying to do in the  environmental arena and other arenas that affect healthcare and so much  more, but I find myself defending the Trump administration's right in  which they are a party to participate in the Equal Access to Justice  Act, just as I did for President Obama's administration.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to stop, take a minute, think  about what this amendment is really doing, and agree with me that we  should oppose this amendment. We should not stop the Federal Government  when it is involved in cases and is a party from participating in the  Equal Access to Justice Act.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.
