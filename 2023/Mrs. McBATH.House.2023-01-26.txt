 Mr. Speaker, there have been 40 separate mass shootings  since the year began. This weekend, 18 people were murdered within  hours of each other.   That is it. That is all there is to say.   What do these mass murders all have in common? Easy access to  unregulated firearms. That is the problem.   It cannot get any clearer. Without easy access to unregulated  firearms,  [[Page H349]]  these mass murders do not happen; these families do not grieve; and  this country does not live in fear.   Without easy access to unregulated firearms, we save lives. It is  just that simple. It is truly that simple.   This type of bloodshed doesn't happen in other developed nations  around the world, only here in the United States of America. Other  nations don't allow unfettered access to unregulated firearms.   This is not who we are supposed to be as America. We should feel safe  in our communities.                            ____________________
