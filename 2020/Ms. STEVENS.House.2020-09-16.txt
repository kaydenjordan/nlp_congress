Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on the measure under  consideration.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may  consume.   I was proud to co-introduce this important legislation with my  colleague, Congressman Max Rose, and I would like to start by thanking  him for his work and leadership on this bill and on behalf of Danny and  his family.   In 2016, 13-year-old Daniel Fitzpatrick took his life as a direct  result of bullying at school.   To honor Danny and to help save countless other young lives, his  family committed to advocacy and established the Danny's Angel Network  Nurturing Youth, DANNY, foundation to raise awareness and end bullying  in schools.   One out of every five kids in this country experiences bullying. The  problem has grown and moved from beyond the playground to the internet  as students spend more and more time online.   Bullying contributes to emotional and mental health problems for  children across this country and, in far too many cases, has driven  kids to suicide. In fact, a recently released CDC report stated that  suicide of youth ages 10 to 24 has increased by nearly 60 percent in  the last 10 years.   This is an issue that deserves our consideration, deserves research,  and deserves action. We simply must do more to prevent bullying and its  devastating consequences.   Danny's Law would establish an antibullying roundtable, a commission  tasked with studying bullying in elementary and secondary schools and  producing a report with best practices to address it.   While we cannot bring back those we have lost to bullying and  suicide, this commission will give schools and educators the tools to  end bullying--something I hear from my constituents far too often, from  my schools, from my educators--and it will ensure that every student  can grow and learn in a safe and welcoming environment.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this  legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  New York (Mr. Rose), the author of this bill.    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from New York.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Pennsylvania (Ms. Wild).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentlewoman from Texas.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   I urge my colleagues today to support H.R. 3659.   Once again, I want to thank and commend my colleague, Congressman Max  Rose, for his incredible leadership. He has taken tragedy and turned it  into action.   Our colleagues are absolutely right that this deserves the full  attention of our government, and it is why we are taking this to the  highest level of our government, to combat bullying.   This bill honors the life of Danny Fitzpatrick, and it recognizes  what so many families are working to prevent, what so many families and  communities across this country never want to see happen. It will help  end bullying. It will protect students across this country, and I look  forward to seeing this bill become law.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
