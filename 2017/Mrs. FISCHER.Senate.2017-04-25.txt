 Mr. President, I rise today to remember another of  Nebraska's fallen heroes--those young men and women who have given  their lives defending our freedom in Iraq and Afghanistan. They all  have different stories. Their families all have the same request:  Remember their sacrifice. By telling the stories of these heroes here  on the Senate floor, we honor the request of these Gold Star families.
