 Mr. Speaker, first off, I want the  folks in Texas and Louisiana to know that South Carolina continues to  pray for the folks that live in the affected areas, and all of the  States that are facing a potential hurricane.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to express support for designation of the first  Saturday of May as National Auctioneers Day and the preceding week as  National Auctioneers Week. Auctioneering is one of history's oldest  professions.   I was an auctioneer for 16-plus years before coming to Congress. As  an auctioneer, I saw firsthand the purest form of buying and selling.  Auctions bring buyers and sellers together where the highest price is  established through competitive bidding.   Auctions continue to be the fairest, most transparent and effective  means of establishing fair market value.   The National Auctioneers Association and its members strive to  advance the auction method of marketing and uphold the highest  standards of professionalism in serving the American public. These  professionals are proud businessowners who support their communities.   For more than 40 years, National Auctioneers Day has been observed by  State and local governments and private organizations across the U.S.  The designation of National Auctioneers Day and National Auctioneers  Week will heighten the public awareness of the contributions made by  auction professionals to our Nation's history and economy.   Mr. Speaker, I call upon the House of Representatives to support this  designation and America's auctioneers.                            ____________________
