 Mr. Speaker, this week, as February becomes March,  Black History Month comes to an end. But I want to be clear, every  month is Black History Month because Black history is American history.   Today, I am thinking of the amazing Black women and men who inspire  us daily and who changed the world.   I am thinking of Ruby Bridges who, at only 6 years old, became the  first Black student to integrate a southern elementary school.   I am thinking of Gwinnett's own Beauty Baldwin, the first Black woman  to be a school superintendent in Georgia.   I am thinking of Hank Aaron, who showed the world the meaning of  Black excellence when he broke Babe Ruth's home run record, and he was  a proud Georgian.   I am thinking of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., an Atlanta preacher who  shared his dream with the world and, in the process, changed it  forever.   And I am thinking of Senator Raphael Warnock, who preached from the  same pulpit as Dr. King, and who now follows in his footsteps as an  advocate for change.                                time  1030    I am thinking of Kamala Harris, our Nation's first Black and first  female Vice President, and of all the Black and Brown girls around the  country who are finally able to look at the White House and see  themselves reflected there.   Finally, I am thinking of our beloved Georgia friend, mentor, and  colleague, John Lewis. Congressman Lewis would have turned 81 this  weekend. Congressman Lewis spent his life getting into good trouble.   At 21, he was one of the original 13 Freedom Riders. At 23, as the  chairman of SNCC, he spoke at the March on Washington. At 25, he led  the march from Selma to Montgomery, in the process withstanding all the  violence and hatred local and State officials could throw at him.   Congressman Lewis went on to serve Atlanta on both the city council  and in Congress for more than 35 years, becoming the conscience of the  Congress.   The tireless work of heroes like John Lewis pushes me to continue  pursuing equitable and just policies. Over the past 2 years, our  country has had a much-needed awakening to the systemic inequality  people of color face every single day. I promise to continue using my  privilege as a Member of Congress to try to break down that inequality  wherever it is found.   In that spirit, I am proud to be cosponsoring some critical pieces of  legislation being considered in Congress: H.R. 1, the For the People  Act, a transformational bill that seeks to ensure free and fair  elections and easy access to the ballot box, to secure nonpartisan  redistricting, and to put people over dark money and special interests  in elections; the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, the first-ever  bold, comprehensive approach to holding police accountable, changing  the culture of law enforcement and building trust between law  enforcement and our communities by addressing systemic racism and  biases in order to help save lives; H.R. 40, which creates a commission  to study reparations; H.R. 55, the Emmett Till Antilynching Act; H.R.  959 to address the Black maternal mortality crisis in America; a  resolution to recognize the difficulty Black veterans face when  returning home after serving our country; and a resolution to award the  Congressional Gold Medal, Congress' highest honor, to the Freedom  Riders.   Of course, while it hasn't been introduced, you can be certain my  name will be one of the first ones signed up to cosponsor the John  Lewis Voting Rights Act, which will restore and modernize portions of  the Voting Rights Act scrapped by the Supreme Court. The right to vote  is sacred. John Lewis knew that better than most, and we must protect  it.   Nor is it enough to sign on to these pieces of legislation and call  it a day. Just as Black history should be celebrated every month, every  piece of legislation we consider must also be looked at for how it will  impact our Black communities.   Mr. Speaker, as I deliver remarks today in celebration of Black  History Month, I would be wrong to not acknowledge that yesterday was  the 1-year anniversary of the murder--yes, the murder--of Ahmaud  Arbery. A young man from my State of Georgia, Ahmaud was killed while  going out for a jog, a simple luxury that so many of us enjoy without  fear of harm.   Ahmaud's case and the way it was handled continue to show us all that  inherent biases and systemic racism remain prevalent in our society. We  here on this floor must do everything we can to break those barriers  down. You have my word, I will continue to do so.                            ____________________
