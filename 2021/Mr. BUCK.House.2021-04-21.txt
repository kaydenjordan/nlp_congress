 Madam Speaker, there is a humanitarian crisis on our  southern border. Every day, more migrants surge towards the border and  overwhelm the dedicated men and women of Customs and Border Protection.   CBP is facing the most dramatic increase in detentions and illegal  crossings in nearly 15 years, with no end in sight and no plan to  address the situation articulated and caused by the Biden  administration.   Mr. Biden revoked the remain in Mexico policy and the safe third  country agreements with Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador. He  stopped building the wall. He tapped Vice President Kamala Harris to  coordinate the response to this humanitarian crisis almost a month ago.  She still  [[Page H2022]]  hasn't visited the border, but she has had time to stop at a Chicago  bakery and grab a slice of cake for her plane ride home.   The Vice President's message to the American communities being  overrun with illegal immigrants is, apparently, ``let them eat cake,''  while the President rolls out the welcome mat to illegal immigrants  pouring over our border.   My colleagues across the aisle want to fund lawyers for illegal  immigrants and defund the police. They don't care if the American  people are protected, but they want to make sure their friends in the  local bar association get paid to represent criminals flooding into our  country.   Democrats don't have time to fix our broken immigration system, but  they have time to visit Minnesota and incite riots.                                time  1445    During the current crisis, immigration backlogs have gotten so  extreme that illegal migrants are being housed in convention centers  and hotels across the country. My liberal colleagues should try  addressing the rising homeless problem with Americans rather than  placing illegal immigrants in hotels.   Just 2 weeks ago, the CBP announced the arrest of two men on the  FBI's terrorism watch list as they tried to cross the southern border.  If this legislation was enacted, Americans would have paid for their  lawyers to help these terrorists stay in our country.   This is a dangerous precedent that prevents our existing border  security apparatus from working properly.
