 Mr. Speaker, I was absent in the House Chamber for  rollcall votes 642 through 649 on Thursday, November 30, 2017, as a  result of the flu. Had I been present, I would have voted ``aye'' on  rollcall vote 642, ``nay'' on rollcall vote 643, ``nay'' on rollcall  vote 644, ``nay'' on rollcall vote 645, ``aye'' on rollcall vote 646,  ``aye'' on rollcall vote 647, ``nay'' on rollcall vote 648, and ``aye''  on rollcall vote 649.                             personal explanation
