 I thank the Senator from Vermont.                            ____________________     Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the immediate consideration of S. 3749, introduced earlier  today by Senator Klobuchar and myself.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be  considered read a third time and passed and the motion to reconsider be  considered and laid upon the table.    Madam President, while our colleagues show their affection  for Senator McCaskill, let me talk a little bit about my relationship  with her and her service to our State. She chose not to do that, but  she has served Missourians at every level of government--as a county  legislator, as a State legislator, as an extraordinary prosecutor, and  as the State auditor, when her particular talent to find out exactly  what was going wrong and point it out was maybe at its best use, and 12  years in the U.S. Senate.   I know that not too long ago Claire and Joe took their family on a  vacation to a ranch in the West. I was thinking about that, and  thinking about her reminded me of a story I had heard about a wrangler  at one of those ranches, who was just perfect on a horse. Somebody who  was visiting asked: How do you get that good riding a horse?   He said: Well, first of all, you get on the horse and you put your  boot in the stirrup. You put your heel right up against the back of the  stirrup. You sit easily in the saddle, and you ride for about 30 years.  You ride for about 30 years.   If you had paid any attention to either the last Senate campaign in  Missouri or the one I was involved in before that, you heard a lot  about 30 years. In the case of Senator McCaskill and me, we have our  own 30 years. About that long ago, she was starting her second term in  the Missouri legislature--smart, well-prepared, all she always is. I  was the first Republican elected secretary of state in 52 years and  only a couple years older than her. In fact, we never had much of a  fight about who was going to be called a senior Senator because neither  wanted to be the particular senior anything at this point, but we began  to work together.   Claire was smart, she was quick, she was funny, she was insightful,  and she was always well-prepared. She was also, by the way, on the  Appropriations Committee that I had to report to. The questions were  always tough and usually I could answer them. Even then, I often  wondered how somebody as smart and well-prepared as Claire could so  often wind up on the wrong side of the issue of the day based on my  view of the issue of the day. We still have that--the 8 years we were  here together.   Let me tell you, on anything that involved Missouri, I think you  would have a hard time finding an exception where we didn't get to the  same place, where we didn't get there quickly, and where we didn't do  everything we both could do to figure out how to reach a conclusion.   In fact, all week I was thinking, is there any way I can get to St.  Louis to where the property transfer will be made for the new NGA, the  National Geospatial West facility--$1.3 billion facility--right where  Pruitt-Igoe used to be, something new that will be the center of  activity and something that was built at the site of a really bad  government decision. We worked very hard to get that done. I was  thinking, I am going to do that, until I found out it wasn't going to  be next Tuesday; it was going to be today when Senator McCaskill was  going to give this speech, and I knew I needed to be here and wanted to  be here for that.   I also say that our staff--and her Washington staff is here--our  staff in Washington, our staff in Missouri, to the best of my  knowledge, have always worked closely on everything. They would even be  at meetings where one of them would be explaining why I voted the way I  did and the other would be explaining why Claire voted the way she did,  and they would often ride together. That was the way we worked together  on citizen concerns, on Missouri concerns. That happened here as well.   Claire talked about her family. Joe Shepard, a great friend of mine  for--frankly, Joe was helping me before he started helping Claire, but  she pretty well totally converted him to her side  [[Page S7558]]  of the aisle, but we are still good friends.   I have gotten to know Claire's sisters and appreciate her sisters.  They are the best. They are always there for her. Occasionally, they  will look just enough like Claire that they could ride in her car in a  parade and she could be in a parade somewhere else. Claire's mom: The  last person in the car is a Republican--I can absolutely hear Claire's  mom saying that. In fact, after I was elected to the Senate, I was in  the Senate and happened to see Joe and Claire's mom and went over to  say hi. Claire's mom said: Well, I would like to say it is nice to see  you here, but based on everything I said in the campaign, I would be  two-faced.   That was Betty McCaskill, and I liked her for it. I was at Betty  McCaskill's memorial service during Claire's campaign that year for her  second election to the Senate. She was at my dad's memorial service  during my election campaign to the Senate this time. As Claire and Joe  were leaving, Claire said to me: What a perfect service for Leroy  Blunt. Nobody in this body could say that like Claire could say it  because she knew my dad. When family got up, we talked about my dad,  but Claire knew that was not just a passing comment; it was knowing who  we were and knowing who she is and what she knew about that.   Of all the times we voted differently, we have a relationship without  pretense, as much as you can possibly have between two Members of the  Senate from the same State. The best part of the last 8 years--we have  been friendly for 30 years, but in the last 8 years, we really have  become good friends. Old friends are hard to make. It takes a long  time, say 30 years, to really make old friends.   I look forward to our time together after you leave here. I have  benefited from our time together while you were here. Our State has  benefited from your service in incredible ways at all levels. Even on  the days we didn't disagree, I never doubted your sense that you were  doing the right thing. It is an honor to be your friend, and it is an  honor to have worked for you. Thanks for all you have done for the  State of Missouri.
