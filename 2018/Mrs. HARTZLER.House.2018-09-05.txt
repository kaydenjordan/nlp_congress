 Mr. Chairman, I offer an amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I rise today to offer an amendment that  would encourage colleges and universities to offer face-to-face loan  counseling. As students arrive at colleges and university campuses this  fall, many will soon find themselves immediately in debt. According to  the Department of Education, a typical student borrower takes out  roughly $6,600 in a single year and averages $22,000 in debt by  graduation.   Alarmingly, default rates are at an all-time high. What is worse is  that many students report not even remembering their student loan  counseling. We need to change that.   I have heard from schools in my district, including many community  colleges, about the need for more robust, personal loan counseling.  Many students take out loans and have difficulty finding the type of  jobs necessary to pay those loans off and become so saddled with debt  that it causes them to delay many of life's milestones, like getting  married or buying a house.   The type of personalized counseling my amendment encourages should  include a sit-down discussion about the current demands of the job  market in relation to what the student is studying and their realistic  ability to repay the financial obligations they are taking. Students  should know what they are getting into and not be at an immediate  economic disadvantage at graduation.   Schools should do their best to educate their students about their  obligations and guide them toward financial literacy and stability, and  this cannot effectively be accomplished through the click of a button.   I applaud my colleague from Kentucky for offering this important  piece of legislation to enhance the information that students receive,  and I thank the Rules Committee for making my amendment on personal  loan counseling in order.    Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the gentlewoman's support.  With total student loan debt of over $1.3 trillion and rising and over  44 million individuals still saddled with student debt, we must take  action.                                time  1530    The student loan crisis looms over America's economy, and we must  make sure that students are aware of the financial obligations they are  agreeing to and cognizant of their ability to repay those obligations.  Personalized, face-to-face counseling can be an effective tool to  address this crisis.   Mr. Chairman, I ask for support of my amendment, and I yield back the  balance of my time.
