 Thank you very much, Mr. President.   The decisions made by the next Secretary of Health and Human Services  will affect all of us, and that is why we are here. That is why we have  spent so much time and will continue to talk about the issues. This is  not personal with the individual, this is about everyone in our country  and how they are impacted by the ideas and the policies of this  individual as well as the person who has nominated him.   This particular individual has a very clear record as to what he  believes should happen as it relates to Medicare and Medicaid, and our  entire health care system. More than 100 million people rely on  programs like Medicare--seniors, people with disabilities on Medicare.  With Medicaid, the majority of money spent through the Medicaid health  care system goes to seniors in nursing homes. That is where the  majority of dollars go, long-term care for seniors. So Congressman  Price's ideas, his proposals, the things he has pushed in the House  matter because they show us what he believes should happen to Medicaid  and to Medicare.   We need to make sure the next Health and Human Services Secretary  will fight for the health care of families in Michigan--at least I need  to be sure. That is where my vote goes, based on what is best for  families in Michigan. That is what is best for our communities, rural  communities, where the hospital, like where I grew up in Clare, was the  largest employer in the community, greatly affected and impacted by  what happens to Medicare and Medicaid funding. If the hospital is not  there, chances are the doctors aren't there either or the nurses. Our  larger communities are where, obviously, our hospitals are critically  important as well.    So when we look at communities and hospitals and doctors, families,  children, seniors, and the broad economy--and, by the way, one-sixth of  the whole economy in our country is connected to health care. So who is  in charge as Secretary of Health and Human Services is a big deal. That  is why we have focused so much on this individual, his policies, his  ideas, and his own background as well.   As we have gone through the confirmation process, it is clear to me  that Congressman Price's policies do not--do not--have the best  interests of the people I represent in Michigan at heart, which is why  I will be voting no on his confirmation.   I have heard from thousands of people around Michigan. I have heard  from people who like our hospitals and live in the community, and  businesspeople and nurses and doctors with great concerns. I have also  heard from people around the country and have helped to lead a forum  for people to come and speak, people who were not invited into the  actual hearing for the confirmation hearing. I thought it was  important, as did my Democratic colleagues, to have a forum where  people could speak about the ideas, the bills, the policies that  Congressman Price has passed in the House of Representatives.   So we heard a lot of stories and, overwhelmingly, people were opposed  to this nominee.   One of the people who shared her story was from Michigan. I was very  appreciative that she came in from Michigan. Ann was diagnosed with  multiple sclerosis when she was 4 years old. It resulted in functional  quadriplegia. She has limited use of her right arm and no use of her  left arm. She was fortunate to have strong employee benefits and to be  covered until she went on Medicare at 65. By the way, this nominee  thinks the age should go up--66 or 67, I am not sure how far. But Ann  made it to 65 and, like so many people I know, was holding her breath  to get there so she could have comprehensive quality health care that  she paid into her whole life called Medicare.   Over the course of the last few decades, the price of her  prescription drugs have skyrocketed and would cost her tens of  thousands of dollars a year without Medicare and Medicaid. For her, the  decision about our Health and Human Services Secretary makes an  enormous impact on her life.   She told us: Without Medicare and Medicaid, things would have been  very different for my family. I don't know how I could have cared for  my mom on top of managing my own care. My family would have lost our  home, all of our savings, trying to keep up with the bills. So many  families are squeezed like ours, having to afford care for their aging  parents and their own care, or childcare at the same time. But with  support, we don't have to suffer to just be alive.   If these programs are cut, if we see the kinds of proposals on  Medicare and Medicaid that Congressman Price has put forward in the  House, in the Budget Committee, people will face more catastrophes than  ever before.   Our new President campaigned on a promise not to cut Medicare and  Medicaid. He said himself: ``I am not going to cut Social Security like  every other Republican, and I am not going to cut Medicare and  Medicaid.'' But it doesn't square with the person he has nominated for  this critical position, who will be making administrative decisions as  well as leading his efforts on health care. So actions speak louder  than words, at least that is what we say in Michigan.   Just this fall, Congressman Price said he expects Medicare to be  overhauled--overhauled within the first 6 to 8 months of Trump's  administration. He also believes the age of eligibility needs to  increase--his words--and that ``the better solution is premium  support.'' What does that mean? That is another word for voucher. Some  people say privatization. But basically instead of having an insurance  card and a health care system where you can go to the doctor and know  that you are covered with insurance, you get some kind of a voucher or  an amount of money, and then you would be able to go find your own  insurance, I guess, or figure out a way to pay for your insurance.   Before Medicare, seniors were trying to figure that out and couldn't  find affordable insurance in the private market, which is why, in 1965,  Medicare was created. There is no way in the world I will support going  backward to that kind of approach.   As chair of the Budget Committee, Congressman Price proposed a budget  that would have cut Medicare by nearly $500 million, not counting what  he wants to do with Medicaid, the majority of which goes to fund senior  citizens in nursing homes.   We need to have a Secretary who supports making it easier and more  affordable for people to get care, not less.   Let's talk about health care for a moment in the broader sense. We  know more and more people--some 30 million people--would be affected,  their health insurance ripped away, if the repeal is passed that has  begun--the process has begun by Republicans in the House and in the  Senate. The Affordable Care Act has provided health care and the  opportunity for people to get care for children to be able to see a  doctor. There are parts of the country where we need more competition,  where prices are too high. I want very much to work on that. I am  committed to working to make that system better, and we can do that  without ripping the entire system apart.   There is also another part of the Affordable Care Act that affects  every single person with insurance--things that I know have made a  tremendous difference to anybody with employer-based insurance; first  of all, being allowed to have your child on your insurance until age  26; secondly, knowing that if you get sick, you can't get dropped by  your insurance company, and if you have a chronic disease, something  has happened to your health, you can't be blocked from getting  insurance; and we also know things like making sure you can get all the  cancer treatments your doctor says you need, not just those up to the  cap that the insurance company will pay for. I had pediatric cancer  physicians tell me they have been able to save children's lives who  have cancer because there was no longer a cap on the amount of care.   Mental health and substance abuse services, where if they were  covered at all before the Affordable Care Act, it always cost more  money: higher copays, higher premiums. Now you can't do that. You have  to have the same kinds of copays and the same kinds of premiums.   So many patient protections have basically said to insurance  companies: You don't get, just based on profits, to decide what is  going to happen; that when you buy insurance, you actually  [[Page S1024]]  get health care. And that is something true for everyone today.   So we have a Secretary nominee who supports doing away with all that,  changing all that, who is not someone who is interested in having a  basic set of services identified in health care, like maternity care. I  talked with him, questioned him in the Finance Committee. This is an  area I had championed when we passed the Affordable Care Act to make  sure that basic services for women were viewed as basic services in  health care, and it starts with prenatal care and maternity care. Prior  to the Affordable Care Act, it was very hard to find private insurance  that covered maternity care, unless you wanted to pay for--some 70  percent of the plans out in the private market require women to pay  more. So I asked Congressman Price, did he believe maternity care was a  basic service and should be covered under basic insurance. He said:  Well, women can purchase that if they need it, which is exactly what  happened before--which is, no, it is not basic care, but you can  purchase it on top of your regular premium, if you need maternity care.   So right now the law says you can't discriminate and charge women  more than men, and in fact being a woman is no longer a preexisting  condition.   But the person whom the President has nominated for Health and Human  Services would take us back there, and he would take us back there on a  whole range of areas that create access for people to be able to have  the care they need.   Here is an example from a doctor in west Michigan who wrote me  regarding just basic medical care for someone in need. He said:         In December, a young man arrived in our emergency room with       a badly mangled hand from a machining accident. He knew the       hand was seriously injured and was willing to allow his       coworker to bring him into the hospital so that it could be       stitched up. When our physician studied the wound, they knew       he needed surgery to repair the bone and blood vessel damage.       The patient refused, thinking the only thing he could       possibly afford was stitches.    They then connected this man with a financial services specialist who  took a few minutes to find out that he was eligible for Medicaid,  working; now, because of the expansion, able to receive health care  under Medicaid. He was then able to get the surgery he needed.   Beaumont physicians said that if the surgery hadn't happened, the man  could have had an open wound for an indefinite amount of time, been  prone to infection, and possibly lost his hand entirely, making him  unable to ever work at his job or maybe any job again.   Expanding Medicaid health care to working people is a good idea, and  millions of people have been impacted and have been able to get the  care they need for themselves and for their children.   Access to health care saved this man's arm and possibly his life, and  that is really what is at stake here, both with this nominee and the  larger debate on where we are going to go in our great country on the  whole issue of health care.   We all know that the advice of the Secretary of Health and Human  Services will be a strong influence on the President's decision to  promote, to sign, to veto legislation. We know he has the ability  administratively to do a number of things--to cut off care, to cut off  access to women's health care, to change the system that we have now,  to destabilize it so that the Affordable Care Act will not work. I am  extremely concerned that because of Congressman Price's record and his  actual proposals and decisions and votes, he will be willing to  actually do that. Whether it is cutting Medicare or Medicaid or  removing some of the critical policies that keep people healthy and  care affordable, I am deeply concerned about the decisions this nominee  will make and the recommendations he will make to the President of the  United States.   Again, we don't have to speculate about this. He has put these plans  on paper. He has supported them. He has passed them. It is very clear.  We don't have to guess where he wants to go: to dismantle Medicare as  we know it, to gut Medicaid, most of which goes for seniors in nursing  homes, and to unravel the entire health care system and the patient  protections that every American who has insurance has right now that  allow them to get the health care they are actually paying for.   I need to raise one other thing because this is very serious and goes  to serious issues surrounding conflicts of interest and likely ethics  violations that relate to this nominee.   There are a lot of unanswered questions and serious concerns related  to Congressman Price's investments in health care and pharmaceutical  companies. Frankly, he misled the Finance and the HELP Committees with  answers to questions, and just the night before he was to have a  confirmation hearing and vote, we learned from company officials that  he got a privileged offer to buy stock at a discount. In other words,  he got a special deal on health care stock. He told us he had not; they  had paid fair market value, even though it was already an issue that he  had purchased stock and then put legislation in related to similar  companies or the same companies involved. But then we found out it was  even worse because he got a special deal.   As Democrats, we asked for answers. We did not want to move forward  without asking the Congressman to come back before us so we could ask  questions about what he had said to the committee versus what the  business that sold him the stock said afterwards. Unfortunately, that  did not happen, requiring the Finance Committee to be in a situation  where the rules ended up being broken and the nomination was forced  through the committee without having bipartisan participation.   I have a number of concerns related to the ethics and possible legal  violations of this nominee. On multiple occasions, he did purchase  stock within days of introducing legislation that would have affected  that company's bottom line and his investment. Despite multiple  requests over several weeks, we still don't have the answers and, more  importantly, the American people don't have the answers from the person  who will oversee health insurance, oversee Medicare, Medicaid--the  entire system. Someone who has invested and then helped the same  companies indicated he didn't get a special deal, and now we have  information that says otherwise. I think that is very concerning and  should have been addressed before we were asked to vote on this  particular nominee.   There are a number of reasons--policy, track record, questions that  have been raised that I find extraordinary that they haven't been  answered and shocking that folks haven't felt they should be answered  at this point. But for many reasons, it is my intention to vote no on  behalf of the people in Michigan who care deeply about a strong,  effective Medicare system, about making sure Medicaid is there for our  children as well as our seniors and nursing homes, and for everyone who  believes that in this great country, all should have the ability to see  a doctor and get the medical care you need for your child or yourself.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.
