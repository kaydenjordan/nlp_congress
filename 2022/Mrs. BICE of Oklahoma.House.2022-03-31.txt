 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the motion  to instruct from my colleague and Oklahoma delegation member, Mr.  Lucas.   Safeguarding our national security, improving our supply chain  resiliency, and bolstering American innovation are things that we can  all agree on. However, in the COMPETES Act, Democrats took these  problems and drafted ineffective, partisan policies in response. As a  member of the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, we had  previously advanced strong legislation to combat these very issues.   On top of this, when this legislation came to the House floor for a  vote in February, Republicans in the House were denied the opportunity  to provide input on these important issues through the restrictive  processes of the majority.   While over 600 amendments were submitted, less than half of those  were made in order by the Committee on Rules. Of the 600, there were a  number that would have taken steps to address the ever-growing threat  we face from the Chinese Communist Party and their affiliated companies  operating in the United States.   This motion to instruct will ensure that the critical investments we  are making in America's innovation don't fall into the hands of our  foreign adversaries.   Democrats' failure to include similar provisions in the COMPETES Act  exemplify their continued, weak policies on China that compromise our  strategic advantage and our national security.   It is common sense that U.S. taxpayer dollars should not be lining  the pockets of the Chinese Communist Party, and instead, should be used  to strengthen our industries here at home. Investing in American  companies will strengthen the economy while keeping the Nation safe.   Madam Speaker, this should not be a partisan issue. I encourage the  adoption of the motion.
