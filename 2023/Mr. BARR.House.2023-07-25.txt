 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 1684) to require the Secretary of State to submit an annual  report to Congress regarding the ties between criminal gangs and  political and economic elites in Haiti and impose sanctions on  political and economic elites involved in such criminal activities, as  amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1684         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Haiti Criminal Collusion       Transparency Act of 2023''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress makes the following findings:        (1) According to a United Nations estimate, approximately       167 criminal gangs operated in Haiti in October 2021,       exerting territorial control over as much as two-thirds of       the country.        (2) Haitian armed criminal gangs, the most prominent of       which are the G9 Family and Allies and 400 Mawozo gangs,       conduct violent crimes, including murder, rape, arms and drug       trafficking, racketeering, kidnapping, and blockades of fuel       and aid deliveries. These crimes have perpetuated the ongoing       security and humanitarian crises in Haiti, which have       worsened since the assassination of President Jovenel Moise       on July 7, 2021.        (3) The United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for       Human Rights and the Human Rights Service jointly found a 333       percent increase in human rights violations and abuses       against the rights to life and security in Haiti between July       2018 and December 2019.        (4) At least 19,000 Haitians were forcibly displaced during       2021 due to rising criminal violence.        (5) Armed gangs have used rape, and other forms of sexual       violence to instill fear, punish, subjugate, and inflict pain       on local populations with the goal of expanding their areas       of influence in Port-au-Prince.        (6) At least 803 kidnappings were reported in Haiti during       the first 10 months of 2021, including the kidnapping of more       than 16 United States citizens, giving Haiti having the       highest per capita kidnapping rate of any country in the       world.        (7) There is significant evidence of collusion between       criminal gangs and economic and political elites in Haiti,       including members of the Haitian National Police, which has       resulted in widespread impunity and directly contributed to       Haiti's current security crisis.        (8) On December 10, 2020, the Office of Foreign Assets       Control of the Department of the Treasury designated former       Haitian National Police officer Jimmy Cherizier, former       Director General of the Ministry of the Interior Fednel       Monchery, and former Departmental Delegate Joseph Pierre       Richard Duplan under the Global Magnitsky Human Rights       Accountability Act (subtitle F of title XII of Public Law       114-328; 22 U.S.C. 2656 note) for their connections to armed       criminal gangs, including organizing the November 2018 La       Saline massacre.

(d) Sunset.--This section shall cease to have effect on the       date that is 5 years after the date of the enactment of this       Act.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to  include extraneous material on this measure.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, prolonged political instability, exceptionally high  poverty levels, a resurgence of cholera, food insecurity, a paralyzed  economy and crippling inflation prices, continuous devastating natural  disasters, lack of access to adequate healthcare, and distressing  levels of insecurity--these are the ongoing crises facing the people of  Haiti.   Tragically, they are being made worse by corrupt oligarchs and  political elites in the country who use gangs as a tool to advance  their personal interests and gain power.   Those lawless gangs are responsible for an exponential rise in  violence and horrific human rights abuses. They are wreaking havoc  against an already vulnerable population.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend, the gentleman from New York, Ranking  Member Meeks, who worked with Chairman McCaul and their bipartisan  cosponsors to help confront those predators with this bill.   This bill ensures that the Secretary of State will impose sanctions  on Haiti's economic and political elite responsible for mobilizing  these gangs to carry out their dirty work which has unleashed violence  with no end in sight.   The bill also requires annual reports to Congress on the ties between  these gangs and political and economic elites in Haiti.   To help the Haitian people restore democratic order, we must hold  corrupt elites accountable for the violence they are instigating.  Prohibiting these criminals from traveling to and operating in the  United States is an important step in that direction.   Mr. Speaker, I urge support for this bill, and I reserve the balance  of my time.                                          House of Representatives,                                      Committee on the Judiciary,                                      Washington, DC, June 15, 2023.      Hon. Michael McCaul,      Chairman, Committee on Foreign Affairs,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman McCaul: I write regarding H.R. 1684, the       Haiti Criminal Collusion Transparency Act of 2023. Provisions       of this bill fall within the Judiciary Committee's Rule X       jurisdiction, and I appreciate that you consulted with us on       those provisions. The Judiciary Committee agrees that it       shall be discharged from further consideration of the bill so       that it may proceed expeditiously to the House floor.        The Committee takes this action with the understanding that       forgoing further consideration of this measure does not in       any way alter the Committee's jurisdiction or waive any       future jurisdictional claim over these provisions or their       subject matter. We also reserve the right to seek appointment       of an appropriate number of conferees in the event of a       conference with the Senate involving this measure or similar       legislation.        I ask that you please include this letter in your       committee's report to accompany this legislation or insert       this letter in the Congressional Record during consideration       of H.R. 1684 on the House floor. I appreciate the cooperative       manner in which our committees have worked on this matter,       and I look forward to working collaboratively in the future       on matters of shared jurisdiction. Thank you for your       attention to this matter.            Sincerely,                                                        Jim Jordan,      Chairman.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                    Committee on Foreign Affairs,                                      Washington, DC, June 15, 2023.      Hon. Jim Jordan,      Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Jordan: Thank you for consulting with the       Foreign Affairs Committee and agreeing to be discharged from       further consideration of H.R. 1684, the Haiti Criminal       Collusion Transparency Act of 2023, so that the measure may       proceed expeditiously to the House floor.        I agree that your forgoing further action on this measure       does not in any way diminish the jurisdiction of your       committee, or prejudice its jurisdictional prerogatives on  [[Page H3909]]       this measure or, similar legislation in the future. I would       support your effort to seek appointment of an appropriate       number of conferees from your committee to any House-Senate       conference on this legislation.        I will seek to place our letters on this bill into the       Congressional Record during floor consideration. I appreciate       your cooperation regarding this legislation and look forward       to continuing to work together as this measure moves through       the legislative process.            Sincerely,                                                 Michael T. McCaul,                                                          Chairman.     Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, what is going on in the nation of Haiti is a human  tragedy. I again thank the gentleman from New York (Mr. Meeks) for  leading this bipartisan bill, which, as he eloquently described, would  require the Secretary of State to submit an annual report to Congress  regarding the ties between criminal gangs and political and economic  elites in Haiti, thereby enabling the Secretary of State to identify  and impose sanctions on political and economic elites with links to  criminal gangs. Hopefully, that effort would improve the conditions  that the people of Haiti are going through right now.   Mr. Speaker, this bill deserves our support, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 3203) to impose sanctions with respect to Chinese producers of  synthetic opioids and opioid precursors, to hold Chinese officials  accountable for the spread of illicit fentanyl, and for other purposes,  as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 3203         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on this measure.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of my legislation, the Stop Chinese  Fentanyl Act, that is currently before the House.   The fentanyl crisis is one that is affecting families and communities  across the United States. As of 2021, 70,601 Americans died as a result  of synthetic opioid overdoses. As of 2020, 82.3 percent of all opioid- involved overdoses were the result of synthetic opioids. Last year,  almost 70 percent of all drug overdose deaths were caused by fentanyl-- over 100,000 American lives destroyed because of this.   This has certainly impacted my home State, the Commonwealth of  Kentucky. A recent drug overdose report from the Kentucky Office of  Drug Control Policy reported that there was a 14.5 percent increase in  overdose deaths in my home State.   According to cases autopsied by the Kentucky Office of the Medical  Examiner and toxicology reports submitted by Kentucky coroners, the  rise in the death toll was driven largely by an increased use of  fentanyl, accounting for approximately 70 percent of all overdose  deaths in the Commonwealth of Kentucky.   Unfortunately, this scourge has spread with the help of our greatest  strategic threat, the People's Republic of China and the Chinese  Communist Party. We know that China has historically been and remains  the primary source of fentanyl in global circulation.   Since the Trump administration tightened controls on the shipment of  fentanyl into the United States, the CCP has adjusted their practices  and begun producing precursor chemicals and outsourcing final  production to cartel laboratories in Mexico to then exploit our porous  southern border and poison the American people.   In 2020, U.S. Customs and Border Protection seized 4,800 pounds of  fentanyl, or enough to kill over a billion people. Just a tiny little  bit of this very deadly synthetic opioid is enough to kill.   This figure more than tripled in just 2 years to 14,700 pounds in  2022. In the first 2 months of 2023, Customs and Border Protection  seized 12,500 pounds. Much of this is originating from China exploiting  the cartels and exploiting our open southern border.   We must attack the production of fentanyl at its source by targeting  the source of the precursors in China. My legislation places sanctions  on Chinese producers of synthetic opioids and opioid precursors and  holds senior government and Chinese political officials accountable for  the spread of illicit fentanyl.   Specifically, it amends the Fentanyl Sanctions Act to expand the  definition of a foreign opioid trafficker to include any Chinese entity  that produces, manufactures, distributes, sells, finances, or  transports synthetic opioids or active pharmaceutical ingredients or  chemicals used to produce synthetic opioids and fails to take credible  steps to detect or prevent opioid trafficking, including know-your- customer procedures or cooperation with U.S. counternarcotics efforts.   The expanded definition also includes any senior officials of the PRC  Government or other Chinese political official who has significant  regulatory or law enforcement responsibilities and fails to take  credible steps to combat foreign opioid traffickers.   Their culpability, the culpability of the Chinese Communist Party in  this epidemic in our country, does not end when the precursor products  land in Mexico or illegally cross our southern border. We must look at  every step of fentanyl's deadly supply chain.   This bipartisan legislation passed the House Foreign Affairs  Committee by voice vote earlier this year and is a needed step to  control this deadly drug.   Mr. Speaker, I urge support for this bill, and I reserve the balance  of my time.

Hon. Jim Jordan,      Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Jordan: Thank you for consulting with the       Foreign Affairs Committee and agreeing to be discharged from       further consideration of H.R. 3203, the Stop Chinese Fentanyl       Act, so that the measure may proceed expeditiously to the       House floor.        I agree that your forgoing further action on this measure       does not in any way diminish or alter the jurisdiction of       your committee, or prejudice its jurisdictional prerogatives       on this measure or similar legislation in the future.

I will seek to place our letters on this bill into the       Congressional Record during floor consideration. I appreciate       your cooperation regarding this legislation and look forward       to continuing to work together as this measure moves through       the legislative process.            Sincerely,                                                 Michael T. McCaul,                                                          Chairman.     Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to  close.   I thank the gentleman from Virginia for his bipartisan support of  this important legislation. This is a bipartisan bill for good reason,  Mr. Speaker: Because China has blamed the rise in overdose deaths in  the United States and illicit fentanyl in the United States on the  United States.   The Chinese Communist Party has refused to address its role in this  crisis. While Mexico is now the principal source of illicit fentanyl  and its analogues, cartels manufacture these drugs in covert  laboratories with ingredients, precursor chemicals sourced largely from  Communist China.   China is the primary source of chemical precursors used to synthesize  fentanyl and other novel synthetic  [[Page H3913]]  opioids, and this illicit fentanyl made in Mexican labs is then  smuggled into the United States across our open and unenforced southern  border, making its way into communities and killing Americans, killing  many Americans in my home State of Kentucky.   No, Kentucky is not a border State, but Kentucky is impacted by the  fact that these Chinese precursors are making their way into China and  then smuggled across our southern border.   This is a huge problem, and we need to hold those individuals, those  Chinese Communist Party officials, accountable for this scourge, for  poisoning the American people.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to  defend the American people, to stop this scourge, and to hold the  Chinese Communist Party accountable for their role in this poison that  is pouring across our borders.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 1176) to amend the Taiwan Allies International Protection and  Enhancement Initiative (TAIPEI) Act of 2019 to provide that the United  States, as a member of any international organizations, should oppose  any attempts by the People's Republic of China to resolve Taiwan's  status by distorting the decisions, language, policies, or procedures  of the organization, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1176         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on this measure.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, Taiwan, an island of democracy and stability, is a key  U.S. partner facing an increasingly aggressive Chinese Communist Party.  Chinese military aggression is the most visible type of coercion  against Taiwan, but CCP influence is widespread. In almost every  international organization, the CCP is taking over leadership positions  and pushing Taiwan aside.   For far too long, the CCP has employed an insidious strategic  approach to suppress Taiwan's participation in the international  community. The Chinese Communist Party has undermined Taiwan and spread  propaganda about that democracy's ability to participate in  international organizations. We cannot turn a blind eye to this assault  on the very institutions we helped build after World War II.   There is no clearer example of the Chinese Communist Party's  nefarious tactics than their manipulation of U.N. Resolution 2758.  Passed in 1971, that resolution recognized the PRC as the U.N.  representative for China.   It said nothing about Taiwan's U.N. representation or sovereignty,  yet the CCP propaganda wrongly claims that this resolution asserts PRC  representation over Taiwan. Beijing has used it as a weapon to prevent  Taiwan from participating in international organizations. This  resolution, which was intended to bring nations together, has instead  been exploited to isolate Taiwan. We cannot allow this blatant assault  on freedom to go unchallenged.   Taiwan is a vibrant and thriving democracy rooted in freedom, pushing  the envelope on advanced technology like semiconductors. By supporting  Taiwan's participation in international organizations, we bolster our  own national security, enhance regional stability, and safeguard the  interests of the United States and our allies.   The consequences of Beijing's actions extend far beyond Taiwan's  borders. The CCP's suffocating grip prevents Taiwan from sharing its  invaluable expertise in areas such as public health, technology, and  humanitarian aid.   For example, Taiwan is not a member of the WHO because of the CCP,  but it was Taiwan that came forward at the end of 2019 with an early  warning of COVID-19. Meanwhile, the CCP robbed the world of critical  time needed to counter the pandemic, causing millions to die around the  world. This is what happens when the CCP manipulates  [[Page H3914]]  international organizations, and this is what happens when Taiwan is  excluded from international organizations: Millions die.   By supporting Taiwan's meaningful participation in international  organizations, we demonstrate to the CCP that we stand firm in our  commitment to promoting freedom, democracy, and human rights.   I thank the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Connolly), a fellow co-chair  of the Taiwan Caucus, for introducing this bipartisan bill, of which I  am a proud original cosponsor.   H.R. 1176 will send a clear message to the CCP that we will not  tolerate their attempts to suppress, delegitimize, and coerce Taiwan  and its people. The Taiwan Relations Act holds that it is United States  policy to maintain their capacity ``to resist any resort to force or  other forms of coercion. . . .'' That policy must include the stance we  are taking today, to resist the Chinese Communist Party's coercive  tactics at international organizations.   Mr. Speaker, this bill deserves our unanimous support. I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Utah  (Mr. Curtis), the Republican principal sponsor of this bill and author  of the bill. He is a great friend to the people of Taiwan and a member  of the Taiwan Caucus.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the right to close. I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I, once again, commend my colleagues, the gentleman from  Virginia and the gentleman from Utah, for their leadership in  introducing the Taiwan International Solidarity Act for standing with  the people of Taiwan.   Obviously, Taiwan does hold some status in some regional  organizations, international organizations, and it holds observer or  other status in several other bodies. But Taiwan cannot participate in  organizations that are key to transnational issues, such as the World  Health Organization, the International Civil Aviation Organization, or  INTERPOL, as has been pointed out. China continues to advocate for  Taiwan's exclusion in these international organizations and blocks  Taiwan's participation in the United Nations.   This bill would amend the Taiwan Allies International Protection and  Enhancement Initiative Act, or the TAIPEI Act of 2019, to reiterate  that the United States, as a member of any international organization,  should oppose attempts by the People's Republic of China to resolve  Taiwan's status by distorting the decisions, language, policies, or  procedures, of international organizations.   This bill encourages U.S. allies and partners to oppose the Chinese  Communist efforts to undermine Taiwan's official diplomatic  relationships and its partnerships with countries with which it does  not maintain diplomatic relations.   The bill adds an additional requirement to report to Congress on the  PRC's attempts to promote its One China position in undermining  Taiwan's membership or observer status in international organizations  and Taiwan's ties and relationships with other countries.   Mr. Speaker, I traveled to Taipei back in September of last year.  This was a major topic of discussion, Taiwan's systematic exclusion  from international organizations, and the coercive actions of the  Chinese Communist Party in working against Taiwan being a participant  in the international community. This is wrong.   The United States needs to stand with the Taiwan people and the  democracy, that island of democracy and stability. That is why every  Member of this body should support this important legislation and stand  for Taiwan's inclusion and constructive participation in international  organizations.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
