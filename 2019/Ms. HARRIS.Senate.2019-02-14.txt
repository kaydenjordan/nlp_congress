 James Baldwin once said:         Not everything that is faced can be changed. But nothing       can be changed until it is faced.    That is why we are here again today, to face the history of lynching  in this country. From 1882 to 1986, the U.S. Congress failed to pass  anti-lynching legislation when it had the opportunity more than 200  times.   We have an opportunity, once again, to right this wrong and face the  ugly history of lynching in America. Let's recall this stain on  America's history. Lynching is an act of terror. It is murder.   These were summary executions. Victims of lynching were dragged out  of their homes. They had ropes wrapped around their necks. They were  hanged on trees. In many cases, they were castrated and burned as  crowds of people watched and applauded. The premise underlying all of  these acts was that Black people were not full human beings.   According to the Equal Justice Initiative, lynching was used as an  instrument of terror and intimidation 4,084 times during the late 19th  and 20th centuries.   In 1955, Emmett Till, a 14-year-old African-American boy, was lynched  in  [[Page S1346]]  Mississippi after being accused of offending a woman in her family's  grocery store. When Emmett Till's mother held open her son's casket at  his funeral, the image of his body became one of the starkest examples  of racial violence in America.   These lynchings, I think no one can deny, were acts of violence. They  were needless, horrendous acts of violence, and they were motivated by  racism. Lynchings were crimes that were committed against innocent  Americans. These crimes, for the most part, did not go without  consequence. They rarely were followed by an arrest or the charging of  a crime or the prosecution of a crime or the punishment for the crime.  Of course, the victims of these acts and their families never received  justice in our courts of law or in their community.   This is an uncomfortable history to think of, to talk about, and  understandably makes many people uncomfortable because of the violence  we are describing, because it is part of America's history, because it  is something we have never truly acknowledged and recognized, in terms  of the crime it was, the crime it is, and how we, through our laws,  must recognize the seriousness of it.   Today we have that opportunity, and we must recognize the context in  which we discuss it today. Just in the last month, we have had  difficult and high-profile conversations about slavery and blackface,  issues that are claimed to be part of a bygone era. However, it is  clear that in many ways our past is our present.   Lynching is not a relic of the past. In 2011, three men in Brandon,  MS, murdered an African-American man, James Craig Anderson. They robbed  him, beat him, and ran him over with a truck. That is modern-day  lynching.   Let's be clear. No one should have to fear for their life because of  their race, national origin, religion, or sexual orientation. We must  confront hate directly.   In December of 2018, our Senate colleagues, I am proud to say, voted  unanimously, in a bipartisan way, to pass the Justice for Victims of  Lynching Act, which I proudly introduced with Senators Booker and  Scott. After 100 years and more than 200 failed attempts in the U.S.  Congress, the U.S. Senate finally spoke the truth about lynching.   Today I have reintroduced the bill and will ask the Senate to pass it  again. The Justice for Victims of Lynching Act is a historic piece of  legislation that would make lynching a Federal crime for the first time  in American history. With this bill, we finally have a chance to speak  the truth about our past and make clear that these hateful acts should  never happen again and, God forbid, they do, we are making clear there  will be swift, serious, and severe consequences.   We can now finally offer some long overdue justice and recognition to  the victims of lynching and their families. As Dr. Martin Luther King,  Jr., said: ``The time is always right to do what is right.''   I now yield the floor to my friend and colleague, the great Senator  from the great State of New Jersey, Cory Booker.    Thank you, Senator Booker. Happy Valentine's Day to you.   Mr. President, as in legislative session, I ask unanimous consent  that the Senate proceed to the immediate consideration of S. 488,  introduced earlier today.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be  considered read a third time.    I know of no further debate on the bill.  [[Page S1347]]     Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you to all of our  colleagues.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the motion to reconsider  be considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action  or debate.    Madam President, our Nation mourns the loss of one  of the country's greatest servant-leaders, The Right Reverend, Senior  Bishop McKinley Young, whose life work ministering to countless  individuals and whole communities in search of both hope and democracy  exemplifies faith in action.   Senior Bishop McKinley Young was born on November 10, 1944, in  Atlanta, GA; the eldest son of Reverend Lonnie C. Young and Mrs. Nellie  Cummings Young. He attended Morris Brown College, where he earned his  bachelor's degree and later received two master's degrees from Andover  Newton Theological School and the University of Chicago Divinity School  respectively.   Early in his ministry, Bishop Young pastored churches in the first,  fourth, and sixth Episcopal Districts, including the historic Big  Bethel A.M.E Church in Atlanta, GA. After being elected and consecrated  the 109th Bishop of the African Methodist Episcopal Church in 1992, his  first episcopal assignment was to the 15th District of Angola, South  Africa, and Namibia where he led the Centennial Celebration of African  Methodism. Bishop Young would later serve as presiding prelate in  Texas, Florida, and the Bahamas. His final episcopal assignment was  with the third District, which includes Ohio, West Virginia, and  Western Pennsylvania, where he served until his transition to the  church triumphant on Wednesday, January 16, 2019.   Bishop Young's commitment to the church community was as strong as  his commitment to voter education, voter registration, and getting  people from the pews to the polls. This passion came from his lifelong  belief that ``a vote-less people is a hopeless people.'' For decades,  Bishop Young organized voter registration drives across the United  States, empowering those who were historically voiceless in the voting  process. His commitment to democratic values led him to South Africa,  where he worked on voter registration efforts during the first free  democratic election of the President of South Africa.   Throughout his journey and in addition to his ministerial and civic  work, Bishop Young worked diligently to increase educational  opportunities for African-American students, especially those attending  historically black colleges and universities. He served on the board of  trustees for Payne Theological Seminary, led the church in financially  stabilizing Paul Quinn College, helped raise $2 million to secure  Edward Walters College's accreditation, and would later serve as  chancellor of Wilberforce University.   Bishop Young has served the ecumenical community faithfully for over  40 years. He was a devoted leader of the African Methodist Episcopal  Church Service and Development Agency, Inc., SADA for over 20 years and  served as  [[Page S1381]]  chair of the board. Bishop Young's leadership among other faith  councils only amplified the effectiveness of his advocacy across the  faith community, including as a member of the Central Committee of the  World Council of Churches, the National Council of Churches, the World  Methodist Council, and the Conference of National Black Churches.   Bishop Young was a courageous servant leader, activist, and champion  for civil and human rights whose service and dedication to countless  communities will continue to inspire others for generations to come.   We wish every member of the African Methodist Episcopal Church that  he served and those whose lives were touched by Bishop Young peace  during this difficult time, especially his wife Dr. Dorothy Jackson  Young, his children, Karyn, Deana, Andrea, and Stephanie, and eight  grandchildren:                            ____________________
