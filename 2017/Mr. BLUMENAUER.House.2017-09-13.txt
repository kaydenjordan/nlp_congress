 Mr. Speaker, as we watch the horrific scenes of  destruction from Hurricane Harvey and Irma, I must say that I have been  taken back in time.   I came to Congress 20 years ago in the aftermath of serious flooding  in my hometown of Portland, Oregon. I was Portland's Commissioner of  Public Works at the time, and we had to scramble to try and prevent  flood damage into our central city.   Since that time, I have spent a great deal of time and energy  focusing on what we can do to solve problems of repetitive flooding,  having Federal policies in place that makes it less likely that people  will be in harm's way. Sadly, over the course of over 20 years, we are  very slow to learn these messages.   First and foremost, we continue to provide payments to properties  that are repeatedly flooded. When we started over 15 years ago on a  program for reforming the flood insurance program, one of the best  examples that we used for the need for reform was a home in suburban  Houston that had flood insurance payments 17 times in less than 20  years. The total was over $1 million for a piece of property that was  less than $120,000 in value. We would have been far better off buying  it at a generous price and returning it to its natural state, saving  the taxpayers money and minimizing future flood damage.   Such is the case when we looked at what was going on with Hurricane  Katrina, where we have problems in Louisiana over the years, a city,  New Orleans, that is slowly settling, and has engaged in development in  some areas where people, like in the lower Ninth Ward, were repeatedly  subjected to flood damage.   But what we have done too often in the past is we have put people  back in harm's way. We shouldn't be spending Federal flood relief to  put people back in the same situation and having a problem with rising  tides because of global warming, changing weather patterns that are  going to cost us more money and put more people at risk.   There are some simple steps. First, we ought to get rid of the  deficit for the flood insurance program. There is no way that premiums  are going to make up a deficit of over $24 billion that is going to be  even bigger after the bills become due for Irma and for Harvey. Let's  stop pretending that.   Wipe the slate clean, like we did with the so-called doc fix, and get  down to solutions. Part of the solution is to make sure that people pay  actuarial rates for flood insurance. Pay what it has cost. Disguising  that cost gives people a false sense of security and reduces that  economic incentive to get out of harm's way, while it makes it less  likely that the program will be self-supporting.   Have adequate, accurate flood insurance maps. We ought to immediately  move towards accurate flood maps so that people get the right signals.  Now, actuarial rates, actual flood insurance maps will cause some  disruption and financial problems for some people, so this should be  phased in over time; it shouldn't happen immediately. But those pricing  signals should be clear. We should stop subsidizing some and sending  inaccurate signals for others.   We ought to invest in mitigation. We save about $4 for every dollar  we spend flood-proofing areas, making them less dangerous in the  future. These are simple, commonsense steps that have been suggested by  experts for years.   We do nobody any favor subsidizing them living in harm's way;  allowing local governments to evade their responsibilities to make sure  that people don't build in dangerous places; and putting first  responders, police, firefighters, and utility workers at risk as they  rush in to try and save people in dangerous situations.   Over the next 3 months, we have a unique opportunity to finally learn  these lessons, save taxpayer dollars, save lives, save property, and  get on with the business in a way that is more sustainable. Given the  problems we are facing with climate change in the future, these  problems are only going to get worse. We ought to start now to solve  the problem.                            ____________________     Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Oregon is recognized for 5  minutes.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself 2\1/2\ minutes.   Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to my friend's amendment, somebody I  enjoy working with and respect; but, with all due respect, I think he  is wrong on this. There is no denying the fact that there are some bad  people in Iran who do bad things, and we have a complicated  relationship that we are trying to deal with.   But, first of all, there are already other countries who are involved  with this. Airbus just had a contract. What the gentleman is talking  about would deny the opportunity for Boeing to be able to have these  sales go forward, cost Americans up to 100,000 jobs, and keep billions  of dollars out of the United States' economy.   Mr. Chairman, part of this is people are deeply concerned about the  agreement that we made with Iran dealing with nuclear weapons, which, I  would note, to this point, has actually dialed down some of the work in  terms of halted enrichment beyond 3.67 percent, it limited the size of  its uranium stockpile, filled in the core of a heavy water nuclear  reactor with cement, and provides an opportunity for us to do  something. There are many areas in this region where we have common  interests, and we are kind of doing a dance.   One of the concerns I have is the United States has consistently  mismanaged its relationship with Iran.   How would we feel if somebody had moved to overturn our popularly  elected government, as we did with Iran in 1953, or we sided with  Saddam Hussein in the brutal war against Iran when they were openly  using chemical weapons?   There are things here that have made this a difficult relationship.   The majority of Iranians, ironically, still like Americans. Unlike  Donald Trump's imaginary Muslims in New Jersey dancing in the street on  9/11, in Tehran on 9/11, there were candlelight vigils in support of  the United States. It has more of a democracy than what we have in  Saudi Arabia and Egypt.   Now, I agree that we have challenges dealing with them, but at a time  when we should be strengthening ties with a former enemy through  diplomacy, trade, and job creation, we should be able to try and have  the management of this complicated relation rather than penalizing  American companies for no good purpose.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I want to be clear. I understand the deep  concerns about things that Iranians are doing that I personally  disagree with. The Syrian conflict is a horrific tragedy, but we have  problems with Russia in Syria, we have problems with Turkey in Syria.  We are involved with a situation in the Middle East that is horrific  and is going to require all of our best efforts.   With all due respect, we have a number of things we are trying to  achieve in this regard. I think being able to maintain our commitments  under the agreement with the JCPOA is important. That Iranian nuclear  agreement has held and it is one of the few bright spots in that  region.   Second, we are punishing an American company, but, as I mentioned,  Airbus just executed a contract. There are other parts of the world  that have moved forward. One of the reasons that we were able to get  alignment was there are different agreements in terms of what people  want to do with France, Great Britain, Germany, and Russia.   We have struck an agreement with those allied powers working with us  to make it more difficult for Iran to be a nuclear state. We have an  opportunity for us to not penalize American companies. We have an  opportunity for us to try and make diplomacy work, which has been  undercut by many of the things we are seeing from the administration,  trying to dial back the capacity of the State Department, dial back the  soft power that even the military says that we need to do.   We have a number of areas where there are sponsors of terror.  Pakistan is involved with all sorts of things in this region, and, of  course, they have been key in helping North Korea become a nuclear  state.   I don't think we should paint a picture here that is too simplistic.  We ought to acknowledge the fact that this is complex, that there are  problems, but deal with a country where the majority of people like  Americans, where they have kept their nuclear commitments, where other  countries are going to step in and fill the gap, and that we ought not  to penalize American industry or undercut diplomatic efforts.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.
