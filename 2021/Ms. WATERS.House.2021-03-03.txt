 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the George Floyd  Justice in Policing Act, which bans police choke holds, creates a  national police misconduct registry, and eliminates qualified immunity,  among other needed provisions.   I grieved when first watching George Floyd's murder by a cop, and I  grieve still over the continued loss of so many Blacks killed by cops.  There have been 149 Black men killed at the hands of police since  George Floyd's murder. I have been fighting against this police  brutality since my first days as a member of the California State  Assembly.   But here we are, mourning the victims of police choke holds, Blacks  being shot in the back, fathers being killed in front of their children  and their families. We Blacks are under siege by rogue cops, who we pay  to protect and serve us, and White supremacists and domestic  terrorists.   We have to resist this. We have to say to bad cops in blue that we  are going to fight you. Or proud boys in yellow gear, we are going to  fight you. We are going to resist you.
