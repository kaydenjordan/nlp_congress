 Mr. President, I am pleased to be here with my  colleagues today to emphasize the incredible importance of voting  rights as the foundation for our democratic Republic: Senator Klobuchar  of Minnesota, who spoke with the perspective of the chair of our Rules  Committee and her experience in her State of Minnesota; Senator Durbin,  who so understands the challenges from his decades of public service  and service in this Chamber; Senator Kaine of Virginia, who brought  forth some of the challenges over time that have existed targeting  Black Americans; and Senator Schumer, who just took us on a tour  through history, bringing us to that point of saying: Let's make sure  that our democratic Republic does not perish, that it endures; that  that responsibility sits on our shoulders.   Mr. President, there are more than 4,500 words in the Constitution,  but the three that matter most are the first three: ``We the People.''  Our Founders printed those words in supersize font, saying this is what  it is all about, that we do not take our government's power and  authority in America as descended from Kings or the elite or the  powerful; that our government takes its authority and power from the  people up. And that is accomplished through the ballot box.   We are a nation with a government, as President Lincoln so eloquently  said, ``of the people, by the people, and for the people.'' That is why  the ballot box is the beating heart of our democracy. It is the ballot  box that is the physical manifestation of every American's sacred right  to have a voice in their government through their vote because, as  Lyndon Johnson told us, ``The vote is the most powerful instrument ever  devised . . . for breaking down injustice.''   For 245 years, since our Declaration of Independence, through war and  depression, through civil strife and terrorist attack, our democracy  has persevered. It has weathered storms. Through those storms, it has  continued to shine as a beacon of light to the world, as Ronald Reagan  so fondly spoke of it, to serve as a beautiful, shining city on the  hill.   All the while, through generation after generation, we have worked to  expand access to the ballot box, recognizing that the vision of the  Constitution wasn't fulfilled until every American had the ability to  exercise their right to vote. And for most of our lives in this  generation, we haven't really worried about the strength of our  democratic institutions.   We have read about Presidents around the world writing a new  constitution and throwing the old out without process, of wiping out  the clause that limited them to two terms or to one term and continuing  on, of shows that were put on in terms of legislative function that was  just a cover story for authoritarian power.   But, here, we have thought we have practiced for more than 200 years  converting the power of the people into representative democracy and  decisions made through the House and the Senate and the President of  the United States. We took for granted that they worked because they  had worked for generation after generation, election after election,  year after year.   But now, in recent years, we have come to realize that we shouldn't  have taken the strength of our institutions for granted. We have come  to see all too clearly that these institutions are fragile. We have  seen the relentless efforts to undermine faith in our institutions. We  have seen the attacks on our free press. We have seen the siloing of  channels of information into different 24-hour cable news networks, and  we have seen the echo chamber of social media.   We have experienced the impact that has occurred attacking the basic  right to vote being torn away by the highest Court in the land, to  political leaders deliberately lying to and deceiving the American  people, and fanning the flames of hate and bigotry, of division and  discrimination, for their political gain.   Then, just over a year ago, we saw it culminate in a violent mob of  extremists stirred up and unleashed by a man who couldn't face the  reality of his electoral loss, and that mob stormed this very building  to stop the wheels of democracy from turning.    I was sitting here in this Chamber, and I well remember the agents  rushing down the center aisle up to the podium to sweep away the Vice  President to safety, wondering why they were running down the aisle  because that doesn't happen here in the Senate. We heard the sounds of  people outside these doors and wondered what was going on. We saw our  Sergeant at Arms team start to lock the doors of this Chamber--all of  it in just an extraordinary moment. Then, because we have smartphones,  we started to understand what was going on outside of the Capitol and  inside of the Capitol.   Later, we learned of the incredibly valiant acts of an officer named  Eugene Goodman, who, as the first wave of the mob ascended the  staircase that is just outside the Chamber in this direction, proceeded  to essentially challenge the leader of that group, shoving him slightly  and backing up away--down that hallway to move the mob away from  entering the double doors that were closer by, buying more time for the  security of this Chamber.   It is hard to believe that men and women in this building were  chanting for the death of Nancy Pelosi and the death of the Vice  President of the United States of America, calling for him to be  hanged.   Because we started to understand the threat, I heard whispered phone  calls to loved ones saying: I am OK. I think I am fine.   We saw fear and pain in the eyes of some of our staff, who were  simply doing their job to help our democracy function that day.   We know how that day lingers in the hearts of our Capitol Police  officers, and I continue to grieve with them for the trauma and loss  they endured and to appreciate so much the service they rendered.   The insurrectionists on January 6, 2021, came all too close to  stopping democracy in its tracks that day. Here in the Chamber, we were  ushered into a safer location, and along with us went the three ballot  boxes pictured here.   This is a picture that I took when I was so pleased to see these  ballot boxes had traveled with us to safety, because the mob did enter  this Chamber, and had these boxes still been here in the well of the  Senate, they would have opened them and they would have destroyed those  ballots because that was what they were intent on doing, was to destroy  the ballots from various States to alter the outcome of the election.  They couldn't get to them because they were safe with us.   These boxes were crafted by real artists who work here in the Senate,  and there was a new box, a larger box, because some of the States were  sending larger certifications of the ballots, the electoral college  ballots, from their State.   Well, we were determined to return to the Chamber that evening, to  come back here and reclaim this Chamber from the mob, replace these  boxes in the well of the Senate, transport them to the House through  the rhythm of counting the electoral college votes, and make sure the  certification of the election went ahead. And it did. We completed our  work, and the House and Senate certified the election results.   The physical attack on our national temple, our revered Capitol  Building, was intended to prevent the counting of ballots--the most  important act marking the transfer of power from one President to the  next.   You know, our leaders in the early phase of our country weren't sure  that this system would survive. Would the first President of the United  States declare that he would continue beyond the bounds of the  Constitution regardless of an election or prevent the election from  happening? It was one of the motivations behind supporting George  Washington as the first President, because people had faith that he  would honor the vision in that Constitution and set the rhythm for the  generations that followed. And he did.   So on January 6, 2021, 1 year and 1 day ago, democracy held--barely,  but it held. Although it held on that day, the attack on our Federal  elections has continued nonstop through the year that has followed.   This is the question we now face. In State after State, Republican  legislatures are erecting barriers to the ballot box to make it more  difficult for specific groups of Americans to vote--  [[Page S96]]  making it more difficult for Native Americans to vote, for Black  Americans to vote, and for college students to vote. It is our  responsibility, in the face of these attacks on the right to vote, to  say: Hell, no. We will not let any group in America be blocked from  voting.   We will guarantee the right of every citizen to exercise the most  fundamental act of a citizen in democracy: the act of putting a ballot  into a ballot box. That is why we must pass, without delay, the Freedom  to Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Act.   The 2020 election was free. It was fair. It was secure. In every  analysis, in every court hearing, in every recount, in every audit, we  have found that the election of 2020 was free and fair and secure. We  have seen that proven time and time and time again.   It was the most scrutinized election ever held in this country. It  was also the election with the largest turnout ever in this country.  More than 159 million Americans cast a ballot. But instead of  celebrating the integrity of that election--that beautiful display of  democracy, the embodiment of the ``we the people'' Republic--some in  our country have spent this past year trying to undermine our Republic,  to lie about it, to tear it down, to tear down what so many have worked  and fought for, marched and sacrificed for over 245 years. These forces  cannot win by the power of their ideas so they want to change the  rules. They want to rig the vote.   So how do you do that? Well, the States make laws to make it harder  to register to vote. The States make laws to allow those on the voting  rolls to be thrown off without them even knowing they have been thrown  off, to purge the voting rolls in a discriminatory fashion. You make it  harder for early voting. You make it harder to vote by mail, and the  consequence of making early voting and vote-by-mail hard is you direct  the voting to election day, and on election day, you have a set of  time-tested tactics to block the ballot box. What are these tactics?   Well, one, you understaff the precinct voting location so the line is  very long in places where you don't want people to vote. In Georgia, in  the last election, in those precincts, where the electorate was 80  percent White, the wait time was an average of about 5 minutes. In  those precincts where the electorate was 80 percent Black, the wait  time was about 50 minutes, or 10 times longer. This did not happen by  accident.   What else can be done? You move the location of the precinct voting  location so people go to the wrong place in the places where you don't  want them to vote. You put them in places where there isn't much  parking so they have to walk a long way to get to the polling place.  You let the machines malfunction and have no one around to fix them to  increase the length of the line. You ban volunteers from giving food  and water to the people who are standing in line, hour after hour after  hour. You put out text messages saying, ``We are so sorry you missed  the vote last week,'' when, in truth, the vote is the next Tuesday  coming, but you make people think they missed the vote so they won't  show up or you put out messages saying, ``We hope you will vote on this  day,'' which is a week after the real vote so people don't show up on  election day.   All of these things happen. And when I read about them happening, I  think about how important early voting and vote-by-mail are. If you  want to look at ballots being stolen--the right to vote being stolen,  the corruption of voting--look to these corrupt activities on election  day. Those are stealing the votes. That is where the crime is being  committed, and that is the crime we need to stop.   Now, in Oregon, we were the first State to have vote-by-mail. And it  started with the Republican Party saying: Let's get everybody signed up  for absentee ballots because we know we can increase turnout. And then  the Democrats said: That is a really good idea. Let's get all our folks  to sign up for absentee ballots.   So when I first ran for the State legislature, half the State was  voting by absentee ballot, and half was voting at the polls. And then  in the next election, the State said: We liked voting by absentee  ballot so much, let's give vote-by-mail to everyone. And it was  embraced by both parties.   And I remember going door-to-door and people telling me: We really  love not having to worry about the challenges of election day--of  parking; of weather; I have a bad hip, and I can't stand in line; I  have to pick up my children after I get off work, and I won't have time  to stand in line.   Why did President Trump attack vote-by-mail? He hated vote-by-mail  because it takes away the cheating on election day that he feels can be  implemented to benefit Republicans across this country. President Trump  is the primary proponent of cheating Americans out of their right to  vote.   This Chamber has to act. We are seeing the strategies unfold in State  after State. Last year, 440 bills were introduced in multitudinous  States aimed at restricting the freedom to vote. Thirty-four of those  bills have been passed into law in 19 States, restricting access to the  ballot box, threatening the integrity of our elections.   The first week of this new year, 13 bills were filed in Arizona and  New Hampshire. Eighty-eight bills were introduced last year that are  carrying over into the 2022 legislative session in nine States,  including swing States like Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.   We can see how prevalent the activity is. Now, when we were wrestling  with the right to vote in the 1960s, it was primarily a challenge of  the Southern United States using strategies targeted at Black  Americans. But now, we have a challenge of strategies being enacted  across the country targeting Black Americans and Native Americans and  young Americans.   So let's take a look at this, at some of the key swing States.  Arizona--for over a decade, voters have been mailed a ballot.   Now, currently, if you are an infrequent voter, and you don't vote  early in two election cycles, you can be removed from the permanent  early voting list--meaning you no longer automatically receive that  ballot, meaning that you are expecting it, but you don't get it. When  you realize that you have to get to the polls, it may be too late,  making it harder for targeted voters to vote by having discriminatory  purging of the voting rolls.    Seventy percent of Arizonans are on that permanent early voting list.  Eighty percent of Arizona voters cast a ballot by mail in 2020.   It is estimated that under this law, 200,000 voters in the State of  Arizona might be removed from the list, and many of them will not  realize they have been removed until it is too late.   Think about how significant that is in a State that President Biden  won by less than 11,000 votes.   What else in Arizona? You have the power being taken away of the  secretary of state to control election litigation, to defend the ballot  box, and it is being moved to the attorney general.   Now, why would Arizona move it from the secretary of state, where it  has always been, to the attorney general? Well, they are moving it  because the secretary of state is a Democrat and the attorney general  is a Republican and they want a partisan angle on enforcement of voting  laws.   I will tell you one bill that hasn't been enacted that really is  something very scary to think about. It says, essentially, that the  legislature can revoke the certification of the State's Presidential  election by majority vote--meaning the State might vote for one person,  but the legislature, which is Republican, could then vote to assign the  electors to the person that the legislature wants instead of whom the  people of that State want.   That is an incredible--incredible--perversion and shows you how far  this conversation is going to create partisan control of the outcome.  The election was won fair and square by one person, and the State  legislature says: Too bad, we are assigning our electoral votes to the  other person.   Florida--Florida has enacted an omnibus election bill. It attacks  mail-in voting. It requires voters to continually renew their request  for a mail-in ballot. It used to be that that was once every 4 years,  but now it is continuous. One-third of Floridians voted by mail in  2018. One-half mailed in their ballots in 2020. An overwhelming  majority of those were Democrats. So if you take away vote-by-mail, the  thought is you can warp the outcome of the election.   Their omnibus bill puts up restrictions on drop boxes, requiring them  to  [[Page S97]]  be supervised in person. They make it hard to drop off your ballots.  And the goal, of course, is if you make it harder to drop off ballots,  maybe that ballot will sit on your kitchen counter and never get filed  and never, therefore, have an impact. And Florida, like Georgia, has  stopped volunteers from handing out food and water to voters waiting in  long lines.   Every time I hear that, I think: Are we not familiar with the story  of the good Samaritan who goes down the road, and he sees someone  beaten up by the side of the road and goes over to help that individual  and gets them to safety and covers the expenses for their lodging and  their food? Well, here, good Samaritans are being outlawed from  providing food and water to people trapped in line for a long period of  time.   That is not just in Florida but in Georgia too. So let's turn to  Georgia. They enacted legislation that attacks early voting. It  eliminates 5 weeks of early voting in runoff elections--5 weeks. Over  1.3 million people voted in 2021's runoffs in Georgia that brought  Senators Warnock and Ossoff here to the Senate. It attacks voting  registration.   You can't register to vote when a runoff election is occurring. You  have to already have registered for the general election. And why did  they do that? Because 70,000 people registered to vote during the 2021  runoffs, and more Democrats than Republicans registered in that period.  So, prejudicially, they want to cut that off. They want to virtually  eliminate the drop boxes. They are relied on far more in the urban  Atlanta metro area than in rural counties. And the law says you can  have no more than one drop box for every 100,000 registered voters,  meaning that four counties that make up the greater Atlanta metro area  will now only have about 20 drop boxes, a reduction to one-fifth of the  drop boxes that were there before.   About half of the absentee voters in the Atlanta metro area used  those drop boxes. And then it says those drop boxes have to be inside  early voting sites, meaning that they are only available during the  hours those early voting sites are open. So if you are going to work at  6 a.m., you can't drop off your ballot. And if you are getting home and  picking up your kids and getting home past 5 p.m., or whatever the  early voting sites close, then you can't vote then either by dropping  off your ballot at a ballot box.   Cobb County Elections Director Janine Eveler said, and refers to the  boxes:         They are no longer useful. The limited numbers mean you       cannot deploy them in significant numbers to reach the voting       population.    In Georgia, also, the law gives power to interfere directly with  people's votes. The legislature has been given power--the partisan  legislature has been given power--over the State election board, and  the State election board can replace the local election boards and,  thereby, influence how they behave to the benefit of the Republican  Party. It also gives ability of an individual to challenge countless  numbers of voters' rights to cast a ballot.   To sum up, in Georgia, they are making it harder to get a ballot in  the mail. They are making it easier to intimidate voters at the polls,  and they are making it easier to rig the results after the votes have  been cast.   How about Iowa? Iowa enacted omnibus election legislation that  attacks early voting and takes away 9 days of early voting. It reduces  it by a third, 29 to 20 days. It attacks in-person voting.   As Senator Klobuchar pointed out, it says you have to close the polls  an hour earlier, making it harder for people who work late in the  evening to be able to vote. It attacks vote-by-mail.   Let's turn to Montana. Montana has enacted HB 176, which eliminates  same-day registration. It has been in place for 15 years. Nearly 8,200  Montanans used that option on election day in 2020--but, prejudicially,  wiped out.   SB 169 also, as a matter of fact, requires voters who do not have  certain specified IDs to get two forms of ID in order to vote at the  polls, making it harder to vote at the polls.   HB 50, also enacted, prohibits the mailing of ballots to new voters  who are eligible to vote on election day but are not yet 18, an attack  on younger voters. Why? Because younger voters tend to vote more often  for the Democratic candidate.   And SB 319 bans voter registration activities on public college  campus buildings such as dorms, study halls, and athletic facilities,  an absolute attack on the ability of college students to vote. Why?  Because they tend to vote more Democratic.   This strategy of deliberately attacking the ability to vote of young  Americans, college students, Native Americans, and Black Americans to  vote is so wrong. It is unethical. It violates the very premise of our  Constitution, which gives every American the right--the equal right--to  participate.   New Hampshire--in one new law, the secretary of state is enabled to  make up their own system of confirming voter residency so that it is  easier to take voters off the rolls. Why is that important? Well, the  Republican legislature is going to choose the secretary of state in New  Hampshire, and ideas have been floated in regard to ``Let's require  residency to be written so that your car has to be registered here if  you are a student who is here.'' And students can't afford to  reregister the car; so students won't be able to vote--another attack  on college students, as an example.   Texas--Texas attacks the drop boxes. The new law eliminates ballot  drop boxes for 16 million voters--16 million. The Governor limited  counties to just one drop box in 2020. The 4.7 million residents in  Harris County, where Houston is located, have to share one drop box for  a population equal to the entire population of Louisiana. It stops  127,000 voters in Harris County who availed themselves of curbside  voting to avail themselves of curbside voting in the future. The  legislature eliminated it.   I think the point should be adequately clear at this moment that in  State after State after State, Republican legislators and Republican- controlled legislatures are creating prejudicial laws to block  Democratic constituencies--constituencies that tend to favor the  Democratic Party--from voting. This is completely unacceptable, and it  is up to us to defend the rights of every American to vote.   Now, there are three States where the Republicans control the House  and the Senate but not the Governorship: Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, North  Carolina. And we know that changes may well happen there in 2 years.  Those Governors may be gone. Last year, the Democratic Governor of  Wisconsin vetoed six bills that would have severely restricted  citizens' ability to vote. So who knows what is going to come next?   Now, some have said: You know, all these measures won't make that big  a difference. Don't worry about it.   Well, I can tell you, those who say that are wrong. Let's think about  how it would affect this Senate. Let's say those measures could make a  3-percent difference in the outcome of the balloting. If that were the  case, then we would have seven Democratic Senators who are here today  who would not have been here. It wouldn't be a 50-50 Senate; it would  be a 57-43. Senator Ossoff won by 1.2 percent; Senator Peters of  Michigan, 1.7 percent; Senator Kelly of Arizona, 2.4 percent; Senator  Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, 2.4 percent; Senator Hassan of New  Hampshire, 0.1 percent; Senator Cortez Masto, 2.4 percent, Nevada.  Seven Senators would not be here today if you changed the outcome by 3  percent. There is a huge difference between a 50-50 Senate and a 57-43.    That is what this is about. It is about the targeting of swing States  by Republican legislatures to seize control of this body against the  voting will of the citizens of the United States of America.   This is why we have to set minimum standards that guarantee access to  ballot, minimum standards for vote-by-mail, minimum standards for early  voting, minimum standards for registration, minimum standards so folks  are not purged off the voting rolls without their knowledge.   I think about democracy, which we sometimes assume is the path more  traveled by countries around the world, and there was a period of a  decade or two where we saw the birth of a lot of new democracies. Now,  this last decade, we have seen many of them slide into authoritarianism  around the world. The truth is, most of the world  [[Page S98]]  is not governed by democracies. It is governed by authoritarian  governments. Democracy is the road less traveled. It takes incredible  vigilance to defend the ability of the citizen to participate.   And here we are at that moment where we have to defend the ability of  the citizen to participate. That vigilance, that responsibility, that  weight of preserving our ``We the People'' Republic is on our  shoulders. So the Freedom to Vote Act needs to be passed to ensure 15  days of early voting; to ensure access to vote-by-mail; to provide  relief for voters waiting in long lines; to ensure that poll workers  exist in sufficient numbers for the polling places and have adequate  training to operate them effectively; to take on gerrymandering through  national standards so that the House of Representatives, down this  hallway outside this door, reflects the will of the people instead of  being rigged for the powerful.   And the bill is needed to take on dark money, money no one knows  where it comes from. If you or I donated $100 to a campaign, it is  recorded. Everyone knows that we donated that money. But if the  billionaire spends tens of millions or hundreds of millions of dollars,  it is done in secret, dark money. Americans of every political entity-- Democratic, Republican, Independent--know this is corrupt, know that it  shouldn't happen, know that the same things should apply to the  billionaire as to the ordinary citizen.   We need to pass the Freedom to Vote Act, and we need to pass the John  Lewis Voting Rights bill. That bill restores preclearance. The 1965  bill, the Voting Rights Act, was a preclearance bill. It said that  those States that have conducted violations of the rights of citizens  to vote can't change election laws without getting them precleared to  make sure they are not prejudicial on the basis of race.   The Supreme Court has gutted that. The Supreme Court has operated as  a supreme legislature of the land and decided it wanted to legislate  out what this body and the House of Representatives passed  overwhelmingly in a bipartisan fashion.   The 2013 Shelby County decision opened the floodgates to voter  suppression and voter repression with laws like the ones I have been  talking about. Preclearance protects us against those corrupt  strategies that are yet to come, while the Freedom to Vote Act protects  us against the activities that have already occurred. We need to do  both.   All of us, Democrats and Republicans, should be working together as  the two parties did in 1965, as they did each and every time to renew  authorization of the Voting Rights Act, until now.   But, now, under the sway of President Trump, who has become the chief  champion of cheating Americans out of their right to vote, they have  decided to abandon their responsibility to defend the Constitution.   You know, in July of 1963, about a month after President Kennedy  unveiled his Civil Rights Act, Martin Luther King was here in  Washington, DC, giving interviews, and his words today still ring true.  He said: ``The tragedy is that we have a Congress with a Senate that  has a minority of misguided senators . . . that want [to keep] . . .  people from even voting.''   We thought that was cured in 1965. We have gone decades where we were  completely united around defending the right to vote. And, suddenly, we  have seen this past year the continuation. The assault on the Capitol  to disrupt the counting of electoral votes has been continued as an  assault in State after State after State after State to stop Democratic  constituencies from exercising their right to vote.   Raphael Warnock, Senator from Georgia, elected by less than 3  percent, said it boils down to this: ``Some people don't want some  people to vote.''   Well, if you have sworn an oath to the Constitution, you have sworn  an oath to ensure every citizen has a full opportunity to vote.   So much depends on the makeup of this body. Whether you care about  voting rights or attacking climate chaos or healthcare or housing,  whether you care about living wages and safe conditions for workers,  those decisions are affected by the makeup of this body. And the theory  of a democratic republic is that if the majority viewpoint is honored,  we will work to address those issues that the majority cares about.   And the majority does care about healthcare and housing and good  working conditions and clean air and clean water and taking on the  warming of this planet. The majority cares about that. If you take and  assault the ability of the minority to express their viewpoints, you  have destroyed that very premise of our democracy.   And voting rights is different than every other issue. On every other  issue, if we go off track, then the citizens can say: What have you  done? You lose my support. I am voting for the other party or the other  candidate. You promised to take on that challenge, and then you didn't.  You have lost my support, and I am exercising my ballot to put in  people who will actually address issues we care about.   But voting rights is different because that issue is about whether or  not the voters actually can exercise their outrage with us if we veer  off track. If you compromise voting, then the voters no longer have the  ability to throw you out--throw the bums out--and bring fresh voices to  bear on the issues they care about. That is why this is so important.   I am going to pivot to a little bit of history because for us to be  able to vote on voting rights in this Chamber, we have a problem, and  the problem is, the current rule of the Senate requires 60 votes to  allow us to get to a final vote, a final majority vote.   In essence, we have become a Chamber where policies cannot be passed  except by 60 votes of support. Many think, Isn't this the way the  Senate was designed? Isn't this the way that our Founders envisioned  the Senate? Didn't they talk about the Senate being a cooling saucer-- an expression attributed to President Washington that historians say he  never said, but still it captures the understanding of this Chamber-- that is, that this Chamber would be a little more steady than the House  would because we would have longer terms, 6-year terms instead of 2- year terms?   Now, it was debated that maybe 12-year terms, maybe lifetime  appointments to the Senate, but in the end, the Founders settled on 6- year terms to make this Chamber a little less rash to some current  trend that might be ill-considered than the Chamber down the hall. That  is the cooling saucer.   The Founders said that because Senators will have a larger territory  than House members, they will have more diverse constituents. They  won't just have a city or just a rural area; they will probably have  both and have to be thinking about how laws affect the farm, the ranch,  the suburb, the city, the manufacturing, all the different aspects of  our economy. So Senators will have a broader view. That is the cooling  saucer.   Then the Founders threw in something else and said: Furthermore, we  are going to say Senators will be elected indirectly by State  legislatures, not by the people. Again, give them a little more  insulation from citizens being very upset about something that hasn't  been well thought through.   But never, ever, ever did our Founders want this Chamber to have a  supermajority barrier, and we know this so clearly because they said  so. When they were writing the Constitution, they were operating under  the Confederation Congress, and the Confederation Congress required a  supermajority, and it was paralyzed. It couldn't even raise the money  to take on Shays' Rebellion. So those who were working to design our  1787 Constitution said: Whatever you do, don't embed a supermajority.   Let's see what they said. Hamilton, in Federalist Paper No. 22, said  that with the minority in control of the majority, the result will be  ``tedious delays . . . and . . . contemptible compromises of the public  good.'' He said the real impact of a supermajority will be ``to  embarrass the administration, to destroy the energy of government.''   On another occasion, he summed it up this way. He said:         If two thirds of the whole number of members had been       required, it would . . . amount in practice to a necessity of       unanimity. And the history of every political establishment       in which this principle has prevailed, is a history of       impotence, perplexity, and disorder.   [[Page S99]]     Why would he say that? Because the Confederation Congress was a  setting of impotence, perplexity, and disorder.    I don't know what other places around the world he was thinking of,  but he was certainly thinking of the Government of the United States at  that very moment.   Madison, in Federalist Paper 58, said:         It would be no longer the majority that would rule: the       power would be transferred to the minority.    He was noting that the principle of free government would be  reversed.   The principle of free government is that you go the direction the  majority weighs in on, not the minority. But when you require 60 votes  to go down path A, and without them, you go down path B, then you go  the direction the minority wants. You have done exactly what Madison  said we must not let happen. We are reversing the principle of free  government.   So we have seen two things. We have seen that--as the filibuster is  used more and more and eating up the time of the Senate, we have seen  amendments decline dramatically. We saw, for example, in the 109th  Congress some 314 amendments. That has declined to just 26 amendments  in the last Congress, the 116th Congress. We are currently in the  117th. Why is it? Well, Senators can't come to the floor and offer an  amendment.   When I was first here as an intern covering the floor for Senator  Hatfield during the Tax Reform Act of 1976, I watched how one amendment  was debated for an hour or so, voted on, and then half a dozen to a  dozen Senators would say to the Chair ``Mr. President, Mr. President,''  and the Chair was supposed to call on whomever he heard first--at that  point, it was always a man in the Chair--and that person would offer an  amendment, and an hour later, they would vote on it. And then again,  there would be a group seeking to get the next amendment, and they  would go on until they were exhausted.   That debate on a bill might go on for days and days or be spread over  the course of numerous weeks, with other intervening activity, as in  the Tax Reform Act of 1976, but every Senator knew they could offer an  amendment. If they cared about a tax issue, they could offer it, and  this body would have to debate it, would have to take a vote on it, but  not today--not today. We twiddle our thumbs while the majority and  minority leaders negotiate over amendments. The minority leader wants  to protect Republicans from having to vote on issues that they might be  embarrassed by. The majority leader wants to protect majority Members  from voting on issues they might be embarrassed by or that  constituencies might not support. So we twiddle our thumbs while the  leaders of the two parties debate. That is not how the Founders  envisioned this Senate.   This process of requiring 60 votes--it isn't just the 60 votes; it is  also the time it eats up because, in order to get that vote to close  debate, you have to file a cloture motion and you have to wait an  intervening day. So if you file it on a Monday, you have to wait until  Wednesday. Then, if it should pass and you close debate, you have to  have 30 hours of debate. Then, if a Senator wasn't allowed to vote  during those 30 hours, they get another hour, so tack on a few more  hours. So every cloture motion eats up a week of the Senate's time,  even if it is successful.   Well, we are about to see in the charts I am going to put up how this  is destroying the Senate.   After 1965, after the Voting Rights Act, the filibuster, the cloture  motion lost its racist taint because we had passed the 1965 Voting  Rights Act. So Senators started to think, Well, we can use this on  other issues. But, still, it was pretty much under control until the  early seventies.   In the early seventies, you saw an increase to about a dozen motions  per year, in 1971, 1972, 1973. In 1974, it exploded to almost three  dozen, and if you think about that eating up 36 weeks of the Senate's  time, people yelled: This is terrible. This is terrible.   So they reformed it in March of 1975, but that reform actually  backfired after a few years, and Senators started to use this cloture  motion--this cloture requirement in ways it hadn't been used but rarely  in times past. It hadn't been used on motions to proceed with bills to  the floor. It hadn't been used on amendments. It hadn't been used on  nominations.    But let's take a look at how that has changed. Let's look first at  the amendments--actually, cloture on nominations.   That one didn't make it through the printer in time, but here is the  story: On nominations, there were only three cloture motions in the  history of the United States before 1975--three. After 1975 to now, 852  times cloture has been filed on nominations; 852 weeks of the Senate's  time potentially obstructed.   Let's look at motions to proceed. Before the reform in 1975, only 16  times in our history had cloture motions been filed to keep a bill from  being debated on the floor of the Senate. Think about it. If the  filibuster was about enhancing debate, extending debate, here it is  being used to prevent debate, prevent a bill from ever being debated.  That is very relevant to the election bill we have been talking about  because, as Majority Leader Senator Schumer pointed out, four times  now, Republicans have voted to prevent an election bill from being  debated, ever getting started, a debate occurring on the floor of the  Senate.   It is the most anti-democratic thing to do, and both parties have  done it, but it is a practice that needs to end, and it is a practice  that exploded in the eighties, in the nineties, in the 2000s, in the  2010s--blocking bills from ever getting to the floor 175 times in the  decade 2010 through 2020.   Looking at cloture motions on amendments, it was considered  unacceptable to prevent votes on amendments until the 1970s, and then  the practice expanded. So you couldn't actually get your amendment up  because of the filling of the tree and the negotiating between the two  bodies, but if you did get it up, you could end up with it being  blocked because it was blocked by a 60-vote requirement to close the  debate on the amendment. The practice has continued and gone up and up  and up.   How about on final passage? Final passage before 1975, that is  virtually the only place where cloture was used, and that expanded as  well.   So we are seeing that the cloture motion that takes up a week  expanded in every single realm, and now, we are at an average of more  than 100 per year--more than 100 per year. We don't have a 100 weeks in  a year.   So the filibuster in its best form--its best form--is the ability of  the minority to stand here on the floor and speak to delay action while  they use that leverage to negotiate amendments or to negotiate  compromise, and both sides have an incentive to reach a deal.   They have an incentive to reach a deal because those who are  filibustering--it takes time and effort. That is difficult, so they  have an incentive to reach a deal. And the majority, which is  responsible for getting things done, has the goal of not having lots of  time eaten up by filibuster. So both sides have an incentive to  negotiate.   But under the current 60-vote requirement, that is not a filibuster;  it is a 60-vote requirement. It is a minority veto, and because it is a  minority veto, it doesn't incentivize negotiation. It does the exact  opposite, especially with the polarized tribal politics of today. The  base of both parties wants us to stop the other party, and so we  paralyze each other.   It is Mahatma Gandhi to whom it is attributed the phrase ``An eye for  an eye makes the whole world blind.'' It is the same challenge here. If  Democrats do everything they can to prevent Republican ideas from  getting into law to be tested and Republicans do everything they can to  prevent the Democratic ideas from being tested, then no ideas are  tested, and no issues are addressed, and the legislature fails in its  responsibility to the people of the United States of America, and that  is what is happening right now.   We are failing in our responsibility to the people of the United  States of America.   Now, there are two ways that we can get that election bill--so vital  to our responsibility under the Constitution, so vital to defending the  rights of Americans to vote--to the floor of the Senate and off the  floor.   One is to create a carve-out that says we will not apply the 60-vote  standard to the election bill because the election bill is too vital.   The second is to rehabilitate, reenergize the filibuster, return to  the vision  [[Page S100]]  that if you want to slow things down, you have to be on the floor  speaking. The way that it worked was that you kept that power in place  by making sure there were continuous speeches, one after the other,  because if there was a break, the Chair could call the question. That  means it comes before the public. That is a good thing. The public of  the United States will see us arguing the pros and cons of whether to  defend or not defend the voting rights of Americans. They would see us  debating whether to stop billionaires from buying elections or not with  dark money. They would see us debating the finer points of stopping  gerrymandering so the principle of equal representation would either be  honored or not honored. That debate would be healthy for the United  States of America.   Those are the only two possibilities right now to have an election  bill enacted to protect the rights of Americans: a carve-out or restore  the filibuster.   I powerfully believe the best path is to restore the filibuster. The  Senate is better off by having the rights of the minority honored, the  ability of minority Members to be heard; to slow things down to seek  amendments; to slow things down to seek compromise; to slow things down  to make sure a complicated bill has been weighed in by experts; to slow  things down to make sure the press has been able to examine what is in  the bill. That is all positive. That doesn't happen with a carve-out.   So I hope we will reinvigorate the filibuster; that all 50 of us will  say: Let's restore the balance in the Senate where the minority can  slow things down for those valuable reasons but ultimately cannot block  a final vote being taken.   This idea was here from the start. The initial Senate--26 Members-- they had a motion to move the prior question in the rule book, but they  never used it. So in 1805, when Aaron Burr directed the rewriting of  the rules, he said: We never use this rule, so let's take it out  because we all listen to each other before we vote.   That is a big positive. Every Member should be heard in this Chamber.  Every Member should be able to participate and have the ability to put  amendments forward, have their voice heard. We should not become the  House. The House of Representatives--the majority runs over the top of  the minority.   It is a better Chamber for having the voices of minority and majority  weighing in on legislation, having amendments from both parties being  considered. That is the reinvigoration of the filibuster in its best  light.   You know, a year ago and 1 day, a mob attacked the Presidential  election, but in the ensuing year, we have had 19 States attack Federal  elections for House and Senate Members by changing the rules in their  State prejudicially to try to block the young, the college students,  the Tribal members, the Black Americans from voting. It is wrong, but  it is happening, and it is on our shoulders, our responsibility, to  stop that.   Earlier, I referred to the fact that the path of democracy is not the  road most taken. Most of the people in the world operate under  authoritarian governments. We have been the shining light to the world  to say the right thing in human rights is for governance to flow up  from the people, not down from the powerful. We have been that light.  But if we cannot make this Chamber function, then the world does not  look at us and say, That is the model we want to follow. If we cannot  protect the rights of Americans to vote because their names are  stripped out of the voting rolls or they are blocked from registering  to begin with or blockades are put around the ballot box to make it  hard for them to participate, then we are not in a position where the  world looks to us and says, That system works. So it is incumbent on us  to fix it.   As I was thinking about these roads, the authoritarian road and the  democratic road, the role of the Republic and the Republican road being  the road less taken, it brings to my mind the poem by Robert Frost,  ``The Road Not Taken.''       Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,      And sorry I could not travel both.    He goes on to say at the end of the poem:       Two roads diverged in a wood, and I--      I took the one less traveled by,      And that has made all the difference.    That is how his poem ends.   We have taken the road less traveled, the road of power flowing up  from the people. It is the right road to take, and it makes the  difference.   Look at the vast difference between human rights being crushed by  China, enslaving a million people in Xinjiang Province, stripping the  democratic voice of the people, the right to free speech in Hong Kong,  versus the freedom we have in our Nation. Our road is the right road.  We have to make it work. To make it work, we need to pass the Freedom  to Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Act, and we need to do it  now.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  be in a period of morning business, with Senators permitted to speak  therein for up to 10 minutes each.
