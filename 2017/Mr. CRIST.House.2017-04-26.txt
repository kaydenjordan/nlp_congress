 Mr. Speaker, as vice chair of the Seniors Task Force, I  rise in strong defense of Social Security. Recent reports that the  White House is considering defunding Social Security and cutting Social  Security disability benefits are troubling, to say the least.   Nearly 61 million retirees, veterans, disabled workers, widows, and  children rely on their Social Security, including over 186,000 in my  district in Florida alone. On their behalf, I have a simple message:  Hands off their Social Security.   President Trump promised the American people he would not cut Social  Security. That is a promise we are going to help him keep.   Hands off Social Security.                            ____________________
