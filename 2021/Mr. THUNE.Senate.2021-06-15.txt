 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, unfortunately, predictions about the  negative economic effects of the so-called American Rescue Plan seem to  be coming true.   In March, Democrats pushed through this massive partisan spending  bill. They claimed it was urgently needed COVID funding. In reality,  the bill was filled with unnecessary spending, from a staggering $350  billion slush fund for States, a majority of which didn't need any more  government money to weather the rest of the pandemic, to almost $129  billion for schools, even though schools had spent just a tiny fraction  of the tens of billions of dollars Congress had already given them.   At the time, Republicans warned about the bill's level of spending.  More than just one liberal economist warned about the size of  Democrats' spending plan, with former Obama adviser Larry Summers  noting that the bill could ``set off inflationary pressures of a kind  we have not seen in a generation.''   Well, it turns out he was right to be worried. Last week, the Bureau  of Labor Statistics released its report on May's consumer prices, and  the news was not good. Inflation reached its highest level in nearly 13  years, with consumer prices up 5 percent from a year ago. Core  inflation, a measure of inflation that excludes food and energy prices,  soared to its highest level in nearly three decades.   And what does that mean? Well, higher prices for Americans. The price  of everything from bikes to bacon has shot up. Auto insurance costs 17  percent more than it did a year ago. Used cars cost 30 percent more.  Shoes and whole milk cost 7 percent more. Inflation is starting to look  like it could become nontransitory, or what most Americans call a  serious problem.   And Democrats' government spending spree is contributing, but, of  course, that is not causing Democrats to hit pause on the economic  overstimulation. Democrats are looking at more trillion-plus-dollar  spending bills.   The President just released a budget proposing to hike government  spending by trillions of dollars over the next 10 years. Under the  President's plan, the Federal budget would be $6 trillion for fiscal  year 2022, rising to $8.2 trillion for fiscal year 2031. Now, to put  those numbers in perspective, the entire Federal budget for 2019 came  to $4.4 trillion. The President is proposing to nearly double that by  2031.   It is disturbing that the overspending in the American Rescue Plan  hasn't made Democrats think twice about future government sprees, but  it is not all that surprising because in the Democratic Party these  days, dogma tends to triumph over reality--or practicality. Democrats  are ever more fanatically committed to expanding government and taxing  Americans, and they are not slowed down by little details like damaging  the economy.   Take the increased unemployment benefits situation. Congress provided  a Federal increase in unemployment benefits early in the pandemic when  businesses were closed and workers had few alternatives to keep their  families afloat, but as early as last fall, there were signs that our  economy was rebounding. And with the arrival of the COVID vaccines, it  became clear that America would be able to get fully back to work  sooner rather than later.   But Democrats insisted on continuing the increased unemployment  benefits until September of 2021, and the effect has been predictable.  Despite record-high job openings, many people are declining to return  to work because they can make more money staying home and drawing  unemployment benefits.   Businesses hit hard by the pandemic are desperate to return to full  operating capacity, but they are being slowed down by the fact that  they can't find workers. In response to the worker shortage, a number  of Governors around the country decided to stop accepting the Federal  increase in unemployment benefits. They wanted to help businesses in  their States and get their residents back to work.   And how did Democrats respond to that? Well, more than one Democrat  responded by suggesting that the Federal Government step in to make  sure these payments continue. That is right. Despite evidence that the  increased unemployment benefits were discouraging workers from going  back to work, some Democrats wanted to prevent Governors from halting  these payments.   Nowhere is Democrats' devotion to dogma over reality more notable  than in their proposed capital gains tax hike. Now, I don't need to  tell anyone that ``tax the rich'' has become the rallying cry of the  Democratic Party. And one of the ways that the President plans to tax  well-off Americans is by doubling the top capital gains rate to almost  40 percent.   The problem is that a 40-percent capital gains rate substantially  exceeds the revenue-maximizing rate. In nonaccountant speak, what that  means is that Democrats could collect more  [[Page S4526]]  government revenue if they raised the capital gains tax less. Let me  repeat that. Democrats could collect more government revenue if they  raised the capital gains tax less.   Now, you would think that the President would want to maximize the  revenue the government could collect, especially with his plans for 10  years of massive government spending, which I alluded to earlier. But  in today's Democratic Party, taxing the rich is more important than  maximizing government revenue, just like tax hikes on corporations are  more important than making sure our economy grows and that American  companies can compete on the global stage--or raising taxes is more  important than passing legislation to boost American infrastructure.   That is right. The President would have reached an agreement with  Republicans on a substantial infrastructure bill, but he tanked  negotiations because he was insistent that any bill repeal parts of the  2017 tax reform legislation, the same legislation that had driven up  wages and boosted our economy before the pandemic hit.   Democrats are so committed to taxation that they included a provision  in the bloated COVID legislation that they passed specifically  prohibiting State governments from using COVID relief money to cut  taxes. Apparently, Democrats are fine with government payments to  Americans, but allowing them to keep more of their own money is off the  table.   Democrats have long been interested in higher taxes to pay for more  government spending, but to today's Democrats, taxation is rapidly  becoming a good in itself. Democrats are no longer just interested in  raising taxes to raise revenue. If they were, they wouldn't be planning  to jack up the capital gains tax rate to over 40 percent. They are  interested in raising taxes because they believe that success should be  punished.   In the increasingly socialist Democratic Party, it doesn't matter how  hard you work to get where you are, how many people you have created  jobs for, or how much good you are doing with your money; if you have  been successful, you should be heavily taxed for your efforts, even if  those heavy taxes actually cost the government money or hamstring the  American economy.   The growing commitment in the Democratic Party to an increasingly  rigid, socialist dogma is deeply disturbing, and it is certainly not  limited to a fanatical commitment to taxation or spending. It embraces  everything from a social agenda that is increasingly hostile to freedom  of religion and freedom of speech to a fundamental belief that  government knows best when it comes to how Americans run their lives.   But, for today, I am just going to limit myself to taxes and  spending. Let's hope that Democrats rethink their planned government  spending sprees before inflation really gets out of control and hard- working Americans end up paying the price.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator  from Florida (Mr. Rubio).
