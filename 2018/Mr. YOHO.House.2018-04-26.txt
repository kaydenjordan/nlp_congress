 Madam Speaker, I rise this evening with a saddened heart to  honor Sergeant Noel Ramirez and Deputy Taylor Lindsey of the Gilchrist  County Sheriff's Office, who tragically lost their lives in the line of  duty on April 19, 2018, in a senseless, evil, and cowardly act, with  complete disregard and respect for law enforcement officers and life  itself.   While I no longer represent Gilchrist County here in Congress, my  wife, Carolyn, and I operated two of our veterinary businesses there.  It is the epitome of an idyllic American town that espouses the values  of America, God, country, and family. Our thoughts are with the entire  community as we recover from this tragedy.   Sergeant Ramirez was born on June 30, 1988, in Brooklyn, New York.  After graduating high school in Puerto Rico with honors, he began his  career in law enforcement.   During his service to the people of Gilchrist County, he played an  active role in recruiting new members to the Gilchrist team to grow  what he liked to call ``the family'' in the Gilchrist County Sheriff's  Office.   He was a medalist in the First Responder Games in both basketball and  weight lifting, but more importantly than that, he was a loving and  dedicated father and husband.   He is survived by his wife, Gigi; their two children, Noel Lito and  Zoey; along with his parents and family.   Deputy Taylor Lindsey was born on June 30, 1992, in Gainesville,  Florida, and graduated from Gainesville High School. Deputy Lindsey  joined Gilchrist County Sheriff's Office in 2013, where he began his  lifelong dream to be a law enforcement officer.   From a young age, he wanted to be a law enforcement officer, and he  couldn't say ``patrol'' so he called it ``P-trol,'' and he went on to  fulfill that dream. He worked there for 3 years.   While quiet at first, he was quick to laugh, and those who worked  with him can tell you a favorite Taylor Lindsey story.   Deputy Lindsey is survived by his parents, his family, and his  girlfriend, Kristin Hite.   John 15:13 reminds us there is no greater love than to lay down one's  life for their friends. Both officers gave the ultimate sacrifice and  epitomized the meaning of service before self. Our lives and our  community, our State and, in fact, our Nation are better because of  their service.   Rest easy, gentlemen. We now have your watch.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
