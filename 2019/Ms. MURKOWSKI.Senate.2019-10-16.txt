 Mr. President, I want to take a few minutes to  recognize the life of a highly respected Athabascan elder Howard Luke,  who died September, 21, 2019 in Fairbanks, AK, at age 95.   With the passing of Native elder Howard Luke, Alaska has lost a  highly respected Athabascan leader who dedicated his life to empowering  the Alaska Native community and ensuring that cultural and traditional  knowledge will be passed down to younger generations.   Howard Luke was born in 1923 in Nenana, later moving to Fairbanks  with his mother at age 13. A man with a true gentle spirit, Howard made  a unique contribution to our State, and he shared his passion of the  Athabascan language and traditional ways.   He always stressed the importance of school for young people while  also learning their traditions. At his mother's side, he learned the  stories and values and subsistence way of life of his people. He  sometimes talked about wishing he had received more formal schooling  and that he felt hindered by stopping school after the fourth grade;  yet he was constantly pursuing learning. He travelled to New Zealand,  Australia, Russia, and visited other Tribes throughout the United  States. In honor of his efforts, the Fairbanks North Star Borough  School District named an alternative school after him. In 1991, he  received an honorary high school diploma from that school. Howard later  received an honorary doctorate from the University of Alaska Fairbanks.   In discussing his efforts with schools, he said that he wanted  teachers to help the kids more than anything else. He knew that you  can't just tell them, ``This is the way to do it,'' and leave them  alone. You have got to help them. His approach was based on the idea  that you have got to make the kids proud of themselves for what they  were able to do.   Howard made sure to focus on educating young indigenous people, ``the  grandkids,'' about the rich culture and values that are their  inheritance.   Howard dedicated his later life to culture camps and cultural  education in the schools. He started a camp on the banks of the Chena  River, the Gaaleeya Spirit Camp, to teach skills to Native youth, such  as art, language, and how to live off the land.   He was a common and welcoming elder in Canada and the Chilkoot  Culture Camp in Haines. He shared traditional practices of hunting,  teaching deep respect for those resources that are so much a part of  Alaska Natives lifestyles.   The knowledge that he had and shared with others is something you  cannot learn in a university. This knowledge is passed down from elders  to youth, and he recognized the importance of sustaining places for  younger generations to learn the ways of their ancestors.   Howard Luke always said, if you love the kids, they will know that  they are loved. He also always told the kids to be proud of themselves.  Howard was loved in return, and Alaskans are immensely proud of all  that he contributed to the State. My deepest condolences to his  friends, family, and loved ones during this time as we reflect on the  life a legendary Alaskan.                            ____________________
