 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the St. Cloud  Federal Credit Union for being named one of the top 150 workplaces in  Minnesota by the Minneapolis Star Tribune.   The companies selected were based off of a survey done by Workplace  Dynamics, which measured the employees' opinions on engagement,  organizational health, and overall satisfaction at their company. This  is a wonderful achievement for the St. Cloud Federal Credit Union as  Workplace Dynamics surveyed nearly 70,000 employees throughout  Minnesota to come up with these results.   For every company, no matter how big or small, the employees are the  key to securing success. The hard work they put in every day is  critical, so it is imperative that management ensures they feel both  valued and respected.   I want to congratulate everyone at the St. Cloud Federal Credit Union  on their incredible teamwork, and I especially want to congratulate  management for creating a great workplace for their employees. Your  company and employees will continue to thrive due to your leadership.  Keep up the good work.                            ____________________
