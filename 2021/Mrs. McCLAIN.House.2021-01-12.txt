 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Oklahoma.   I rise today to echo many of my colleagues in the call for unity and  a peaceful transition of power. I say this as a believer in the  Constitution and the fact that the election has been certified.   First, the incitement of politically motivated violence that we saw  last week is intolerable. Words have consequences, and, yes, the  President could have done more. But I ask you this: Doesn't everybody  need to play by the same rules?   Let me highlight some other questionable statements.   And I quote: ``Let's make sure we show up wherever we have to show  up. And if you see anybody from that Cabinet in a restaurant, in a  department store, at a gas station, you get out and you create a crowd,  and you push back on them, and you tell them they are not welcome  anymore, anywhere.'' That was not President Trump.   Let me give you another one. ``I just don't even know why there  aren't uprisings all over the country.'' Again, not President Trump.   Can we all agree that at times our emotions get in the way because we  love this country so much? But I ask you this: Whatever is good for one  side, isn't it good for the other?   We all have the same name on the front of our jersey, and that is the  United States of America. We need to start acting like it and let our  actions follow our words.    Impeachment only incites more division. It does not provide unity.   I offer a solution. I am ready to come together and get to work for  this great country in which we live.
