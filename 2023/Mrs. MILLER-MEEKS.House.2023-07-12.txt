 Mr. Speaker, one of the biggest threats we face  today as a Nation is the threat of the Chinese Communist Party at home  and abroad.   The fiscal year 2024 National Defense Authorization Act includes  funding that protects the citizens of the United States from the  imminent threat of the Chinese Communist Party. It requires the DOD to  notify Congress of collaborative nuclear efforts between China and  Russia and assess the cooperation between China and Iran on ICBM  technology.   This year's NDAA counters aggression from the Chinese Communist Party  on every front. It promotes processes for our small businesses to enter  the market to work with the DOD in an effort to continue to grow the  American small business economy and onshore manufacturing capacity to  the United States.   Additionally, the NDAA recognizes the growing threat of the Chinese  Communist Party to Taiwan, reaffirming U.S. support of the defense of  Taiwan to allow Taiwan to defend itself and fully funds military  exercises with our allies and partners in the Pacific to counter  China's growing military expansion.   Further, the NDAA protects us at home by building up our  cybersecurity capabilities and developing new emerging technologies in  AI to help our soldiers defend against threats against our Nation and  the largest pay raise in over 20 years of 5.2 percent, barely keeping  pace with inflation, to help our enlisted and lower-paid  servicemembers.   Supporting the NDAA is essential in making sure our soldiers and  interests abroad are supported and defended to the highest standard,  while also making sure that all of us at home in the United States are  protected from threats, as well.   Mr. Speaker, according to the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, it  is estimated that 6 out of 100 people will have PTSD at some point in  their lives. Sadly, the incidence of PTSD is higher in veterans and  Active Duty servicemembers.   As a doctor, former director of the Iowa Department of Health, and a  24-year U.S. Army veteran, the mental, emotional, and physical health  of my constituents and fellow veterans is one of my top priorities in  Congress. For too long, PTSD and other mental or physical ailments have  had devastating effects, and far too often, they go untreated.   The new FDA guidance that presents considerations for designing  clinical trials for psychedelic drugs will give patients and their  doctors increased access to effective treatments rather than  alternatives such as opioids.   That is why I introduced the Veterans CARE Act to allow the VA to  research the effectiveness of using medical cannabis for chronic mental  and physical pain and why we have held roundtables on emerging  breakthrough therapies.   I hope others will join me in supporting these novel forms of  research that will benefit our heroic veterans.                            ____________________
