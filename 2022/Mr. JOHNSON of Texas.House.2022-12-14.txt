 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the bill  before us today, which will provide one additional week of continuing  appropriations to allow work on the Omnibus appropriations act to be  completed. In addition, the bill includes the ``Providing Research and  Estimates of Changes in Precipitation'', or ``PRECIP Act.''   I am proud to be an original cosponsor of Representative Sherrill's  bipartisan PRECIP Act. Representative Sherrill has been a tireless  advocate for improving our understanding of extreme precipitation. As  the Chairwoman of the Subcommittee on Environment of the Science,  Space, and Technology Committee, Representative Sherrill has been a  steadfast  [[Page H9815]]  leader in promoting understanding of how science can help better  prepare our communities for extreme precipitation events, and the  PRECIP Act is a direct outcome of those efforts. This bill will address  gaps in accurate probable maximum precipitation, or PMP, estimates and  it directs NOAA to enter into an agreement with the National Academies  of Science, Engineering, and Medicine to conduct a study on the best  practices for estimating precipitation.   The PRECIP Act will ensure precipitation estimates are updated at  least every decade across the U.S. Further, this legislation will  direct the NOAA to include forecasted changes in precipitation due to  climate change in precipitation studies.   We have been feeling the changes in precipitation across the country,  and these changes will only get more extreme with climate change.  Having access to the best available information is critical to protect  lives, taxpayer dollars, and infrastructure. The PRECIP Act will assist  stakeholders such as floodplain managers, emergency managers, local  governments, and many more. I urge my colleagues to support this  legislation.
