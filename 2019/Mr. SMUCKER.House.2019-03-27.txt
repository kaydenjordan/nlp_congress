 Madam Speaker, March is Women's History Month, and I am  proud to honor some remarkable women in my district.   Today, I am recognizing Ms. Cher Kondor, who I had the honor of  meeting just recently. Cher is a Gold Star mother. Her son, Martin  Kondor, was a U.S. Army specialist killed in Baqubah, Iraq, in 2004.   Of course, Ms. Kondor was devastated, but she decided to do something  in his honor and in honor of all the other veterans who have served,  particularly those who have sacrificed their lives for our freedom.   She created a memorial veterans garden called the Gold Star Garden in  York County and has raised, since the time it was created, nearly $1  million for the garden. This beautiful, living monument is a gathering  place for those who want to commemorate and remember the fallen and  celebrate the lives of our sons and daughters who volunteered to  protect this country.   Ms. Kondor honors our Nation's veterans, and it is a privilege to  recognize her contribution to our community on the House floor today.   We are thankful for her example and for her continued awareness of  the sacrifices of those who have fought for us and for our freedom.   I am proud to honor Ms. Kondor.                            ____________________
