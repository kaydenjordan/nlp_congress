 Mr. Speaker, there is kind of a rather ridiculous  healthcare bill that this body may or may not be considering soon.   First of all, it creates an entirely new entitlement program at the  State level rather than the Federal level.   Second of all, in an unrelated matter, it provides huge tax cuts to  millionaires and billionaires--mostly in New York and California--which  has nothing to do with making health care affordable. I mean, it is  fine. Republicans want to do that. We get that. They always want to cut  taxes for millionaires, but don't put it in the same bill as we are  here trying to provide health care for people and bring down our  insurance rates.   Third of all, this bill that is supposed to somehow help is going to  increase insurance costs to American families by 15 to 20 percent. Most  families can't afford that, and 24 million people will lose their  insurance.   So there is just no way, shape, or form that this bill makes any  sense.   There are a lot of positive improvements and suggestions that we can  make to the Affordable Care Act. There are a lot of great ideas with us  providing a public option, more pricing transparency, a lot of great  ideas that probably Democrats and Republicans support; but, frankly,  they missed the mark on this bill.   These aren't ideas that Democrats or Republicans support, because  they are bad ideas that cost families money.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume,  and I thank the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Collins) for yielding me  the customary 30 minutes.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this rule today, one that  provides for consideration of H.R. 372, the Competitive Health  Insurance Reform Act of 2017, a good bill that I support.   Mr. Speaker, the Competitive Health Insurance Reform Act amends the  McCarran-Ferguson Act so that the health insurance companies would no  longer be exempt from Federal antitrust regulation.   Currently, unfortunately, most types of insurance, including property  or life insurance, are exempt from Federal antitrust regulations and  statutes. The McCarran-Ferguson Act makes it clear that the insurance  industry heretofore has been regulated only by States. Additionally,  the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission have  retained authority for antitrust enforcement involving mergers and  acquisitions of insurance companies, but not dominations of markets and  competition.   As a result of this exemption, the health insurance industry does not  [[Page H2254]]  have to share pricing information, and actually can currently  communicate with one another to fix prices. Now, that doesn't make  sense.   I firmly believe that the more transparency in our healthcare system,  the better off consumers will be. Repealing the health insurance  exemption of the McCarran-Ferguson Act may improve competition, but it  would almost also result in more transparency in health insurance. It  is something that we sorely need. So I intend to join many of my  colleagues on both sides of the aisle in supporting the underlying bill  because it increases transparency.   The reality is that this bill does nothing to replace the protections  of the Affordable Care Act. It doesn't even make a dent in addressing  the many problems created by the Republican healthcare legislation, the  American Health Care Act.   Mr. Speaker, so I don't want anybody listening to this to be  distracted by a bipartisan bill that we hope becomes law. In any way,  shape, or form, this bill does nothing when, in 2 days, we are  considering a bill that threatens the health care for 24 million  Americans, increases prices for Americans who are currently insured by  15 to 20 percent, and throws millions off of the rolls of the insured.   The Republican healthcare bill that is coming to the floor Thursday  will cause a huge disruption in coverage for millions of Americans. It  creates an entirely new entitlement program. It would throw 24 million  people who currently have insurance out of insurance. And for anybody  who still has insurance, their rates go up 15 to 20 percent.   How is that a good idea? It is not.   This bill today does nothing. Nothing. I don't even think the  advocates of it would say it does anything to address those increases  in costs for consumers or 24 million people losing their health care or  the creation of a brand-new costly entitlement program in a time of  record deficits.   For constituents--and we all represent people from our districts--for  people like Greg and Nikita, Coloradoans who have shared their stories  with me, the passage of the American Health Care Act, the Republican  healthcare bill, would devastate their lives.   Greg was diagnosed with a rare form of cancer in 2014, in his  midforties. After several surgeries, his doctors told him his condition  is inoperable and could only be treated chronically by medication. It  is a very expensive injection that has so far been successful, thank  goodness, at keeping the tumor from growing and allowing Greg to live  an ordinary life.   Now, Greg needs this shot every 3 weeks. It is thousands of dollars  each time. And despite working at least two jobs, it is not something  that Greg could afford to have--Greg would not have health care without  the Affordable Care Act. He would have to quit his jobs and become  destitute and go on Medicaid.   The Republicans are basically saying to people like Greg: We want you  to be lazy. We want you to quit your job so you could have health care.  We want you to live off the government dole of this brand-new  entitlement program that we created to hand you money rather than work  for yourself and pay for your own insurance.   That is the message the Republicans are sending to people like Greg  across the country.   Nikita lives in Boulder and has spent much of her life battling  endometriosis. In 2014, she was having trouble walking because of her  condition and she missed work for a few weeks. After the passage of the  Affordable Care Act, she was able to afford the surgery that she needed  to improve her mobility and manage her pain.   In her message to me, Nikita emphasized that affordable health care  is what allows her to work and to be a citizen that pays taxes and  contributes to society rather than somebody who is shut in at home,  living off the government dole like Republicans are trying to force her  to do with the new entitlement program that they are creating.   If Nikita didn't have the healthcare coverage she obtained through  the Accordable Care Act, she said that she would be on disability and  Medicaid, costing the government far more money and preventing her the  dignity of holding a job and working to support herself and paying  taxes.   Both Greg and Nikita expressed fear that the benefits they receive  under the Affordable Care Act would disappear if the Affordable Care  Act is dismantled in favor of this new Republican entitlement program  that encourages people not to work. The American Health Care Act  threatens to pull the rug out from so many of my constituents and  millions across the country while simultaneously raising rates by 15 to  20 percent for people who are currently insured and paying for their  own insurance.   Look, H.R. 372 is a fine bill. Republicans are using it as a talking  point, claiming that somehow it addresses costs in some meaningful way.  And given how complicated the healthcare system is and the critical  role that we all have to play in it and every little piece plays, it is  important to lay out the facts of the Republican plan, which H.R. 372  does nothing to address.   It is a fact fewer people will be covered under the Republican plan.  The Congressional Budget Office says 24 million people will lose their  healthcare coverage over the next decade.   It is a fact that middle-aged Americans will pay five times more in  premiums. The age tax is a big part of the Republican healthcare bill.  Americans ages 55 to 64 will see their cost increase by over $8,000.  Most of my constituents in that age group simply can't afford that  every year.   It is a fact that those currently enrolled in Medicaid programs are  at risk of losing their coverage. The Republicans' concern that  Medicaid expansion to the Affordable Care Act was coercive, they should  be equally concerned about the per capita cap in the Republican plan.  It is the flip side of the same coin.   Those are just some of the many troubling facts about the Republican  healthcare bill.   H.R. 372, removing the antitrust exemption, is a fine bill. It does  nothing to address any of those problems or change any of those facts  and figures that I cited as to why this bill doesn't fix health care.   In fact, frankly, this bill is a distraction from the real topic we  should be discussing--how to improve health care in this country. I  don't think we should improve it by giving tax cuts to millionaires and  billionaires, forcing people like Greg and Nikita not to work and to be  destitute in order to get health care and go on the government dole,  creating a brand-new entitlement program that States administer,  increasing the costs of insurance for people who are already insured by  15 to 20 percent.   Mr. Speaker, if those are the answers, what is the question? Is it  how to make health care cost more and how to have less people covered?   If that is the question, the Republican bill is a good answer.   That is not the question my constituents are asking me, and I don't  think it is a question their constituents are asking my Republican  colleagues.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Two weeks ago, the Republicans pushed ahead with their healthcare  bill, despite not knowing the impact of the legislation. A week later,  the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office announced that the bill  would take health insurance away from 24 million people and increase  costs by 15 to 20 percent for those who currently have insurance.   Mr. Speaker, late last night the Republicans introduced a major  manager's amendment that changes the bill, frankly.   Mr. Speaker, just as it was irresponsible to move forward without  knowing the full effects of the original bill, it is completely  reckless to even know whether this manager's amendment makes it better  or worse and the impact that it has on health care for American  families. It is reckless to consider and vote on their amended bill  before the Congressional Budget Office even says how much it costs, or  how much it will increase insurance by, or whether it throws people off  insurance rolls.   Mr. Speaker, if we defeat the previous question, I will offer an  amendment to the rule that would require a CBO cost estimate that  analyzes the impact of any legislation amending or repealing the  Affordable Care Act, as well as the impact of any manager's amendment  to that legislation to be made publicly available before the bill may  be considered on the House floor.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment in the Record along with extraneous material immediately  prior to the vote on the previous question.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Colorado?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I am proud to yield 4 minutes to the  distinguished gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Yarmuth), the ranking member  on the Committee on the Budget, to discuss our proposal.    Mr. Speaker, I am proud to yield 4 minutes to the  distinguished gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Yarmuth), the ranking member  on the Committee on the Budget, to discuss our proposal.    I yield an additional 1 minute to the gentleman.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I am awaiting the graphic presentation about some of  what is at stake in this debate about the Affordable Care Act, the  fundamental debate about whether we try to fix health care in this  country, make insurance cost less, or whether we move backwards under  this Republican healthcare proposal.   The Republican healthcare proposal would create an entirely new  entitlement program administered by the States. In creating this  program, it would throw 24 million people who have healthcare insurance  today off of the insurance rolls. They would become uninsured  Americans.   It would add an age tax on older Americans. It would also increase  the cost of health care for people who have health care today and pay  for it, by 15 to 20 percent. Now, they wouldn't be getting more for  that 15 to 20 percent.   Mr. Speaker, if you can believe it, they would actually be getting  less insurance for that 15 to 20 percent because many of the  requirements that insurance has to have are rolled back, the Federal  protections under this Republican healthcare bill.   Somehow, at the same time it does all these things, the same time it  costs 24 million Americans their insurance, the same time it increases  rates by 15 to 20 percent--and, by the way, these figures are from the  nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, the head of which was  appointed by Republicans.   These are solid predictions that are done by people who were  appointed by Republicans. We are not citing any outside group or  naysayers who don't like the bill. These are the objective  Congressional Budget Office numbers that we are citing here in their  entirety.   So, in addition to costing people 15 to 20 percent more, this bill  also, for reasons unknown, gives an enormous multibillion-dollar tax  break to millionaires and billionaires in New York and California. That  is where most of them live. Now, there are a few in other places, of  course, too.   But it is just unclear why, at the same time Republicans are trying  to change the healthcare law, they want to go back to giving enormous  tax cuts to the wealthiest Americans. We are not even talking the  wealthiest 1 percent. We are talking, like, one-tenth of a percent who  are going to see the bulk of the benefit from these tax cuts, at the  same time that health care is being taken away from 24 million people  who have insurance today, and at the same time those who are fortunate  enough to be able to continue to have it will have to pay 15 to 20  percent more.   That is why, Mr. Speaker, this bill is so unpopular. If you are going  to go through the trouble of creating an entirely new entitlement  program, at least do it in a way where it actually helps people afford  coverage versus hurts their ability to afford coverage.    Now, I gave the example in my remarks of Greg, and that is far from  unique because people today, who rely on the subsidies to be able to  get health insurance within the Affordable Care Act, if the Republican  bill passes, would have to quit their jobs and rely on Medicaid  instead, or they would have to take a lower-wage job. Instead of  earning $40,000 or $50,000 a year, they would have to quit that job and  try to take a minimum-wage job so they could qualify for Medicaid.   Essentially, this Republican healthcare bill is telling Americans,  you need to be lazy and not work if you want health care because, if  you want to work a job, we are going to take it away. We are only going  to provide it if you quit your job or take a minimum-wage job under  Medicaid.   So that is not the message or the incentives that we want to send to  the American people. One of the great aspects of the Affordable Care  Act is it actually, for the first time, provided an incentive for  people to get increases in their wages, to get better jobs, to work  additional hours.   Before the Affordable Care Act, we were locked into a scenario where  people who were on Medicaid lost their Medicaid benefits if they got a  raise at work, depending on the size of their family. It could have  been a raise from, let's say, $14 an hour to $16 an hour. They couldn't  work overtime. They couldn't work a second job, as so many people do to  escape from poverty because they would lose their health care.   The Affordable Care Act said: You know what? We are going to allow  you and encourage you to work that second job, to get a raise and  support your health care as you make your way out of poverty into the  middle class. What a great idea.   The Republican proposal creates a brand new entitlement program, but  rolls back those affordability protections that help people work their  way out of poverty, and leaves no alternative for people like Nikita  and Greg, other than you have to quit your job or work a minimum-wage  job because, otherwise, we are going to take your health care away from  you.                                time  1300    That is the reason that the projections came back--no surprise--that  24 million people will lose their healthcare insurance. It is the  reason that healthcare insurance rates will increase 15 to 20 percent.   We don't know the reason that they are also giving a tax cut to  billionaires in the same bill. We know they want to do that, but they  should do that in a tax bill. There is an effort at tax reform. I think  they are talking about giving an additional tax cut to billionaires in  that bill. That will be debated separately. But it is unclear how--or  it is more than unclear as to why it would help make health care more  affordable to give a tax cut to billionaires. It just doesn't make any  sense. Let's debate that under a different bill.  [[Page H2257]]  I am happy to do that. As part of a broader tax proposal, we will see  what else is in it. We know Republicans want to do that, but they  shouldn't do that under the guise of health care.   So, again, Mr. Speaker, what you have here in this Republican bill,  which this current bill does nothing to change--and this bill will  pass, it has passed before, and we hope the Senate acts on it to remove  the antitrust exemption. This bill does nothing to change the facts on  the ground that the Republican healthcare bill that creates a brand new  entitlement program would make Americans pay more for less, 24 million  people would lose their insurance, there is an age tax on older  Americans, guts Medicaid, huge tax cuts for millionaires and  billionaires, increases of 15 to 20 percent for Americans who are lucky  enough to retain their insurance, and discourages work and encourages  people to be lazy at home to get health care.   It is the opposite of what we want to do. It is contrary to the  American work ethic, and it is contrary to all incentives around cost  containment. I hope--I really hope, Mr. Speaker--that the House defeats  this awful bill to replace the Affordable Care Act, even as we pass  some of these commonsense bipartisan measures like the one before us  today that, around the edges, could potentially affect antitrust within  insurance companies.   Mr. Speaker, the bill under consideration today is a commonsense  piece of legislation. It has passed the House before. Ultimately,  however, it distracts from the elephant in the room. The American  Health Care Act is the Republican bill to roll back and change the  Affordable Care Act and create a brand new entitlement program while  increasing the insurance rates for American families, providing tax  cuts to billionaires, and throwing 24 million people off of the  insurance rolls.   My colleagues across the aisle had 7 years to work with us to improve  the Affordable Care Act, but they refused to work with us to make  health care more affordable and to expand coverage. Instead, they have  drafted a bill that does the exact opposite. No wonder we were unable  to find common ground when our goals were different.   The goals of myself and Democrats have always been to reduce costs  and expand coverage. Reading into what the Republican goals must be if  this bill meets them, it seems like they are working to decrease  coverage and increase costs--the opposite of what we are working for.   How will my colleagues look into the eyes of a former veteran or a  small-business owner or a middle class family or my constituents like  Greg or Nikita and somehow tell them that they would be better off  under a plan that forces them to quit their jobs and become destitute?  How will Republicans defend the vote to senior citizens when the age  tax in this bill will force most seniors to pay premiums five times  higher than what others pay for healthcare coverage? What will my  colleagues say to 24 million people who lose healthcare coverage  entirely under this bill?   The Republican healthcare bill that this body will consider on  Thursday will do extraordinary damage to the healthcare system and  leave millions of Americans guessing as to how much healthcare costs  will cost and what will be covered. The American healthcare bill  threatens to roll back important protections in coverage gains  delivered by the ACA, and discussion of anything else at this point is  a diversionary tactic, plain and simple.   Mr. Speaker, let's defeat the previous question and figure out how  much this mysterious manager's amendment even changes the bill for  better or worse. My colleague, Mr. Yarmuth, made a very compelling  argument about how we need to know the actual costs and benefits of any  bill we vote on; yet, this body is being forced to vote blind on a  manager's amendment that we saw for the first time today and could even  change by tomorrow, and we won't even know how it affects the costs of  this bill or how it affects the lives of Americans who have health care  today or aspire to it.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to defeat the previous  question and vote ``no'' on the rule, to vote ``yes'' on this  commonsense bill to modify our antitrust statutes which Democrats and  Republicans have supported overwhelmingly in the past, but never, not  once, to take our eye away from the ball of trying to decrease costs  rather than increase costs and trying to expand coverage rather than  retract coverage.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. This is a 5-minute vote.   The vote was taken by electronic device, and there were--ayes 234,  noes 182, not voting 13, as follows:                               [Roll No. 177]                                 AYES--234       Abraham      Aderholt      Allen      Amash      Amodei      Arrington      Babin      Bacon      Banks (IN)      Barletta      Barr      Barton      Bergman      Biggs      Bilirakis      Bishop (MI)      Bishop (UT)      Black      Blackburn      Blum      Bost      Brady (TX)      Brat      Bridenstine      Brooks (AL)      Brooks (IN)      Buchanan      Buck      Bucshon      Budd      Burgess      Byrne      Calvert      Carter (GA)      Carter (TX)      Chabot      Chaffetz      Cheney      Coffman      Cole      Collins (GA)      Collins (NY)      Comer      Comstock      Conaway      Cook      Costello (PA)      Cramer      Crawford      Crist      Culberson      Curbelo (FL)      Davidson      Davis, Rodney      Denham      Dent      DeSantis      DesJarlais      Diaz-Balart      Donovan      Duffy      Duncan (SC)      Duncan (TN)      Dunn      Emmer      Farenthold      Faso      Ferguson      Fitzpatrick      Fleischmann      Flores      Foxx      Franks (AZ)      Frelinghuysen      Gaetz      Gallagher      Garrett      Gibbs      Gohmert      Goodlatte      Gosar      Gowdy      Granger      Graves (GA)      Graves (LA)      Graves (MO)      Griffith      Grothman      Guthrie      Harper      Harris      Hartzler      Hensarling      Herrera Beutler      Hice, Jody B.

There are 2  minutes remaining.                                time  1342    So the resolution was agreed to.   The result of the vote was announced as above recorded.   A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume,  and I thank the gentleman for yielding me the customary 30 minutes.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this rule today that provides  for consideration of H.R. 1101, the so-called Small Business Health  Fairness Act of 2017.   This bill, first of all, from a procedural basis, did not allow even  a discussion of the amendments that my Democratic colleagues brought  forward to improve the bill. This rule has something called the  structured amendment process, which basically means that Democrats are  locked out from presenting our ideas for improving this bill. We are  not even allowed a 10-minute debate or a vote on any of the ideas that  many of my colleagues brought forward.   The gentlewoman from Oregon (Ms. Bonamici) proposed an amendment to  require the legislation only take effect if the Congressional Budget  Office determined premiums for older workers wouldn't increase. Sounds  like a reasonable idea to at least debate for an hour, 10 minutes. It  is important to do.   The gentlewoman from California (Mrs. Torres) offered an amendment  that would have required all association health plans to continue the  10 essential health benefits of the Patient Protection and Affordable  Care Act to obtain State certification--again, not even allowed to vote  on her amendment.   The gentleman from New York (Mr. Espaillat) offered an amendment to  allow States to continue regulating any association health plan,  including regulations related to benefits, consumer protections, and  rating restrictions--not allowed.   These amendments would have improved the underlying legislation. They  should have been allowed to proceed to the floor. Unfortunately, the  only amendment that made it in was from the Republican side of the  aisle, and all of the great ideas that Members on my side of the aisle  offered were prevented from being even allowed to be debated under this  restrictive rule.   I find it very troubling that my colleagues on the other side seem to  prefer a partisan vote to collaboration and to considering valuable  proposals that might help improve the quality of health care just  because they happen to come from Democrats.   But there is a bigger issue here. Of course, in addition to the  faulty process, the bill is simply a bad bill and does nothing to  address the problems with the repeal of the Affordable Care Act, which  is pending before this body.   One of the issues raised under this bill is it could lure away young  and healthy workers, creating a distortion in the market. The ACA  changed that practice by requiring health insurance sold through an  association to meet the same insurance standards of coverage sold to  the individual and small group market, preventing cherry-picking and  providing a basic level of protection for consumers. This bill would  roll back that progress, creating a separate set of rules for  association health plans, essentially exempting them from complying  with State regulations.   There is also little evidence that it has even been effective to  expand coverage. That is why many consumer and advocacy groups,  including, for instance, the National Association of Insurance  Commissioners, have come out opposed to this bill.   But even more disturbing is the fact that we are considering a bill  that even its proponents would agree does not in any way, shape, or  form replace the protections of the Affordable Care Act. This is a bill  that is narrow in scope. In fact, when we marked it up in our  committee, the Education and the Workforce Committee, that very same  day, the Energy and Commerce and Ways and Means Committees were marking  up a bill to create a brand-new entitlement program, remove health care  [[Page H2262]]  from 24 million Americans who have it today, and increase costs by 15  to 20 percent for those who are paying for their insurance today.   At that time, the Republican healthcare bill had only been public for  24 hours. When the committees marked it up, we didn't even know how  much the bill cost or how many people would lose coverage as a result.  That information only came later, after committee members voted to  amend or not amend the bill.   Frankly, it is unconscionable to deny people healthcare insurance. It  may be a life-or-death proposition, and we need to do a better job  understanding bills before we vote on them, which is one of the reasons  that we need to make sure we know the cost of this so-called manager's  amendment, these midnight changes to the repeal of the Affordable Care  Act.   What is interesting with this proposed American Health Care Act the  Republicans plan to bring to the floor, it was just reported--and I  will be submitting the article for the Record--that the Republican bill  actually results in more people being uninsured than if ObamaCare were  simply repealed outright.   So rather than repealing it outright, what Republicans are doing is  giving a tax break to billionaires, creating a brand-new entitlement  program, throwing 24 million people off the insurance rolls, and  increasing costs by 15 to 20 percent. It would actually throw less  people off insurance if they simply repealed ObamaCare.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record an article from The New York  Times.                  [From The New York Times, Mar. 21, 2017]                         The Upshot--Public Health    Fewer Americans Would Be Insured With G.O.P. Plan Than With Simple                                   Repeal                          (By Margot Sanger-Katz)         The Congressional Budget Office recently said that around       24 million fewer Americans would have health insurance in       2026 under the Republican repeal plan than if the current law       stayed in place.        That loss was bigger than most experts anticipated, and led       to a round of predictable laments from congressional       Democrats--and less predictable ones from Republican       senators, including Bill Cassidy of Louisiana and John Thune       of South Dakota, who told reporters that the bill needed to       be ``more helpful'' to low-income people who wanted       insurance.        But one piece of context has gone little noticed: The       Republican bill would actually result in more people being       uninsured than if Obamacare were simply repealed. Getting rid       of the major coverage provisions and regulations of Obamacare       would cost 23 million Americans their health insurance,       according to another recent C.B.O. report. In other words, 1       million more Americans would have health insurance with a       clean repeal than with the Republican replacement plan,       according to C.B.O. estimates.        The C.B.O. estimated what would happen after a simple       repeal when it considered a bill that Congress passed last       year. (President Obama later vetoed that bill.) The bill left       parts of Obamacare in place, so the 23 million estimate       didn't come with the kind of detailed analysis that       accompanied last week's score of the American Health Care       Act. But the similarity of the two estimates highlights some       of the difficulties of the current proposal, both for       Democrats, who are strongly criticizing potential coverage       losses, and for the repeal-or-die crowd, who hate the       structure of this new bill.        ``It's reaffirmed how exceedingly complicated and       convoluted the approach the House leadership took,'' said Dan       Holler, the vice president for communications and government       relations at Heritage Action, an advocacy group firmly in the       repeal-or-die camp.        Late Monday, House leadership revealed a set of amendments       to the bill, which will be considered when the bill comes up       for a vote. But, if they are adopted, the changes are       unlikely to have major effects on overall coverage numbers.       If anything, the changes might lead to a larger increase in       the number of Americans without health insurance.        The people who would end up without health insurance are       slightly different in the two cases. The current bill would       cause more people to lose employer insurance, while a       straight repeal bill would most likely cause more people who       buy their own coverage to become uninsured. A simple repeal       would be worse for Americans with pre-existing conditions,       but the current bill would be worse for older Americans who       are relatively healthy. Both approaches would lead to major       reductions in the number of Americans covered by Medicaid.        The bill that Congress passed in 2016 is the third       scenario. It would have kept Obamacare's major insurance       regulations on the books, including its rule that health       insurers need to sell insurance at the same price to healthy       and sick customers of the same age. It would have removed       funding for the expansion of Medicaid, dropped subsidies to       help people buy health coverage, and eliminated the       individual and employer mandates in the law.        The results of those changes would be drastic: In a decade,       32 million more people would be without health insurance,       according to the estimates. The C.B.O. essentially said it       was a policy combination that would break the insurance       market, resulting in substantially more people losing       coverage than gained it under Obamacare.        The kind of full repeal that some Republicans are calling       for would, of course, be hard to pass. Even if every member       of their caucus supported the approach, most experts believe       that repealing Obamacare's major insurance provisions would       require a type of legislation that would be vulnerable to a       Senate filibuster, and would thus require at least eight       Democratic votes.        All three approaches would result in meaningful reductions       in the number of Americans with health coverage. But, in the       end, it appears that the long-term effects of the current       Republican plan don't look that different from full repeal.     Mr. Speaker, Margo Sanger-Katz said, in part: ``But one  piece of context has gone little noticed: The Republican bill would  actually result in more people being uninsured than if ObamaCare were  simply repealed. Getting rid of the major coverage provisions and  regulations of ObamaCare would cost 23 million Americans their health  insurance. . . . In other words, 1 million more Americans would have  health insurance with a clean repeal than with the Republican  replacement plan, according to CBO estimates.''   So it is just unclear what the Republicans are trying to do here. If  the goal was to come up with something worse than repealing the  Affordable Care Act, they certainly reached that goal: less people will  have coverage, more tax breaks for billionaires, higher rate increases  for most Americans. On every account, it actually underperforms a  cleaner repeal.   What Democrats wanted to do is improve the Affordable Care Act. And I  want to be clear, none of us have ever argued the Affordable Care Act  is perfect. I pushed for fixes. So many of my Democratic and Republican  colleagues have pushed for fixes to strengthen the law, like repealing  the medical device tax, which adds cost to health care, and altering  the Cadillac tax on insurance premiums.   In the Education and the Workforce Committee, I actually offered  three amendments to show some of the ideas that I and some of my  colleagues had to improve the Affordable Care Act. They offered an  amendment to establish a public option in the exchange, to provide a  baseline of competition in every ZIP Code in this country--defeated on  a partisan vote. I should add that my proposal for a public option--and  I am a cosponsor of the bill to do the same--would actually reduce the  budget deficit by over $50 billion.   I also offered an amendment for pricing transparency to help make the  market in health care work. One of the major market fallacies in health  care is a Byzantine pricing structure where, frequently, different  entities and people are paying different amounts for the same thing. If  we had simple pricing transparency and quality transparency, we would  go a long way towards making markets work in health care--defeated on a  party vote.   Finally, I offered an amendment that would have allowed reimportation  of prescription drugs. When you have a situation where--we have a  popular example of this in the EpiPen, costing Americans who need  access to the EpiPen over $400, and yet in neighboring countries-- Canada, Australia--EpiPens cost $40 or $50, one-tenth as much.   It is not unique to the EpiPen. By no means is that an exception to  the rule. In fact, it is the rule. By allowing reimportation of  prescription drugs, a proposal that was backed in the Senate in a  bipartisan way by many of my Democratic and Republican colleagues as a  budget amendment, we could actually reduce costs in health care, making  the goal of expanding coverage even easier with those reduced costs.   You know, when I think about health care, I think it is important to  think about who in our districts and States it most affects. I think of  Pat Hayward, a constituent in my district who lives in Loveland.   Pat has so many family members who would be directly impacted by the  repeal of the ACA. For instance, her husband has melanoma and over the  years has needed several procedures to remove cancerous cells from his  skin.  [[Page H2263]]  Had those procedures not been done in a timely and efficient manner, it  could cause major complications, including premature death for Pat's  husband.   Prior to the Affordable Care Act, when they tried to change insurance  carriers, her husband was told that any coverage would exclude coverage  of cancers, the very type of coverage he needed, because it was a  preexisting condition. They literally would have had to choose between  bankruptcy or being forced out of their home and into destitution or  not getting the lifesaving melanoma treatments that he needed.   But it is not just Pat's husband who has benefited and perhaps is  alive and thriving today because of the protections of the Affordable  Care Act. Pat's eldest son took advantage of a provision that allowed  him to stay on his parents' plan until he got a job with health  insurance at age 25.   Their younger son has struggled with anxiety and panic attacks, but  thanks to comprehensive mental health treatment and the protections of  the mental health parity that are in the Affordable Care Act--and being  rolled back under the American Health Care Act, the Republican bill to  replace it--their son is now back in college and thriving.   Pat, herself, expressed gratitude. The Affordable Care Act covers  wellness visits and tests like mammograms, which can detect problems  early, reduce costs, and save lives.   I share this story--and Pat wanted me to share her story--because  families like the Haywards are like families in every State, in every  county, in every ZIP Code in the country. American families have faced  their share of medical challenges, as have mine, and I am sure that  yours has as well, Mr. Speaker. Medical challenges crop up  unexpectedly. They don't have any bias toward a political party. They  affect Democrats and Republicans and Independents and Greens and  apathetic voters and diligent participants in our civic system. They  make no distinction.   But the Affordable Care Act is there to make it easier for families  across our country to stay healthy, to get better, to save their lives  so that kids can grow up with their parents healthy, kids can grow up  and be able to go to school and get good jobs.   And like so many of my constituents, Pat told me she would rather see  the current system improved than thrown out entirely, and I agree. That  is why I offered the pricing transparency amendment, the public option  amendment, and the reimportation of prescription drug amendment; and  there are dozens of other ideas to improve the Affordable Care Act from  my side of the aisle. I offered amendments in committee that would have  codified these provisions into law.   I plan to continue to fight to improve access and lower healthcare  costs, but dismantling the Affordable Care Act is simply  counterproductive towards that end.    The Republican proposal to create a brand-new entitlement program  would cause 24 million Americans to lose their insurance--over 1  million more than repealing the Affordable Care Act. For those who are  lucky enough to still have their insurance, it would increase rates by  15 to 20 percent.   It would also, for reasons unknown, have an enormous tax cut for  billionaires and millionaires. We know Republicans want to do that, but  they should do that through a tax bill, not through something that is  supposed to be a healthcare bill--enormous tax cuts. We are not even  talking the wealthiest 1 percent. Most of those tax cuts go to the  wealthiest one-tenth of 1 percent of Americans. That certainly doesn't  help reduce the cost of health care.   Again, this bill can be debated, and, frankly, many of us feel it  presents a problem in the risk pools that remove consumer protections.  There is a solvency issue around some of these groups. There is a  legitimate debate to be had, but we certainly haven't heard anybody  present that somehow this bill is any kind of answer to making health  care more affordable or expanding coverage.   What we have before us over the next couple of days is a bill that  not only is the answer, but is a bill that creates an even bigger  problem. The Republican healthcare bill would dig us in a deeper hole  with regard to health care, leaving more Americans without coverage,  creating a costly, brand-new entitlement program, and raising rates for  those Americans who are lucky enough to still have their insurance  after the Republicans remove it from tens of millions of people.   If that bill is the answer, what is the question?   Is the question, Mr. Speaker: How do we make health care cost more  for American families?   Is the question, Mr. Speaker: How do we have less people covered and  throw 20 million people off of health care insurance?   Is the question, Mr. Speaker: How do we make sure that, rather than  work hard and try to get a raise or work two jobs, Americans are forced  to quit their jobs and be lazy and not work just so that they can have  Medicaid eligibility, which is what the brand-new Republican  entitlement program would do?   Or, is the answer to move forward in a bipartisan way to improve the  Affordable Care Act, a discussion that so many of us are excited to  have.   I was disappointed that my three amendments were shut out in partisan  votes in committee, and I am hopeful that by resetting this process, we  can work together to reduce costs and expand coverage. Defeating the  rule today will be the first step towards accomplishing that.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, first of all, amendments that were brought forward by  Ms. Bonamici, germane. Republicans shut it down, didn't allow a debate.   Amendment brought forward by Norma Torres for this very bill,  germane--not allowed to be debated for not even 10 minutes, not 5  minutes, not even 1 minute. Mrs. Torres wasn't even allowed to offer  her amendment under this rule that only allowed Republican amendments.   Finally, Mr. Espaillat's amendment to this bill, yes, germane. He  was, nevertheless, shut out in a party-line vote by the Rules Committee  and not allowed to present his amendment before the floor that would  simply allow States to continue protecting the benefits and consumer  protections and rating restrictions in associated health plans, very  simply.   Mr. Speaker, we are here considering the rule for H.R. 1101 and we  still don't have a cost estimate from our nonpartisan experts at CBO.  We certainly believe this legislation will increase premiums for the  middle class and seniors, but we don't have any idea how much so. It is  becoming a pattern, Mr. Speaker.    Two weeks ago, the Republican majority pushed ahead with their  healthcare repeal bill without a cost estimate. A week later, it turned  out it will cost 24 million Americans their insurance and 15 to 20  percent increases for those who would still have it.   Late last night, there was a backroom, secretive manager's amendment  that was proposed which we don't know the cost of or how it would  affect coverage, and it is irresponsible for the Republicans to move  forward without knowing the effect of the bill as amended.   If we defeat the previous question, I will offer an amendment to the  rule that would require a CBO cost estimate that analyzes the impact of  any legislation amending or repealing the Affordable Care Act, as well  as the impact of any manager's amendment to that legislation, to be  made publicly available before the bill may be considered on the House  floor.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately  prior to the vote on the previous question.   The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Mooney of West Virginia). Is there  objection to the request of the gentleman from Colorado?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished  gentlewoman from California (Ms. Lee) to discuss our proposal to make  sure we actually know the cost of what is before this body.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, first of all, over 150 amendments by Democrats were  rejected to this healthcare bill before us today, contrary to the  process of 8 years ago when over 120 Republican amendments were not  only made in order, but were actually incorporated into the healthcare  bill despite the fact that, for final passage, not a single Republican  voted for it.    So when we talk about the record and the precedent, there couldn't  more of a night-and-day difference between what is occurring today  where Democrats are locked out and the effort 8 years ago where  Republican ideas were welcomed in the process.   I also want to ask my colleague from Alabama--I was hoping that he  would yield me the time to do so, and I will have to yield him time for  an answer--he mentioned that this manager's amendment has already been  posted and we will have 3 days to look at it. I just want to get his  assurance that the version that we saw posted is the actual version  that will be brought to the Rules Committee and presented on the floor  and there will be no further changes to the manager's amendment, if the  gentleman can assure me of that.    I yield to the gentleman from Alabama.    Reclaiming my time, Mr. Speaker, I also would like to ask  if we are going to have a score from the Congressional Budget Office  prior to the House having to vote on that manager's amendment?   I yield, for an answer, to the gentleman from Alabama.    Mr. Speaker, reclaiming my time, again, that simply  confirms what our previous question would simply require, that before  the bill is voted on we will simply know how much it costs and who it  impacts. What could be more important than finding that out.   I think it is important to note that Democrats have been shut out of  the process, at the committee level, in the amendments I offered. Even  the germane amendments of this particular bill before us today,  Democrats were locked out.   Rather than allow Members of both parties to participate in reducing  the costs of health care and increasing coverage, Republicans have come  up with a bill that actually increases costs and decreases coverage.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, the statistics we are talking about, the fact that it  will cost Americans 15 to 20 percent more to get health care, the fact  that it will cost 24 million Americans their insurance, these are not  statistics that are made up by some group that wants to oppose the  Republican effort. They are facts that are arrived upon by the  Congressional Budget Office, the head of which was appointed by a  Republican. They do diligent work to determine how much bills cost and  what their effect is.   Now, of course, you know, those are best estimates. Maybe, instead of  24 million people who will lose coverage under the Republican  healthcare bill, maybe it will be 25 million, maybe it will be 23  million. There is always a little bit of variation on what those  predictions are.   But whether it is 23 million or 25.6 million, the fact that  Americans--millions, tens of millions of Americans--will lose coverage  under this Republican bill should be a flashing warning sign that it is  time to slow down and work in a collaborative manner to improve the  Affordable Care Act, rather than create a brand new entitlement program  that throws 24 million people off the insurance rolls, and increases  the cost for those who remain by 15 to 20 percent.   This bill immediately before us is a diversion from the real story in  health care. In my home State alone, 600,000 Coloradans would likely  lose coverage if the American Health Care Act is rammed through  Congress, as my Republican colleagues intend to do.   The American Health Care Act would roll back important protections  and coverage gains. It would create a brand new entitlement program,  while delivering record tax breaks for billionaires in New York and  California.   It is clear that this bill threatens the health and welfare of  hundreds of thousands of families in Colorado alone, tens of millions  across the country. It is time that we get this process right and slow  down, rather than cramming a midnight bill through the House of  Representatives that we don't even know the cost of, before we are  voting on it.   This is simple, Mr. Speaker. Democrats are excited to roll up our  sleeves and work together to create a plan that will reduce healthcare  costs. If you don't like the amendment I offered for allowing  reimportation of prescription drugs, let's talk about other options.   What about Medicare negotiating prescription drug rates? What about  removing tax deductibility for the advertisements for pharmaceutical  companies?   What about expediting approval process at the FDA, which President  Trump himself mentioned in this very Chamber as a proposal that can  reduce the cost of approving drugs from the $1.2 billion it costs  today, which is passed along to consumers, to a much lower cost,  thereby passing the savings along to consumers.  [[Page H2266]]    There are plenty of good ideas the Democrats and Republicans can work  together on. None of them are this bill before us today. None of them  are in the repeal of the Affordable Care Act. So let's just stop this  ridiculous partisan process.   I don't want 24 million Americans to be victims of partisanship in  Washington. I don't want other Americans who pay for their healthcare  insurance to be victims of partisanship in Washington.   I want to make sure that people in my district who are working hard  and only able to afford coverage under the Affordable Care Act because  of the healthcare subsidies are not forced into medical bankruptcy and  to give up their jobs and rely on Medicaid because of Republican  efforts to ram through this brand new entitlement program.   Let's get this right. There is plenty of opportunity to work together  to reduce costs and expand coverage. The American Health Care Act does  the exact opposite. It increases costs and reduces coverage.   And instead of these incremental bills, like this so-called Small  Business Health Fairness Act, which actually winds up removing  protections and pushing more costs onto working families and seniors,  we should improve upon and fix the Affordable Care Act that we put in  place 7 years ago. We should support innovation to produce healthier  outcomes, to reduce costs, and, yes, to expand coverage across our  country.   We have a unique opportunity in this Congress to put partisanship  behind us, to work together to make affordable health care a reality  for every American family. Because you know what? When you have a  preexisting condition, like I talked about Pat's husband in my district  who suffers from melanoma, it doesn't matter whether he is a Republican  or a Democrat or Independent or whether he is not even registered at  all.   What matters is that he is a father to two children, a husband to his  wife, and he wants the ability to work with dignity, support himself,  and have medical insurance to receive his lifesaving monthly injections  that allow him to maintain his quality of life and continue to work and  pay taxes and support his kids and family. That is what healthcare  coverage is all about.   So let's stop this silly partisanship. This Republican American  Health Care Act actually kicks more people off of the healthcare rolls  than simply repealing ObamaCare. By creating this brand new entitlement  program, they are actually costing an additional 1 millions Americans  their healthcare insurance.   But the answer is not to cost 23 million people their healthcare  insurance. It is not to take it away from 24 million people. You know  what the answer is, Mr. Speaker, is to provide a way that more people  can work hard and pay into the system, and that we decrease the number  of Americans who lack access to healthcare insurance which, in turn,  reduces the costs for the rest of us because of the cost shifting that  occurs within health care.    Mr. Speaker, I know so many of my friends on the Republican and  Democratic side of the aisle, dedicated public servants with thoughtful  ideas that they have based on their life experiences, that they want to  present before this body to reduce the cost of health care. Let's let  them do it. Let's have an open process.   So, 150 amendments from Democrats were shot down in committees, not  even allowed to be debated, not even allowed to be included in this  healthcare bill. Three of mine were shot down. In this very rule today,  amendments by Mr. Espaillat and Ms. Bonamici were not even allowed to  be debated.   The American people want health care to be affordable, and they want  Republicans and Democrats to work together to accomplish that end.   Let's vote ``no'' on this rule. Let's reset the process. Let's fix  health care. Let's expand coverage. Let's reduce costs. I look forward  to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to accomplish  those important goals that my constituents have sent me here to work  on.   I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the previous question so we  can know the cost of any manager's amendment before we vote on it; to  vote ``no'' on the rule, and to vote ``no'' on the underlying bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further  proceedings on this question will be postponed.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.
