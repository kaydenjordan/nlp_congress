Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  insert extraneous material on H.R. 5363, the Fostering Undergraduate  Talent by Unlocking Resources for Education, or FUTURE Act.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to support H.R. 5363, the Fostering Undergraduate  Talent by Unlocking Resources for Education, or the FUTURE Act. We can  also simply call it FUTURE Act 2.0.   Mr. Speaker, 3 months ago, on September 17, the House of  Representatives unanimously passed the first version of the FUTURE Act,  H.R. 2486, which would have reauthorized title III, part F of the  Higher Education Act for the next 2 years. We acted on that day because  this important program, which prepares the 8 million students at our  Nation's minority-serving institutions for careers in STEM, expired on  September 30.   Unfortunately, inaction on the part of the Senate left us in a  situation where colleges and universities have already had to begin  laying off staff, and smaller schools have planned to cut back  programmatic offerings to stay afloat.   Fortunately, Congress has shown that we can actually come together  and work in a bipartisan, bicameral fashion to make the lives of our  citizens better. The agreement reached in H.R. 5363 will not only  reauthorize 255 million in mandatory funding for historically Black  colleges and universities and all MSIs for 2 years, it will reauthorize  this funding permanently.   A permanent reauthorization means that for the rest of time, long  after we are all gone, Mr. Speaker, diverse college students can count  on a robust investment from their Federal Government. And it was all  done because we, as Members, were able to put aside partisanship, come  together for the common cause of ensuring a bright and prosperous  future for millions of low-income, first-generation college students of  color.   Mr. Speaker, the FUTURE Act 2.0 is, once again, responsible  legislation that is completely paid for. There are a number of people  to thank for getting this bill to the floor today, but I want to  particularly recognize the leadership of Chairman Neal of the Committee  on Ways and Means and Representative DelBene for her partnership.  Because of these collaborative efforts, the House today can once again  address the number one priority of our minority-serving institutions,  which educate nearly 30 percent of all undergraduate students in  America.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from the American  Council on Education and 42 other national organizations in support of  the FUTURE Act's passage today by the House.                                   American Council on Education,                                  Washington, DC, December 10, 2019.      Representative Nancy Pelosi,      Speaker, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Representative Kevin McCarthy,      Minority Leader, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Pelosi and Minority Leader McCarthy: On behalf       of the organizations listed below, we write to express our       strong support for H.R. 5363, the FUTURE Act. This       legislation is fully offset and offers practical solutions to       critical issues facing students and institutions. H.R. 5363       has strong bipartisan support, which is reflected in the fact       that previous iterations of this bill passed the House under       suspension in September, and an amended version passed the       Senate under unanimous consent last week.        This legislation addresses several important issues. First,       it would restore, and make permanent, critical mandatory       funding for Historically Black Colleges and Universities,       Hispanic-Serving Institutions, Tribal Colleges and       Universities and other Minority-Serving Institutions that had       expired at the end of September, allowing those institutions       to strengthen STEM education programs and build institutional       capacity to better serve students. It is vital that this       funding be restored immediately as campuses are already       making decisions regarding staffing, facilities and       programming, which are directly influenced by the       availability of this support.        Beyond the benefits to historically under-resourced       institutions, the FUTURE Act would make significant       improvements to the federal student aid system, by       simplifying and streamlining the processes for applying for       student aid and repaying student loans. This will       dramatically simplify the Free Application for Federal       Student Aid (FAFSA) and make it far easier for low- and       middle-income families to apply for and receive federal       student aid. In addition, the changes proposed in the       legislation will also make the process of paying for college       significantly easier for students and their families. This       bill would also strengthen the accuracy and effectiveness of       the administration of these programs.  [[Page H9964]]         Finally, the bill includes additional funding for the       Federal Pell Grant program, which is the cornerstone of       federal student aid. These grants enable millions of low-      income students to access and afford college, and we       appreciate the inclusion of additional support for this       valuable program.        For all of these reasons, we urge you, and the Members you       represent, to support this legislation when it comes to the       floor for a vote today. We appreciate your attention to this       important legislation and look forward to working with you to       ensure passage into law of the FUTURE Act.            Sincerely,                                                      Ted Mitchell,                                                         President.

Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Washington (Ms. DelBene).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Washington (Ms. DelBene).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his comments, and I  will add my testimony to that, a 40-year college professor at Bennett  College in Greensboro, North Carolina, an HBCU, a fine HBCU, a women's  college; and having done my studies at North Carolina A&T State  University twice--my bachelor's and master's there--and knowing that  North Carolina has more HBCUs than any other State, we are proud of  that.   Having said that, Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman  from Oregon (Ms. Bonamici), who is also a member of the Education and  Labor Committee and chair of the Subcommittee on Civil Rights and Human  Services.    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time remains on either  side.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. Scott), the capable chair of the Committee on Education  and Labor.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his kind remarks,  and it is a real pleasure serving with him and working with him on this  particular issue.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Doggett).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas  (Mr. Castro).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from South Dakota (Mr. Johnson)  for all of his work and his support. Let me again thank all of my  colleagues who have helped to bring us to the precipice of solidifying  a robust Federal investment into HBCUs and MSIs for all time. I thank  Chairman Neal and Representative DelBene, as well as Chairman  Bobby  Scott for his leadership every step of the way in this effort. I thank  the chair of the Congressional Black Caucus, Congresswoman Karen Bass,  and the chairs of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus and the  Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus, Congressman Joaquin Castro  and Congresswoman Judy Chu. I thank the leadership of the House for  making HBCUs and MSIs and the students they serve a priority for this  body.   It is telling how important this issue is for the fate of our Nation  that we are considering this measure in the midst of all that Congress  has to do before the end of the year.   To the advocates, the United Negro College Fund, the Thurgood  Marshall College Fund, and NAFEO, whose members have sent over 65,000  letters and made calls to Members of Congress, I hope we can let them  know that while they have worked hard, their hard work has paid off.   Mr. Speaker, 8 million students from across America are counting on  us today. They are counting on Congress to keep its promise.   In 2008, when mandatory funding language was first authorized in  title III, this body approved the measure by a vote of 354-to-58.  Congress in 2008 understood the importance of our HBCUs and MSIs and  the educational opportunities that they specifically tailor to students  who have traditionally been denied access to adequately funded schools  throughout their lives. Congress understood how the program was needed  to help these institutions fulfill their mission to assist students in  meeting their goals. That fact remains true now more than ever.   Let's have a strong vote to pass FUTURE Act 2.0 out of this House  today. Bring it to the Senate and send it to the President's desk so  that our HBCUs and MSIs and their students can finally have certainty  from their government and know that when Congress makes a promise to  provide for their future, we mean what we say.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the legislation, and I  yield back the balance of my time.
