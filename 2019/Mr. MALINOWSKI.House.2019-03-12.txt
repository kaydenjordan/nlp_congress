 Madam Speaker, today, I rise to tell the story of  three very special young men from my district.   Edward Roman and his twin brother, Edwin, were diagnosed with a heart  condition that has put them through multiple surgeries. Both worked at  the Village Trattoria restaurant in Summit, New Jersey, where they met  Quinn Butler, a senior at Summit High.   When Quinn learned of what they were going through, he set up a  GoFundMe site that raised $119,000 in 2 weeks.   It is a story of good people coming together to say they will not let  a neighbor down, but it is also a story of how our healthcare system  lets us all down.   A community should not have to raise $100,000 to keep someone from  going into debt due to a medical condition. Two young men worried about  staying alive should not have to worry about negotiating with hospitals  and insurance companies to stay solvent.   Every American deserves the security of knowing that affordable  healthcare is a right that will follow us wherever we go, wherever we  live and work, whatever misfortune may befall us.   Madam Speaker, our friends and neighbors will always do what they  can. Now it is up to the Congress to do what we must.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from New York  (Mr. Engel), chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, and I thank  my friends on the other side for leading on this important resolution.   When Boris Nemtsov was gunned down 4 years ago on a bridge just a few  hundred feet from the Kremlin, we saw once again what a dangerous place  Putin's Russia is for anybody with the courage to speak truth to power.   We saw again that while Russia has fierce and formidable security  agencies that will track down anyone who dares criticize the Kremlin  anywhere in the world, when one of those critics is killed, somehow  they can never find the killer.   We know that whoever gave the order to kill Boris Nemtsov, one man,  Vladimir Putin, is responsible for building a state where those who  champion freedom are always punished and those who kill them never are.   This resolution says that we will always remember Boris Nemtsov and  the truth about what happened to him and who is responsible.   It urges the Russian Government to hold accountable the authors of  the crime and says that, until that happens, we will sanction them  under the Magnitsky Act.   It singles out Ramzan Kadyrov, the brutal ruler of Chechnya, and  urges the administration to ensure that he can no longer do business  anywhere outside Russia.   By passing this resolution, we will make clear that you can kill a  man but not the ideas that he fought for; that a good person who lived  and died for a good cause will be honored for all time, while the  people who killed him will go down in history, if they are remembered  at all, as utterly worthless.   And we will be saying something else very important: that the United  States is not in conflict with Russia or with the Russian people. On  the contrary, we are in solidarity with the vast majority of Russians,  who, like Boris Nemtsov, want a country that is free of corruption, a  country where nobody is above the law.   Our argument is only with the leaders who deny them that, but those  leaders won't be around forever. Boris Nemtsov's legacy will outlast  them, and so will our desire to partner with the Russia that shares his  values and vision.
