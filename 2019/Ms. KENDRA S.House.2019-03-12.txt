 HORN of Oklahoma. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor  the Girl Scouts of the United States as it celebrates its 107th  birthday today.   On this day in 1912, Juliette Gordon Low founded this organization  for, in her words, the girls of Savannah and of all America and of the  world.   As you might be able to tell from the pictures next to me, Girl  Scouts holds a very special place in my life.   Girl Scouts prepares girls to empower themselves, promotes  compassion, courage, confidence, character, leadership,  entrepreneurship, and active citizenship.   You see, my life has been shaped, as have many other girls and women  throughout this country, in large part by the lessons I learned through  scouting. From my great-grandmother, to my grandmother, to my mother,  to myself, Girl Scouts and the values that they taught me and the  strengths that Girl Scouts helped me to achieve have helped carry me  through life.   For more than a century, the Girl Scouts have taught girls to be go- getters, innovators, risk-takers, and leaders.   Today, with a record number of women serving in the U.S. Congress,  there are also a record number of Girl Scouts. Fifty-eight percent of  the women in the U.S. House of Representatives are Girl Scouts and 73  percent of female U.S. Senators are Girl Scouts.   Though there are hundreds of Girl Scout alums in both houses of  Congress, there are three of us who earned scouting's highest honor:  myself, Congresswoman Lauren Underwood, and Senator Tammy Duckworth.   This award, the Gold Award, is given to high schoolers after they  identify an issue in their community, investigate it, build a team,  build a plan, and implement it. These 1- to 2-year take-action projects  must have sustainable impacts on the community. They can be petitions  to add playgrounds to local parks, recycling campaigns, building  emergency kits, and on and on and on, but the one thing they have in  common is a sustainability requirement. They simply can't be a one  shot. They must create lasting change.   Girl Scouts teaches its members to look for the root cause of a  problem, not simply the symptoms.   The Gold Award is the highest achievement in all of Girl Scouts.    Congress isn't the only place as well that Girl Scouts have gone into  public  [[Page H2652]]  service. Three Secretaries of State, Condoleezza Rice, Madeleine  Albright, and Hillary Clinton, were all Girl Scouts, and virtually  every single female astronaut has also been a Girl Scout.   Today, more than 50 million women alive have participated in Girl  Scouts growing up. I am proud to say that for the Girl Scouts of  western Oklahoma, there are today 14,000 girls who are members.  Worldwide, Girl Scouts has 2.6 million current girl and adult members.   Although Girl Scouts is perhaps best known for the entrepreneurial  skills it introduces through the cookie program, it does so much more  to develop leadership skills in girls. It teaches them how to advocate  for themselves, for others, and it gives them a voice beginning at a  very young age.   Programs introduce girls to science, technology, engineering, art,  and mathematics, or STEAM, often paths where girls might not otherwise  be encouraged or supported to go on their own. Those STEAM programs  introduce girls to these important areas and help them to move through  challenges.   Girl Scouts can also learn about the outdoors through going on long  treks, camping, kayaking, mountain biking, and countless other  activities, all while learning how to minimize their impact on the  environment.   Bottom line, Girl Scouts teaches girls the skills they need and they  might not get elsewhere about healthy relationships, soft skills,  financial literacy, nutrition and health.   All of these journeys are designed by girls and for girls, following  evidence-based approaches that ensure they fit girls and foster their  growth.   I am honored today to rise to celebrate the Girl Scouts on their  107th anniversary as a fourth generation Girl Scout and Gold Award  recipient.                            ____________________
