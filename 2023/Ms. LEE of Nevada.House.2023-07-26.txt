 Mr. Speaker, during rollcall No. 367 on H. Res.  614, my vote was not successfully registered. Had my vote been  registered, it would have been a ``nay.''    Mr. Chairman, I rise today as a Representative  from southern Nevada, where we have Creech Air Force Base, Nellis Air  Force Base, and hundreds of thousands of veterans that call southern  Nevada home. As their Representative, I have extreme disappointment  with this bill that we have before us, the MILCON-VA bill.                                time  1445    As a member of the Subcommittee on Military Construction, Veterans  Affairs, and Related Agencies, I take great pride in our work. This  traditionally has been bipartisan and laser-focused on the needs of our  veterans, of our servicemembers, and their families, and on the  military's construction requirements to meet global security challenges  facing our Nation, not just today, but in the future.   Unfortunately, this bill is not a reflection of that MILCON-VA  tradition of putting politics aside and putting our military, our  servicemembers, our veterans, and our Nation first. Instead, this bill  sacrifices our promises to veterans, our military readiness, and our  national security, honestly, in favor of meeting the demands of a few  extremist Republican politicians.   Instead of ensuring our Nation provides for Americans who have  sacrificed to keep our Nation safe, this bill focuses on picking  culture war fights, banning the VA from flying certain flags or banning  them from taking steps to advance equal opportunity and health access  for every veteran.   Instead of focusing on preparing our military to protect U.S.  interests, the bill would prevent the VA from providing lifesaving  reproductive healthcare to female veterans.   As my colleague just said, the mission of the VA should be respectful  to our veterans. I say to every woman veteran who has put her life on  the line for our freedom that we should show them the respect that they  can make their own choice and be free to make their own choice for  their own healthcare.   I want to be clear, as a woman who has undergone a D&C, that abortion  care is healthcare. I will say that again. Abortion care is healthcare.  Women who have put their lives on the line for our country, for our  freedom, should have the ability to make that choice.   The policies that extremist politicians, in addition to that, have  tacked on to this bill prevents the VA from providing that type of  care, even in the case when a pregnancy is the result of rape, incest,  or the life of the mother is at risk.    Policies that extremist politicians have tacked on  to this bill are offensive to men and women who serve our country,  including my constituents at Creech and Nellis Air Force bases.   I am especially alarmed at the $1.5 billion in proposed cuts to  military construction. I am supportive of being thoughtful and  responsible with our Federal spending, but at a time when our Nation  faces mounting security challenges across this globe, I cannot  understand how we can stand here today and cut nearly 10 percent of  funding that would ensure that our military bases are fully equipped to  handle global threats.   This bill would increase the backlog of projects at bases likes  Nellis and Creech, where I have heard directly from my airmen and  airwomen working out of temporary, cramped, and outdated, unsafe  facilities; and this, at a time when our military is already struggling  with recruitment and retention.   Full military construction funding is key to enable that our  servicemembers meet National Defense Strategy demands, so we must  invest fully in critical facilities, like Nellis' communication support  center and the Weapons School Campus.   We also need to support the mission-critical Reconnaissance  Operations Training Facility and to repair the base's taxiway at  Creech.   We call on our men and women in our military to make our Nation and  keep our Nation safe, but this bill does not meet the demands of our  servicemembers and, instead, abandons men and women who we should be  supporting most in southern Nevada and beyond.   I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' and, instead, please let's get  back to working together to get servicemembers and our veterans the  resources that they need, that they have earned, and give them the  respect and the freedom that they have fought for.
