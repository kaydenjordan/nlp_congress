 Mr. President, if the Senator will yield for 1  minute, I would like to make a unanimous consent request that at the  conclusion of Senator Portman's remarks, I be recognized, and that at  the conclusion of my remarks, Senator Smith be recognized.    Thank you. Thank you, Senator Portman.  [[Page S6126]]                                ____________________     Mr. President, I am delighted to be joined today by  my colleague Senator Tina Smith of Minnesota. Both my home State of  Rhode  [[Page S6128]]  Island and her State of Minnesota are heavily involved in the booming  renewable energy sector.   President Trump has called climate change a hoax, but no matter how  much his administration may try to prop up the old, dirty, dangerous,  polluting fossil fuel industry, there is no denying the clean energy  revolution.   The rapid growth of renewables has been underway for decades, but it  has really accelerated in the last several years. It took global wind  and solar developers 40 years to install the first 1 trillion watts of  power generation. A recent estimate from Bloomberg found that the next  trillion will be installed within 5 years. That is 40 years for the  first trillion and 5 years for the second. Part of the reason is that  lower costs of renewables mean that building out the second trillion  will cost half as much as the first trillion.   This chart shows the year-to-year costs of generating energy from  wind, from Lazard. Since 2009, the costs for onshore wind have dropped  by two-thirds. Onshore wind costs are down two-thirds in basically a  decade.   Here is the same chart for solar power. Utility-scale solar costs  have dropped 86 percent over the same time period. ``In some  scenarios,'' writes Lazard, ``the full lifecycle costs of building and  operating renewables-based projects have dropped below the operating  costs alone of conventional generation technologies such as coal or  nuclear.''   When you look at the drop in solar costs compared to other resources,  you see how dramatic the change has been. This graphic is from the  World Economic Forum.   The renewable industry in America has grown to 3.3 million jobs--more  than all fossil fuel jobs combined. AT&T has been a leader in this,  adopting the World Wildlife Fund's Corporate Renewable Energy Buyers'  Principles and signing up under that for 220 megawatts from an Oklahoma  wind farm and 300 megawatts from a Texas wind farm, one of the largest  corporate renewable purchases in history. So, congratulations, Texas  and Oklahoma, for the new home State renewable energy jobs, and AT&T,  for your leadership.   In Rhode Island, the Governor's 2018 Rhode Island Clean Energy  Industry Report has shown that clean energy jobs have risen by 2  percent since 2014, bringing over 6,600 new clean energy jobs and  bringing us to nearly 16,000 Rhode Islanders working in clean energy,  and it is projected to continue to grow. We lead also on energy  efficiency, ranking third on the American Council for an Energy- Efficient Economy's 2017 scorecard.   In Senator Smith's State of Minnesota, the public utilities  commission has required since 1993 that there be a social cost of  carbon standard for new infrastructure at $43 per ton of carbon  emitted. Minnesota leads in being a State whose public utility  commission is factoring the cost of carbon into its decision making  rather than making the general public pay for what the carbon-producing  utilities should be paying for.   Other States are powering forward. I saw Mr. Bennet on the floor. His  State of Colorado Public Utilities Commission just unanimously approved  an Xcel Energy program to build out a cleaner energy mix and retire  older fossil fuel units. Specifically, they are going to retire 660  megawatts of operating coal, close it down, and replace it with $2.5  billion in new renewables and battery storage. The initial request for  bids brought in a flood of new renewable energy proposals below the  cost of existing coal and natural gas facilities.   Now, here, because of the politics, political funding, Citizens  United, and all the trash that is unleashed in our politics, there is a  sharp political divide on climate change and renewable energy brought  to you by our fossil fuel friends. But out in the real world, some of  the most Republican States are actually at the forefront. The  Department of Energy last week released a report showing that Texas is  leading the Nation in generation, with over 22 gigawatts of wind  capacity. Right behind them are Oklahoma and Kansas, with more than 5  gigawatts of installed wind capacity. Just over 6 percent of the  nation's electricity in 2017 was wind nationally, but if you go to  Iowa, Kansas, Oklahoma, and South Dakota, they all have more than 30  percent of their power coming from clean wind power.   Oklahoma is at 32 percent. Kansas is at 36 percent. Iowa is at 37  percent. South Dakota is at 30 percent, and North Dakota is at 27  percent.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have the Department of  Energy reports printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                 Texas, Oklahoma, and Iowa Lead the Nation         Washington, DC--Today, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE)       released three wind energy market reports demonstrating that       as wind installations continue across the country and       offshore wind projects move beyond the planning process,       technology costs and wind energy prices continue to fall. The       reports cover three market sectors: land-based utility scale,       distributed, and offshore wind.        Highlights from this past year include larger, more       powerful wind turbines and lower technology costs and wind       power prices for on land and offshore applications, as well       as U.S. distributed wind capacity crossing the 1 gigawatt       (GW) threshold.        The 2017 Wind Technologies Market Report, prepared by DOE's       Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, found the following:        The U.S. wind industry installed 7,017 megawatts (MW) of       capacity last year, bringing total utility-scale wind       capacity to nearly 89 GW.        In total, 41 states operated utility-scale wind projects.       Texas leads the nation with over 22 GW of wind capacity,       while Oklahoma, Iowa, California, and Kansas have more than       5,000 MW.        Another 13 states have more than 1,000 MW.        In 2017, wind energy contributed 6.3 percent of the       nation's electricity supply, more than 10 percent of total       generation in 14 states, and more than 30 percent in four of       those states--Iowa, Kansas, Oklahoma, and South Dakota.        Bigger turbines with longer blades are enhancing wind plant       performance. Wind projects built in the past few years have       seen capacity factors increase by 79 percent compared to       projects installed from 1998 to 2001.        The average installed cost of wind projects in 2017 was       $1,611 per kilowatt (kW), down 33 percent from the peak in       2009-2010.        The U.S. wind industry supported more than 105,000 jobs and       saw $11 billion invested in new wind plants in 2017.        The 2017 Distributed Wind Market Report, prepared by DOE's       Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, highlights the       following:        In total, U.S. wind turbines in distributed applications       reached a cumulative installed capacity of 1,076 MW. This       capacity comes from roughly 81,000 turbines installed across       all 50 states, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and       Guam.        In 2017, Iowa, Ohio, and California led the nation in new       distributed wind capacity installed as a result of large-      scale turbines installed by commercial and industrial       facilities and electricity distribution utilities.        Thirty-five percent of distributed wind projects installed       in 2017 were at homes, and 25 percent were agricultural       installations.        U.S. manufacturers of small wind turbines and their supply       chain vendors are located in 27 states.        Between 2015 and 2017, U.S.-based small wind turbine       manufacturers accounted for more than $226 million in export       sales.        The 2017 Offshore Wind Technologies Market Update, prepared       by DOE's National Renewable Energy Laboratory, found the       following:        The U.S. offshore wind industry recently took a leap       forward as commercial-scale projects were competitively       selected in Massachusetts (800 MW), Rhode Island (400 MW),       and Connecticut (200 MW).        New York, New Jersey, and Maryland also have offshore wind       projects in the development pipeline.        The U.S. offshore wind project pipeline has reached a total       of 25,464 MW of capacity across 13 states, including the 30       MW Block Island Wind Farm commissioned in 2016.        In Europe--where most offshore wind development has       occurred to date--recent offshore wind project auctions have       continued the trend of developers committing to lower       electricity prices for projects that will be operating in the       2020s.        New offshore wind turbines are being developed with 10-12       megawatts of capacity (compared to an average capacity of 2.3       MW for land-based turbines and 5.3 MW for offshore wind       turbines installed in 2017). As a result, demand is       increasing for specialized ships that will be able to install       these very large turbines in U.S. waters.        About 60 percent of the U.S. offshore wind resource lies in       deep waters. Developing a project in deep waters requires       wind turbines on floating foundations.        In the U.S., floating offshore wind projects have been       proposed off the coasts of Maine, California, and Hawaii.    Mr. President, amazingly, this report comes from the  same Energy Department currently pushing coal bailout proposals, but  that is what you get from helpless, weak leadership from this  administration that will not face up either to the scientific reality  of climate change or  [[Page S6129]]  the economic reality of energy markets.   FERC, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, has just finalized a  rule for energy storage that could spur as much as 50 gigawatts of  additional energy storage across the United States, and that could be a  conservative estimate if renewables prices keep along those  trajectories we showed before. That FERC rule on energy storage, by the  way, is unanimous and bipartisan. The ISO system operators, like ISO- New England, are doing their best to remove obstacles that had kept  renewables from competing fairly in capacity auctions and dispatch  decisions. This is saving consumers money.   It was reported by Utility Dive that during the July heat wave in New  England, distributed solar, which can reduce demand during peaks, saved  customers some $20 million.   This is reliable stuff out in Iowa, where Midwestern is the ISO. They  figured out the algorithms to treat wind as reliable baseload power,  and the FERC storage rule will further enable this transition.   As you can imagine, the fossil fuel industry is not letting this go  without a fight. They are up to their usual political mischief to try  to protect their $700 billion annual subsidy that they get from  polluting for free. Their shady tactics are just as would be expected.   Start with the fossil fuel industry. They put in front of them the  U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of Manufacturers  to screen what is really the dirty fossil fuel industry. Those two  groups put in front of them some fake consumer group called the  Consumer Energy Alliance, and that fake Consumer Energy Alliance put in  front of it something called Kentuckians for Solar Fairness, all in an  effort to fight rooftop solar for individuals in Kentucky. That is the  kind of nonsense the fossil fuel industry gets up to to try to defend  itself. But despite that, you can't stop progress. You can't deny  costs. You can't win against energy that is cheaper, reliable, and  carbon-free. It is time for us to wake up, throw our weight into clean  energy, and move forward into the future, rather than let the fossil  fuel industry condemn us to a dirty past.   With that I yield to my colleague, Senator Smith.
