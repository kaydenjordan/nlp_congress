 Mr. President, I rise in support of S. Res. 527, a  resolution I was proud to cosponsor, recognizing the longstanding  partnership between the United States and Australia to share critical  firefighting resources during times of crisis.   I first want to thank my colleagues, Senator Cardin and Barrasso, for  introducing this important legislation recognizing the brave men and  women who have not only risked their lives in the United States as  first responders, but went above and beyond to help combat the recent  bushfires in Australia.   In November 2019, Australia began to experience devastating bushfires  that burned over 30,000,000 acres of land. During this time, more than  300 American firefighters mobilized to assist Australian efforts to  suppress and contain the bushfire raging throughout the continent. This  bipartisan resolution recognizes the efforts and bravery of Australian  and American men and women who worked together to help those in danger  and also specifically honors the three American firefighters who lost  their lives fighting Australia's bushfires on January 23, 2020.   In my home State of Nevada, several firefighters answered the call to  assist with bushfire mitigation and suppression efforts. I want to take  a moment to recognize them individually: Matthew James Petersen, Justin  Cutler, Brian C. Holmes, Ian McQueary, Jacob Keogh, Juan Islas, Kevin  Kelly, Joseph L. Miller, Dylan Rader, Timothy P. Roide, and Eric T.  Tilden.   Thank you to all of these brave Nevadans for your service and  sacrifice.                            ____________________     Mr. President, each week the U.S. Senate Committee  on Small Business & Entrepreneurship recognizes one small business that  exemplifies the hard work and perseverance of the American Dream and  the American entrepreneur. The great State of Nevada is home to more  than 250,000 small businesses of all types from mom-and-pop shop  bakeries to world renowned cybersecurity firms. In fact, about 99  percent of all business in Nevada are small businesses. Nevada's small  businesses are the driving force behind our State's rapidly growing  economy and the engine that powers our communities. It is therefore my  honor to recognize Nevada's Fallon Food Hub, a small business with a  strong and deeprooted commitment to  [[Page S1702]]  improving lives and a desire to give back to the community, for  recently having been named the U.S. Senate Small Business of the Week.   The Fallon Food Hub's mission is to educate the northern Nevada  community about the benefits of eating seasonally in order to create a  thriving and expanding local food scene, resulting in increased  opportunities for producers and local businesses. Fallon Food Hub  believes that through educational opportunities for the community about  health and wellness, members of the community can gain a greater sense  of cooperation and appreciation for the area producers, local farmers,  and specialty food producers that serve the Silver State. Through  increasing awareness of and appreciation of local farming and proper  nutrition, people can learn a healthier lifestyle while also supporting  local producers.   The Fallon Food Hub conducts frequent surveys to get a sense of what  the community is interested in learning, hosts monthly classes on the  benefits of eating seasonal produce, and keeps the community informed  through a monthly newspaper. The Fallon Food Hub provides an outlet for  local farmers, ranchers, and value-added producers to sell their goods.   I would also like to recognize the work that Fallon Food Hub does to  advocate on behalf of local farmers. Through ongoing education for  members and surrounding communities about farmers and the origins of  local food, Fallon Food Hub is encouraging our community to connect  with one another on a new level. They are an example of an outstanding  business with deep love for our community and one of the many reasons  why they were a clear choice for this recognition.   Small businesses truly are the driving force for development and  growth not just in Nevada, but across our entire Nation. Small  businesses like Fallon Food Hub not only help our economy succeed, they  also give back by uplifting our communities, inspiring others to open  businesses of their own, improving people's health and well-being, and  changing lives for the better.   Again, I would like to recognize Fallon Food Hub and all the  employees there for their contribution to Nevada and our Nation and  congratulate them for being named the Senate Small Business and  Entrepreneurship Committee's Small Business of the Week. As a member of  the committee, it was my honor to nominate this proud Nevada business  for recognition and my continued privilege to represent them and all of  Nevada's small businesses in the U.S. Senate.                            ____________________
