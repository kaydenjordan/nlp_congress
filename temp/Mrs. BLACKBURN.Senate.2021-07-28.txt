 Madam President, my colleague said it so very well.  The inflation bomb is exploding, and people in Tennessee are incredibly  concerned about that. I hear about this every single day from  Tennesseans.   They are also concerned about the fact that it seems that the  Democratic majority has been unable to push forward a budget that would  be bipartisan, that would have appropriate spending, and that would  prioritize the needs and the concerns of the American people.   Until just a few hours ago, we didn't have any insight into an  infrastructure bill that would be bipartisan, and I applaud those who  have worked so diligently to reach a bipartisan agreement. But the  American people have started to lose a lot of their trust and a lot of  their patience with Washington, DC, and I think we can say ``rightfully  so'' because they are watching the cost of government go up. They are  watching the hesitancy to move forward on their concerns, and they are  speaking out to us. I had a Tennessean this week ask me why Washington  was wasting so much time, because time is money, and they want to see  things done.  [[Page S5128]]    We know we need to see what these bills are going to look like. We  are hearing that the majority wants to bring forward this tax-and-spend  spree of legislation that would be trillions of dollars, and we know  that what would end up happening is this would be something that--I  call it lie, cheat, steal. You don't say exactly what you are going to  use the money for. You don't say exactly where the money is going to  come from within the budget. Eventually, all of it comes out of the  taxpayers' pocket. And you are stealing hopes and dreams from future  generations who are going to--they are going to have to pay the bill  for this. It is our children and our grandchildren and future  generations that are going to have to find a way to pay for all of  this.   That is why I brought this chart back to the floor. I have used it  recently here on this floor to remind us of Ronald Reagan's words:         Freedom is never more than one generation away from       extinction. It has to be fought for and defended by each       generation.    Very true words. And what a good reminder to us because as we give  government more control over our lives, as we give them more control in  the Federal budget, as the government takes more money out of the  pocket of hard-working taxpayers, what do we see? We see less freedom.   There is such concern that the Democratic majority has refused to  come forward and say how they want to spend these trillions of dollars.  I think part of that is because there is not a way to pay for it, and  they don't plan to pay for it. Instead, they are going to send that  bill to future generations.   This is dangerous. We are upside down on this national debt when you  look at how that debt clock is ticking. But we have to choose to spend  taxpayer money where it matters, and it still matters. It matters to  Tennesseans what their tax dollars are spent for, and it matters how  they are spent. Another thing that matters to them is what we are  spending it for and the driving of inflation across this country.   If my Democratic colleagues continue to dig this hole, future  generations will be in so deep that it will be very difficult for them  to compete on the global stage. They will be vulnerable to the  deathtraps our adversaries in Beijing set for nations that have made  the same mistakes that the Democratic majority wants us to make:  spending more money than you have to spend for programs that you cannot  afford.   I would argue that existing in a state of dependence and  vulnerability created by our own government is the opposite of freedom.  It is the opposite of freedom. Is that really what we want for our  children and grandchildren, to leave them with so much Federal debt  that they are covered in debt; that most of their paycheck is going to  go to the Federal Government to pay for programs that have long  outlived their usefulness? I think not.   That is why it is so important that we look at what is happening  right now, as there are these conversations about budgets and as there  are these conversations about the tax-and-spend spree that my  colleagues across the aisle would seek to propose.   I would also offer that that type of spending is not governing. What  it is, is a power grab. What it is, is taking care of your friends and  not those who elected you to serve. The American people can see what is  coming at them from a mile away, and they are expressing their concerns  about DC's out-of-control tax-and-spending spree.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
