 Mr. Speaker, I was a free lunch kid growing up. I was  the young man that brought his ID card to the lunch lady and she looked  on the back for the yellow sticker and I received free breakfasts and  free lunches.   I know what it is like to come from a home with a lot of love but not  a lot of money. I can tell you for a fact that kids with backgrounds  like me cannot succeed in the classroom if they are worried about the  next meal.   That is why this GOP farm bill is so reprehensible. Republicans are  proposing SNAP cuts that will kick a quarter-of-a-million students off  of the free lunch program.   That is right, Mr. Speaker. They have just given massive tax cuts to  millionaires and billionaires, but now, to save money, they are trying  to pass a bill that could cause poor kids across this country to go  hungry.   This legislation is a direct attack on my constituents. It is a  direct attack on the poor. One in four families in my district alone  counts on SNAP to put food on the table.   They deserve better. Our country deserves better. I urge my  colleagues to oppose this shameful legislation.                            ____________________
