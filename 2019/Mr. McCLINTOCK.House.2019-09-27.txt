 Mr. Speaker, for 43 years the President of the United  States has had the statutory authority granted by this Congress to  declare a national emergency and to reprogram unobligated military  construction funds to meet that emergency. Fifty-eight times previous  Presidents have invoked this authority to address such matters as civil  unrest in Sierra Leone and Burma.   Only when this President invokes his authority for the 59th time to  address the most serious national security crisis in our lifetime--the  collapse of our southern border--only then do we hear protests from the  left and its disciples in Congress.   Under our Constitution, the Congress appropriates money but cannot  spend it, and the President spends money but cannot appropriate it. He  spends it according to laws given to him by this Congress. In this  case, Congress appropriated funds and delegated to the President  precisely the authority to spend those funds that he is now exercising.  Whether Congress should have delegated this authority is a separate  question that no one has raised in 43 years. But while that authority  exists, the President has both a right and a duty to use it to defend  our country.   We also hear protests that the President's act will divert money from  other construction projects. I ask them: What is more important to our  Nation's defense than the defense of our own borders? A childcare  center in Maryland? Really?   Our Nation is going to have to have a serious discussion over whether  we wish to continue as a sovereign nation with the uniquely American  principles and customs that have made us, in Lincoln's words, the last  best hope of mankind on this Earth, or whether we will allow the  Democrats to render our borders meaningless and reduce our once great  nation into nothing more than a vast international territory between  Canada and Mexico.
