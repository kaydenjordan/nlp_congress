 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of amendment No. 8 in  the en bloc. This amendment helps veterans and their families navigate  a bureaucratic maze at VA. It is very frustrating a lot of times when  they receive medical treatment at a non-VA facility.   When a veteran is admitted to a hospital or emergency department they  currently only have 3 days to notify the VA. If they fail to notify the  VA in that 3-day window, any claim associated with that visit will be  automatically denied.   There are circumstances when getting immediate medical care outside  of the VA system is the veteran's only option, especially during a  medical emergency. They and their family should not have to worry about  paperwork and the bureaucracy if the veteran is facing a life- threatening condition or is unable to make his or her own healthcare  decisions.   My amendment simply just lengthens that window and adds another day  onto that window to report the claim. When you think about this, if you  are going in on an emergency basis and after you get stabilized--it  might take a couple days in the hospital to get stabilized--that extra  day doesn't seem like much, but it is really important because they get  stabilized and they get time to sort through where they are at. That is  so important. We have helped hundreds and maybe thousands of veterans  back in Ohio, and this comes up all the time, and they have to fight to  get their claim.   Mr. Speaker, I think it is really important, just a little bit of  extra time. It is a no-brainer issue. I appreciate the chair putting it  in the en bloc because it is really important because veterans,  especially when they are in a non-veteran facility and have emergency  care, they shouldn't have to worry about that deadline, and it just  gives them a little extra time.   Mr. Speaker, I support amendment No. 8.
