 I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, last week, this House voted on a bill that was sold as  pandemic relief, yet less than 9 percent of that bill was for public  health funding to combat COVID-19, and $140 million of that bill is  going to a failed rail project in Speaker Pelosi's district.   This week, the Democrats have put forth a bill titled ``For the  People,'' but the bill has nearly 800 pages of provisions that take  election decisions away from State and local officials and put them in  the hands of the Federal Government. It attacks Americans' First  Amendment right to free speech, and it publicly funds Members of  Congress' campaigns using corporate dollars.   There is a pattern emerging. The Democrats are bringing bills to the  floor under the guise of being for the people, but their bill actually  benefits the politicians.   As I said, I have many issues with H.R. 1, including the mandates  this bill puts on States and provisions that attack our First Amendment  rights. But I want to focus on one particular provision in this bill  right now, and that is how the Democrats' number one priority is a bill  that funds their own campaigns.   H.R. 1 would launder corporate dollars through the U.S. Treasury and  use those dollars to publicly fund congressional campaigns. Based on  2020 fundraising numbers, that creates access to more than $7 million  in laundered corporate dollar public funds to bolster my colleagues'  campaign coffers. This is the 6-to-1 match program that my colleague  talked about for small-dollar donations.   I know when I speak with my constituents back home, establishing a  program that helps me acquire more money for my campaign is not what  they think the Federal Government should be working on.   At the Rules Committee, because this bill did not go through regular  order and did not receive a markup in the House Administration  Committee, we submitted amendments to not only strike this program  altogether and prevent sitting Members of Congress from financially  benefiting from this bill, but also requiring any increase in corporate  fines to be used to help the pandemic relief.    I can think of a lot better ways to spend the $7 million that would  be just for my district, like pandemic relief. We could maybe reopen  our schools or rebuild a fund to help women's shelters and rape crisis  centers. Amazingly, Democrats wouldn't even allow these amendments for  a vote on the floor today.   It is disappointing because I had hoped that we could all agree that  helping our country through this pandemic or just simply focusing on  the American people is more important than lining our own campaign  coffers. Clearly, this bill is not for the benefit of the people, but  it is for the politicians' campaign coffers.   I also want to note that this bill is opposed by 16 secretaries of  state, nine former FEC Commissioners, the National Disability Rights  Network, the Institute for Free Speech, and more than 130 other  nonprofit organizations, but supported by Indivisible, a group whose  sole purpose is to elect Democrats. I think this speaks volumes as to  why my friends on the other side of the aisle are rushing this bill  through with little debate and next to no input from Republicans.   Despite what my friends on the other side of the aisle continue to  tell Americans, this bill is not for the people. This bill is for the  politicians. I urge a ``no'' vote on this bill.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Loudermilk), a great member of the House  Administration Committee, and my good friend.    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 30  seconds to the gentleman.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from California (Mr. McClintock).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes  to the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Tenney), the newest member of  this Congress.    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 30  seconds to the gentlewoman from New York.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from California (Mr. Valadao), a refreshing sight to see back  on the House floor.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Lucas), a very good friend.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from Arizona (Mrs. Lesko), my good friend.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes  to the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. Womack), my good friend.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes  to the gentleman from the great State of Minnesota (Mr. Emmer), my good  friend.    Madam Speaker, just for the viewers on  C-Span who wondered why time stopped here in the House for that minute  the majority leader spoke, I want to remind them all that is what we  call the majority leader's magic minute.   Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Pfluger), my good friend and one of the newest Members.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes  to the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Biggs), my good friend.    Madam Speaker, in spite of my hesitance  to trust this timing, can I get a time check to see how much we have  left?    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Steil), another member of the Committee  on House Administration.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, no matter how many times Speaker Pelosi and the  Democrats continue to say that there is not a publicly funded program  to put money directly into her Members' congressional campaigns, it  doesn't make her statement true.   In this bill, it is the first-ever corporate money since 1907 that is  laundered through the Federal Government, through the Department of  Treasury, and goes right into our own congressional campaigns, up to $7  million, using 2020 numbers.   Madam Speaker, I am angry that the Speaker continues to talk about  States, like Georgia, following the law to make sure that their voter  rolls are complete and accurate when, in her own home State of  California, the corrupt secretary of state would not even commit to  removing over 400,000 deceased or moved voters from the voter rolls,  and many of them, if not all of them, got live ballots.   This bill would place the corruption that we see in California and  export it nationwide. Let me tell you, that corrupt secretary of state,  huh, what a deal, we now call him a U.S. Senator.   Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Roy).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes  to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Crenshaw).    Madam Speaker, I do also have a stack  of letters in opposition. I will include them in the Record. I won't go  through each of them.                                                      Frank LaRose,                                         Ohio Secretary of State,                                                        Columbus OH,      For Immediate Release:      Thursday, February 25, 2021.      LaRose Calls on Congress to Reject Federal Takeover of Elections  House Resolution 1 Would Bring Sweeping, Unworkable and Unfunded Change     Across the Nation's 50 Unique Election Systems, Causing Chaos and                         Damaging Voter Confidence         Columbus.--Today, Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose       called on the United States Congress to vote against House       Resolution 1, a bill that would effectively take over control       of how states conduct elections. HR 1 imposes significant       changes that ignore both the United States Constitution and       the unique election systems across the 50 states in an effort       to standardize how states vote.        ``Ohio's November 2020 election was the most successful on       record, but Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Majority Leader Chuck       Schumer want to wipe it all away with a massive power-grab,''       said LaRose. ``Remember, each state election system is       unique--shaped by time and trusted by their respective       voters. Forcing uniform standards, procedures, and       expectations into state election systems, some far different       than others and not built for those requirements, is like       forcing a square peg into a round hole. It won't work.''        Article 1, Section 4 of the Constitution states that       ``[t]he Times, Places and Manner of holding Elections for       Senators and Representatives, shall be prescribed in each       State by the Legislature thereof,'' but that ``the Congress       may at any time by Law make or alter such Regulations, except       as to the Places of chusing Senators.'' In Federalist Paper       No. 59, Alexander Hamilton contended that such regulation was       only necessary ``whenever extraordinary circumstances might       render that interposition necessary to its safety''. Moreso,       state-level elections and the election of the president have       remained outside of the purview of congress.        However, the question of whether it's even within the power       of congress to take over how states run elections isn't even       the most important question. Instead, the better question is       ``should they?'' In the 59 presidential elections since 1789,       each has resulted in the successful election of a President.       Voting laws have evolved across the 50 states, providing more       and more access, security, and accuracy. Over time, each of       those same 50 states have created their own unique election       systems. From who administers the elections, to how votes are       cast, to how a vote is protected--each system was born of       federalism.        Like human beings, no voting system is perfect.       Improvements and changes happen as the people, working       through their respective state legislatures, see fit. In       Ohio, a state whose elections have long been under the       national spotlight, we've developed a system which has       ensured voters have confidence in the outcome of elections.       As a result, voter turnout is at an all-time high, voter       fraud and voter suppression are exceedingly rare, and our       efforts to strengthen the security of our elections have       become a national model. Even as we faced enormous       challenges, last year we in Ohio ran the most successful       election in our state's history. It's no surprise that other       states are now coming to us to learn our best election       practices so they can mirror them back home.        That's how it's supposed to work. One of the great       motivations of federalism is the state role as a laboratory       for democracy, with each state innovating to become a better       version of itself, and sharing those lessons with other       states. That experiment has allowed our nation to become the       best in the world. We need to keep that experiment going and       encourage Ohio's congressional delegation to vote against       House Resolution 1.        Secretary LaRose will soon be sending a letter to       congressional leadership and Ohio's congressional delegation       requesting a no vote on HR 1.

Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Speaker, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Kevin McCarthy,      Minority Leader, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Jerrold Nadler,      Chairman, House Judiciary Committee,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Lindsey Graham,      Chairman, Senate Judiciary Committee,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Mitch McConnell,      Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Chuck Schumer,      Minority Leader, U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Jim Jordan,      Ranking Member, House Judiciary Committee, Washington, DC.      Hon. Dianne Feinstein,      Ranking Member, Senate Judiciary Committee, Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Pelosi, Majority Leader McConnell, Minority       Leader McCarthy, Minority Leader Schumer, Chairman Nadler,       Chairman Graham, Ranking Member Jordan, and Ranking Member       Feinstein: On behalf of the undersigned state Attorneys       General, we write to respectfully urge Congress to address       the ongoing, declining balance of the Crime Victims Fund       (``the Fund''). The Fund provides critical support and       services to victims of crime across the country. As state       Attorneys General, we are often the administrators of grant       funding, through our state compensation programs or       otherwise, financed directly from the Fund. In order to       ensure the predictability and sustainability of these       critical funds, change must be enacted to support our states'       ability to effectively serve victims and survivors of crime       for years to come.        The Fund, established by the Victims of Crime Act of 1984       (``VOCA''), is the primary funding source for victim services       in all 50 states and six U.S. territories. Deposits to the       Fund originate from criminal fines, forfeited bail bonds,       penalties and special assessments collected by U.S.       Attorneys' Offices, federal courts and the Federal Bureau of       Prisons. Funding is derived from offenders convicted of       federal crimes, and not from taxpayers.        Since its creation, the Fund has covered the expenses of       essential direct services and support for victims and       survivors in the aftermath of crime, including medical care,       mental health counseling, lost wages, courtroom advocacy and       temporary housing. The Fund also provides support for       initiatives that benefit victims of crime, including federal,       state and tribal victim service programs, crime victim       compensation, discretionary grant awards, victim specialists       in U.S. Attorneys' and FBI offices and the federal victim       notification system. Additionally, grants through the Fund       are the only funding source available for services to all       victims of crime.        The balance and financial health of the Fund is in       jeopardy. As deposits have sharply decreased in recent years       due to a decline in the fines and penalties recouped from       federal criminal cases, withdrawals have increased at a rapid       pace. In 2015, Congress increased the annual cap on       distributions from the Fund, resulting in significant growth       in the amount of services offered across the country. Nearly       2,500 new organizations received VOCA funding since 2015. In       addition, more than 2.5 million new victims were served       through VOCA assistance formula grants from 2015 to 2019.        We applaud Congress for expanding access to victim       services. Yet, these important advances are at risk given the       current downward trajectory of the Fund's balance. Its       balance is projected to reach a ten-year low by the end of       2021 unless specific changes are enacted to protect its       bottom line. Any decrease in the funds available for       distribution results in a decrease in the number of victims       and survivors that are served as well as potential loss of       essential staff for victim service programs.        In order to stabilize and maintain the Fund for use in the       future, we respectfully request Congress amend VOCA in the       following three ways:        Deposit all monetary penalties from deferred and non-      prosecution agreements into the Crime Victims Fund.        Over the last decade, the Department of Justice has       increasingly utilized deferred and non-prosecution agreements       to resolve cases of corporate misconduct. These agreements       bypass a traditional prosecution process and shift fines and       penalties into the general treasury rather than the Fund. In       2018 and 2019, the total recoveries resulting from these       agreements resulted in approximately $8 billion each year.       Redirecting these deposits will provide increased funding to       the Fund, which will allow for better predictability of state       awards.        Increase the rate at which states are federally reimbursed       for victim compensation programs to 75 percent.        The Fund supports state compensation programs, which       provide direct reimbursement to or on behalf of crime victims       for unexpected and often catastrophic expenses caused by       violent crime. In order to supplement a state's efforts to       financially assist victims for crime-related out-of-pocket       expenses, the Fund reimburses states 60 percent of spending       in a fiscal year. Most states' compensation programs are       funded through fines and fees paid by offenders prosecuted in       state courts. Recently, due to criminal justice reform       initiatives along with court closures due to the COVID-19       pandemic, states are facing a significant decline in       collections of these fines and fees, limiting their ability       to support essential victim compensation eligible expenses.       An increase in the reimbursement rate from the Fund to at       least 75 percent will ensure each state has more money       accessible to serve victims and survivors with much needed       financial support.        Allow for additional years of spending or no-cost       extensions for VOCA discretionary, assistance and       compensation awards.        Current statutory limitations require that recipients of       VOCA funds spend annual grants in a four-year period. To       reduce reversions and provide better forecasting for       programming, the statute should allow for longer periods to       spend down grants and allow the Office for Victims of Crime       to permit no-cost extensions to states. A longer award period       allows administrators to better plan and predict funding       awards and long-term services. In times of economic       uncertainty, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, this is       especially important as state budgets and other funding       sources are significantly impacted. Additional time also       allows for redirection of funds for emergency assistance       without the threat of compromising traditional services.        Your support of the Crime Victims Fund is paramount to our       responsibility as Attorneys General to protect the interests       of victims. As such, we defer to you on the best vehicle to       introduce the above changes. We do ask, however, that       Congress make them a key priority and act upon all three       swiftly.        Thank you for your attention and consideration of this       matter.

Re Committee on House Administration Hearing: Strengthening           American Democracy.       Chair Zoe Lofgren,      Committee on House Administration, House of Representatives,           Washington, DC.      Ranking Member Rodney Davis,      Committee on House Administration,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chair Lofgren and Ranking Member Davis: On behalf of       the National Disability Rights Network (NDRN) and the       nationwide network of Protection & Advocacy (P&A) systems, we       commend the Committee for examining the state of voting       rights in America and unswervingly exploring ways to       strengthen our democracy. We wish to submit this letter for       the record in connection with the Committee on House       Administration's hearing, ``Strengthening American       Democracy,'' scheduled to take place on February 25, 2021.        NDRN is the non-profit membership organization for the       federally mandated P&A systems for individuals with       disabilities. The  [[Page H986]]       P&As were established by the United States Congress to       protect the rights of people with disabilities and their       families through legal support, advocacy, referral, and       education. P&As are in all 50 states, the District of       Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the US territories (American       Samoa, Guam, Northern Mariana Islands, and the US Virgin       Islands), and there is a P&A affiliated with the American       Indian Consortium which serves Native Americans with       disabilities in the Four Corners region of the Southwest.       Collectively, the P&A Network is the largest provider of       legally based advocacy services to people with disabilities       in the United States.        Through the Protection and Advocacy for Voter Access (PAVA)       program, created by the Help America Vote Act (HAVA), the       P&As have a federal mandate to ensure the full participation       of individuals with disabilities in the entire electoral       process, including registering to vote, casting a ballot, and       accessing polling places. PAVA advocates are on the ground in       communities and states, providing advice, technical       assistance, and training to election officials about voting       accessibility for a wide array of disabilities. They also       provide outreach, training, and direct representation to       individuals with disabilities, and the agencies and       organizations that serve them.        Voters with disabilities remain a large voting bloc in       America's elections. The United States Census Bureau has       reported up to 56.7 million people with disabilities live in       the community, totaling approximately 19 percent of the non-      institutionalized US population. The Centers for Disease       Control and Prevention (CDC) and Pew Research Center believe       that number is closer to 25 percent, or one in four       Americans. Further, the School of Management and Labor       Relations at Rutgers University projected that there were       38.3 million people with disabilities eligible to vote in the       US, one-sixth of the total American electorate, during the       2020 elections.        The disability community is diverse and people with       disabilities are a part of every community. People who       identify as LGBTQIA+ are more likely to have a disability. A       quarter or more of American Indians/Alaska Natives and Black       adults have a disability. People with disabilities are       disproportionately low-income, and are unemployed,       underemployed, or not participating in the workforce at a       rate of approximately three-fourths of adults with       disabilities, under the age of 65 living in the community.        Despite the size and diversity of the disability community,       America's electoral system remains largely inaccessible and       has a long history of excluding people with disabilities.       Inaccessible polling places, voting stations and vote by mail       systems are only some of the barriers voters with       disabilities face while trying to exercise their right to       vote in America every election cycle. In February 2021, the       Election Assistance Commission (EAC) and Rutgers University       released their report, ``Disability and Voting Accessibility       in the 2020 Elections'', which summarized their survey       results from last year's election cycle. The results found       that ``one in nine voters with disabilities encountered       difficulties voting in 2020,'' twice the rate of people       without disabillties. The report also found that 18 percent       of people with disabilities who voted in person last year had       difficulty with voting compared to 10 percent of people       without disabilities, while five percent of voters with       disabilities had difficulties using a mail ballot, compared       to two percent of voters without disabilities.        Despite the fact that the Americans with Disabilities Act       (ADA) was signed into law now almost 31 years ago, requiring       America's polling places be accessible to voters with       disabilities, the majority of polling places remain       inaccessible. The US Government Accountability Office (GAO)       surveys of polling place accessibility span 20 years. In       2000, GAO data indicated that only 16 percent of polling       places had an accessible path of travel from the parking area       to the voting booth. This percentage has slowly but steadily       increased to 27 percent in 2008 and to 40 percent in 2016. To       be clear, 40 percent is an all-time high in architectural       access, meaning that less than half of polling places were       compliant with federal law during the 2016 presidential       election.        Worse, GAO began to investigate the accessibility of voting       stations within polling places starting with the 2008 study,       during which only 54 percent of voting booths were determined       to be accessible in 2016, the prevalence of accessible voting       stations actually fell to a dismal 35 percent--a drop of 19       percentage points in just 2 presidential election cycles. GAO       found that voting booths were less likely to be set up to       ensure voter privacy, set up for wheelchair access, have       headphones readily apparent for audio balloting, or even be       turned on for voters to use. In their 2016 findings, GAO       combined architectural access data with voting booth data for       the first time and reported an astonishing 17 percent of       polling places are compliant with federal law and fully       accessible for voters with disabilities--fewer than 1 in 5.        Along with inaccessible polling places and inaccessible       voting stations, vote by mail systems are not, and have never       been, accessible to all voters with disabilities. People who       are blind or low vision, have print disabilities, limited       literacy, limited manual dexterity, and other disabilities       cannot privately and independently mark, verify, and cast a       hand marked paper mail-in ballot. Federal law is clear that       any option made available to voters must be accessible for       people with disabilities, including vote by mail.        As Congress continues to explore voting legislation to       strengthen American democracy, we urge you to protect the       rights of voters with disabilities. Legislation currently       being considered in the 117th Congress, such as H.R. 1, the       For the People Act, which includes several provisions that       will positively impact voters with disabilities. However, it       must be understood that the paper ballot mandate included in       the bill is of great concern to many voters with       disabilities.        Paper-based voting options have become the preferred voting       system to many who believe mandating the use of paper ballots       is necessary to ensure the security of our elections.       However, it must be made abundantly clear, that the ability       to mark, verify, and cast a paper ballot privately and       independently is currently not an option for all voters.        Given that paper ballots are already the predominant method       of casting a ballot in America today with extremely few       exceptions, mandating paper ballots is frankly unnecessary. A       federal mandate for paper ballots that are already being used       will not change how we currently administer elections in the       United States or make our elections any more secure.       Additionally, any mandate of a paper-based voting system will       inevitably create barriers for voters with disabilities. A       paper ballot mandate would: 1.) end all voting system       innovation and advancement to produce a fully accessible       voting system that provides enhanced security without relying       on archaic, inaccessible paper; 2.) limit voters with       disabilities' federal right to privately and independently       verify and cast their ballots, and 3.) ultimately segregate       voters with disabilities.        Further, any paper ballot mandate that entitles voters to a       hand marked ballot threatens the availability of Ballot-      Marking Devices (BMDs) for voters who rely on them to mark       their ballots by drastically limiting use of BMDs to voters       with disabilities. This would result in segregating voters       with disabilities away from the entire pool of voters by       making them the only group of people that use a particular       type of voting machine. Federally mandated segregation is       problematic alone, but in practice, it also increases the       likelihood that poll workers will not be properly trained on       the machine, the machines will not be properly maintained or       set up for use, and if the only available BMD is not       functioning, there is no alternative option for voters who       need it. Limits on BMD use will also saddle poll workers with       determining who is ``disabled enough'' to use the BMD, a       decision for which they have no qualifications or legal       right. Finally, if the ballot produced by the BMD is not       identical to the hand marked ballot or the BMD ballot cannot       be scanned and stored with hand marked ballots, the voter's       right to cast a private ballot is violated.        To be clear, no paper ballot voting system today, ready for       widespread use, is fully accessible. Even BMDs require voters       with disabilities to verify and a cast a paper-based ballot,       which does not ensure a private and independent vote. A fully       accessible voting system by Federal law must ensure the voter       can receive, mark, verify, and cast the ballot without having       to directly visually inspect or handle paper. Most, if not       all, market-ready voting systems cannot do this. Before       paper-based voting systems become the law of the land, the       concerns of voters with disabilities must be addressed.        Moving forward NDRN calls on Congress to continue to       examine and pass legislation that protects the rights of all       voters, including voters with disabilities. This includes,       but is not limited to, Congress accepting its role in       providing a continual funding stream to state and local       election officials for the purpose of making electoral       processes fully accessible. Congress must invest in research       and development and pilot projects, as well as funding to       states for the purchase of new accessible voting equipment.       Congress may also consider expanding the role of the U.S.       Election Assistance Commission to address accessible remote       voting in its creation of voting system guidelines and by       adding full time staff and additional seats on its advisory       boards for experts in elections accessibility with a focus on       voters with disabilities. Rather than overly prescriptive,       blanket mandates that create barriers for eligible voters,       our focus must be on fostering innovative solutions that make       our elections more accessible and more secure through       responsible use of technology.        NDRN thanks Congress for prioritizing strengthening       American democracy and we look forward to working with you to       ensure every voice, including the voice of the disability       community, is heard on Election Day.            Sincerely,                                                  Curtis L. Decker,                                                Executive Director.

Merrill,                                              Secretary of State,                                  Montgomery, AL, February 22, 2021.      Hon. Chuck Schumer,      Majority Leader,      U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Speaker of the House,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Mitch McConnell,      Minority Leader,      U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.      Hon. Kevin McCarthy,      Minority Leader of the House,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Majority Leader Schumer, Minority Leader McConnell,       Speaker Pelosi, and House Minority Leader McCarthy: We are       writing you today to urge you to reject the ``For the People       Act'' otherwise known as H.R. 1 or S. 1, which is a dangerous       overreach by the federal government into the administration       of elections.        Each state legislature should have the freedom and       flexibility to determine practices that best meet the needs       of their respective states. A one-size-fits-all approach       mandated by Congress is not the solution to any of our       problems.        These bills intrude upon our constitutional rights, and       further sacrifice the security and integrity of the elections       process. We firmly believe the authority to legislate and       regulate these changes should be left with the states.        H.R. 1 and S. 1 blatantly undermine the extensive work we,       as election officials, have completed in order to provide       safe, accessible voting options for our constituencies. Many       of the proposed practices would reverse the years of progress       that has been made. We are strongly opposed to these bills       and hope you will dismiss efforts to advance this       legislation.        Thank you for your consideration and attention to this       matter,        John H. Merrill, Alabama Secretary of State; Kevin Meyer,       Alaska Lieutenant Governor; Brad Raffensperger, Georgia       Secretary of State; Lawrence Denney, Idaho Secretary of       State; Connie Lawson, Indiana Secretary of State; Scott       Schwab, Kansas Secretary of State; Michael Adams, Kentucky       Secretary of State; Kyle Ardoin, Louisiana Secretary of       State.        Michael Watson, Mississippi Secretary of State; Christi       Jacobsen, Montana Secretary of State; Bob Evnen, Nebraska       Secretary of State; Alvin A. Jaeger, North Dakota Secretary       of State; Steve Barnett, South Dakota Secretary of State; Tre       Hargett, Tennessee Secretary of State; Mac Warner, West       Virginia Secretary of State; Ed Buchanan, Wyoming Secretary       of State.                                   ____           Ohio House of Representatives, Scott Wiggam, State             Representative,                                                 February 25, 2021.      To: Ohio Federal Delegation      From: Ohio Representative Scott Wiggam, District 1, Ohio           House of Representatives         To the Ohio Federal Delegation: As a state legislator       elected to be a voice for the people of Ohio, I write to       express my opposition to H.R. 1/S. 1, an unconstitutional       takeover of citizens' right to free speech and association.        As elected officials, we both have a duty to represent our       constituents best interests and a responsibility to defend       the United States Constitution. Therefore, it is my       obligation to urge you to oppose the deceptively named ``For       the People Act.'' The legislation is ill-considered and       deeply unconstitutional, and I have seen firsthand the       chilling effects of the donor disclosure provisions that it       would enact.        As a member of the American Legislative Exchange Council, a       membership organization of state legislators dedicated to       principles of limited government, free markets and       federalism. In 2013, activists launched a campaign to reveal,       then harass and shame, the ALEC donor base. Their goal was       simple: Harassing ALEC donors and corporate members would       chill their participation with and support for the       organization, ultimately cutting off a funding source for       ALEC.        Worse, public elected officials used their platform to       heighten this threat of donor disclosure in order to further       intimidate ALEC supporters. In 2013, every company       tangentially associated with ALEC received an official letter       from US Senator Richard Durbin, demanding to know whether it       had ``served as a member of ALEC or provided any funding to       ALEC,'' with the intent of intimidating them. Durbin wrote       that he would read their responses into the official       Congressional record, forever memorializing their support and       creating a public target list for activists opposed to the       organization. Even the Chicago Tribune, the Senator's       hometown newspaper that had endorsed his candidacy, rebuked       Durbin's attempt at creating an ``enemies list'' by using       ``his high federal office as a cudgel against his enemies.''        H.R. 1/S. 1 would institutionalize this harassment and       intimidation and extend it to all nonprofits, regardless of       their issue area or political persuasion. Whatever issues you       support or oppose, this should be of serious concern to you.       If this legislation is enacted, passionate activists on both       sides of the aisle would have access to a government-run       database of donors who give to every organization from ALEC       and the Family Research Council to the ACLU and Planned       Parenthood. Does anyone doubt that the blunt instrument of       donor disclosure in H.R. 1/S. 1 would put millions of       Americans' peace and livelihoods at risk of significant,       material harm?        These tactics are flimsy bureaucratic structures designed       to harass nonprofits and chill speech, despite fundamental       violations of the First Amendment. In keeping with today's       ``cancel culture,'' H.R. 1/S. 1 is a government-sanctioned       attempt to chill speech and participation. ``Good       governance'' watchdogs argue this measure increases       ``transparency.'' Transparency is good when applied to       government, but when it strips away Constitutionally       protected privacy for individuals, it is exceedingly       dangerous. For the federal government to expose our       constituents as supporters of any nonprofit's cause would be       an enormous overreach of centralized power.        If passed, the donor disclosure provisions in H.R. 1/S. 1       would bludgeon our democratic institutions and threaten the       safety and peace of our everyday constituents. It would       further normalize the darkness of ``cancel culture'' and       intimidation through overregulation in American society.       Therefore, we call on you to oppose H.R./S. 1.        Sincerely,                                    Representative Scott Wiggam,                          District 1, Ohio House of Representatives,      Ohio ALEC State Chair.                                   ____                                                National Association                                            of Attorneys General,                                    Washington, DC, August 10, 2020.      Re Support for the Edith Shorougian Senior Victims of Fraud           Compensation Act (S. 3487/H.R. 7620).       Hon. Mitch McConnell,      Senate Majority Leader,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Charles Schumer,      Senate Minority Leader,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Lindsey Graham,      Chair, Senate Judiciary Committee,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Dianne Feinstein,      Ranking Member, Senate Judiciary Committee, Washington, DC.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Speaker of the House,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Kevin McCarthy,      House Minority Leader,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Jerry Nadler,      Chair, House Judiciary Committee,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Jim Jordan,      Ranking Member, House Judiciary Committee, Washington, DC.        Dear Leader McConnell, Speaker Pelosi, Leader Schumer,       Leader McCarthy, Chair Graham, Chair Nadler, Ranking Member       Feinstein, and Ranking Member Jordan: As our jurisdictions'       chief legal officers, we are writing to request the inclusion       of the Edith Shorougian Senior Victims of Fraud Compensation       Act (S. 3487/H.R. 7620) in COVID-19 relief legislation. This       bipartisan legislation, also known as ``Edith's Bill,'' would       amend the Victims of Crime Act of 1984 (VOCA) to include       victims of senior fraud as eligible for reimbursement by the       Crime Victims Fund for states that provide compensation to       victims. This bill will also amend VOCA so that penalties and       fines from deferred prosecution and non-prosecution       agreements, which can include white collar criminal conduct       against seniors, are deposited into the Crime Victims Fund.       We support inclusion of the full bill in COVID-19 relief       legislation.        Scam artists know that seniors are especially at risk from       COVID-19 and are exploiting the anxiety around this pandemic.       They are targeting seniors who are isolating at home and are       separated from their families and support networks.        The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of       Inspector General has warned that fraudsters ``are offering       COVID-19 tests to Medicare beneficiaries in exchange for       personal details, including Medicare information.'' This is       unfortunately just one of many COVID-19 scams targeting       seniors.        Senior fraud scams can be devastating on a personal and       financial level. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau       estimated in 2019 that elder financial exploitation cases       resulted in an average loss of over $40,000 and 7% of cases       resulted in a senior losing over $100,000. Many seniors live       on fixed incomes and savings earned over a lifetime of hard       work. Older adults have contributed so much to our nation,       and it is simply wrong that many are losing life savings to       criminals. Tragically, it is rare for seniors to receive       compensation even after fraudsters are caught and convicted.       Edith's Bill would take an important step in providing       compensation to defrauded seniors, and it would do so without       using taxpayer funds.        Throughout the country, attorneys general are fighting       senior fraud and abuse. In 2019, several state attorneys       general partnered with the U.S. Department of Justice and  [[Page H988]]       other federal partners to conduct the largest-ever nationwide       elder fraud sweep against perpetrators who had repeatedly       targeted seniors, resulting in losses of over $750 million.       Though this initiative was a tremendous success, the total       annual financial loss by elder abuse victims is estimated to       be well over $2.6 billion.        Further, with 1 in 5 Americans expected to be over the age       of 65 by 2030, an increase in scams and frauds targeting       seniors is widely expected. In Wisconsin alone, the number of       reported elder abuse cases has already more than tripled       since 2001. Edith Shorougian was one of those Wisconsin       victims. Edith was scammed out of more than $80,000 by her       longtime financial adviser. By using this legislation to add       senior fraud as an eligible reimbursement expense under VOCA,       states will be able to help victims like Edith receive the       financial relief they deserve. States would be incentivized       but not mandated by this legislation to provide compensation       to victims of senior fraud.

Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Speaker of the House of Representatives,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Chuck Schumer,      Majority Leader,      U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.      Hon. Kevin McCarthy,      Republican Leader,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Mitch McConnell,      Republican Leader,      U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Pelosi, Republican Leader McCarthy, Majority       Leader Schumer, and Republican Leader McConnell: We write out       of deep concern for the threat that the self-styled ``For the       People Act'' (H.R. 1 and S. 1 in the current Congress,       hereinafter the ``FPA'') poses to the long-standing       bipartisan structure of the Federal Election Commission       (``FEC'')--a concern based on our many years of experience as       commissioners of the FEC. The FEC is the federal agency       entrusted with primary interpretation, civil enforcement, and       administration of federal campaign finance laws.        The threat to bipartisanship in this federal agency should       be a concern for the public, but also for members of       Congress, who are among the most visible subjects of FEC       scrutiny. Candidates for federal office know that the FEC is       an intrusive presence in virtually every aspect of their       campaigns, requiring disclosure of detailed aspects of their       contributions and expenditures, initiating investigations,       subpoenaing witnesses and records, imposing civil penalties       for violations of its hundreds of pages of regulations, and       conducting audits of campaign committees selected by the       Commission to monitor compliance, among other actions.        We are all former members of the FEC. Collectively, we have       over six decades of service on the Commission. Most of us       served as Chair of the FEC, and at least one of us was       serving on the Commission at all times between 1998 and 2020.        The FPA, as introduced in the House, is 791 pages and       addresses virtually every aspect of election rules and       administration. Our comments here are limited to Titles IV       and VI in Division B of the Act. We address those provisions       because they concern the jurisdiction of the FEC, and our       comments specifically represent our combined expertise and       experience over decades of service on the Commission. Our       decision not to address provisions of the FPA changing       election administration outside of FEC jurisdiction, however,       should not be viewed as support for or acquiescence in those       proposals.        Title VI would transform the FEC from a bipartisan, six-      member body to a five-member body subject to, and indeed       designed for, partisan control. Proponents claim this radical       change is necessary to prevent ``deadlock'' on the Commission       and assure efficient operations. This perception of perpetual       deadlock is incorrect. Empirically, even the most extreme       study of FEC vote--that is, a vigorously contested, non-peer       reviewed study, conducted during a short period of relatively       high disagreement within the Commission, and not transparent       about its methodology or selection of votes--found a maximum       of 30 percent of enforcement matters ending in 3-3 votes. But       other studies, including peer-reviewed studies, have       consistently found much lower rates of ``deadlock,''       typically in the one to six percent range.        Moreover, the argument that the bipartisan makeup of the       Commission hinders its effectiveness is based on a       misunderstanding of the FEC's work and why deadlocks       occasionally occur. By definition, campaign finance law       inserts the government into partisan electoral disputes. In       our experience, the agency's bipartisan structure both       assures that the laws are enforced with bipartisan support       and equally important, that they are not perceived as a       partisan tool of the majority party--an electoral weapon, if       you will. ``The indispensable ingredient in the FEC's       creation was its bipartisan makeup,'' with an equal number of       members from each major party and a voting structure       requiring some minimal measure of bipartisan agreement before       an enforcement action went forward or a rule was adopted. As       Senator Alan Cranston (D-Calif.) explained during post-      Watergate Congressional debates about the agency's creation:       ``We must not allow the FEC to become a tool for       harassment.'' Political actors who violate campaign finance       laws, and their partisans, are often quick to denounce       enforcement as a ``partisan witch hunt.'' The FEC's       bipartisan makeup is a direct response to this claim and is       fundamental to public confidence in the system.        Further, a neutral examination of the relatively few       ``deadlocks'' that do occur reveals that a substantial       portion of them concern differences of opinion over the reach       of the statutes the FEC enforces. One bloc of three       commissioners has often reflected the views of activist       organizations that advocate for even more extensive       regulation, supporting an expansive view of the statutes that       goes beyond what Congress has enacted. In short, the       complaints about ``deadlocks'' come from the regulatory       activists who haven't gotten their way. They now seek to       change the bipartisan nature of the Commission, to smooth the       path for agency adoption of the more expansive regulations       they have unsuccessfully sought for years. Congress has       consistently declined to adopt those expansive objectives.        Similarly, in rule-making, the FEC's bipartisan structure       is a beneficial feature, not a defect. It demands that       commissioners work to reach consensus and compromise on       measures to achieve bipartisan support. If Congress wanted to       destroy confidence in the fairness of American elections, it       is hard to imagine a better first step than to eviscerate the       FEC's bipartisan structure.        But Title VI goes further. First, it allows the Chair, who       is appointed on a partisan basis by the President, to hire       and fire the FEC's General Counsel, a statutory position,       with the support of just two commissioners. Thus, this       crucial enforcement position can be filled with no bipartisan       agreement, as the Chair, the other commissioner from that       party, and an ``independent'' member appointed by a President       of the Chair's party, could make the decision. Further, it       places sole authority to hire or fire the Commission's Staff       Director, also a statutory position, in the hands of the FEC       Chair, not even requiring the support of an independent       commissioner. The Staff Director oversees the Commission's       Auditing, Reports Analysis, Administrative Fines, and       Alternative Dispute Resolution processes, which combined       handle far more enforcement matters than the Office of       General Counsel. Both the appearance and reality of       bipartisanship in enforcement is fundamental to the FEC's       success, and Title VI destroys both.        The FPA also makes startling changes in the FEC's       enforcement processes, perhaps no more so than in Sec. 6004       of Title VI. That section provides that, in the event the       Commission, after reviewing or investigating a complaint,       finds the respondent candidate, campaign, or other entity did       not violate the law, the complainant may sue in federal  [[Page H989]]       court. There, the matter will be reviewed de novo, with no       deference to the Commission's findings of law or fact. If,       however, the Commission finds that the respondent did violate       the law, and the respondent seeks to contest those findings       in court, the Commission's rulings will be afforded the       traditional deference given to administrative agencies by       courts of law. In short, while the American justice system       has traditionally erred in favor of the accused, so as to       protect the innocent and unjustly convicted, the FPA turns       the formula on its head, explicitly biasing the judicial       review process in favor of findings of guilt against       candidates, campaigns, and other defendants.        Furthermore, Section 6004 allows for the appointed General       Counsel to launch investigations and even determine matters       of guilt or innocence without any majority vote of the       Commission. It does this by sharply limiting the time the       commissioners have to consider a matter, and then       substituting the General Counsel's verdict for a vote of the       Commission.        Other changes in Title VI to the Commission's structure,       enforcement, and regulatory processes are similarly ill-      conceived.        In addition to our concerns about Title VI, the FPA also       includes a number of troubling, substantive changes to       campaign finance law. Most notably, we reiterate the concerns       previously expressed in 2010 by many of the signatories below       regarding the ``DISCLOSE Act,'' included in Title IV,       Subtitle B. The DISCLOSE Act is unnecessary, burdensome, and       would stifle constitutionally protected political speech.        Similarly, the ``Stand by Every Ad Act'' included in Title       IV, Subtitle D would make disclaimer regulation more complex,       have a chilling effect on speech, and provide little or no       information that is not already available to the public under       the Federal Election Campaign Act (``FECA'') and existing       Commission regulations. Indeed, in many cases, it would       mislead the public as to the sources of an ad's funding.        Subtitles F and G of Title IV aim to affirmatively clear       the way for the Internal Revenue Service (``IRS'') and the       Securities and Exchange Commission to become involved in       campaign finance regulation. This is contrary to the design       of the FECA, which gives the FEC primary civil enforcement       responsibilities and exclusive authority for administering       and interpreting the Act. These other agencies do not have       expertise in campaign finance law. Attempting to use the IRS       for campaign enforcement led to the scandal of 2013, which       tarnished that agency's reputation and public confidence in       its operations. Inviting other non-expert agencies into       campaign finance enforcement would create a likelihood of       inconsistent interpretations and applications of the laws and       increase the complexity of a regulatory system already famous       for its intricacy.        Based on our collective decades of experience at the FEC,       we believe that these, and several other provisions of Titles       IV and VI not specifically addressed here, would complicate       the law and hinder grassroots political speech and activism,       with little or no benefit to public accountability,       transparency, understanding of public policy, or reduction in       corruption.        Given these concerns, we are disturbed by recent news       reports that House Leadership plans to bring H.R. 1 directly       to the floor, bypassing committee consideration. We urge       members of Congress in both chambers to deliberately and       carefully consider this complex, nearly 800-page legislation,       with special attention paid to the bill's harmful impact on       First Amendment speech and association rights.        Most importantly, we believe that Title VI, by shifting the       Commission from a bipartisan, six-member body to a five-      member body subject to partisan control, would be highly       detrimental to the agency's credibility. It would lead to       more partisanship in enforcement and in regulatory matters,       shattering public confidence in the decisions of the FEC. The       Commission depends on bipartisan support and universal regard       for the fairness of its actions. The FPA frustrates these       goals with likely ruinous effect on our political system.        Thomas J. Josefiak, (1985-1991); Darryl R. Wold, (1998-      2002); David M.

Crisis for the VOCA Crime Victims Fund                                  The Basics          Fact: The Victim of Crime Act's (VOCA) Crime Victims Fund       (CVF) is a non-taxpayer source of funding that supports       thousands of crime victims services providers serving       millions of victims of crime annually and is funded by       monetary penalties associated with federal criminal       convictions.        Fact: Deposits fluctuate annually based on the cases that       the Department of Justice successfully prosecutes.        Fact: Appropriators decide how much to release from the CVF       every year. Statutorily, this money funds specific DOJ       programs and state victim assistance grants and supplements       state victim compensation funds.        Fact: It is important to have money in the CVF to provide a       buffer for lean years. Unfortunately, if there are too many       lean years in a row, the CVF will not be able to provide that       buffer. That is the situation we are currently facing.                    Lower Deposits Lead to Cuts in Grants         Fact: Deposits into the CVF are historically low. Deposits       the last three years have been $445 million, $495 million and       $503 million respectively--deposits have not been this low       since 2003. This decrease is caused in part by an increase in       the use of deferred prosecution and non-prosecution       agreements, the monetary penalties associated with which are       deposited into the General Treasury rather than the Crime       Victims Fund.        Fact: Lower deposits lead to lower releases. Appropriators       are justly cautious about depleting the CVF, and they are       reluctant to dip too deeply into the buffer the CVF provides,       particularly if they do not see indications that the CVF will       be replenished.        Fact: The amount coming off the top for non-victim service       grants is somewhat static, which means that the cuts to the       annual VOCA release disproportionately cut victim service       grants. Thus, the percentage cut to victim service grants is       larger than the percentage cut to the VOCA release.        Fact: State grants decreased in both FY'19 and FY'20,       reflecting the decreased deposits. The Senate bill cuts these       further. If the release was to reflect deposits without       drawing down the balance in the CVF to dangerously low       levels, assuming no transfers to fund other grants, victim       assistance grants to the states could be cut to as little as       approximately $200 million annually, only 10% of what went       out in FY'20.                                  The Impact         Fact: States are experiencing enormous cuts to their       awards. See table below.        Fact: Every state is at a different place in their grant       cycles. Some subgrantees have already seen cuts (ex. Ohio),       and some will see them in the next few years.        Fact: CACs receive between $150 and $200 million in VOCA       dollars annually, which is the largest single source of       funding for these programs. The cost of serving the more than       371,000 children they helped last year was $614 million. If       programs lose 70% of their funding, this would leave a $140       million deficit, equating to about 84,450 children.        Fact: Victim services in Ohio lost $55 million in 2020.       Rape crisis programs specifically lost over $7.5 million,       with individual programs losing between 32% and 57% (as well       as three 100% cuts) of VOCA funds. This will essentially cut       services in half, reducing survivor access to pre-2000       levels.                                 The Solution         Increase deposits into the Crime Victims Fund by depositing       monetary penalties associated with deferred prosecution and       non-prosecution agreements into the CVF as well as monetary       penalties associated with convictions.        For more information about the problem and the solution,       see this letter to Congress, signed by over 1,480 national,       state, tribal, and local organizations and government       agencies. The 56 State and Territorial Attorneys General also       sent a letter to Congress, addressing some of these same       issues.     Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from California (Mr. McCarthy). Hopefully, he will soon be  the majority leader or actually the Speaker of the House. He is not  part of that California corruption I mentioned earlier.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes  to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Jordan), my good friend and the ranking  member of the Judiciary Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Alabama (Mr. Palmer), the chair of the Republican Policy  Committee and my good friend.    Madam Speaker, you can tell we have got  some dedicated Members of Congress here to debate this bill.   Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New York (Mr.  Garbarino), my great friend and one of the newest Members of Congress.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from California (Mrs. Steel), my good friend and another  freshman Member of our historic freshman class.    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 15  seconds to the gentlewoman from California (Mrs. Steel).    Madam Speaker, may I inquire as to how  much time is remaining?    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, vote ``no'' on this disastrous piece of legislation.  Obviously, the timekeeper didn't keep the time right; I should have  more.    Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, we have so much  opposition on our side to this bill. I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Carter), my good friend, since we ran out  of debate time on general debate.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes  to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Gonzalez), my good friend, who, in  spite of once being an Ohio State Buckeye and an Indianapolis Colt, it  took him coming to Congress to finally win a football championship.    The gentleman is right. We really did  enjoy having him on that bipartisan congressional football championship  team.   Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman from  Oklahoma (Mrs. Bice), another star member of this freshman class.    It is interesting that during this same  debate 2 years ago, we had many in the majority come talk about this  bill. I would say they must feel a little bit different this time.   Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from Wisconsin  (Mr. Fitzgerald), another mediocre--I mean, a star freshman of our  historic class and my good friend.    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 15  seconds to the gentleman from Wisconsin.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, here we are again with more Federal election mandates  that the majority would impose on our States and localities. Article I,  Section 4 of the Constitution gives States the primary authority to set  the ``times, places, and manner of holding elections for Senators and  Representatives.''   Congress' role in this space is purely secondary and reserved only  for correcting highly significant and substantial deficiencies. We saw  nothing in 2020 that would rise to the level of a complete and total  nationalization of our election system.   To give you some sense of the level of control the majority feels it  should exert over our elections, amendments in this en bloc would  mandate even the positioning of ballot drop boxes and polling  locations. It would also mandate voters' requests for absentee ballots  and the methods used for recruiting poll workers.   The underlying bill would require States to provide 15 days of early  voting at 10 hours a day, even in States that conduct their elections  completely by mail.   The underlying bill would regulate the amount of time a voter could  wait in line to vote. Here is the deal: No one wants any voter to wait  in a long line to vote, but setting aside the constitutional issues for  a second, do we really think this body can make a one-size-fits-all  decision that works for the unique people who live in each of our  diverse 50 States?   This provision, coupled with the bill's private right of action,  would simply set up a stopwatch stakeout at polling locations for  ambulance-chasing trial attorneys.   States run elections in this country. I urge each of my colleagues to  speak with their State's secretary of state or chief election officials  and local election officials. Learn from the people who actually  administer elections. State and local election administrators know best  the needs of their voting population.   I speak with secretaries of state from across the country regularly  to keep up to date on election issues. Just last week, at the only  hearing held in this Congress on the underlying bill, the minority  called the only witness who had even ever administered an election. So  I know many of my colleagues could benefit from learning more about  their State's election processes.   For these reasons, I urge a ``no'' vote on these amendments and the  underlying bill.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I see we have a new  clock watcher. How much time do we have remaining?    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, we can't say much more about how bad this bill is.  Just the distortions, the mistruths, and just obvious malicious errors  coming from the majority about what this bill does is frustrating.   Last Congress, when this bill was introduced, this bill started  funding Members of Congress' campaigns with taxpayer dollars. And back  then, under the 2018 calculations, every Member of Congress was only  eligible to get about $4 million added to their campaign accounts.   Now, if you look at the top 20, 11 Democrats make up the top 20, and  9 Republicans, in disbursements over the 2020 cycle. Every single  Member of this body is eligible through the 6-to-1 matching program to  get $7.2 million.   No matter what Speaker Pelosi says, no matter what the majority  says--they can tell you it is not true--read the bill. It is in the  bill.   They are going to say, well, it is not taxpayer dollars. Let me go  through the process. It is corporate money, corporate dollars that we  cannot get in our campaigns right now that is then taken from  corporations who, in their name, are bad actors.    Remember, Congress sets the level of fines. And a lot of these fines  already go to good causes, like crime victim funds, rape crisis  centers. They are going to get shortchanged because that  [[Page H997]]  money is taken from corporate fines that are corporate dollars  laundered through the Federal Government.   This money comes out as public money, taxpayer dollars, and then it  is given directly to Members of Congress' campaigns.   Madam Speaker, a vote for this bill is a vote for you, yourself, $7.2  million in your own campaign.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have an amendment at the  desk.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, the need for this amendment is another example of this  bill not being updated from last year.   We have made huge efforts on cyber issues and successfully had an  election year this year with no foreign interference. This is in large  part due to the efforts of DHS and the Election Assistance Commission.  I even took part this summer in a tabletop exercise to prepare for  cyberattacks.   Mr. Speaker, if we had considered this bill in committee, we could  have talked about our success in this area during the last election.  This is another example of the Democrats not knowing what is in their  legislation and rolling out their standard bill without a thoughtful  review.   Absolutely no one wants foreign interference in our elections.   Mr. Speaker, absolutely no one wants foreign interference in our  elections, but the last thing we need to do is create a commission with  another layer of bureaucracy when we have programs in place that have  been successful for our local election officials. It is because of some  great work by CISA that we should be recognized.   Mr. Speaker, finally, this amendment would violate separation of  powers and attempt to control the judicial branch, threatening our  independent courts. It is disappointing that this is the only amendment  of mine and the other Republican members of the committee that the  majority Democrats allowed through.   We submitted 25 amendments to restore the ability to run our  elections to the States and localities that this bill takes away;  eliminate the fund to publicly finance campaigns using corporate  dollars and instead use that money for pandemic relief for the American  people; prevent sitting Members of Congress' campaigns from benefiting  from this bill; protect Americans' First Amendment right, without fear  of retaliation from the Federal Government; and the list goes on and  on.   Mr. Speaker, unfortunately, the majority did not allow these  amendments to come to the floor. While I urge passage of this  amendment, for those reasons and many more, I urge a ``no'' vote on the  underlying legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    May I inquire as to how much time I  have remaining.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, one of the big problems that I see in this election  arena is a bill that 2 years ago was written with the assistance of  special interests before we were even sworn in to the 116th Congress.  It was announced and put forward with every member of the majority  signing on as cosponsors the day we were all sworn in.   That is not the process that the Democratic majority promised the  American people when they gave my colleagues the privilege to serve in  this majority.   Mr. Speaker, here we go again. It is like Groundhog Day. Instead of  introducing the same bill, they made some changes, which is great.  Still, this is a problem of the nationalization of our elections. Also,  it limits free speech.   There was no negotiation with us, no markup in our committee, no  ability for us to have a voice.   Mr. Speaker, to top it off, none of us in the minority want any  campaign dollars coming from corporations that are then laundered and  then made into public funds through the Federal Government and then put  in their own campaigns. We don't want one dollar, let alone the limit  now of $7.2 million that each and every person in this institution  would be eligible to get into our own campaigns. That is not campaign  finance reform. That is not what my constituents want. That is the  furthest thing from what the minority wants.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on  this amendment. It is a commonsense amendment that is going to protect  the bipartisan work that our officials have done to protect Americans'  elections and address cybersecurity issues and foreign interference.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition at  this point in time.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Iowa (Mrs.  Hinson), another star of the historic diverse class of new freshmen.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to  the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Hice), the subcommittee chair that has  oversight of elections on the Oversight Committee.    Mr. Speaker, can I inquire again how  much time is remaining? We have a lot of folks who want to talk.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from Tennessee (Mrs. Harshbarger), a member of this  historic freshman class.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Gohmert), I may live to regret it, but I will  do it anyway, my good friend.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from California (Mr. LaMalfa), who was my fellow classmate in  the 113th Congress.    Mr. Speaker, I keep bringing up our  historic freshman class. I have got another member of that historic  freshman class who, frankly, has made history, too, in her short time  here.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the gentlewoman from Georgia (Mrs.  Greene).    Mr. Speaker, may I ask how much time is  remaining?    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance  of my time to close.   Two minutes to solve the problems of this bill clearly are not  enough.   Mr. Speaker, the amendments in this bloc continue the Democrats'  efforts to attack our constitutional system by nationalizing our  elections and attacking the First Amendment. Even the Speaker herself  said earlier on the floor that this body should consider altering the  First Amendment. That is unbelievable.    Mr. Speaker, as my friend, Mr. Loudermilk, highlighted earlier, any  action by Congress in this space must be limited to correcting highly  significant and substantial deficiencies.   I had teams out in the field working under our constitutional  authority, as the House of Representatives, as official election  observers from October through February, to investigate and observe the  last election. We saw that there were certainly many bumps in the road  and policy changes that many States should consider to run better  elections. That is without a doubt. But there was nothing in 2020 that  rose to the level of nationalizing our election system. These are State  issues, and Congress--this body--must not act unconstitutionally in  this space.   Further, these amendments would also threaten free speech and punish  those who work to comply with the law with even larger amounts of  paperwork simply to provide information already required by law. I see  absolutely no reason for duplication in the Federal Government. It is  big enough as it is.   Mr. Speaker, for these reasons, I urge rejection of these amendments,  which would continue the majority's push to nationalize our elections  and centralize their administration in Washington, D.C., and they will  continue to be allowed to forward their full frontal attack on the  First Amendment, just as the Speaker offered earlier today on this  floor.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
