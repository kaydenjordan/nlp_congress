 Mr. Speaker, when the pandemic closed schools and left  millions of children without meals they needed, our government took  action. Emergency waivers eliminated income caps and gave meal  providers flexibility in delivering food.   Even now, with schools reopened, these waivers are getting healthy  meals to children without burying families under mountains of  paperwork, but these provisions are set to expire on June 30.   As 97 percent of meal providers like schools struggle to pay soaring  food prices, these protections should be strengthened, not stopped.   This year, California became the first State to provide free meals to  any student. Offering no-cost meals to everyone, regardless of income,  helps resources reach the kids who need them most.   This will also help California's kids in schools perform better. Free  meals contribute to better attendance, fewer nurse visits, and higher  test scores. California's universal meal program will benefit schools  and families. The Nation should follow our example.                       Taking Action on Climate Change     Mr. Speaker, the greater our delay in taking action on  climate change, the higher the price tag will be for families and our  economy.   Last week, Californians suffered through an intense heat wave.  Temperatures went over 100 degrees in parts of our State. That is bad  for public health and bad for our economy.   A study by the Atlantic Council estimates that the total economic  loss from excessive heat is at least $100 billion annually. They also  estimate that this loss could double by 2030 and quintuple by 2050 if  we don't take climate action.   Simply put, the fiscally responsible thing to do is for Congress to  act quickly to prevent further losses. Taking climate action will lower  and stabilize costs for families.   High temperatures aren't just bad for human health. They are bad for  our economy. Heat waves push prices for electricity higher, costing us  billions. We should not leave families in California and across the  country to figure out their budgets while Washington figures out  climate change.   The need for climate change is urgent, not just for our planet, but  also for our pocketbooks.                             PTSD Awareness Month     Mr. Speaker, our Nation is failing people with post- traumatic stress disorder. During June, PTSD Awareness Month, we must  commit to doing better.   Mental health affects many across our Nation, but I rise today to  shine light on the brave young people dealing with PTSD.   Too many Americans, including many with PTSD, go without the mental  healthcare they need because their insurance won't cover it. I wrote a  bill, which is now Federal law, to crack down on insurance companies  that break the rules and refuse to cover mental health the same way  they cover physical health. I am proud the House is considering  additional proposals I have worked on to strengthen the enforcement of  protections for mental health coverage.   When a child experiences a traumatic event, like emotional or sexual  abuse, it harms their emotional, social, and cognitive development.  These adverse childhood experiences are linked to substance use  disorder, chronic health issues, and PTSD.   We cannot let trauma or related challenges hold students back from  getting high quality educations. The effect of these experiences  doesn't end when children leave their homes for college. They bleed  into their daily lives, including in the classroom.   I am proud to introduce legislation, the Student Mental Health Rights  Act, which would direct the Department of Education to study mental  health, issue guidance to help schools level the playing field, and  support students in overcoming their mental health challenges so they  can complete their schooling. Our students need this help.   For Americans with PTSD of all ages, awareness is not enough. They  need action.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, our Nation's populations of fish and  wildlife are dwindling. To save threatened and endangered species, we  need the bipartisan Recovering America's Wildlife Act which will boost  science-based conservation efforts.   The United Nations has warned the world that human actions will  continue to drive plant and animal species to extinction if we do not  act. In my home State of California, native species have declined by 20  percent, and over 600 species risk extinction.   As a member of the House of Representatives Natural Resources  Committee, I have learned from scientists and advocacy groups that we  need dedicated funding to recover and sustain healthy populations of  threatened and endangered species.   Importantly, protecting these species is good for our economy.  Wildlife-focused recreation generates $140 billion annually. The  Recovering America's Wildlife Act will sustain biodiversity, create  jobs, and protect our planet.                            ____________________
