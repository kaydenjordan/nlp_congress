 Mr. Speaker, I stood here several weeks ago to speak in  support of the original House-passed tax reform bill. Since then, as a  member of the conference committee, I have participated in the process  of strengthening this bill and making it even more transformative. That  is why I continue to stand in strong support of the bill and conference  report we will be voting on today.   Washington's special interests have distorted business decisions for  too long, and we cannot afford to wait any longer to reform our broken  Tax Code.   Should we fail to act now, businesses will continue to leave the  United States for tax purposes, taking thousands of good-paying jobs-- American jobs--with them. Our small businesses will continue to suffer  the damaging effects of a bewildering and punitive Tax Code that gives  unfair advantages to their larger, well-connected competitors.   But all this will change if we pass this bill.   For years, I have advocated for full and immediate expensing, which  will allow businesses of all sizes to write off costs immediately. This  bill will provide full expensing, which is one of the many progrowth  pieces to this legislation. I am confident my colleagues will soon see  the tremendous effect of full expensing and make the important decision  to extend it before it expires.   Mr. Speaker, I stand here with my colleagues on an historic day in  support of one of the most dramatic reform bills to come before this  body since I came to Congress. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act simplifies the  Code, grows the economy, and allows for strong business investment.   I have said before that I will not accept the status quo of our  broken Tax Code or a minimal reform that merely adjusts rates. Instead,  we must transform the Code into a system that is simpler and fairer and  that encourages economic growth instead of suppressing it. That is what  this bill does, and that is why I strongly support its passage.
