 Madam President, the Senate must determine whether to  remove a President duly elected by the people. A decision of such  magnitude deserves, first, full consideration of the procedures;  second, the merits of the charges; and third, the ramifications removal  would have on our Republic.   The Framers of the Constitution granted the House of Representatives  impeachment powers yet cautioned against using that power unless  absolutely necessary. Impeachment negates an election in which  Americans choose their leader. If substantial numbers of Americans  disagree with removing the President, removal damages civic society. It  follows that the House should conduct thorough and complete  investigations, even if time-consuming, before impeaching.   A thorough investigation educates Americans that a President should  be impeached and removed. Failing to convince the people invites anger  towards, disdain for, and abandonment of the democratic process.   The Framers also required a two-thirds Senate majority for removal to  prevent partisanship, so that removal only occurs after the House  convinces its own Members, the Senate, and the American people. The  Watergate investigation, for example, convinced Americans that  President Nixon committed crimes, forcing his resignation with  overwhelming support for removal in the House and the Senate.   In the case against President Trump, the House declined to call  witnesses it felt relevant, arguing that the courts would take too long  and the President was an imminent threat to our Republic. House  managers blamed legal resistance from the administration and witnesses.  For example, Dr. Charles Kupperman threatened to sue. A congressional  committee afraid of being sued while claiming to be fearlessly pursuing  truth for the good of the country rings hollow. It also rang hollow  when Adam Schiff said that we could not wait for the next election for  voters to decide President Trump's fate after Speaker Nancy Pelosi held  the articles for 37 days. That decision smacks of partisan political  motivations.   The partisanship the Founders warned against was reflected in the  House vote with the only bipartisan votes being against impeachment.  House Managers Schiff, Nadler, and Lofgren once said that party-line  impeachment would divide the Nation. They never explained why their  opinions changed.   The role of the Senate, though, is to judge the House's evidence.  House managers stated their case was ``overwhelming'' and  ``compelling.'' Having not pursued further witness testimony in  building their case, the House managers demanded the Senate call  witnesses the House did not call.   Additional witnesses, however, would not have changed material facts,  but allowing the House to poorly develop a case, sacrificing  thoroughness for political timing, would have forever changed the  dynamic of the Chambers respective to the role of each in the  impeachment process. Should the Senate acquiesce in this manipulation  of the process, it would welcome the House to use impeachment as a  political weapon, whatever the merits of its case.   I have been speaking of procedure. I want to emphasize that procedure  matters. Justice Frankfurter once wrote: ``The history of liberty has  largely been the history of the observance of procedural safeguards.''  If the appropriate use of impeachment is to be preserved, procedural  safeguards must be observed.   Moving now to charges, in article II, House managers argued the  President obstructed Congress by acting on the advice of legal counsel  to resist subpoenas. The judiciary resolves disputes between the  executive and legislative branches. The House should have exhausted  judicial remedies before bringing this charge. I shall vote against  article II.   On article I, abuse of power, three issues must be addressed: one,  the legal standard of guilt by which to judge the President; two,  whether the President committed a crime; and if so, three, whether that  crime warrants removal from office.  [[Page S817]]    First, the standard of guilt was never established. Legal standards  for conviction vary from the lower--more probable than not--threshold  to the higher, which is beyond a reasonable doubt, which is used in  criminal cases.   Since House managers charged ``something akin'' to a crime, ``beyond  a reasonable doubt'' seems most appropriate, the higher threshold. As  Senator Jay Rockefeller stated during President Clinton's impeachment,  beyond a reasonable doubt ``means that it is proven to a moral  certainty, that the case is clear, that the case is concise.''   Second, House managers allege that the President held military aid to  Ukraine to leverage an investigation into former Vice President Biden  as a quid pro quo, although they did not charge President Trump with  the crime of requiring a quid pro quo or bribery. The President's  defense team cast reasonable doubt on this allegation.   For example, regarding the July 25 phone call, which was reported by  the whistleblower and which triggered the House impeachment  proceedings, the President raised the issue of corruption in Ukraine.  President Trump has always been skeptical of foreign aid and especially  when he thinks it is wasted. Hunter Biden was mentioned, but no  connection was made with the release of aid to Ukraine.   Other defense arguments included that Ambassador Kurt Volker denied a  connection between aid and corruption investigations; President  Zelensky and Ukrainian officials denied feeling pressure; and President  Trump denied a quid pro quo to Ambassador Sondland and told Senator Ron  Johnson, when asked if there was some sort of arrangement, ``No way. I  would never do that.''   Both aid to Ukraine was released before the statutory deadline and a  meeting between Presidents Trump and Zelensky occurred without an  announced investigation.   It is also important to note that the release of aid on September 11  followed new Ukrainian anti-corruption measures, which included  swearing in a reformed Parliament and installing a new prosecutor  general--August 29--and the newly established High Anti-Corruption  Court meeting for the first time--September 5.   The third issue regarding article I, abuse of power, is that the term  is a nebulous one which does not define a specific crime. Contrast this  with the impeachment of President Nixon when the House drafted an  Article of Impeachment alleging abuse of power which enumerated five  specific criminal and noncriminal offenses against President Nixon.   The Constitution speaks of treason, bribery, or other high crimes and  misdemeanors. Because high crimes and misdemeanors are not specifically  defined, it is reasonable to assume that the Framers meant for  impeachment to occur only if a crime approached levels as severe as  treason and bribery.   Since the House managers allege President Trump committed something  ``akin to a crime,'' in deciding whether abuse of power is a high crime  or misdemeanor, the prudent decision is to apply the principle of  lenity. This principle, relied upon by Supreme Court Justice Marshall  and Justice Frankfurter, says that if a law is ambiguous, it is better  to narrowly interpret the words of a law in favor of the defendant.   Although the preceding discussion finds that the House managers  failed to prove their case beyond a shadow of a doubt, failed to define  the crime, thereby invoking the principle of lenity, it is still a  question that if a crime was committed, was it an impeachable crime?   In 1998, then-Democratic Congressman Ed Markey argued that even  though President Clinton, as chief law enforcement officer of the land,  lied under oath, the crime was not impeachable. The Senate agreed,  establishing the precedent that to remove a President, the crime must  reach a high threshold of severity. The allegation against President  Trump was not proven beyond a reasonable doubt, and it does not meet  that high threshold.   I shall vote against article I.   I end by speaking of the ramifications for our Republic. In 1998,  then-Congressman Chuck Schumer said of the Clinton impeachment:         I suspect history will show that we have lowered the bar on       impeachment so much, we have broken the seal on this extreme       penalty so cavalierly that it will be used as a routine tool       to fight political battles. My fear is that when a Republican       wins the White House, Democrats will demand payback.    Mr. Schumer was a prophet.   This must stop.   With that, I yield.
