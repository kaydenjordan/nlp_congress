 Mr. Speaker, on March 21, our country and the world  celebrated World Down Syndrome Awareness Day.   This afternoon, I am happy to lead my colleagues in recognizing this  important day and all of the contributions individuals with Down  syndrome make each day to families, businesses, schools, and  communities. From brothers and sisters to employees and businessowners,  to artists and models, people with Down syndrome have an incredible  impact on every part of society. They deserve our support,  understanding, and full acceptance.   Thankfully, there are many groups and programs that have made it  their mission to support individuals with Down syndrome and their  families.   As Kansas State treasurer, I advocated for passage of the Federal  ABLE Act and led the effort to implement it in Kansas.   It is kind of one of those things that, several years ago, I didn't  necessarily expect that I was going to be standing here today; so I was  going through the process of how do we lobby, how do we make sure that  a good program gets passed through the Federal legislative process that  benefits so many people, and then having to take that initiative in my  home State of Kansas and work through the legislature and making sure  that we implemented it to help people's quality of life and enable them  to live the lives that they wanted to live and make it more beneficial  for them.   This important law created tax-free savings accounts for individuals  with disabilities to cover expenses like healthcare, education,  housing, and transportation. It is important for parents raising a  child to be able to help provide their care.   Obviously, the concern on the part of parents is that, over years,  particularly as the parents age, they want to make sure that their  children, in some cases when they are in their adult life, are able to  enjoy the life that they want and the life that they deserve. A program  like ABLE is able to help make that dream come true.   These programs are similar to the 529 college savings programs,  health savings accounts, and individual retirement accounts. The ABLE  accounts  [[Page H2823]]  give people with Down syndrome and other disabilities the opportunities  to live the life they deserve.   The Kansas ABLE Act went into effect in January 2017. I was proud to  be part of that effort because it is the right thing to do.   In Congress, I have been humbled to work with organizations like the  National Down Syndrome Society to build upon the progress of the ABLE  Act. Last year, I was honored to receive the 2018 National Down  Syndrome Society Impact Award and look forward to supporting the  mission in this Congress.   This year, I am also honored to be on the honorary committee for the  AcceptAbility Gala, hosted by the Global Down Syndrome Foundation, an  annual event in Washington, D.C., that supports lifesaving research and  medical care for children and adults with Down syndrome.   Back home in Kansas, I am also inspired by groups like the Arc of  Sedgwick County, which supports individuals living with intellectual  and developmental disabilities, including Down syndrome.   Just as each of these groups, among numerous others, supports those  with Down syndrome, it is my hope that, in Congress, we can do the same  thing.   Mr. Speaker, I look forward to discussing this more today, but, at  this time, I am happy to yield to the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr.  Stauber).    Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Stauber for those  comments.   Mr. Speaker, it is important for us, as Representatives, to actually  stand up for what we think is important. Obviously, as parents, we all  care about our children. We want to make sure they get the best  opportunities that they can, and, as elected Representatives, one of  the reasons I ran for office was to make sure that we could have an  impact and make sure that we could make a difference in people's lives.   When I look at the role of the Federal Government, one of the things  that is most important for us is making sure that we can help those  individuals live out the life that is embedded in our Constitution and  Declaration of Independence and having the right to life, liberty, and  the pursuit of happiness, people having that opportunity to live and  enjoy all the blessings of this great country.    We can talk a lot about different issues, and there are, obviously,  lots of us here in the Halls of Congress who want to talk about some of  those issues. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr.  Hill), my good friend, who wants to weigh in on this subject as well.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr.  Hill).   It is tremendous to be able to work with representatives like him  that have a goal to focus on: how do we make life better? How do we  provide opportunities for individuals?   You touched on a sad part in society today where so many people seem  to think that it is right that just because of some particular trait  that the parents don't necessarily like, that they are able to kill  individuals because of that through abortion.  [[Page H2824]]    When we are talking about Down syndrome and awareness of that, you  know, it is a sad fact that we have got to address this issue. We have  got to address that extreme discrimination that some individuals that  want to impress upon those people who may have Down syndrome even  before they have a chance to live a life.   In the United States, two-thirds--67 percent--of babies diagnosed  with Down syndrome while in the womb are aborted.   In Europe, it is even worse. In France, the rate is 77 percent. In  Denmark, it is 98 percent. And in Iceland, it is nearly 100 percent,  where late-term abortions are allowed if the baby has a deformity,  which includes Down syndrome, to quote a CBS News article.   In a society where Down syndrome individuals can have a wonderful  quality of life and pursue their dreams, this discrimination needs to  be brought to light.   We live during a time when there is so much medical innovation, so  many opportunities, so many brilliant things that our doctors are  developing, we need to make sure that we capitalize on that innovation,  make sure that we allow people the opportunity to live a full life and  live the opportunities that they enjoy.   This innovation, unfortunately, has been used by individuals to  determine the sex, determine if the child is healthy, determine if the  child has certain traits; and in some cases, for positive reasons, to  determine whether there is some medical necessity to operate while in  the womb to make sure that that individual--that child--enjoys quality  of life.   However, we need to make sure that that testing process never gets  corrupted, never gets used in a discriminatory way, and it is never  used to justify abortion.   It is a sad fact that we are seeing so many things being talked about  in the abortion arena nowadays, and so many people beating that drum.   We have got to stand up, you know, in our country. We want to be able  to stand up for people's rights and we want to be able to stand up for  the opportunities for babies to live and have the opportunity to live a  life that we all will enjoy as well.   I now yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Babin), my fellow  colleague, the opportunity to speak and talk about this very important  issue.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Babin, and I  appreciate those words.   Mr. Speaker, we, as fellow colleagues, have such an important role  trying to work on how we bring forth those American principles and  opportunities for everybody.   In recent months, we have seen politicians from States around the  country embrace late-term abortions and openly discuss infanticide.  Individuals with Down syndrome would be among the most severely  impacted by these tragic policies.   To help respond to that, my colleagues and I have repeatedly called  to bring forward the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act to  the floor for a vote.   This straightforward bill would require healthcare practitioners to  give the same care to a child who has survived a botched abortion just  as they would any other newborn child.   Apparently, the bill has 182 cosponsors.   Unfortunately, a vote on the bill has been blocked 21 times now by  the majority.   However, as we rise to commemorate World Down Syndrome Day, I call on  my colleagues to consider this bill and any other one that would  protect life and support those with Down syndrome.   There are 250,000 people in America with Down syndrome. They live  healthy, productive, happy lives, just like you and I do, and want to  have the same hopes and dreams and goals.   We need more awareness of what a diagnosis of Down syndrome really  means. It means that a child simply has an extra chromosome and that  nothing else about their life is different from you or me.   They have so much to contribute to this world, and they deserve that  chance.   Last year, I had the chance to meet David Egan. David is a fellow  working for the National Down Syndrome Society, and previously worked  for the House Ways and Means Committee.   When I met him, he told me how much he wanted to help others with  Down syndrome accomplish anything they wanted to do, just as he has  done in his own life and career.   I am inspired by people like David, and I want to thank my colleagues  who join me today for this Special Order recognizing World Down  Syndrome Day.   Mr. Speaker, I look forward to working with Congress to support those  with Down syndrome, and with that, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 3 o'clock and 54 minutes  p.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until tomorrow,  Wednesday, March 27, 2019, at 10 a.m. for morning-hour debate.                            ____________________
