 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the subject of my Special Order.    Madam Speaker, together with President Biden, this  country has already created 5.6 million jobs this year alone. Growth is  up, wages are up, and unemployment is at a figure that is at a low of a  couple of generations at this point.   And in the middle of all of this, Democrats had the temerity to enact  the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, a historic  occasion.   The infrastructure law the Democrats delivered will create millions  more good-paying jobs--American jobs, union jobs, family-sustaining  jobs, jobs that cannot be outsourced or sent offshore.   The bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act that was signed  into law the week before last makes the largest Federal investment in  public transit ever. It makes the largest Federal investment in  passenger rail since the creation of Amtrak. It makes the single  largest dedicated bridge investment since the construction of the  Interstate Highway System. It makes the largest investment in clean  drinking water and wastewater infrastructure in American history. It  ensures  [[Page H6846]]  that every American has access to reliable high-speed internet. It  helps tackle the climate crisis by making the largest investment in  clean energy transmission and electric vehicle infrastructure in  history.   Madam Speaker, rebuilding our infrastructure means shoring up our  American middle class. It means jobs, jobs, jobs, jobs, and more jobs.  It means, maybe most importantly to a lot of us, honoring the work and  the sacrifices of the Greatest Generation, those folks that Tom Brokaw  called the Greatest Generation. They came back from World War II, from  defeating fascism in the Pacific and the Atlantic, and they came back  after making all of those sacrifices, suffering all of those hardships  and deprivations and what did they do? They immediately set to work  sacrificing more for their children and their grandchildren, for us.  They sacrificed for us, and they didn't stop sacrificing.                            ____________________
