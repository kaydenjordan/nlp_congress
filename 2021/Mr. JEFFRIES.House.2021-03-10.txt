 Mr. Speaker, the COVID-19 pandemic is a once-in-a- century crisis. It requires a once-in-a-century comprehensive,  compassionate, and continuing congressional response. That is what the  American Rescue Plan is all about.   More than 500,000 Americans have died. Hundreds of thousands of  businesses have closed. Almost 30 million Americans have been infected  by the coronavirus. Tens of millions of Americans are dealing with  unemployment, food insecurity, or are on the brink of homelessness.                                time  1045    So much pain, suffering, and death, and our Republican colleagues  want us to do nothing? What is wrong with them?   We are going to act with the fierce urgency of now. We will crush the  virus. We will provide direct relief to everyday Americans who are  struggling. We will revive the economy. We will send the American  Rescue Plan to President Biden's desk. We will build back better for  the people. Help is on the way.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished chair for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, the right to bear arms is an important part of the  constitutional fabric of this country, but it is  [[Page H1299]]  not without limits. And the notion that America has 4 percent of the  world's population but 40 percent of the world's guns and a  disproportionately high amount of homicides and suicides by guns should  shock the conscience of every single person in this Chamber.   Mass shooting after mass shooting after mass shooting, and yet we  haven't acted to protect the health, safety, and well-being of the  American people.   That is why H.R. 8 is so significant. Universal criminal background  check legislation is reasonable under the circumstances given the  tragedies that we confront.   House Democrats will not just talk about it. We are about it. That is  why we will pass H.R. 8, and now we have a Senate and a President who  will ultimately get it over the finish line. Vote ``yes'' on this  lifesaving legislation.
