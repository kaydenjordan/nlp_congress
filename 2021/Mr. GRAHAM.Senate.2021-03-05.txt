 Mr. President, a vote-arama is upon us. Stay hydrated.  Try to keep good cheer. We are going to have lots of amendments today  and kind of talk about where we differ on certain things, which will be  good for the country.   What I hate the most is that we are doing a partisan COVID bill for  the first time as a nation, and I don't know why because on March 5,  2020, 96 to 1, we appropriated $8 billion when we had just begun to  understand what COVID was about; March 18, $355 billion, 90 to 8; March  25, $1.9 trillion.   So March 5 and 25, we spent well over $2 trillion, with the average  vote 96 to 1, 90 to 8, and 96 to 0. In April we spent $355 billion by  voice vote; September 30, 2020, $8 billion, 84 to 10; December 21,  2020, $1.04 trillion, 92 to 6.   So it is not like we can't work together on COVID. You had a  Republican President, you had a Republican Senate, and a Democratic  House, and we were able to come together as a nation. But that is all  over now because my Democratic colleagues have chosen to go another way  because they can. They have all the power. They have the House, the  Senate, and the White House.   They have chosen to do a $1.9 trillion package without any effort at  all, in my view, to try to find common ground. Ninety percent of this  money has got zero to do with COVID. It is a liberal wish list, and  every time Senator Schumer says it is not, it makes me believe it is.   So another point for the American people: Of all the money I just  described to you that we appropriated in a bipartisan fashion, we  haven't spent it all yet, but we are going to spend $1.9 trillion even  though we haven't spent the earlier money.   Of the administrative actions, we have got still $200 billion left to  spend. Of the legislative appropriations, we appropriated $4.1  trillion; we have got a trillion we haven't spent yet, but we are going  to spend $1.9 trillion more before we spend what we spent in the past.   The Federal Reserve set aside $5.9 trillion to help business. They  have only spent $2.8 trillion, so there is a lot more capability there.   The economy is showing signs of life. The vaccine is out. Things are  looking  [[Page S1229]]  better. It seems to me we would want to slow down and wisely spend the  money not spent before we embark on a $1.9 trillion spending spree.   Most of it doesn't have much to do, if anything, with COVID. They are  doing it because they can, and there will be a lot of amendments  talking about better ways to spend this money.   The minimum wage has been dropped out, but here is what is in this  bill: $20 million for the preservation and maintenance of Native  American languages. That might be something we want to do, but we  should go through the appropriations process, have hearings, not put it  on a COVID bill.   And $135 million for the National Endowment for the Arts. It may be  something we want to do, but not on a COVID bill. And $135 million for  the National Endowment for Humanities. Again, the same concept. About  $200 million for the Institute of Museum and Library Services. What has  that got to do with COVID? Nothing.   PPP loans for labor unions, paid leave fund for Federal employees, an  $86 billion bailout for union pensions. What has that got to do with  COVID? Nothing. And $350 billion for blue States. We changed the  formula under this bill--dramatically different than the one we passed  96 to 0.   So I could go on and on. Money for schools. Most of the money in this  bill--$129 billion for K-12--only $6.4 billion is to be distributed  this year. Most of the money is spent from 2022 to 2028. Hopefully we  will get control of COVID by 2028. Again, this is an opportunity to  spend money on things not related to COVID because they have the power  to do so.   It is going to be a long day. We are going to be talking about  reprioritizing money. We are going to try to strike provisions from  this bill, money that comes from hard-working taxpayers, being spent in  a way unrelated to COVID.   So stay tuned. Keep good cheer. Stay hydrated. But this is a debate  worth having, and I regret very much that we could not find common  ground here. To find it, you have to seek it. And this is the one area  where we were doing a pretty damn good job, I thought, working together  as Republicans and Democrats, spending a lot of money because there was  a need out there.   Today we are going to spend a lot of money, most of it not related to  COVID, and it is going to be along partisan lines. It is unfortunate,  but it is the choice my Democratic colleagues made. And we are going to  hold them to that choice.   With that, I yield the floor.    The Republicans yield back their time.    Mr. President, the budgetary effects of the pending  amendment, 972, offered by Senator Sanders, are merely incidental to  the nonbudgetary effects of the amendment. Accordingly, the amendment  is extraneous. Therefore, I raise a point of order against this measure  pursuant to section 313(b)1(D) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974.    =========================== NOTE ===========================        On page S1230, March 5, 2021, second column, the following  appears: POINT OF ORDER  Mr. President, the budgetary  effects of the pending amendment, 872, offered by Senator Sanders,  are merely incidental to the      The online Record has been corrected to read: POINT OF ORDER  Mr. President I would like to call up amendment No. 1369,  as modified, and ask it be reported by number.                             Additional Cosponsor    I ask that Senator Hagerty be added as cosponsor.    Mr. President, I ask for 2 minutes, equally divided.    There was a time about a year ago when we were together,  and we passed a COVID relief bill of $1.9 trillion, 96 to nothing. What  happened? You all got it now.   So here is what I want you to know. That CARES formula, that bill we  passed, had an allocation for State and local funding that has been  changed by our Democratic friends, and the biggest winners are New York  and California. So the formula they are using now, New York and  California wins big. You need to check what you are doing because you  are giving a lot of money to New York and California because they can  do it.   This is a big State bailout. You need to check and explain to people  back in your State why they need more money than you do. You are  rewarding people who have closed down the economy, won't reopen, so I  am asking to go back to the bipartisan formula, reject this partisan  formula that rewards Democratic blue States at the expense of most  everybody else in this building.   So if you don't know how your State is doing, we know how your State  is doing, and you will hear about it.    I ask for the yeas and nays.
