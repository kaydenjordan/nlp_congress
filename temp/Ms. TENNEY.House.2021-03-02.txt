 Madam Speaker, I rise today to raise awareness of the  grave human rights violations taking place in Burma, also known as  Myanmar.   For decades, the country of Burma has been working diligently to  establish credible elections, democratic civilian governance, and a  peaceful transition of power.   However, this progress came to a halt after the military violently  seized control on February 1, 2021. The military has since used this  unlawful control to violently oppress ethnic minorities, including  firing artillery into Burmese villages and displacing over 7,000  people.   Peaceful protests for freedom have been met with deadly force,  killing 18 and imprisoning nearly 700. One protester, a 16-year-old  boy, was reportedly shot in the head by an army sniper.   Utica, New York, my hometown, is home to over 4,000 Burmese refugees  and new Burmese-American citizens. Many fear for the lives of their  friends and families in peril in Burma.   In Utica, they have peacefully stood in solidarity with their home  country, holding signs that say, ``Save Democracy, Save Burma.''   I met recently with a group of these refugees to hear their grim  accounts of the conditions in their native country. Their passion and  courage are inspiring.   We must also condemn the cruelty and genocide against the Rohingya  people, an ethnic minority who also desperately need our support and  assistance.   The U.S. remains a symbol of democracy to the world. I urge my  colleagues to join me in supporting the Burmese people in their quest  for freedom and democracy.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I rise today in opposition to H.R. 1, the  so-called For the People Act.   My colleagues on the other side of the aisle are touting this  sweeping legislation as a win for transparency and election integrity.  Nothing could be further from the truth.   This bill is an attempt to destroy democracy by federalizing aspects  of U.S. elections constitutionally delegated to the States. It would  prohibit commonsense voter ID rules, encourage ballot harvesting,  require no-excuse absentee and early voting, permit felons and  noncitizens to vote, and make colleges and universities trusted voter  registration agencies.   I know firsthand the need for election reform and the consequences of  [[Page H975]]  elections run without transparency and oversight. I was sworn into  office over 30 days late, after an exhaustive 100-day postelection  count in the race for New York's 22nd Congressional District. In the  run-up to the 2020 election, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo rushed  through a series of executive orders that mirrored many of the policies  the Democrats are now proposing in H.R. 1. The result was one of the  most poorly run elections in the entire Nation. It was a disgrace to  our system of government.   If H.R. 1 had become law, I can confidently say it would have been  virtually impossible to conduct a fair and transparent race. New York's  election debacle reveals H.R. 1's real-world consequences.   If this legislation had been adopted, the errors exposed in my race  wouldn't be the exception. It would have been bureaucratic chaos and  that would have been the norm.    Mr. Speaker, it is clear we need reforms to restore  confidence in our elections, but what my Democratic colleagues are  proposing would dramatically change election law. The American people  are demanding a commonsense framework for election reform that  strengthens security without compromising integrity.   Congress should focus on delivering results to the American people,  not perpetuating their own power at an irreversible and grave cost to  our democratic principles.
