 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the PACT Act and my  bill contained within on burn pits.   Most of us here all know about Agent Orange and the horrible effects  it had on our veterans in Vietnam. We also remember how long it took  for Congress and the VA to respond and make sure our veterans had the  care and benefits they needed.   The bill we will vote on today is a landmark piece of legislation  that will address the Agent Orange of the post-9/11 generation: burn  pits.   For anyone who doesn't know, burn pits are used to dispose of waste  on a military base, usually abroad in a combat zone, with jet fuel used  to light the fuse. For years, we have used these burn pits in places  like Iraq and Afghanistan. I lived near one in Iraq on three tours.   Just as with Agent Orange, we have learned over the years that the  toxins our servicemembers have been exposed to have horrible  consequences, strange cancer diagnoses, respiratory issues that have  affected millions of veterans, including those in Michigan.   This issue has been deeply personal to me as an Army wife and someone  who lived near those burn pits while with the CIA.    Madam Speaker, for years, 9/11 veterans have walked into  their local VA center only to be turned away.   Madam Speaker, one of the most important things I have worked on in  my short 3\1/2\ years here is this bill. It is the biggest veterans'  healthcare bill we have passed in decades.   Last week, I visited our local VA in Lansing--and they know it is  coming--another 3.5 veterans will have access to healthcare because of  this bill.   We do important things in this body all the time, but I think fewer  are more important than this one we are going to vote on today.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle--I am  glad many of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have switched  their positions--to now vote on this bill.
