 Mr. Speaker, today, homeless advocates from Rhode  Island, including from Crossroads Rhode Island and from Rhode Island  Housing, came to visit my office.   Mr. Speaker, it is difficult to express in words how important their  work is. These groups take care of the least among us. They provide  shelter for the working poor and those affected by the opioid crisis,  and they assist those not working because of age, infirmity, or  disability. They help keep lives together. They help keep families  together.   Mr. Speaker, we must continue to provide strong funding for these  programs in our appropriations bills. We still have not fully emerged  from the financial crisis and people are still trying to make ends  meet. Foster youth are particularly vulnerable, with as many as 40  percent who age out of the system becoming homeless.   Mr. Speaker, social services organizations and nonprofits can only do  so much on their own. They need support to keep our vulnerable brothers  and sisters from falling off a cliff. We can do better and we deserve  to support them.                            ____________________
