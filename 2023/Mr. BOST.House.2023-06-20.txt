Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks on  S. 30.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 30. This bill would authorize VA  major medical facility construction projects in California, New York,  Texas, Montana, Kentucky, and Oregon.   As chairman, I have committed time and time again to provide the  necessary funding that ensures our Nation's veterans receive the  quality care they deserve.  [[Page H2976]]                                     time  1615    It is well known that the VA healthcare system has serious  infrastructure issues and needs critical renovations. Authorizing these  projects will help the thousands of veterans who live in these six  States have better access to care in modern settings.   I appreciate Senator Tester and Senator Moran for their work  introducing this important bill. I also thank Representative Chavez- DeRemer for introducing a similar bill in the House. It has my full  support today.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I encourage all Members to support this  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 3672) to designate the clinic of the Department of Veterans  Affairs in Indian River, Michigan, as the ``Pfc. Justin T. Paton  Department of Veterans Affairs Clinic''.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 3672         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. DESIGNATION OF PFC. JUSTIN T. PATON DEPARTMENT OF                     VETERANS AFFAIRS CLINIC.         (a) Designation.--The community-based outpatient clinic of       the Department of Veterans Affairs located at 5739 Hwy M-68,       Indian River, Michigan, shall after the date of the enactment       of this Act be known and designated as the ``Pfc. Justin T.       Paton Department of Veterans Affairs Clinic''.        (b) Reference.--Any reference in any law, regulation, map,       document, paper, or other record of the United States to the       clinic referred to in subsection (a) shall be considered to       be a reference to the ``Pfc. Justin T. Paton Department of       Veterans Affairs Clinic''.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks on  H.R. 3672.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3672, a bill to  designate the clinic of the Department of Veterans Affairs in Indian  River, Michigan, as the ``Pfc. Justin T. Paton Department of Veterans  Affairs Clinic.''   Justin Paton was born on July Fourth, 1982, in Emmet County,  Michigan. He joined the U.S. Army in 2005 and deployed to Iraq in  October 2006, assigned to the 1st Cavalry Division based out of Fort  Hood, Texas.   While deployed to Iraq in 2007, his unit came in contact with the  enemy just north of Baghdad, with small arms fire being exchanged.  While in this firefight, Private First Class Paton was hit by an Iraqi  sniper and did not survive his wounds. He was posthumously awarded the  Purple Heart and Bronze Star. He bravely answered the Nation's call  when it came, like many others before him and so many after.   Naming the VA clinic in his hometown, which he so loved, is an honor  that would be a fitting remembrance of Private First Class Paton's life  and sacrifice.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to support H.R. 3672, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Bergman), the sponsor of this legislation  and also a very good friend.    Mr. Speaker, once again, I encourage all Members to support  this legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
