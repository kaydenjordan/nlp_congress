 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of  the Music Modernization Act. As co-chair of the Congressional Creative  Rights Caucus, I am proud to stand with my colleagues to support this  consensus bill that aims to modernize our copyright law.   Music is at the heart of how we experience life. We count on the  right song to help us express a moment better than we could ourselves.   For music creators, their works help them support their families,  keep a roof over their head, and food on the table. But, for far too  long, I have heard from songwriters whose compensation was less than  pennies in digital play for number one hits, and I have heard from  music legends who are touring well into their seventies because their  works created before 1972 are not eligible for royalties on digital  broadcasts.   This bill will help bring our copyright law into the digital era and  address the gaps that prevent creators from receiving fair compensation  for their work. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote for this  bill. The lives of our most treasured creators depend on it.
