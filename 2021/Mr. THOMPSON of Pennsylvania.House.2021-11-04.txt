 Madam Speaker, I rise today to  recognize Liberty Baptist Church located in Blanchard, Pennsylvania.  This weekend, Liberty Baptist Church is celebrating a major milestone,  their 150th anniversary.   What started with very humble beginnings at an abandoned German  reform church in 1871, what started there has now blossomed into a  vibrant congregation and community staple.   In 1872, Brother Runyon, the pastor at the time, described the  congregation in a simple sentence: ``Wealth we have not, but warm  hearts and willing hands we have.''   Those words ring true today. With warm hearts and willing hands,  Liberty Baptist Church continues to give back to the community, whether  it is a bake sale or potlucks to backpack ministries, Christmas  caroling, and youth sports, the congregation at Liberty Baptist Church  is happy to lend a helping hand.   Over the past 150 years, there were challenging times as well as  times of great joy. It is clear, God shines on your members, your  church leadership, and your pastors.   Congratulations on this monumental anniversary. May God continue to  bless you all for the next 150 years.                            ____________________
