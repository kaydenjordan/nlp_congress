 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 8408, the Aircraft  Certification Reform and Accountability Act.   I want to thank Chairman DeFazio and Chairman Larsen for working with  us to put together this bipartisan bill.   The Committee's response following the Lion Air and Ethiopian  Airlines tragedies has been to take the time that is necessary to  understand all the contributing factors in these accidents.                                time  1515    Throughout this process, I have taken the position that if the safety  experts recommend improvement to our certification system, then  Congress should act.   We now have the benefit of a number of nonpartisan reviews by  aviation safety experts confirming that multiple factors were involved.  There is only so much the United States can do to influence factors  outside of our borders, but the experts identified issues to address  those things that are within our control and made recommendations to  improve our system, and that is the focus of this bill.   We can all agree that the United States and the Federal Aviation  Administration has to--must--continue to be the gold standard in  aviation. The safety of the traveling public depends on that, but so  does our economy, our competitiveness, and hundreds of thousands of  American jobs.   Plain and simple, we can't remain the gold standard if our system  isn't safe. And one reason for our achievements in aviation has been  our ability to leave partisan politics at the door and work together on  critical safety issues, and that is what we have done today in this  bill.   This bill before us today is going to require additional improvements  beyond those which the FAA and Boeing have already undertaken. These  changes are going to make our safe system even safer.   To be clear, the experts have concluded that the current system does  not need to be dismantled, but that we can and should take action to  improvement.   H.R. 8408 thoughtfully addresses the multiple contributing factors  involved in the Lion Air and Ethiopian Airlines accidents that are  within our control, as well as the many expert recommendations to  improve safety within our own system.   This is a well-reasoned, comprehensive, and bipartisan bill.   Mr. Speaker, I urge support for this legislation, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may  consume to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Graves), the ranking  member of the Aviation Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, H.R. 8408 addresses the  nonpartisan expert safety recommendations to improve the FAA's aircraft  certification process in the aftermath of tragic Lion Air and Ethiopian  Airlines accidents in 2018 and 2019.   This bill is responsible, comprehensive, bipartisan, and it is going  to improve aviation safety.   I thank again Chairman DeFazio and Ranking Member Garret Graves and  the committee staff on both sides, with special thanks to Holly  Woodruff Lyons, Hunter Presti, Jamie Hopkins, Corey Cooke, Jack Ruddy,  and Paul Sass for their work on this important piece of legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to support this legislation, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I am the proud sponsor of H.R. 5953, the Preventing  Disaster Revictimization Act. In the 2018 Disaster Recovery Reform Act,  Congress made the recovery process fairer and more equitable for most  communities. This bill builds upon those efforts by ensuring that spent  funds aren't clawed back.   When a disaster victim applies in good faith to FEMA for assistance  and receives it from the Agency, we fully expect those individuals need  to move quickly to use the assistance for eligible expenses, like home  repairs, to speed up recovery, to begin rebuilding their lives. These  victims should never expect FEMA to come back weeks or months or  sometimes even years later and say: Sorry, we made a mistake. Now, you,  the victim, have to give back those funds that we have already  distributed to you and that you have already put to good use.   To add insult to injury, FEMA's information on how disaster victims  can appeal these decisions is incredibly confusing, and it is  insufficient. Through no fault of their own, many disaster victims are  faced with debt collectors and the full force of the Federal Government  seeking repayment.   People acting in good faith to rebuild should not be revictimized  because they relied upon FEMA's determination that they were qualified  for assistance that they did receive.   Unfortunately, disaster victims have experienced this recently in my  own district in a few of my communities, and one in particular, Craig,  Missouri, and in other communities all across the country.   One constituent in my district was awarded just over $12,000 only to  have FEMA show up after the money was spent to say that they messed up,  that that individual didn't actually qualify for the money, in their  determination, and that it needed to be paid back. That is simply  wrong, and it can devastate someone who is already facing some very  difficult circumstances.   H.R. 5953 is going to clarify that if FEMA makes an error and there  is no evidence of fraud, the victim will not be revictimized, and their  debt is automatically viewed as a hardship and waived.   In addition, the bill would also require FEMA to report back to  Congress on its error rates and tell us what they are doing to be more  accountable.   Mr. Speaker, I urge support for this legislation to ensure that the  government does not revictimize disaster victims, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may  consume to the gentlewoman from Puerto Rico (Miss Gonzalez-Colon).   Miss GONZALEZ-COLON of Puerto Rico. Mr. Speaker, I thank the  Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure Ranking Member Sam  Graves for leading this bill to prevent the Federal Emergency  Management Agency from being able to collect disaster assistance funds  that it has previously awarded to individuals and families who applied  for Federal funding after they were affected by natural disasters.   I think this bill, H.R. 5953, the Preventing Disaster Revictimization  Act, is more important than ever with the history we have in the past,  with hurricanes and earthquakes here in the Nation as well. And we are  experiencing all of those examples that he just mentioned.                                time  1630    This legislation is the result of the management of funding and poor  recordkeeping practices, which are not the fault of those affected by  natural disasters. I truly believe that FEMA should be there to support  individuals and families when they need it most, not revictimize them  when they are starting over.   As an example, in Puerto Rico, the island was devastated by  hurricanes in 2017, then again by earthquakes earlier this year. We  received more than $60 billion in disaster recovery funding that has  been awarded to Puerto Rico and my constituents. How, now, can we tell  those rebuilding that some of the funding that was given to them was by  mistake? How does the Federal Government re-collect funding that was  already used to buy materials to rebuild a home? It can't.   I think this legislation makes sure our constituents and our people  are not on the hook for FEMA's mistakes. I think this is a great  opportunity to use those funds wisely. That is the reason I want to say  thank you, again, to Representative Sam Graves for leading this issue,  protecting those who have already become victims, and I urge its  passage.    Mr. Speaker, in closing, this bill, H.R.  5953, is going to ensure that disaster victims applying for FEMA  assistance in good faith are not revictimized by the Agency if it  realizes that it did make an error.   Residents in north Missouri and across this country need to be able  to rely on FEMA's determination on eligibility for assistance and not  have to look over their shoulder as they rebuild, wondering if they are  going to have to give back money sometime down the road.   This bill also ensures that FEMA is working to prevent such errors in  the future, making it a much better steward of the taxpayers' dollars  and vital disaster funding.   Mr. Speaker, I urge support for this very important piece of  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 4358 is going to improve consistency in FEMA's  preliminary damage assessments to better help communities hit by  disaster.   Inconsistencies in FEMA training and personnel on the ground  following a disaster often slow the recovery process down dramatically.  This bill is going to help ensure that there is more consistency within  FEMA to support State and local communities as they navigate the  preliminary damage assessment process to determine eligibility for  assistance.   Ultimately, the bill is about helping Americans impacted by disasters  to get the help that they need sooner and more reliably.   I want to thank Ranking Member Katko for his leadership and work on  this piece of legislation.   I urge support for the bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may  consume to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Katko).    Mr. Speaker, H.R. 4358, as I mentioned  earlier, is going to improve FEMA support for communities that have  been hit by disasters by ensuring more consistency in the preliminary  damage assessment process.   This bill will provide much better and faster government assistance  to those whose lives have been impacted by floods, by hurricanes, and  by so many other disasters that we see.   Again, I want to thank and I want to commend the gentleman from New  York (Mr. Katko) for his leadership on this issue.   I urge support of this important legislation, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2914, which would help  disaster victims verify residency and homeownership following a  disaster. When disasters strike, essential property and possessions are  often destroyed. Disaster victims may not be able to easily obtain the  paperwork needed for them to verify their residency, which delays  needed assistance and the recovery process.   This bill is going to clarify how the Federal Emergency Management  Agency addresses alternate verification.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Puerto Rico, Miss Gonzalez- Colon, for her work with Mr. Espaillat of New York on this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I would urge support of the legislation, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may  consume to the gentlewoman from Puerto Rico (Miss Gonzalez-Colon).   Miss GONZALEZ-COLON of Puerto Rico. Mr. Speaker, I thank again my  ranking member and his staff for all the help to make this bill able to  come to the floor today.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2914, the Housing Survivors of  Major Disasters Act. I thank Representative Espaillat for leading this  bill with me, to ensure not just people in the Nation, but actually on  the island of Puerto Rico, constituents that I do represent here in  Congress and those affected by Hurricane Maria have increased  flexibility in providing ownership of property when applying for  Federal disaster funding. This was a major issue, and actually still  is, many times.  [[Page H5861]]    FEMA changed the way the documents were going to be accepted. Then  they changed it again. And they did that more than five times during  the course of Hurricanes Irma and Maria. So at the beginning, no papers  were accepted, and then they changed it. So there was a difficult  situation for people, even in the center of the island.   The documents that were requested in the north part of the island  were different from those in the south, from those in the west, or in  the countryside. And that is the reason this bill is so important.   This bill will provide necessary flexibilities in the form of  documents that individuals that were residing in the area during the  natural disaster got to apply for disaster assistance. Individuals may  now use their driver's license, deeds, or title to properties,  utilities bills, or any of the 13 forms included in this bill as  evidence of occupancy.   In our case, you got many people that were affected. There was no  doubt in terms of FEMA or the government that they were affected by the  hurricanes, yet they did not have the papers at the time because they  lose them because of disaster, and it was so difficult to get the  government actually to use or redo those papers in time. So that took  almost a year for many of the individuals affected by hurricanes in  Puerto Rico just to provide the documents.   As you may know, many of the dates expired. Most of the people didn't  qualify then to receive the Federal funds that were available for  disaster survivors. That is the reason H.R. 2914 also includes language  for a report on the Disaster Housing Assistance Program, and how  effective this program is. The Federal Emergency Management Agency  decided against using this disaster housing program in Puerto Rico  following Hurricanes Irma and Maria, as the agency looks to other  efficient programs to more effectively meet the immediate needs of  those affected by the two hurricanes.   After those crazy 1 and 2 years, I may say that FEMA is helping and  providing and using many of the forms that are now included in this  bill to get those funds available. But, again, that can change if we  don't have it in law, and that is the reason this bill is so important.   Mr. Speaker, I thank, again, Representatives Espaillat, and  leadership on the Committee, as well as my ranking member for  supporting this legislation and working with me and my staff to improve  this bill for the past year. I urge its passage.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2914 is going to help speed up the recovery  following a disaster by helping disaster victims who have lost their  personal records, and likely much more, to verify residency and  homeownership. It is a very good piece of legislation, and I would urge  support of this, and I yield back the balance of my time.
