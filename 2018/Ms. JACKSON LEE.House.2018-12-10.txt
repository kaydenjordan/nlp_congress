 Mr. Speaker, many of us will see this as the holiday  season, but many of us know that our young college students will be  finishing their first semester of whatever year they are in college.   As I was home this season greeting my constituents, one very  dedicated constituent came to me and said: What are we doing about  helping students get rid of this enormous burden of debt, trying to  become a contributing citizen to this country?   I made a commitment to him that we would work together to reduce the  interest rates on student government loans, to look forward to  providing access to education to all Americans.   I believe, as students finish their first semester, looking to their  second, some of them graduating, that we do have a responsibility to  make sure that education is reasonable, accessible, and not the  enormous burden that it is.   Let's help our college students. Let's help them succeed. I look  forward to doing that.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise to join my colleagues tonight in  what is a tribute to George Herbert Walker Bush and Barbara Bush, a  tribute of which I hope we will continue to live.   It is my great honor to salute President Bush and to be reminded of  the beauty of his love of 73 years, a partnership of service, raising a  family, and serving a Nation. Last week's tribute of mourning,  memorials, and funerals was an opportunity for not only the Nation, but  the world to learn of the depth and the level of integrity, honesty,  statesmanship, and leadership of our 41st President.   I am glad to have known him, as a Houstonian, and delighted to have  worked with his wife, Barbara Bush, on her great commitment that  everyone should have the ability to read. Literacy was a standard- bearer by which she guided her later life. So many people learned to  read and cherish books because of her service.   I got to know the President more closely because of his relationship  with my husband, Dr. Elwyn C. Lee. What most people don't know is,  preceding the Honorable Barbara Jordan and Mickey Leland, parts of the  18th Congressional District, of which I represent, was represented by  this young Congressman by the name of George Herbert Walker Bush. They  were African Americans in a segregated Houston. He was beloved because  of his eagerness to treat everyone as a human being.   One of his dear friends, who will turn 90 in a couple of weeks,  Reverend Dr. F.N. Williams, the pastor of the Antioch Baptist Church-- he still is the pastor--and I remember standing next to him in Acres  Homes when then-President Herbert Walker Bush landed his big helicopter  right there in our community, showing and affirming the friendship.   We further enjoyed the opportunity to know him, along with my  husband, through his assisting him in his own high school, Andover  Academy, and how kind he was to send a gift for our wedding from China.   He is more than the President of the United States, the Congressman;  the chair of the RNC, the envoy, among others--the Vice-President,  President, the Director of the CIA, and most of all, a hero of World  War II, where he, in his effort to fight for this Nation also, was shot  down and looked to save his colleagues.   He is a hero. He is a friend. He is a man we will honor and continue  to honor. By our lives and our service we hope to affirm both the  wonderful life of his lovely bride, as well as himself, and to say to  his children, grandchildren, great grandchildren, and others: Rest  well. Thank you for sharing him with us, for he did serve his Nation.  By that, he has served the people of this Nation. My God bless.
