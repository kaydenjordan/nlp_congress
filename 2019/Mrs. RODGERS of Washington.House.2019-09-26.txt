 Mr. Speaker, I thank everyone for joining  me tonight on this Special Order.   In August, my colleagues and I traveled to Israel with the United  States-Israel Education Association, and tonight we wanted to share  with you about our trip. I am joined by Bradley Byrne from Alabama, Ann  Wagner from Missouri, and Dr. Phil Roe from Tennessee.   Through the years, the USIEA has led Members of Congress behind the  Green Line, so into the West Bank, in Judea and Samaria.   Tonight we wanted to share with you some of what we saw, what we  learned, witnessing the economic cooperation and integrated businesses  between Palestinian and Israeli business leaders. It is really an  untold story. It is an untold story, one that includes the story of  hope and opportunity.   For me, it was my first trip to Israel since being named the United  States Representative to the U.N., and it renewed my strong commitment  to ensure that America remains a bipartisan, steadfast, and staunch  supporter of Israel.   Tonight we are going to get started with my friend and colleague from  Alabama, Bradley Byrne, to share about the trip.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. Byrne).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman  from Missouri (Mrs. Wagner).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from  Missouri. I thought she said it so well. It really is an untold story.  It is a story of opportunity, and it is a story of hope that,  unfortunately, isn't being told right now.   This needs to be part of the peace plan. We need to have and  encourage that economic cooperation between the Israelis and the  Palestinian business leaders. We saw it, the Judea and Samaria Chamber  of Commerce coming together and, in the last 2 years, creating jobs,  creating opportunities, and giving people hope.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. David P.  Roe).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  his comments. That was great to hear.   I often tell people, everyone should go to Israel. There really is no  other place like it in all of the world. And it is at the center of  history from a Biblical perspective, the history, but today, so much of  what is happening in the world is centered on what is going on in  Israel. So it was great to be able to return to Israel for me.   I have traveled with the U.S. Israel Education Association before,  and I am grateful for them leading these trips, especially behind the  Green Line into Judea and Samaria, and taking Members of Congress,  House and Senate, Republicans and Democrats, to be able to see it for  themselves. It really is important.   We spent a couple of days beyond the Green Line, so that is in the  West Bank, and we were witnessing amazing cooperation between the  Palestinians and the Israelis. I feel like, for me, it is the untold  story, and it is a story about opportunity. It doesn't always make the  headlines or the news, the cable news. It is a story of hope at a time  when too many despair.   So I think the gentlewoman mentioned we went to the city of Ariel.  Ariel is the capital of Samaria. It is a city right now that is booming  with housing, shopping centers, more jobs. We went to Ariel University.  It is the newest university in Israel. It is a leader in science and  technology.   I was especially impressed with the program that they had for those  with autism, giving those with autism an opportunity to earn a degree.  They are also building a new medical school.   Ariel University is a leading model, where Jews, Arabs, and diverse  students from across Israel come to study and to learn together, to  build that opportunity for a better life.   Down the road from Ariel University, we toured the business park.  There was a large business park. We toured one factory that is  processing 50 tons of tahini a day, and they want to double that very  soon.   In that town is where we saw the Israelis and the Palestinians  working together. We saw neighborhoods where they are living together  with equal opportunities, equal pay, equal benefits.   The waiting list to get a job is over 1,000 people long. And why is  that? Because they are going to make three to four times what they  could make anywhere else that is controlled by the Palestinian  Authority.   Now, everything that comes out of that business park is considered  BDS. So why would Palestinians want to risk working at a place that  everything is going to be stamped ``BDS''--and that is actually against  the law. It is because they want to be able to provide for their  families and live a full life.   So one Palestinian employee in Ariel said this: ``All the people I  know in the factory or outside it, they believe that the commercial  progress will bring stability, a comfortable life.   ``Why not work together in peace? You can see good examples of  friendship and peace here.   ``In the territories that are under the control of the Palestinian  Authorities in the West Bank, we don't have factories like this  factory. If you want to work in a factory over there, you will not get  the salary we get here. It's not enough for the necessity of life.   ``Here, we get a comfortable and respectable salary.''   That is the reality on the ground in the West Bank. Jews and Arabs  from Israel and Palestine are working and living together today in  peace.   I was reminded again that it is the opportunity: It is the  opportunity for a good-paying job. It is the chance for your children  to get a good education.   It is the desire for hope, peace, and security that drives all of us.  It really is foundational for every person, no matter their background  or their walk of life.   I was also reminded of this in Hebron. And in Hebron, we did make  history. That picture was the first time that a group of Members of  Congress had traveled to a Palestinian business leader's home, Ashraf  Jabari, and he warmly invited us into his home. He told us that he  wants to be a partner  [[Page H8049]]  for peace with America in the Middle East.    I yield to the gentlewoman from Missouri.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman.   This picture is a picture of the leaders of the Judea and Samaria  Chamber of Commerce. There are 150 Israeli business leaders and 150  Palestinian business leaders coming together. They formed the Judea and  Samaria Chamber of Commerce 2 years ago, and, yes, we want to invite  them to come to Capitol Hill, to visit with Members of Congress, to  tell their story, because it is an untold story, and it needs to be  told.    They believe that this has to be part of the peace solution. It is  the bottom-up grassroots movement where people are living together,  working together, and they are doing it. And that is the way that we  are going to build peace. So it was really encouraging to see that  economic activity.   One of the things that I remember Ashraf saying was:         Our truth and our reality is that the Palestinians and the       Israelis work together. We want to show the world that       reality.    So that is why we are excited about them coming and being able to  host them here in Congress and being able to introduce them and have  them tell their story.    Mr. Speaker, another aspect of this does  deal with the BDS movement, the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions  movement that we see right now. It has a goal of delegitimizing Israel.   We heard from the factory workers, the business leaders like Ashraf,  and the Judea and Samaria Chamber of Commerce. We saw a different story  where they are really working together in peace, and that economic  relationship must be foundational to peace.   For the Palestinians and the Israelis, though, BDS is going to  threaten it. Both the Palestinian business leaders as well as the  Palestinian workers told us that BDS actually hurts them more than the  Israelis because, for the first time, they have an opportunity for a  really good-paying job, to be able to provide for their families, to be  able to make sure that their kids are getting a good education. That is  their dream. That is what gives them hope.   So it hurts them. It hurts their ability to work, to provide for  their families. They want economic freedom, not boycotts. And this  desire is overwhelming.   That is why I am proud of the leadership of my colleague, the  gentlewoman from Missouri, Ann Wagner, in leading the resolution that  passed here on the House floor, overwhelmingly, a statement that we do  not stand for Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions, BDS, that this is  actually going to work against peace.   What we saw, what we witnessed, that is the foundation for peace and  must be a part of any of the peace plan moving forward.   So I believe that, as America continues to influence and encourage  this kind of grassroots movement, we are going to see growing economic  opportunity that is foundational, that is vital for Israel's future,  but also for the Palestinian people.   Israel is our greatest ally, our greatest friend in the Middle East.  They are also vital for America. So I am going to be encouraging, and I  know my fellow colleagues who traveled with me, we are going to be  talking to the administration and Jared Kushner about the peace plan  that is being developed right now and urging them to include, in any  kind of a peace plan, this economic cooperation and America standing in  support of this bottom-up grassroots approach that really makes a  difference in people's lives.    Mr. Speaker, I completely agree. That is  a good point. A big thank-you to Heather Johnston, who led, and General  Krulak, former Commandant of the Marine Corps, Joint Chiefs of Staff,  who is helping encourage this economic, integrated business approach.   We also got to, as the gentlewoman said, see Arrow 3. Also traveling  with us was Ari Sacher, who led the whole Iron Dome.   I always take pleasure in noting that, under his leadership, Israel  was able to develop Iron Dome in less than 3 years, under budget. That  is something we could take note of. And it is working, and they are  using it today and every day.    Mr. Speaker, Mr. Jabari had courage and  bravery.    I yield to the gentlewoman from Missouri.    Mr. Speaker, we should also recognize the  extraordinary leadership of Ambassador David Friedman. We had the  opportunity to have lunch with him. We had the opportunity to visit the  United States Embassy in Jerusalem.    It was a beautiful day when we were  there. It was just great to be able to spend some time with him. He  really has led the way within the administration with integrated  business. Also he sees the vision, and he sees the potential of what  that means as far as helping really forge peace from a bottom-up  approach. So it was great to be with him.   I appreciated Dr. Roe talking about the national training center  which is leading with training, leadership, and teamwork that we all  can benefit from. They have contracted with the IDF. They have  contracts now with the Department of Education. We saw the young  people--the Israelis and the Arabs--going through this training  together--thousands.    It was so encouraging to see that during  our time there.    I remember that, too.    Mr. Speaker, when you think about Israel,  it is a very young country. It is just over 70 years old. It is very  impressive from a defense perspective, from a technology perspective,  and from an agriculture perspective leading the world in so many  different fields.    I also believe it is always important to highlight they are the only  democracy in the Middle East. They are our best friend. Its history and  its culture are the center of our civilization. Israel faces threats  every single day against its survival and against the universal values  of peace, security, opportunity, and, of course, freedom.   Those values unite us in America and in Israel on both sides of the  Green Line. I am excited that my colleagues are here to share with  everyone our experience. We returned home with a strong conviction that  this story needs to be told and that more of our colleagues,  Republicans and Democrats, need to see it for themselves. That was the  biggest takeaway we heard after listening to the people whom we met.  They asked us to go home and share their reality and their desires to  promote peace and economic security in Israel. That is our mission  today.    Well said.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now  adjourn.
