 Mr. Speaker, the Holy Bible, the book of Mark, chapter 12,  verse 30 says, ``Love your God with all your heart and with all your  soul and with all your mind and with all of your strength.'' Those  words sum up Laura Chaffin, her life.   An accident last year in Uganda took her voice and paralyzed her for  a couple of trying weeks. She was there with her husband Scott trying  to put their family together. The Chaffin family is beside me right  now. There is Laura, there is Scott, and their three sons, Elijah,  David, and Jonah.   If you think Laura felt pity when she was hurt, you are dead wrong.  With a team of experts at TIRR at Memorial Hermann Hospital and with  the love of family and the love of Jesus Christ, she started talking  and walking and teaching at Alvin ISD and cooking for her family. She  became, again, a mom and a wife.   Mr. Speaker, in the name of Laura, Scott, Elijah, David, Jonah, and  Jesus Christ, I yield back.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank my dear friend from Austin, Texas,  for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, on March 4, 1950, in the Texas Panhandle metropolis of  Haskell, Texas, Rick Perry was born. Haskell lately has a population of  3,322. That was too much big city for Rick Perry, so his family moved  to Paint Creek, Texas, current population somewhere around 324.    As was mentioned, he became an Aggie yell leader. He said he knew A&M  was where he had to go because: ``I was probably a bit of a free  spirit. . . . I would have not lasted at Texas Tech or the University  of Texas. I would have hit the fraternity scene and lasted about one  semester.''   As was mentioned, he served our country in uniform, flying a C-130  Hercules, a large aircraft that carries cargo all over the world that  has the same engine as my P-3 Orion I flew in the Navy, the Allison  T56-A14. We share that common bond.   Rick was elected to serve in the Texas House in 1984. He became what  was known as a pit bull. The Texas House has a place they go called the  pit to have strong, strong, strong debates. Rick wanted to go off on  people who wanted to spend, spend, spend. The pit bulls in Texas had a  raging bull in Rick Perry.   In 1990, he became our Agriculture Commissioner. In 1998, he allowed  American history to be changed in a very positive way. He ran against a  guy named John Sharp to become our Lieutenant Governor. It was very  close, Aggie versus Aggie. Rick won by about 1.7 points, but that  victory enabled George W. Bush to leave his beloved Texas and become  America's 43rd President. Governor Bush knew he could leave with Texas  in great hands of prosperity and with a bright future, and Rick Perry  did not disappoint.   As our longest-serving Governor with 14 years in Austin, Texas, on  his watch, great things happened in our State that are the models for  America and the world.   He got true medical liability reform passed in Texas that changed our  provision of healthcare for our citizens because doctors were fleeing  our State because of unjustified lawsuits. They came back in droves  when this bill was passed and became an amendment to our constitution,  all because of Rick Perry's leadership.   He changed our energy market to a market with competition, driving  prices down and giving people the cheapest, most reliable energy in  America.                                time  2000    He had Texas squared away, so when America went into recession in  2007, our State, one State, created half the private-sector jobs in  America over 2007 and 2008.   And he also got a big start with technology, a place in Houston  called Celltex, which uses human beings' own stem cells to repair  broken bones and long-term injuries. They are thriving, and that is all  because of Governor Rick Perry.   On March 2 of 2017, the Senate confirmed him to be America's  Secretary of Energy. He tried to make D.C. just like Texas. On his  watch, the only viable carbon capture-enhanced oil recovery operation  in the entire world, in Texas 22, the Petro Nova project with NRG, was  started.   On his watch, we started exporting American crude oil all over the  world.   On Rick Perry's watch, we have sent liquified natural gas--we call  that liquid ``American freedom''--all over the world, helping allies in  need, allies like India, like South Korea, like Japan, and like Eastern  Europe break the hold on energy that comes from Russia or OPEC.   I will close with a statement from a Texas legend that applies  directly to Governor Rick Perry. Bum was talking about Earl Campbell,  the famous Heisman Trophy winner, a Hall of Famer in the NFL who played  for the Houston Oilers for just under a decade. Bum was asked: Is Earl  in a class by himself? And Bum's answer applies to Earl and applies to  Governor Rick Perry. Rick may not be in a class by himself, but  whatever class he is in, it don't take long to call the roll.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Rick and Anita for their service to America and  the great State of Texas. They will never, ever be forgotten.
