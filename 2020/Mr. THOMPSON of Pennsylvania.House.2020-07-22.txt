 Madam Speaker, I rise today on National  Fragile X Awareness Day to raise awareness of this genetic disorder.   Fragile X is caused by mutations in the gene known as FMR1. These  mutations can result in behavioral, developmental, cognitive, and  reproductive conditions, often leading to delayed development of speech  and language. In the most severe cases, fragile X can cause potentially  fatal neurodegenerative conditions.   Fragile X syndrome affects an estimated 100,000 Americans. But more  than 1 million Americans have a variation of the fragile X mutation,  meaning they either have or are at risk of developing one of the  associated conditions.   This means each Member of this House, on average, represents 230  constituents living with fragile X syndrome, and countless more  parents, grandparents, siblings, and caregivers love someone with  fragile X.   Each person living with fragile X syndrome, and any other  intellectual and developmental disability, makes our world a better  place.                            ____________________
