 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  order for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, Congress is returning to Washington  for a work period that will be filled with important to-do items, but  we already know what will top the agenda in the House of  Representatives: House Democrats are finally indulging in their 3-year  old impeachment obsession, full steam ahead.   Many of us remember the Washington Post headline that was literally  published on Inauguration Day in 2017. Here is what it said: ``The  campaign to impeach President Trump has begun.'' And, sure enough,  House Democrats have been at it ever since.   One prominent House Democrat called this Presidency illegitimate  before it had even begun. One of Speaker Pelosi's committee chairs whom  she has tasked with leading this process promised years ago that she  would find a way to impeach the President.   Now that Speaker Pelosi has finally crumbled and allowed her leftwing  impeachment caucus to dictate the House's actions, I don't think many  of us were expecting to witness a clinic in terms of fairness or due  process. But even by their own partisan standards, House Democrats have  already found new ways to lower the bar. This is about the most  consequential process the House of Representatives could possibly  engage in: overruling American voters and nullifying an election.   Surely, any such process must be conducted with the utmost fairness  and transparency. It must be held to the most exact of standards. Yet  House Democrats have wasted no time throwing fairness and precedent to  the wind. Already, they have denied their Republican counterparts  certain minority rights, like equal subpoena power, which Republicans  provided Democrats in the Clinton impeachment.   Already, they have made clear that President Trump's counsel will not  be allowed to participate in hearings, present evidence, and cross- examine witnesses--all-important rights that Republicans provided to  President Clinton.   Already, one House chairman has been caught publicly  mischaracterizing his committee's handling of the whistleblower inquiry  on which this whole investigation hinges.   For all the public hyperventilating over institutional norms that we  have heard from House Democrats in recent years, it appears they have  no intention of letting norms, precedents, or basic due process stand  in their way as they seek to cancel out a Presidency.   In the meantime, in the Senate we will keep our focus squarely on the  substantive work we need to complete for the American people. In the  coming days, we will confirm another slate of President Trump's well- qualified nominees. For starters, later this afternoon, we will advance  the nomination of Barbara Barrett, the President's choice to be  Secretary of the Air Force.   Speaking of our Armed Forces, Congress can waste no more time in  getting our appropriations process back on track and delivering a  funding that our servicemembers need. Just 2 months ago, the President  and the Speaker of the House produced an agreement to guide the  appropriations process. The White House and congressional leaders set  top-line funding targets for defense and nondefense and agreed to  forego poison pills. Last month, unfortunately, our Democratic  colleagues went back on the deal. Routine funding negotiations were  again subject to poison pill threats, and urgent resources for the  operations of the Pentagon were withheld for the sake of politics.   We need to put these political games aside. Democrats need to stop  filibustering a pay raise for our troops and  [[Page S5777]]  the funding our commanders need. We need to get our funding process  back on track for the entire Federal Government.   House Democrats need to stop slow-walking the USMCA, the landmark  trade agreement that stands to create 176,000 new American jobs. Mexico  is ready, Canada is ready, and a majority in the Senate is ready. The  entire continent is just waiting on Speaker Pelosi to stop blocking  this win for the United States and to stop blocking these new jobs. I  don't care how much my Democratic colleagues in the House may dislike  the President. They shouldn't throw 176,000 new American jobs on the  scrap heap.   On all these fronts, I hope sincerely that our Democratic colleagues  will be able to separate this vital business from their animus toward  the administration and join Republicans in moving forward with the work  of the American people.                            ____________________     Madam President, on one final matter, I know I speak  for many of our colleagues on both sides of the aisle in expressing my  grave concern at the events that have unfolded in Syria in recent days.   Turkey is our NATO ally. Yes, it hosts millions of Syrian refugees  and has a legitimate security concern about the situation in Syria. But  Turkey's escalation of hostilities with the Syrian Kurdish partners who  have helped the United States fight terrorism is completely and totally  unacceptable. This violence needs to end.   Syrian Kurdish forces have stood proudly alongside U.S. forces in the  fight against ISIS. Over years of joint effort, their shared sacrifices  have put ISIS on its heels and rendered its physical caliphate  essentially nonexistent. But leaving the field now would mean leaving  the door wide open for a resurgence of this dangerous force and a new  iteration of the Islamic State; creating a power vacuum begging for the  meddling influence of Russia; leaving northeastern Syria wide open for  Iran to extend its reach, unimpeded, all the way from Tehran to the  doorstep of our friends in Israel; and destroying the leverage we  currently have to compel Bashar Assad to stop his slaughter of the  Syrian people and negotiate an end to this terrible conflict and  humanitarian catastrophe.   I want to make something clear: The United States has taken the fight  to Syria and Afghanistan because that is where our enemies are. That is  why we are there. Fighting terrorists, exercising leadership in  troubled regions, and advancing U.S. interests around the world does  not make us an evil empire or the world's policeman. It makes us a  prudent and responsible world power that stands up for our own security  and the freedom of others.   Alongside the 80 coalition partners that U.S. forces have led in the  counter-ISIS coalition, that is what we must continue to do. We must  continue to provide support to the local forces that carry the lion's  share of the responsibility to defend their homelands. This effort must  continue to include our allies and partners, even the imperfect ones  that sometimes behave rashly and dangerously, as both Saudi Arabia and  Turkey have recently.   When it looked like President Trump would withdraw from Syria at the  beginning of the year, 70--70--Senators joined in warning of the risks  of precipitously withdrawing from Syria or Afghanistan. The veto-proof  majority vote for my amendment to S. 1, the Strengthening America's  Security in the Middle East Act, demonstrated strong and bipartisan  appreciation of our enduring security interests in that region. The  Senate spoke clearly and said that we must ensure that we have set the  conditions for an enduring defeat of the terrorists before any  withdrawal.   Regrettably, many of the Democratic Senators running for President,  along with my friend the Democratic leader, parted with this bipartisan  consensus and voted against this amendment. So I hope those aspiring  Commanders in Chief are asked to explain how they reconcile their  criticism of the administration today with their votes just a few  months ago. Maybe they will even be asked on the debate stage this very  evening.   I am heartened to hear that Vice President Pence will soon lead a  delegation to begin immediate talks with Turkey to end this violence.   I expect Turkish allies listen carefully to the anger from  Washington, welcome our Vice President, and take steps to repair our  important relationship. It would be a tragedy for both of our nations  if Turkey's escalation in Syria imperils our common fight against ISIS  and emboldens traditional adversaries like Iran and Russia. This would  be bad for U.S. interests, but it would be terrible for Turkey.   I also look forward to discussing with Members on both sides and with  the administration how the United States can stand with our partners  and provide strong, principled, and consistent global leadership.                            ____________________     Madam President, I understand there is a bill at the  desk due for a second reading.    In order to place the bill on the calendar under the  provision of rule XIV, I object to further proceedings.    I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Res. 322.    I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed  to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motions to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table.

Madam President, if there is no further business to  come before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned  under the previous order, following the remarks of Senator Blackburn.
