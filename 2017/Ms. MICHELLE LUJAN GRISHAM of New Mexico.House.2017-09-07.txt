 Mr. Chair, I want to thank  my colleague for yielding me time.   Mr. Chair, yesterday the House passed a $7.9 billion downpayment to  address the destruction caused by Hurricane Harvey, which is projected  now to cost as much as $180 billion--by far, today, the costliest  hurricane to hit the United States.   Today, we are considering an amendment which would prohibit BLM from  implementing a rule to address the wasteful venting, flaring, and  leaking of methane, which is a climate change-causing emission 30 times  more powerful than carbon dioxide.   New Mexico is currently home to the largest methane hot spot in the  world. Not only is methane a powerful greenhouse gas, but every cubic  foot of gas that is wasted into the atmosphere cheats hardworking New  Mexican taxpayers out of precious royalty and tax payments which go  toward public education, infrastructure, and community development  programs.   Our State desperately needs these investments, and we cannot afford  to let money disappear into thin air. BLM, in fact, should work with  stakeholders, especially small independent producers who have low- producing wells to make this workable. But taking a sledgehammer to our  Nation's energy policy is a shortsighted and counterproductive effort.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment and to  collaborate to make this rule effective for producers and taxpayers  alike.
