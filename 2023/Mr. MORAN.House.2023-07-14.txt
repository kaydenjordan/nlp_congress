 Mr. Speaker, Washington has a spending problem. I know it,  you know it, and more importantly, the American people know it.   Our addiction to unaccountable spending has resulted in our Nation  accumulating more than $32 trillion in debt, leading to crippling  inflation and a financial burden that future generations will struggle  to overcome.   That is why I have introduced the principles-based balanced budget  amendment, which would require annual spending and revenue to balance  and affirm the principle of fiscal responsibility through  constitutional mandate.   If ratified, this constitutional amendment would require Congress to  balance the budget within 10 years while still allowing Congress to  determine the mechanisms of how to achieve that balance through  statute.   Under the Constitution, Congress holds both the power of the purse  and the responsibility of the purse. Let us fulfill that responsibility  with a strict measure of accountability.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this effort to affirm  the principles of fiscal responsibility through constitutional mandate.  Our financial future in America depends on it. We must act now.                            ____________________
