 Mr. President, I have been a member of the Agriculture,  Nutrition, and Forestry Committee since I was first elected to the  Senate. The work that committee has done throughout my tenure in the  Senate has proven that a bipartisan, reasonable process is not only  possible but is preferable to the rancor and rhetoric that so often  curtails the important work before the Senate.   The 2018 farm bill process once again demonstrates this distinctive  quality of the Agriculture Committee, which has produced a vital  legislative product that will improve our Nation's agricultural, food,  and environmental systems. As a former chairman and ranking member of  the Agriculture Committee, I know just how much work it takes to draft  and advance a bill of this size, breadth, and influence, and I thank  Chairman Roberts and Ranking Member Stabenow for working together to  get this done.   This bill stands in stark contrast to the version passed by the House  of Representatives just last week, in which an ugly partisan process  resulted in legislation full of environmental riders and harmful policy  constraints that would devastate the millions of families that depend  on our nutrition programs for basic nutrition. I urge all Senators to  recognize that the bipartisan product reported nearly unanimously by  the committee is a strong bill that provides leadership on food,  agriculture, nutrition, natural resources, and rural development  issues. The policies it advances are based on the best available  science and will provide for effective management.   This bill is so much more than just a ``farm bill'' or even a ``food  bill.'' This is a bill that addresses a wide swath of American life and  helps to set priorities for the policies that affect every single one  of us. It is our chance to show farmers, foresters, families, rural  communities, and every American consumer that we hear their concerns  and can help everyone live a healthier, fuller life. Vermont farmers  and families expect that the programs and guidance within the farm bill  will help our struggling farms, large and small, to stay productive,  ensure that children are well nourished, and protect our environment.  This is a bill for every America and a bill for future generations.   I have heard countless heartbreaking stories from Vermont dairy  farmers who are struggling to stay afloat right now amid perilously low  milk prices. In addition to dairy, I know that agriculture across the  country is facing increasing difficulties when it comes to competition,  trade, dropping prices, and dramatic weather challenges that have  farmers everywhere on edge. I am proud that this bill will continue to  address these. I particularly want to thank the chair and ranking  member for the inclusion of the improved Dairy Risk Coverage Program  that builds on the important margin protection improvements I was able  to secure in February for our struggling dairy farmers. The bill also  provides important support for the rapidly growing organic industry and  local food systems and the opportunity for farmers to diversify their  crops by growing and selling hemp products.   We continue the proud tradition of providing nutritional assistance  to our fellow Americans with the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance  Program, or SNAP, and this bill continues our commitment to worldwide  stability and productivity with programs like McGovern-Dole, Food for  Peace, the Global Crop Diversity Trust, as well as valuable research to  support farmers here at home and around the world. We know that, when  families and children do not have to wonder where their next meal may  come from, children do better in school, workers are more productive,  and our Nation is stronger. The same is true when we support  international efforts that combat poverty and provide lifesaving  humanitarian assistance, we alleviate poverty and build stronger U.S.  partners.   Our Nation's conservation tradition is reinforced in this bill, with  significant funding and necessary improvements to programs that allow  farmers and forestland owners to make environmentally friendly  improvements to their land and take care of the natural areas that make  our lands and our countryside so vital, productive, and unique.  Wildlife, biodiverse ecosystems, and the air, land, and water we rely  on will be cleaner and healthier because of this bill. Through the  support of the committee's chair and ranking member, the bill does not  include problematic changes that would have weakened pesticide and  forestry laws.   This farm bill provides critical economic development support to  address the unique challenges and needs faced by our rural communities.  I am proud of the steps this bill makes possible to improve the lives  of rural citizens everywhere by investing in rural community  infrastructure and facilities, including a new priority for treatment  centers for substance abuse disorders, while providing and expanding  much-needed technical assistance and access to affordable capital for  small and growing rural businesses that serve as economic engines in  our rural towns.   This bill is a good bill, a strong bill, and it is a breath of  bipartisan fresh air. Coming on the heels of our recent passage of the  first package of Senate appropriations bills for fiscal year 2019  earlier this week, we are again proving that the Senate can move  important and complicated legislation with bipartisan support when we  take the time to work with each other and we commit to keeping these  bills free of controversial items.   This bill serves as an example of why we are all here: to help those  who need it, to make sure our Nation is secure, and to protect our  natural resources for generations to come. I will work with the  chairman and ranking member to ensure that this bill passes and that we  are able to send a strong and balanced bill to the President that we  can all stand behind.    Mr. President, today, I am joining with Senator Murray in  introducing the Border Zone Reasonableness Restoration Act of 2018.  This legislation, if enacted, will establish critical privacy  protections for Americans by limiting the unjustifiably wide ``border  zone'' within which Department of Homeland Security officers may-- without a warrant--stop vehicles and search private land for the  purpose of patrolling the border.   The current 100 mile ``border zone'' was established through  regulatory fiat. While the Fourth Amendment allows limited exceptions  to the warrant requirement at or close to the border, this 100 mile  zone is neither limited nor reasonable. It includes marine borders. At  present, it encompasses almost two-thirds of the population of the  United States. This includes major cities such as New York, Seattle,  Chicago, New Orleans, and Los Angeles, even the ``border town'' of  Richmond, Virginia, as well as entire states such as Maine, Delaware,  and Florida.   The need for this legislation has never been clearer. The Trump  administration's aggressive yet wasteful use of immigration enforcement  resources has subjected law-abiding citizens to needless and intrusive  searches at Customs and Border Protection (CBP) checkpoints far from  the border. Not only do these searches produce minimal value to border  enforcement, they violate the constitutionally protected privacy of  citizens and residents of border regions, including in my home State of  Vermont. Recently, CBP agents in Vermont have boarded Greyhound buses  in Burlington without a warrant and inquired about the citizenship of  passengers. They have targeted international college students for  questioning about their legal status. In the nearby States of Maine and  New Hampshire, they have shut down interstate highways with immigration  checkpoints. In Montana, a CBP agent even stopped an American citizen  simply for speaking Spanish.   This should not be a partisan issue. This is about ensuring that  every person in this Nation receives the constitutional protections to  which they are entitled. Both the American Civil Liberties Union and  the Cato Institute have sharply criticized these practices as  problematic under the Fourth Amendment. Vermonters have rightly been  concerned about these expanded border zone searches. They believe, as I  do, that once inside our country the phrase `show me your papers' does  not belong inside the United States of America.   The Border Zone Reasonableness Restoration Act is based on an  amendment that Senator Murray and I successfully attached to  immigration reform legislation in 2013 during the Obama Administration.  The 100 mile ``border zone''--and the similar 25 mile zone where many  types of warrantless property searches are permitted--predates this  current administration, but the actions of this administration have  shown just how much we need legislation like this today.   The Fourth Amendment does not stop 100 miles from our land and sea  borders. Its protections extend whether in the heart of Kansas or in  the middle of Vermont. Ensuring that the protections of the Fourth  Amendment are available to everyone within the United States should be  important to all of us, regardless of party or ideology. I hope all  Senators will support this commonsense measure to ensure the Fourth  Amendment is upheld.                                  ______                                         By Mr. CORNYN (for himself and Mrs. Feinstein):   S. 3170.
