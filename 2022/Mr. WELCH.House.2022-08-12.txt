 Madam Speaker, as many of my colleagues know, I have  worked for years to protect patient access to pharmacies across this  nation. It is the intent of the United States House that this  legislation, and in particular, Section 1860D-14C(c). MANUFACTURER  DISCOUNT PROGRAM shall operate in the same manner as the Medicare Part  D Coverage Gap Discount Program found under 42 USC 1395w-114a. CMS  shall implement this provision to operate in the same manner with  respect to a pharmacy. In that way, this section shall not result in  any reduction in pharmacy reimbursement or require or permit price  concessions or other remuneration from the pharmacy. We will convey  this intent to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services as they  develop the rules that will govern this discount program. I will  continue to look for additional ways to help patients and to preserve  and protect our pharmacies that are so essential to communities across  Vermont and our country.
