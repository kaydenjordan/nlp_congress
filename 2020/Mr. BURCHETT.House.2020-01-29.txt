 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Knoxville  Catholic High School senior Eleni Christopoulos. Eleni has earned the  Girl Scout Gold Award and was recently named to Knox.biz's 20 Under 20  class.   When Eleni was born, she had a serious infection that needed  specialized medical care. Fortunately, she overcame her illness, but  she knows that not every sick child will get the same outcome. The  experience inspired Eleni to start a program at East Tennessee  Children's Hospital to comfort families whose children pass away in the  neonatal intensive care unit.   Eleni builds and hand-paints memory boxes for grieving families to  store cherished keepsakes like photos and footprints. While it is  impossible to ease the pain of a lost child, Eleni's memory boxes offer  the families a small comfort during a difficult time.   We don't hear enough about our young folks giving back to their  communities and taking the initiative to help others, so I congratulate  Eleni for making a meaningful difference in the Knoxville community and  for being recognized as a young leader in the 20 Under 20 class.   Eleni has a bright future ahead of her, Mr. Speaker, and I know her  grandparents and her mom and dad, and they are very proud, as I am.                            ____________________
