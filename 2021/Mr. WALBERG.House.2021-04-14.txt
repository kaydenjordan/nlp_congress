 Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Florida for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1215, Fraud and Scam Reduction  Act, and thank my colleague and friend, Representative Blunt Rochester,  as well as the Committee on Energy and Commerce staff for their hard  work in bringing the bill to the floor today.   Sadly, in today's digital age, scams targeting seniors and their  hard-earned money are growing in number and sophistication.   Every year, scammers steal billions of dollars from unsuspecting  consumers. The effect on victims can be financially and emotionally  devastating, and the COVID-19 pandemic has only made things worse.  Safeguarding seniors in Michigan and across the country needs to be a  top priority.   Retailers have diligently worked to combat these crimes. Their  ability to educate their employees with best practices and training to  recognize the signs of a scam can make a huge difference in stopping  criminals.   Our bipartisan bill builds upon the work retailers are doing by  creating a Federal advisory council at the FTC to create a unified  front against criminals who target our most vulnerable citizens and  stop this fraud before it is too late.   Mr. Speaker, I urge the House to pass H.R. 1215 so we can help stop  scammers from perpetrating a fraud and taking advantage of our loved  ones and our neighbors.
