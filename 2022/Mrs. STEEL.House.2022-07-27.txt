 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the Advancing  Telehealth Beyond COVID-19 Act.   Telehealth has been life changing for so many, especially during the  COVID-19 pandemic. Increased access to telehealth has benefited a wide  range of Americans, from seniors to high-risk patients.   We must ensure that the millions of Americans who have utilized  flexibility provisions authorized during the pandemic do not lose their  access to telemedicine.   Right now, regardless of where you live, you have access to  telehealth and virtual care. This bill ensures that this can continue  for millions of Americans, but we should ensure that this flexibility  is permanent.  [[Page H7195]]    That is why I introduced legislation with Mr. Buchanan and Mr.  Johnson to permanently remove any geographic restrictions on telehealth  services.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support our legislation and to  vote ``yes'' on today's bill so that we can continue to expand access  to quality, affordable healthcare solutions.
