 Mr. Speaker, I rise to comment on this resolution.   Our country was founded on the principle of protecting the rights of  the minority. It is considered a republic for a reason because our  Founding Fathers understood that majority rule can lead to tyranny from  the majority, mob rule, and dictatorship.   Last Congress, Speaker Pelosi and the Democrat majority took  unprecedented actions removing minority party Members from committees.  They also made a resolution of inquiry, which they used against the  Republican administration, and also eliminated the ability for the  minority party.                                time  1130    It was very disappointing. What I ask--you know, I want to  differentiate this resolution for Speaker McCarthy. He added explicitly  to this resolution to make sure that we apply the same standard not  just to Democrats but also to Republicans--and it is actually stated in  this resolution--and also added that, you know, we might look into a  process of appeal.   I agree with the gentlewoman from Pennsylvania that we didn't have  any due process because it was unprecedented what was done by her  party. So maybe at least the committee could have the ability to look  if there is a way to look at the process if that is going to be  continued.   I hope maybe we can reconcile it and have better collaboration as two  parties, as we were talking today at the prayer breakfast, on a  bipartisan basis. I think it is important for us to really look at us  as a body and start respecting the minority.   Unfortunately, the other party started this unprecedented action when  they were in the majority, and we have to work on that; how we can  reconcile.
