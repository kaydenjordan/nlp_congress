 Mr. Speaker, I come to the floor of the House this morning  to pay tribute to a close friend of mine, Monsignor George Farland, who  is celebrating the 50th anniversary of his ordination as a Catholic  priest.   On May 4, 1968, Monsignor Farland received his ministerial orders at  Cathedral of St. Michael the Archangel in my hometown of Springfield,  Massachusetts. I know because I was the CYO basketball coach at Sacred  Heart upon his arrival.   For the next half century, he has been a source of inspiration and  comfort to his faithful parishioners at Sacred Heart Church in  Springfield. Every Sunday, he provides a strong spiritual message,  frequently laced with a special grace and a sense of irony and good  humor, but always a powerful message. We have watched and witnessed as  he has rebuilt and sustained a vibrant parish in the life of its  members.   Sacred Heart Church was built by immigrants, and to this day, it  welcomes immigrants, as he frequently says in the opening phrases of  his powerful homilies: ``No matter what your status or station in life,  you are welcome in this church.''   He has found time to serve as a police chaplain for the Springfield  Police Department and also a hospital chaplain in the Sisters of  Providence Health System in Mercy Medical Center. He has surely  reinvigorated the life of the church, and is a son of Hungry Hill, a  graduate of Cathedral High School and Saint Anselm College.   His spiritual leadership in western Massachusetts has become, in  fact, legendary. He has a well-deserved reputation for compassion,  humility, and kindness. Again, the welcoming message of his inclusivity  continues to deeply resonate with those who worship at Sacred Heart  Church.   He leads his parishioners up and down that middle aisle, oftentimes  in joy and happiness or in grief of the funeral, but he always does it  with a special tolerance and grace.   Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the United States, I want to congratulate  Monsignor George Farland for reaching this important milestone in his  life, thank him for his decades of thoughtful ministry, and acknowledge  the remarkable contributions he has made to the people of all walks of  faith in the Diocese of Springfield in western Massachusetts.                            ____________________
