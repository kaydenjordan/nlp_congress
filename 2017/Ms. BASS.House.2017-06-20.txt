 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of my legislation, in  conjunction with Representative Faso, to support the education and  advancement of foster youth. I want to thank the Representative for his  leadership on this issue. I also want to thank Chairman Brady and  Ranking Member Neal for their leadership on behalf of the Nation's  foster youth.   I do think it is very remarkable, as several other speakers have  said, that today we are bringing forward five bipartisan bills to  improve the Nation's foster care system. Each one of the bills  addresses a serious challenges or gap in that system.   H.R. 2847, the Improving Services for Older Youth in Foster Care Act,  allows States to expand the Chafee Grant Program to foster youth up to  the age of 23. Currently, the program ends at 21. The Chafee Grant  Program provides educational grants and other services to help young  people transition into adulthood and become independent.   In May, as part of National Foster Youth Shadow Day that is organized  by the National Foster Youth Institute, I had the opportunity to meet a  young woman named Doniesha Thomas. Doniesha is from Los Angeles, and  spent 20 years in foster care before she aged out. She described her  foster home as abusive, and eventually she had to move several times.   Against tremendous odds, Doniesha has continued to persevere and is  currently a college student at Los Angeles Trade Tech College, majoring  in the administration of justice and minoring in paralegal studies.   Doniesha is just one of a small number of foster youth who actually  make it to college. This is despite nearly 70 percent of foster youth  expressing a desire to attend college. Those, like Doniesha, who are  accepted and attend college face another hurdle, which is graduating.  Currently, only 3 percent of foster youth who attend college graduate.  Programs like Chafee are designed to help foster youth advance in  college, trade school, and employment.   During National Foster Youth Shadow Day, I had the opportunity to  speak to many other young people, and several of them described  challenges that they face after--well, if they were lucky to graduate  high school, where they attend college and then something happens;  either they run out of resources or their housing falls through and  they have to leave college, so their college is interrupted.   That is why this legislation is so important, because it allows for  the flexibility; if the young person is not able to complete college in  4 years, they do have a couple of other years.   One of the things that many people don't realize is that when young  people age out of the foster youth system--which typically is at 18,  sometimes is at 21, depending on the State--that many times we  literally put these young people on the street. They are 18 years old.  They are in their foster home. They are given a bag, typically a large- sized trash bag, with all of their belongings, and they are put out on  the street left to fend for themselves. With today's economic  challenges, there are no 18-year-olds that can fend for themselves  without a safety net.   If we think of middle class children, transitioning into adulthood is  typically what happens at college. They go to college and they have  housing. But if they have any challenges, they can always call home.  They can text their parents. Their parents are there to rescue them in  case they run out of money or something happens with their housing or  their grades.   If we think of a young person out of the child welfare system who is  literally put on the streets at the age of 18, you can only imagine  what happens; which is why so many children in the foster care system  wind up incarcerated. Many young girls wind up trafficked; and we did  legislation on that a few weeks ago.   So if we want to stop what happens on the other end, with many young  children winding up incarcerated, or early pregnancies, or other  challenges, we need to make sure that we provide support for them early  on.   H.R. 2847 will allow the flexibility for a student, again, who might  need more time to complete their education. I urge my colleagues to  support this legislation, to give foster youth the same type of  flexibility and support that we provide our own children.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2866, and I want to  congratulate my good friends, Representatives Sewell, Kelly, and  Smucker for this legislation to reduce barriers for relative  caregivers.   Ironically, in the 1990s, when the crack cocaine epidemic hit, that  was the first time that women started using drugs equal to men. It  hadn't happened before, and so families fell apart. One of the things  that happened, in the early 1990s, was in the middle of the night a  grandmother might be called and three grandchildren delivered to her by  Children's Protective Services. The grandmother would take the children  without any support and without any knowledge of how to deal with the  trauma that the children faced.   During those years, we actually discriminated against relatives. We  said very negative things about them such as: the apple doesn't fall  far from the tree; and, if your daughter wound up on drugs, why should  we give the children to you?   So during those years, we would rather pay a stranger--and there can  be wonderful foster parents--but a stranger to take care of children  instead of families.   One of the things we did in Los Angeles was we organized the  grandmothers, and we trained them how to go before the board of  supervisors and advocate on their own behalf. That happened all around  the country. So there really was a movement of relatives who rose up  and said: We want our children; we just need help. We might be on a  fixed income, and we can't really support the children.   It is actually more expensive to put a child in foster care. So there  began a national movement for relative caregivers to fighting for their  rights and for services. So over the years, we really evolved to the  point where we have legislation like this where we recognize the  benefit of having relatives take care of children.   Ironically, the last piece of legislation we were talking about was  about children aging out of the system. Before we prioritized  relatives, what would happen is a young child who was aging out of  foster care, we would put them on the street, and the first thing they  would do would be to go look for their families because they might have  family somewhere, and they would often do that.   This legislation, I think, is extremely important to allow  flexibility for licensing of relative caregivers. Examples of  grandmothers who I worked with directly who wanted to take in their  grandchildren but they were told they didn't have enough bedrooms in  their house, and so we were going to put the children in more expensive  foster care and break them up and send them to different foster homes  instead of leaving them with the grandmother or assist her in moving.    So legislation like H.R. 2866, I believe, will begin to address some  of these challenges and do what every child needs, which is to be in a  loving home with family.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2742, the  Modernizing the Interstate Placement of Children in Foster Care Act.   Children who cannot be safely returned home deserve to be placed in  the best setting possible for them, regardless of the State where the  setting is located; and no child should have to wait to move to that  best setting because it is across the State line.                                time  1715    Separation from a parent or long-term caregiver is always traumatic  for a child. Even if relatives come forward right away, it may take  months to get licensed, months in which the child may bond with the  foster family. When the relative lives in another State, the licensing  process can often take as long as 6 months, so that might mean 6 months  in foster care. Sometimes our well-intentioned efforts to protect  children actually do them more harm.   H.R. 2742 provides States with resources to automate this process so  that social workers no longer have to photocopy documents and submit  them on paper through a succession of offices.   Last year, the National Foster Youth Institute organized a listening  tour in Representative Vicky Hartzler's district; and during a meeting  with child welfare professionals, they described the challenges they  face when relatives are identified in different States and they are  unable to quickly place the child with family and must keep the child  in foster care. The judges, social workers, and families specifically  requested Members of Congress to change the law and asked the National  Foster Youth Institute to please advocate for change. I look forward to  communicating with Representative Hartzler and her constituents about  this legislation.   I ask my colleagues to support the legislation sponsored by  Representatives Walorski and Davis, H.R. 2742.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2834, the  Partnership Grants to Strengthen Families Affected by Parental  Substance Abuse Act.   This piece of legislation is responsive to countless pleas of youth  and families seeking necessary assistance and support without  fracturing critical family bonds and relationships.   The majority of children who are removed from home are actually  removed for neglect and not physical or sexual abuse. Over 60 percent  of children are removed for neglect, and neglect is secondary to  substance abuse, mental health issues, and abject poverty.   In the 1990s, when the crack cocaine epidemic hit, we didn't  understand much about addiction, and so we were angry. We punished the  mothers. We imprisoned the mothers. We took the children away, and we  didn't realize that actually not addressing the underlying substance  abuse issue would really be more harmful to the children than removing  them and putting them into foster care.    Now that we are experiencing another epidemic related to drugs, both  with meth and with heroin, at least our knowledge base has grown a lot.  We have drug courts. We have evidence-based treatments. We have a lot  of ways that we can address families.   One of the things that we have learned is that, if you can put the  entire family in treatment, then, that way, one, the parents are not  separated from their children, the children can get help, and the  parents can get help as well.   What often happens if you remove the child from the parent is that  you set the parent up to relapse or to never actually go into treatment  because they will cycle into depression, and they will continue their  cycle of addiction.  [[Page H4968]]    We have had many children who actually wound up growing up in foster  care because their parents were removed ask us, why didn't we help the  family, why didn't we help their parents. Sadly, what has happened to  many of these children, when they grow up, they continue the same cycle  of going into depression, winding up in addiction.   Over the years, the National Foster Youth Institute in conjunction  with the Congressional Caucus on Foster Youth have organized many  different delegations and trips around the country looking at the  different foster care systems. Our very first listening tour was in Los  Angeles, and we visited a program called SHIELDS for Families.   SHIELDS for Families is a very large drug treatment program that has  functioned for over 20 years by keeping the entire family together, and  some of these families can remain in residential care for as long as a  year. They have been able to reduce the number of children who were  removed and go into the foster care system because they provide  treatment for the family as a whole.   This bill would modify the award criteria for Health and Human  Services to consider whether a partnership has a track record of  selective collaboration among child welfare, substance abuse disorder  treatment, and mental health agencies. Simply put, this bill is  designed to keep families together.   I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 2834.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2857, to  support foster care maintenance payments for children with parents in a  licensed residential facility.   Last month, when the National Foster Youth Institute sponsored Foster  Youth Shadow Day, several of the youth, in a townhall meeting that we  had, described their parents' challenges with substance abuse. One  young lady said that both of her parents were addicted to heroin, and  that she was taken into court and, in front of her, the judge said to  her parents: ``If you don't clean up, we're going to take your children  away.''                                time  1745    After she left court, she was taken away. She was removed from her  parents. Ultimately, her parents continued to use, and, sadly, both of  them died. This young woman grew up feeling guilty and feeling that  part of the reason why her parents passed away was because she was used  as leverage, and that if her parents had been kept together in drug  treatment along with her maybe she wouldn't be an orphan today and her  parents would have lived and she wouldn't have had to grow up in foster  care. H.R. 2857 will allow programs like SHIELDS for Families that does  address parental substance abuse and keeps families together to have  the resources to expand their programs.   Today, we heard five bills that addressed challenges in the child  welfare system. We know that there is a lot more that needs to be done,  but today we passed bills addressing substance abuse, relative  caregivers, we identified and addressed barriers to placement, and I am  hoping that one next step we could take would be to extend the kinship  navigator programs so that organizations like Community Coalition can  continue to provide support to relatives and expand their Kinship in  Action program.   As we improve various parts of the system, at some point we need to  address the structural problem with how the system is financed. Right  now, we have to remove a child and break up a family in order to have  the resources to help the child. We know much more now. We know what  leads a parent to neglect the child: substance abuse, mental health  issues, poverty. We need to continue to reform the system and provide  the resources to prevent a crisis. When problems are identified, why  should we wait for the neglect to occur?   Once again, I want to thank Chairman Brady, Ranking Member Neal, and  all of the sponsors of the legislation today, and I urge my colleagues  to support H.R. 2857.
