 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the SAFE Act because  Vladimir Putin conducted a sweeping and systematic campaign to disrupt  and destabilize our Presidential election in 2016.   Some say we can't pass the SAFE Act to guarantee the security of our  elections, that because of federalism, we should let the States work it  out on their own.   But we are not the fragmented, divided States of America. We are the  United States of America, and that is the way we were designed.   Article IV, Section 4 of the Constitution, Madam Speaker, says  Congress ``shall guarantee to every State in this union a republican  form of government, and shall protect each of them against invasion.''   What does it mean by ``republican form of government''? It doesn't  mean a Republican Party form of government. It means a representative  form of government. That means we must have a system that accurately  translates the popular will into the election of a Congress.   This is a massive technical challenge in a country of hundreds of  millions of people, 50 States, and thousands of jurisdictions,  especially in the computer age. We need voter-certified, paper-ballot  voting systems in every State in the Union. We need risk-reducing  audits. We need real accountability for election vendors. We need  voting machines manufactured in the United States, where our democracy  is created, too.
