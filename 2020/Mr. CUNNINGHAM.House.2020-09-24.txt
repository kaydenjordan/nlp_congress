 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Amari  President.   Amari was only 16 years young when he passed, but his wisdom was  already far beyond his years. Despite being too young to vote, he knew  the importance of his civic duty to hold public officials accountable  and to be involved in his local community.   That involvement brought Amari into my life when he attended one of  my very first townhalls and left me with a question. In my subsequent  conversations with Amari, it was clear that his leadership and vibrancy  were going to take him to big and wonderful places in life.   Anyone who was lucky enough to know Amari knew his dreams were big  but achievable for someone as bright and determined as him. You just  knew Amari would find a way to achieve every single one of them,  especially living up to his name and becoming a U.S. President one day.  And he would have my vote.   Beyond his ambition, his family knew Amari as compassionate,  empathetic, and driven to serve others. Amari wanted to spread kindness  and joy wherever he went. He went the extra mile to be a beacon of  light and knew how to brighten your day by sharing his warmth through a  big grin.   His 16 years have left an incredible imprint on the Lowcountry, and  his legacy will be found in every heart that Amari touched, including  mine.   I mourn this tragic loss with his family, his classmates, and the  massive community that was blessed to know Amari and his greatness.                            ____________________
