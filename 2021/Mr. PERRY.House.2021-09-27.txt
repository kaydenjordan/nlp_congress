 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   I hear the chairman talk about investment. Let me tell you about the  last investment of this type. We were giving, I don't know, a $100  billion slush fund to the Secretary of Energy, Secretary Granholm. When  she was Governor of Michigan, she invested $874 million of your  taxpayer dollars into, I don't know, eight energy companies. Four of  them went bankrupt within 6 years.   A123 Systems, the worst of them, received a combined $350 million in  Federal and State subsidies. What happened? Less than 6 months later,  it was sold to the Chinese for $257 million, a $100 million loss.   Let me tell you where this investment is headed. It is headed to  where the U.K. and the rest of Europe is headed.   Right now in Britain, their energy markets, U.K. electricity prices  went up 700 percent, and a 250 percent increase in gas prices in the  U.K. Germany's electricity benchmark has doubled this year.   That is where we are headed with this investment. That is where we  are headed, ladies and gentlemen. Americans are already experiencing  this. Don't let them do it. Don't vote ``yes'' on this.
