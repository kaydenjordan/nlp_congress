 Mr. Speaker, the story of Austin Tice's disappearance  and presumed imprisonment is tragic and frustrating.   I met with Austin's loving parents, Marc and Debra, last year in my  office, where they told me about the heartbreaking details of his  abduction in 2012 at a checkpoint near Damascus on his way to Beirut.   Hearing about Austin, I knew I had to do what I could to try and  help, just like these other Members who have spoken earlier. So, with  the Tices sitting in my office, I called upon the help of my Syrian- American friend and constituent, Paul Jallo. I put Mr. Jallo on  speakerphone as we brainstormed with Marc and Debra as to how we could  navigate the treachery of this situation on the ground in Syria.                                time  1645    Paul vowed to enlist the assistance of his family and friends living  in Damascus to try and garner critical information as to Austin's  current location and the identity of his captors. I cannot thank and  commend Paul enough for his continued efforts to help the Tices in this  ongoing endeavor to determine the status of Austin's well-being.   We are frustrated, Mr. Speaker, that we still can't confirm with any  degree of certainty Austin's captors, though we believe that Syrian  President al-Assad's government has within its power and influence to  see to Austin's release, despite denials of detaining him.   This is unacceptable, Mr. Speaker. Austin was not a combatant, not a  threat to al-Assad's regime, and yet he had to endure the terrible fate  of imprisonment without acknowledgment. Austin, who proudly served our  country as an officer in the United States Marine Corps, deserves  better, and his parents, Marc and Deborah Tice, who have tirelessly  fought for answers, deserve better.   Today we are going to send a message to the Syrian Government that  the United States of America has not forgotten about Austin Tice and  that we will not give up on him.   Today we are here, and we are going to stand up and fight for someone  who put himself in the face of danger to make sure that we always knew  the truth of what went on in Syria and continues to go on.   Please join me in supporting this resolution and sending a powerful  message.
