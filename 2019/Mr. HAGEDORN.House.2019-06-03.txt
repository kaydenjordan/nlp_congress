 Madam Speaker, the best gummy bears I have ever tasted  are made by a company right in southern Minnesota.   Last week, I visited Le Center and toured Maud Borup, a 112-year-old  wholesale confections company that specializes in gourmet candy, baking  kits, food gifts, and more.   Maud Borup started as a woman-owned brick-and-mortar candy shop in  St. Paul before women even had the right to vote. Today it is a  wholesale company continuing to offer opportunities for women. In fact,  96 percent of the more than 100 employees are women.   Maud Borup's president, Christine Lantinen, was recently named the  2019 Minnesota Small Business Person of the Year. Christine is an Army  vet and an entrepreneur who is making a difference in her community.   We had the opportunity to discuss regulatory issues, healthcare  reform, trade, and how Federal policies are affecting small businesses  in Minnesota.   Madam Speaker, I thank Christine and everyone at Maud Borup for being  a valuable part of Minnesota.                            ____________________
