 Mr. Speaker, Iran's youth have emerged as leaders of the  anti-regime protests--but also as a political target.   On November 16, 9-year-old Kian Pirfalak was fatally shot, becoming  the youngest killed by Iranian authorities' response to that  demonstration. Two months after Mahsa Amini's death, over 60 children  have died under Iran's brutal crackdown--children no older than my own.   These aren't accidents. Security forces are raiding grade schools  looking for student protestors. Mass arrests and violent beatdowns are  commonplace. Authorities are even holding hostage the remains of  protestors, a heartless practice meant to silence grieving relatives.   These children belong in safe schools and loving families, not in  body bags.   I strongly condemn Iran's killing of children and stand with the  protestors demanding change and accountability.   Iran should not be allowed to rob children of their lives or their  freedoms.                            ____________________
