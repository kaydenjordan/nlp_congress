 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from New York for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I reintroduced H.R. 449 to enhance counterterrorism  preparedness at the local level.   In recent years, we have seen acts of terrorism, especially in  planning and execution, take place in cities throughout our Nation.  Whether it occurs at a church in Charleston, a synagogue in Pittsburgh,  or a nightclub in Orlando, local law enforcement is the front line of  defense in protecting our communities from acts of violence. It is,  therefore, necessary to equip our first responders with the tools to  allow them to quickly adapt to the evolving terrorist threat landscape.  This bill, H.R. 449, does just that.   Today, the Department of Homeland Security's training catalogue is a  primary resource for State and local jurisdictions to find  opportunities to enhance their counterterrorism and preparedness  capabilities.   Specifically, H.R. 449 directs DHS' Office of State and Local Law  Enforcement to produce, as you have heard, and distribute an annual  catalogue of training programs and services to State, local, and Tribal  law enforcement communities. To ensure that this information is shared  throughout the law enforcement community with agencies large and small,  H.R. 449 requires this comprehensive catalogue be posted on the DHS  website, as well as on the Homeland Security Information Network.   Enactment of this bill will further strengthen the Department's  partnership with State and local law enforcement to help better protect  the homeland. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this  legislation.
