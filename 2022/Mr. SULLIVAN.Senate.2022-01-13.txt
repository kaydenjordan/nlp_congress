 Mr. President, I want to commend my colleague from  Wyoming Senator Barrasso, who has been a leader on so many of these  issues, and Senator Cruz on his bill, this important piece of  legislation that we are going to be voting on here in a couple hours.   This Nord Stream 2 sanctions bill is not just about the immediate  crisis in Ukraine, but this would be a continuation of long-term  bipartisan American strategy as it deals with Russia, energy security,  and American security. So I want to provide a little broader context to  that bipartisan strategy and put this debate and vote that we are  having here today into that context.   The U.S. commitment to European security, as we all know, is  ironclad. We fought two world wars and a cold war to protect our  interests in a free and open Europe. We expanded NATO to secure those  gains and to prevent Russia from ever building a new empire that could  threaten us or our allies.   As we all know, Russian power is not just a function of military  power; to the contrary, Vladimir Putin and the Russians for decades  have been using energy in terms of power and energy as a weapon. As a  matter of fact, it is their weapon of choice in many instances in  Europe.   Let me provide a few recent examples.   If you look at this map, one pipeline that is actually not depicted  is the so-called Brotherhood Pipeline from Russia into Ukraine, and it  goes into Europe. The Russians have cut off supplies of natural gas on  that and other pipelines going through Ukraine in 2006, in 2008, in  2014, and in 2015.   In Moldova, shortly after the defeat of a pro-Russian Government and  the election of a pro-Western one, Russia did what they normally do.  They cut off gas to that country.   And it is not just impacting countries like Ukraine. When these gas  supplies were cut off by Russia--because Vladimir Putin was angry about  something--it impacted over 18 EU countries with regard to those  cutoffs. And it is happening even today.   Just yesterday, the head of the International Energy Agency in Paris  said that Russia is already, right now, strategically limiting natural  gas to Europe during this very cold winter to pressure European nations  not to support Ukraine as the Russians amass tens of thousands of  troops on their border as we speak.   For these reasons, it has been the longstanding bipartisan American  policy to do two things as it relates to energy security: First, we  have sought, dating back to the 1980s, to block implementation of major  pipelines from Russia--from the then-Soviet Union into Europe. The  Reagan administration did this with sanctions in 1982, and we have  continued to work this element of our policy. The other element of  American bipartisan policy, as it relates to European energy security,  has been to help countries--former Soviet Union countries, particularly  in the Caspian and Central Asia area--to provide their own energy  outlets, in terms of natural gas and oil, to Europe through the  southern corridor--the BTC Pipeline.   These are all areas that Democrats and Republicans have been involved  with in terms of energy supplies to our European allies that don't go  through Russia. Some of the diplomacy here on these pipelines started  with the Clinton administration, which did a very good job on this. I  had the opportunity, as an Assistant Secretary of State in charge of  economic and energy issues in the Bush Administration, to lead efforts  on these southern corridor pipelines, and they were successful. Right  now, these pipelines are providing energy to our allies in Europe. They  don't go through Russia. They start in countries like Azerbaijan, go  through Georgia, go through Turkey. This has been very bipartisan,  supported by the Senate, and the Russians hate this. They hate it.   Why? Because it doesn't give them any control over energy into  Europe.   So, as I mentioned, today's vote is actually part of a long-term  bipartisan American strategy for decades that we have been pursuing  because we know the Russians use energy--particularly, natural gas, as  a weapon.   So how have we been doing on this? Well, at the end of the Trump  administration, we were in a very good position on European energy  security in two key areas. First, as Senator Barrasso mentioned, we had  strong--very strong--bipartisan support with regard to Nord Stream 2  sanctions, on its construction and operations. We had overwhelming  Republican and Democrat support for the sanctions that we are going to  be voting on today in the 2021 NDAA and in the 2020 NDAA--very big,  very bipartisan.   Another reason we were set up very well, in terms of Eurasian energy  security, is at the end of the Trump administration we had achieved a  longstanding bipartisan goal of American national security, economic  security, and energy security. What was that? Energy independence. We,  once again, had become the world's energy superpower.   What do I mean by that--largest producer of oil, bigger than Saudi  Arabia; largest producer of natural gas, bigger than Russia; one of the  biggest producers of renewables in the world. This is a bipartisan  goal.   With regard to European security, why was that so important? Because  it answered a huge question that the Europeans often said: If we are  going to block Nord Stream 2, Russian gas into Germany and other places  in Europe, where are we going to get the gas? Well, we had an answer:  You are going to get your gas in America.   Our exports in LNG, liquefied natural gas, surged to take care of  this problem. This is a good thing.   In terms of the environment and climate, U.S. LNG exports to Europe  have a 41-percent lower emissions profile than Russian gas and  pipelines to Europe. So it is good for the environment, climate,  national security, energy security.   And here is another area. This big production of American energy was  something that the people who know Vladimir Putin best knew that it was  one of the biggest things we could do.   A couple of years ago, I was in a meeting with my colleague whom we  miss very much here, Senator McCain, and a Russian dissident--a very  famous Russian dissident. And at the very end of the meeting, I asked:  What more can we do to undermine the Putin regime?   Do you know what he said to me? He looked me in the eye, without  hesitation, and said: Produce more American energy. That is the No. 1  thing that you can do to undermine the Putin regime.   And we did it. We did it.   So these are all things, in addition to strengthening our own  military, in addition to giving the Ukrainians Javelin missile  systems--all of these things were putting us in a good position. Putin  seemed very much in a box and certainly wasn't threatening Ukraine with  tens of thousands of troops on the  [[Page S211]]  border. Where are we today on these key areas that I just mentioned?   Well, we are not in such good shape.   In terms of energy independence, this administration seems focused on  actually destroying the production of American energy--oil and gas in  particular. I guarantee you, the dictators in Moscow as well as in  Beijing can hardly believe their luck. It seems like President Biden  wants to undermine the very bipartisan goals we had for decades-- American energy independence and the United States as the world's  energy superpower again.   Just think about what he is seeing: canceled pipelines, the Keystone  Pipeline, Canada and United States, and the President is green-lighting  Nord Stream 2; killing energy production in great States like mine.  Just Monday, there were more obstacles to produce energy in Alaska, and  now we are importing two times as much oil from Russia as we were a  year ago. That is helping Putin, hurting the United States.   What about Nord Stream 2, where we looked so strong just in the past  few years, with this body, in a strong bipartisan way, sanctioning that  pipeline right there. President Biden has green-lighted it.   But we don't have to. That is the point of this vote today. Again,  this vote is not just about the current crisis in Ukraine; it is about  continuing a long-term bipartisan approach to Eurasian energy security  that would make our European allies less vulnerable to Russian energy  blackmail, which has not only gone back decades, it is literally  happening right now. Just listen, as I mentioned, to the International  Energy Agency's report yesterday on this topic.   To be honest, it is also about a more political question, this vote  today. Many of my Democratic colleagues suddenly became very hawkish  against Russia and Putin on these issues and other issues during the  Trump years, and I welcomed their conversion to a more hard-line  approach. But it always begged the question, was that more hawkish  conversion a principled one because they realized being tough on Putin,  in terms of energy and our military, was the best way to achieve  American national interests or was this conversion more of a temporary  one, depending on who occupied the White House? I hope it is not the  latter, but today's vote will answer that for some of the Senators who  are looking to change their recent votes.   But, clearly, some of my colleagues just a few years ago, who were  voting to sanction and stop the Nord Stream 2 Pipeline and were  sounding very tough on Vladimir Putin and Russia, are now in a bit of a  quandary if they vote differently today. So, not surprisingly, they are  making arguments to rationalize this new position, and I would like to  review, briefly, just a few of those.   Senator Murphy has been down on the floor, the junior Senator from  Connecticut, with a lot of these arguments. And I respect him, a  thoughtful voice on foreign policy. I don't always agree with him, but  he is a serious voice. But his arguments on this issue right now are  not very persuasive or powerful. Here is the thing he is saying right  now: This isn't about Russia. I am quoting Senator Murphy. This is  about ``a Cruz-Trump agenda to break up the Atlantic alliance.'' A  Cruz-Trump agenda to break up the Atlantic alliance.   Now, look, he is clearly trying to make a boogeyman here, the so- called Cruz-Trump agenda. But serious people who have been working on  these issues for decades know that what we are doing today is a  continuation of long-term bipartisan support for really important  energy security policy for the United States and our European allies.  This is continuing that longstanding approach.   You know, in his quote on the Cruz-Trump agenda, he said: This is  actually about keeping the Atlantic relationship going to ``save  Ukraine from an invasion.'' To save Ukraine from an invasion.   But where is the President of Ukraine on this issue? What does the  President of Ukraine, who knows a little bit about power politics and  Putin, think about what we are doing today? He supports sanctions. He  supports sanctions on Nord Stream 2.   That is where Senator Murphy is starting to dig a little deeper on  his weak arguments and trying to provide cover for his colleagues who  are going to change their vote. He had to respond on where President  Zelensky of Ukraine was. Here is what Senator Murphy said about that:         I'm a big supporter of President Zelenskyy. But often he       misreads American politics. And I think it would have been       better for him to have stayed out of this one.    Wow.   So, as to the leader of the country, right here, whom many of us  think this is all about, who certainly knows what Russian energy power  politics are about since he has been on the pointy end of that weapon  many times, we now have a Senator saying: President Zelensky, sit down.  Be quiet. Stay out of this one. We don't want to hear from you even  though this is about ``saving'' your country--unless, of course, you  support his position on Nord Stream 2.   So these are very weak arguments by the Senator from Connecticut.   The most legitimate argument I have heard some of my Democratic  friends make on switching their vote on their previous Nord Stream 2  sanctions is that the Germans--a very important ally; we all agree on  that--don't want us to apply Nord Stream 2 sanctions. OK. That is an  argument we should all consider, and this is what I have heard  Secretary Blinken and National Security Advisor Sullivan have been  telling Senators this week as they lobby against this vote we are going  to take, although, early in the year, it was reported in the press that  both of them actually supported Nord Stream 2 sanctions.   Here is the thing on that argument. It is actually hard to tell what  the Germans really want. In fact, what the Germans really want seems to  be changing by the hour. There was a recent change in government in  Germany, and the new Foreign Minister herself has said that the country  should not grant Nord Stream 2 regulatory approval in order to resist  ``Russian blackmail'' on energy prices. This is the current Foreign  Minister of Germany.   It is also important to remember where the rest of the European Union  is. There is broad opposition in Europe on Nord Stream 2. The European  Parliament voted last year, on an overwhelming, cross-party basis--581  to 50--in favor of canceling the entire project in the wake of the  arrest of Alexei Navalny, a Russian democracy leader whom Putin first  tried to kill before locking away in prison. The European Parliament  has voted at least four further times on other resolutions to call on  the EU to halt this very project, which is what we are looking to vote  on today.   Finally, outsourcing this very important foreign policy, national  security, American issue to the Germans is simply not wise. The Germans  have not always been so clean or levelheaded when it comes to Russian  gas, Gazprom, and Nord Stream 2. What am I talking about? Well, of  course, I am talking about the former Chancellor of Germany, Gerhard  Schroder--one of the biggest betrayers of the West, certainly, in the  last century. He left his chancellorship to become Putin's Gazprom  lapdog. He is the main lobbyist who is pushing Russian gas all over  Germany and Europe. He is an embarrassment to the Atlantic Alliance. He  has been the chairman for many years of Gazprom. This is the former  Chancellor of Germany. Of course, he has influenced Germans to say this  is good. He has made millions doing it, by the way. He should be  sanctioned with other Putin cronies.   At the end of the day, this shouldn't be outsourced to Germany. What  we need to do is to take a vote on what is right for American national  security, and a vote that sanctions this pipeline would be consistent  with long-term, very bipartisan, American-Eurasian energy security  policy.   Make no mistake, my colleagues: Nord Stream 2 is Putin's pipeline.  Let's not make it his lifeline. I encourage all of my colleagues to do  what they have done recently, in the last couple of years, which is to  vote in an overwhelming, bipartisan manner to sanction the Nord Stream  2 Pipeline.   I yield the floor.
