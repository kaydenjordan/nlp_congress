 Madam Speaker, I rise today because a resolution was  introduced in this body last week supporting the Boycott, Divestment  and Sanctions, or BDS movement, against the State of Israel. Again,  seemingly right after this body passed another resolution condemning  anti-Semitism, this backwards ideology has reared its ugly head once  again in the form of H. Res. 496.   I have come to the floor today to speak to the supporters of bills  like these and the 22 Members who either voted ``nay'' or ``present''  on H. Res. 246 earlier this week, to remind them that Israel is the  only stable democracy in an otherwise volatile region of the world.   It is a place where women serve in the military and hold high office.  It is a place where all people are able to express their views without  threat from the government. It is a place where Arab citizens are  elected to the Knesset. Bottom line, Israel values human rights.   Madam Speaker, we must condemn anti-Semitism no matter where it comes  from, and I am glad the House did that earlier this week.                            ____________________
