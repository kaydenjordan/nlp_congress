 Mr. President, I call up my amendment  No. 3073 and ask that it be reported by number.    Mr. President, in over a year of  uncertainty and the pain of living through a pandemic, I have to admit  I am shocked that I have to come down here to talk about the importance  of quality, in-person education.   Today, we are debating a $4 trillion tax-and-spending bill, and that  is on top of the $2 trillion we spent in March and the $4 trillion we  spent last year. How insane is it that with all that spending, there is  still no guarantee that our kids will be back in school this fall?   The sad reality is, more than 1 million kids did not enroll in their  local schools during the pandemic. Thanks to labor union bosses and  their unneeded and damaging school shutdowns, kids have been kept out  of school, and many--far too many--have suffered psychologically.   For our children's sake, I urge all my colleagues to vote yes on my  amendment and to join me in ensuring our children are no longer  confined to virtual learning.    I agree with my colleague that we should  stop politicizing this issue. All we have done for the last several  months of this year is politicize this issue and every other major  issue.                          Vote on Amendment No. 3073    I would like to ask for the yeas and nays.
