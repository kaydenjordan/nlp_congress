 Mr. Speaker, the Massachusetts Institute of  Technology Review reported that the cost of then-candidate Trump's wall  along the southern border will be up to $40 billion for every 1,000  miles of wall. With the potential of a 2,000-mile wall along the  border, American taxpayers can expect to pay up to $80 billion for a  wall at the southern border--$80 billion for a wall we were told Mexico  would pay for, and Mexico said they will not pay for that wall.   Last year, a leading Republican Governor also suggested that we  should explore building a wall along the northern border. The northern  border wall would be 5,000 miles. A northern border wall would cost  about $400 billion using the MIT report estimates. Obviously, Canada,  like Mexico, will not pay for a silly wall.   Mr. Speaker, $480 billion to wall in the United States. What is it  with Republicans and walls? What are they afraid of? What we need is a  new infrastructure bill not to build walls, but to build bridges and  roads and to build infrastructure to put Americans back to work and to  grow the American economy.                            ____________________
