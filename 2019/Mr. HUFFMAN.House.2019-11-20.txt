 Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 182) to extend the authorization for the Cape Cod National  Seashore Advisory Commission.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 182         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. CAPE COD NATIONAL SEASHORE ADVISORY COMMISSION.         Effective September 26, 2018, section 8(a) of Public Law       87-126 (16 U.S.C. 459b-7(a)) is amended in the second       sentence by striking ``2018'' and inserting ``2028''.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the measure under consideration.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   H.R. 182, introduced by Representative Bill Keating from  Massachusetts, would reauthorize the Cape Cod National Seashore  Advisory Commission, which expired under current law in September 2018.  This bill would reauthorize and extend it until 2028.   Since the national seashore was originally created in 1961, it was  actually the first national seashore. It is the second most beautiful  national seashore, but it was the first national seashore created.   The advisory commission has served as a main forum for consultation  and coordination between local communities and the National Park  Service. Comprised of representatives from the six towns within the  park, Barnstable County, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and the  Secretary of the Interior, this advisory commission gives surrounding  communities a voice in the management of the seashore.   I thank Representative Keating for his leadership in introducing this  important legislation, and I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 182.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield as much time as he may consume to  the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Keating), who is honored to  represent the second most beautiful national seashore in America.    Madam Speaker, I respectfully request an ``aye'' vote,  and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 255) to provide for an exchange of lands with San Bernardino  County, California, to enhance management of lands within the San  Bernardino National Forest, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 255         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

SEC. 4. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS.         The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the measure under consideration.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   H.R. 255, introduced by Representative Cook, would authorize an equal  value exchange between the U.S. Forest Service and San Bernardino  County. This exchange would enable the county to build a resource  conservation and recovery facility. This will increase efficiency and  safety of timber processing and recycling in that area. In return, the  Forest Service would receive an undeveloped inholding in the San  Bernardino National Forest.   The bill is a perfect example of how, through a collaborative  process, we can meet the needs of local stakeholders while continuing  to protect our environment and public lands.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to congratulate and thank my colleague,  Representative Cook, for introducing this legislation, and I urge my  colleagues to support the bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from southern California (Mr. Aguilar).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I want to associate myself with the other comments about how much we  are going to miss Colonel Cook. We respect him. We admire him. We are  amused by him.   Let the record show he just called the Sierra Club great. I want that  to be noted.   And although he has found a way, through this bill, to create an  equal value exchange, something tells me that in the exchange of  Colonel Cook, because we are losing him, the County of San Bernardino  is making out a lot better than this institution. So I wish him well  and urge a ``yes'' vote on his good bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 263) to rename the Oyster Bay National Wildlife Refuge as  the Congressman Lester Wolff Oyster Bay National Wildlife Refuge.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 263         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. FINDINGS.         The Congress finds the following:        (1) The Oyster Bay National Wildlife Refuge was created in       1968. It is located on the north shore of Long Island in       eastern Nassau County, is the largest refuge in the Long       Island National Wildlife Refuge Complex, and receives the       most public use of all the refuges in the Complex.        (2) The State of New York designated Oyster Bay a       significant coastal fish and wildlife habitat. It is       especially important for wintering waterfowl such as black       duck, greater scaup, bufflehead, canvasback and long-tailed       ducks. Management activities include wetland restoration and       protection of the natural shoreline and vegetation.  [[Page H9076]]         (3) The refuge is unique in consisting solely of bay bottom       and adjacent shoreline up to the mean high-tide mark. Ninety       percent of New York's commercial oyster harvest comes from       the refuge. Visitors enjoy fishing, wildlife observation,       photography and environmental education. The refuge is truly       a national treasure.        (4) Many visitors are unaware that were it not for the       tireless work and advocacy of then-freshman Congressman       Lester Wolff, this area would today be an 8.5-mile causeway       and bridge across Long Island Sound between Oyster Bay and       Rye, New York, connecting Nassau and Westchester Counties.        (5) The bridge was first proposed by Robert Moses, the       well-known New York City Planner, to divert traffic from New       York City. Former Governor Nelson Rockefeller signed into law       legislation creating the bridge authorized by the New York       State Legislature in 1967.        (6) Congressman Wolff, elected in 1964, quickly decided the       bridge would be an intrusion in a pristine area, and that       Long Island Sound was a very precious resource that was       despoiled. The conservation threats in the mid-1960s were       suburban development, wetland filling, and industrial       pollution. The fight to preserve this land became an enormous       political fight and is considered to be a turning point in       New York State's environmental legacy.        (7) With State and local political and community leaders,       and especially the North Shore leaders and the Committee to       Save the Long Island Sound, Congressman Wolff arranged a       meeting with Department of the Interior representatives and       local leaders where the idea of creating a wildlife refuge       from municipal and privately owned wetlands was created.        (8) The Town of Oyster Bay, in which one end of the bridge       was to be located, deeded 5,000 acres of wetlands to the       United States to be maintained as a Federal wildlife       preserve. It was stipulated that if the Department of the       Interior agreed to an intrusion of the property, it would       revert to the town. Creating a Federal wildlife preserve       provided the land with Federal protection.        (9) Because of the vision, dedication, and perseverance of       Congressman Lester Wolff, all of us and future generations       can enjoy the beauty and magnificence of this refuge.       SEC. 2. RENAMING THE OYSTER BAY NATIONAL WILDLIFE REFUGE AS                     THE CONGRESSMAN LESTER WOLFF OYSTER BAY                     NATIONAL WILDLIFE REFUGE.         (a) Renaming.--The unit of the National Wildlife Refuge       System known as the Oyster Bay National Wildlife Refuge and       located near Oyster Bay, New York, shall be known as the       ``Congressman Lester Wolff Oyster Bay National Wildlife       Refuge''.        (b) References.--Any reference in a law, map, regulation,       document, paper, or other record of the United States to the       unit of the National Wildlife Refuge System known as the       Oyster Bay National Wildlife Refuge is deemed to be a       reference to the ``Congressman Lester Wolff Oyster Bay       National Wildlife Refuge''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the measure under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, this bill would rename the Oyster Bay National Wildlife  Refuge in New York as the Congressman Lester Wolff Oyster Bay National  Wildlife Refuge.   A long-time Congressman from Long Island, Congressman Wolff was  instrumental in creating this refuge and protecting it from unnecessary  development. Thanks to his hard work and vision, the Oyster Bay refuge  is an important stopover for wintering waterfowl, and it is also a  popular destination for outdoor recreation enthusiasts.   At 100 years old, Congressman Wolff is the oldest living Member of  Congress. This bill is a fitting tribute to him for his years of  conservation leadership, and I urge its adoption.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from New  York (Mr. Suozzi), who is the sponsor of this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I will close by commending Representative  Suozzi for his bipartisan initiative to honor the legacy of Congressman  Lester Wolff. I urge a ``yes'' vote on this bill, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 737) to prohibit the sale of shark fins, and for other  purposes, as amended.  [[Page H9077]]    The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 737         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Shark Fin Sales Elimination       Act of 2019''.       SEC. 2. PROHIBITION ON SALE OF SHARK FINS.         (a) Prohibition.--Except as provided in sections 3 and 4,       no person shall possess, offer for sale, sell, or purchase       any shark fin or product containing any shark fin.        (b) Penalty.--For purposes of section 308(a) of the       Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (16       U.S.C. 1858(a)), a violation of this section shall be treated       as an act prohibited by section 307 of that Act.       SEC. 3. EXEMPTION FOR TRADITIONAL FISHERIES, EDUCATION, AND                     SCIENCE.         Section 2 shall not apply with respect to possession of a       shark fin that was taken lawfully under a State, territorial,       or Federal license or permit to take or land sharks, if the       shark fin is separated from the shark in a manner consistent       with the license or permit and is--        (1) destroyed or discarded upon separation;        (2) used for noncommercial subsistence purposes in       accordance with State or territorial law;        (3) used solely for display or research purposes by a       museum, college, or university, or by any other person under       a State or Federal permit to conduct noncommercial scientific       research; or        (4) retained by the license or permit holder for a       noncommercial purpose.       SEC. 4. EXEMPTION FOR DOGFISH.         (a) In General.--It shall not be a violation of section 2       for any person to possess, offer for sale, sell, or purchase       any fresh or frozen raw fin or tail from any stock of the       species Mustelus canis (smooth dogfish) or Squalus acanthias       (spiny dogfish).        (b) Report.--By not later than January 1, 2027, the       Secretary of Commerce should review the exemption in       subsection (a) and should prepare and submit to the Congress       a report that includes a recommendation on whether the       exemption should continue or be terminated. In preparing such       report and making such recommendation, the Secretary should       analyze factors including--        (1) the economic viability of dogfish fisheries with and       without the continuation of the exemption;        (2) the impact to ocean ecosystems of continuing or       terminating the exemption;        (3) the impact on enforcement of the ban contained in       section 3 caused by the exemption; and        (4) the impact of the exemption on shark conservation.       SEC. 5. INCLUSION OF RAYS AND SKATES IN SEAFOOD TRACEABILITY                     PROGRAM.         Not later than one year after the date of the enactment of       this Act, the Secretary of Commerce shall revise section       300.324 of title 50, Code of Federal Regulations, to include       rays and skates in the species and species groups specified       in subsection (a)(2) of such section.       SEC. 6. DEFINITIONS.         In this Act:        (1) Shark.--The term ``shark'' means any species of the       orders Pristiophoriformes, Squatiniformes, Squaliformes,       Hexanchiformes, Lamniformes, Carchariniformes,       Orectolobiformes, and Heterodontiformes.        (2) Shark fin.--The term ``shark fin'' means the raw,       dried, or otherwise processed detached fin, or the raw,       dried, or otherwise processed detached tail, of a shark.       SEC. 7. STATE AUTHORITY.         Nothing in this Act affects any right of a State or       territory of the United States to adopt or enforce any       regulation or standard that is more stringent than a       regulation or standard in effect under this Act.       SEC. 8. DETERMINATION OF BUDGET EFFECTS.         The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the measure under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, this bill would make it legal to possess, buy, or sell  shark fins in the United States.   Now, everyone knows sharks are in trouble. Around the globe, one- quarter of sharks and their relatives are threatened with extinction.  They are being caught and killed on average 30 percent faster than they  can reproduce, in large part due to the demand for their fins to fuel  the global shark fin trade. The fins from as many as 73 million sharks  enter the shark fin trade every single year.   As top predators in the oceans, they play a critical role in  ecosystems impacting our fisheries, coral reefs, and tourism economies.  The concern for declining shark populations and the impact of their  loss and the impact that loss has on ecosystems and tourism alike has  led to increased efforts to conserve sharks globally, including no-take  marine reserves, species-specific fishing bans, and shark fin trade  bans.   While the United States has banned the practice of shark finning, we  have not banned the buying and selling of shark fins, which means that  we are still a part of the problem.   States and the private sector are catching on. Already 12 States,  three territories, 40 airlines, and 20 major international shipping  companies and other corporations such as Amazon, Disney, Hilton, and  Grubhub have all refused to partake in this trade that devastates shark  populations around the world.   And just this year Canada passed a similar bill, in large part thanks  to our efforts here. That is the intention of this bill. When the  United States steps up to lead, others will follow.   H.R. 737 would build on the leadership of these States, territories,  and companies by eliminating shark fin sales and possession in the  United States.   In addition to its 287 bipartisan cosponsors, this bill enjoys the  support of recreational fishing interests, aquariums, over 150  scientists, 150 chefs, over 300 dive businesses and over 130  nonprofits. With this overwhelming support and at a time when so many  shark populations are depleted, it is of utmost importance that we pass  this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I want to commend Congressman Sablan for his leadership  and also Congressman McCaul for his leadership on this bill, and I urge  my colleagues to support it.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I would just note, that in California,  where I authored a very similar ban on the possession, sale, and trade  of shark fins, the sky has not fallen, the world has not ended. All of  the calamities that my friend just predicted have not taken place, and  guess what, there continues to be a sustainable shark fishery for the  meat without contributing to the global shark fin trade that is driving  the decimation of shark populations around the world.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from The Northern  Mariana Islands (Mr. Sablan), the author of this bill.    Mr. Speaker, just another shout-out to Congressman  McCaul and his wife, who was a fantastic witness at the hearing we had  on this bill at the Natural Resources Committee, and also for the  leadership of the State of Texas and so many other States, territories,  and leaders in the  [[Page H9079]]  private sector who understand we have to end this terribly wasteful and  cruel global shark fin trade.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from South Carolina  (Mr. Cunningham).    Mr. Speaker, if this is a question that requires us to  listen to the experts and the scientists about how to end the global  shark fin trade, then it is not much of a debate, because over 150  scientists are on record supporting this bill. The same consensus  exists among leaders at aquariums, academic institutions, and other  places.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Oregon (Mr.  Blumenauer).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Webster for his engagement on this issue. I  think his intentions are noble. I think he wants to help end the global  shark fin trade. Unfortunately, though, his bill just won't work.   We did incorporate some of that bill, the part, frankly, that would  not cost a lot of money. By doing so, we added skates and rays to the  seafood import monitoring program. That is a good suggestion, because  skates and rays are also not doing well globally, and they deserve our  attention.   But the rest of the bill is expensive, cumbersome, and, frankly, it  is just not going to work. It would require a complicated, expensive  certification scheme that might sound good on paper, but we know the  real world that we live in.   In the marine fisheries management in the United States right now, we  are years, and sometimes decades, behind having the resources we need  for adequate and timely stock assessments, even for the fisheries that  we are already trying to manage right now.   So the idea that we would somehow be able to do this, be able to  afford it, and also do it in a way that we could comply with in this  country so we could hold other countries around the world to that  standard, if we are unable to do all of that stuff, then requiring  other countries to meet that standard would trigger a WTO violation and  we would do nothing to help end the global shark fin trade.   Again, I appreciate the gentleman's interest in this issue. I know  that Florida has been said to be the heart of the opposition to this  bill, but we should note that 19 members of the Florida delegation  support this bill, including 6 Republicans in the Florida delegation.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, again, I agree with my friend: We should listen to the  scientists--not the two who my friend  [[Page H9083]]  cited in his closing arguments, but how about the over 150 who are on  record in support of this bill? We should listen to them.   We should listen to the many States and territories and other  nations, including, recently, Canada, our neighbor to the north.   We should listen to the many corporate leaders around the world, all  of whom have reached the inevitable conclusion that, if you are serious  about ending this wasteful and inhumane and horrific practice of shark  finning, then you have to tackle the shark fin trade; you have to ban  the possession and sale of shark fins, because, if you don't, we know  here in the United States we have banned the practice of shark finning  for years, and yet we have continued to be part of and contributed to  the global shark fin trade because we don't ban the possession and  trade and sale of the fin itself.   That is what this bill does.   And in terms of U.S. fishermen who are, as my friend says, following  the laws and doing everything right, well, the good news is they are  going to be just fine under this law. We know that because, in States  like California, Oregon, Texas, and other places, folks who want to  continue fishing for shark meat have been able to do so, even though  those States have passed bans just like this on the possession, trade,  and sale of shark fins.   This is a good bill. It is an overwhelmingly bipartisan bill. It is a  bill that includes support from 19 members of the Florida delegation,  including 6 Republicans from that delegation.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes,'' and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 1088) to authorize the Society of the First Infantry  Division to make modifications to the First Division Monument located  on Federal land in Presidential Park in District of Columbia, and for  other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1088         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``First Infantry Recognition       of Sacrifice in Theater Act'' or the ``FIRST Act''.       SEC. 2. MODIFICATION TO FIRST DIVISION MONUMENT.         (a) Authorization.--The Society of the First Infantry       Division (an organization described in section 501(c)(3) of       the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and exempt from taxation       under section 501(a) of that code), may make modifications       (including construction of additional plaques and stone       plinths on which to put the plaques) to the First Division       Monument located on Federal land in President's Park in the       District of Columbia that was set aside for memorial purposes       of the First Infantry Division, in order to honor the members       of the First Infantry Division who paid the ultimate       sacrifice during United States operations, including       Operation Desert Storm, Operation Iraqi Freedom and New Dawn,       and Operation Enduring Freedom. The First Infantry Division       at the Department of the Army shall collaborate with the       Department of Defense to provide to the Society of the First       Infantry Division the list of names to be added.        (b) Non-Application of Commemorative Works Act.--Subsection       (b) of section 8903 of title 40, United States Code (commonly       known as the ``Commemorative Works Act''), shall not apply to       actions taken under subsection (a) of this section.  [[Page H9085]]         (c) Funding.--Federal funds may not be used to pay any       expense of the activities of the Society of the First       Infantry Division which are authorized by this section.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the matter under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, this bill introduced by Representative Marshall would  honor the heroism of the soldiers of the U.S. Army's 1st Infantry  Division by authorizing the installation of additional plaques at the  First Infantry Division Monument located in the National Park Services'  President's Park just south of the White House.   These additions would include the names of over 600 1st Infantry  Division soldiers who paid the ultimate sacrifice in service to our  Nation during Operation Desert Storm, Operation Enduring Freedom,  Operation Iraqi Freedom, and Operation New Dawn, ensuring that these  fallen soldiers are not forgotten.   For over 100 years now, soldiers of the U.S. Army's 1st Infantry  Division have embodied their motto: ``No mission too difficult, no  sacrifice too great. Duty first.''   I am proud to rise in strong support of this bill and the brave  soldiers of the 1st Infantry Division and I want to thank  Representative Marshall for championing this important legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support it, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close, so I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I commend Congressman Marshall for that  very moving presentation and for the impressive history that he  recounted of the 1st Infantry Division.   This is a great bill, an important bill, and I know we are all very  proud to support it. I urge a ``yes'' vote, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 1446) to require the United States Postal Service to  continue selling the Multinational Species Conservation Funds  Semipostal Stamp until all remaining stamps are sold, and for other  purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1446         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Multinational Species       Conservation Funds Semipostal Stamp Reauthorization Act of       2019''.       SEC. 2. REAUTHORIZATION; REQUIREMENT TO SELL ALL STAMPS.         (a) In General.--Section 2(c) of the Multinational Species       Conservation Funds Semipostal Stamp Act of 2010 (39 U.S.C.       416 note; Public Law 111-241) is amended--        (1) in paragraph (2)--        (A) by striking ``of at least 6 years,''; and        (B) by inserting before the period at the end the       following: ``and ending not earlier than the date on which       the United States Postal Service provides notice to Congress       under paragraph (5)''; and        (2) by adding at the end the following:        ``(5) Requirement to sell all stamps printed.--        ``(A) In general.--The United States Postal Service shall       sell each copy of the Multinational Species Conservation Fund       Semipostal Stamp that the United States Postal Service prints       under this Act.        ``(B) Notification of congress.--The United States Postal       Service shall notify the Committee on Homeland Security and       Governmental Affairs of the Senate and the Committee on       Oversight and Reform of the House of Representatives when all       copies of the Multinational Species Conservation Fund       Semipostal Stamp printed under this Act have been sold.''.        (b) Retroactive Applicability.--The amendments made by       subsection (a) shall take effect as if enacted on the day       after the date of enactment of the Multinational Species       Conservation Funds Semipostal Stamp Reauthorization Act of       2013 (Public Law 113-165; 128 Stat. 1878).       SEC. 3. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS.         The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the measure under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1446. It is a bill that  would require the U.S. Postal Service to continue selling the  Multinational Species Conservation Funds Semipostal Stamp. It would  require those continued sales until such time as the remaining stamps  are sold.   Now, since 2010, these stamps have been sold by the U.S. Postal  Service to support international conservation efforts, but the  authorization for these sales has expired, leaving 49 million stamps  unsold--printed, but unsold. Americans care deeply about wildlife, and  by purchasing these stamps, they can support the Multinational Species  Conservation Fund, which includes five grant programs that support the  conservation of African and Asian elephants, great apes, marine  turtles, rhinos and tigers.   Between 2011 and 2017, the stamp sales from this program generated  $3.9 million, and that money went to conservation projects related to  antipoaching, capacity building, community engagement and outreach,  habitat restoration, and raising public awareness of wildlife  trafficking.   Mr. Speaker, 49 million stamps have already been printed. They are  sitting and waiting to be sold. This bill doesn't authorize the  printing of any new stamps, but it does direct the U.S. Postal Service  to continue selling the stamps it has printed until they are exhausted.   At a time when so many species are threatened with extinction due to  climate change, habitat loss, and exploitation, we must do more to  protect wildlife.   Mr. Speaker, I do not have another speaker at this point, and I  reserve the balance of my time.                                          House of Representatives,                                  Committee on Natural Resources,                                 Washington, DC, September 30, 2019.      Hon. Elijah E. Cummings,      Chair, Committee on Oversight and Reform,      House of Representatives, Washington DC.        Dear Chair Cummings: I write to you concerning H.R. 1446       the, ``Multinational Species Conservation Funds Semipostal       Stamp Reauthorization Act of 2019.''        I appreciate your willingness to work cooperatively on this       legislation. I recognize that the bill contains provisions       that fall within the jurisdiction of the Committee on       Oversight and Reform. I acknowledge that your Committee will       not formally consider H.R. 1446 and agree that the inaction       of your Committee with respect to the bill does not waive any       future jurisdictional claim over the matters contained in the       bill that fall within your Committee's Rule X jurisdiction.        I will ensure that our exchange of letters is included in       the Congressional Record during floor consideration of the       bill. I appreciate your cooperation regarding this       legislation and look forward to continuing to work with you       as this measure moves through the legislative process.            Sincerely,                                               Raul M. Grijalva,                                                              Chair,      House Natural Resources Committee.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                               Committee on Oversight and Reform,                                   Washington, DC, October 16, 2019.      Hon. Raul Grijalva,      Chairman, Committee on Natural Resources,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Grijalva: I am writing to you concerning the       bill H.R. 1446, the Multinational Species Conservation Funds       Semipostal Stamp Reauthorization Act of 2019. There are       certain provisions in the legislation which fall within the       Rule X jurisdiction of the Committee on Oversight and Reform.        In the interest of permitting your committee to proceed       expeditiously to consideration of this important bill, I am       willing to waive this Committee's right to consider the bill.       I do so with the understanding that by waiving consideration       of the bill, the Committee does not waive any future       jurisdictional claim over the subject matters contained in       the bill which fall within its Rule X jurisdiction. I request       that you urge the Speaker to name members of this Committee       to any conference committee which is named to consider such       provisions.        Please place this letter into the committee report on H.R.       1446 and into the Congressional Record during consideration       of the measure on the House floor. Thank you for the       cooperative spirit in which you have worked regarding this       matter and others between our respective committees.            Sincerely,                                                Elijah E. Cummings,                                                          Chairman.     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from California (Mr.  McClintock). It is good to have bipartisan support for this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I yield back the balance of  my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 1472) to rename the Homestead National Monument of America  near Beatrice, Nebraska, as the Homestead National Historical Park.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1472         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. HOMESTEAD NATIONAL HISTORICAL PARK.         (a) In General.--The first section of the Act of March 19,       1936 (16 U.S.C. 450u), is amended by striking ``designated''       and all that follows through the end and inserting       ``designated the `Homestead National Historical Park'.''.        (b) References.--Any reference in a law, map, regulation,       document, paper, or other record of the United States to the       unit of the National Park System known as ``The Homestead       National Monument of America'' shall be considered to be a       reference to the ``Homestead National Historical Park''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that Members have 5  legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the measure under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1472, introduced by my friend Representative Smith  from Nebraska, would rename the Homestead National Monument of America  near Beatrice, Nebraska, to the Homestead National Historical Park.   In 1862, President Lincoln signed the Homestead Act, and this enabled  citizens to own a portion of the vast public lands across the Western  United States.   To commemorate the first claim under the Homestead Act, Congress  established the Homestead National Monument of America in 1936; serving  as a lasting memorial to the over 1.6 million claims that built the  American West.   Today, the Homestead National Monument of America consists of the  first site successfully claimed under the Homestead Act, the Freeman  School, a heritage museum, hiking trails, and 100 acres of restored  tall grass prairie. Redesignating this important monument as a national  historical park would provide a more accurate and appropriate  description of the scope and complexity of the site's resources and  would conform the park's designation to Park Service standards.   Mr. Speaker, again, I thank my colleague Representative Smith for  introducing this bill, and I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 1472. I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, this is a good bill. The community of  Beatrice--I just had to say it one more time because I like that  pronunciation--is fortunate to be home to what will hopefully soon be  America's newest historical park, the Homestead National Historical  Park, and is also fortunate to have been represented over the years by  these two fine gentlemen from Nebraska.   Mr. Speaker, I urge an ``aye'' vote on this bipartisan bill, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 1487) to direct the Secretary of the Interior to conduct a  special resource study of portions of the Los Angeles coastal area in  the State of California to evaluate alternatives for protecting the  resources of the coastal area, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1487         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Santa Monica Mountains       National Recreation Area Boundary Adjustment Study Act''.       SEC. 2. RESOURCE STUDY OF THE LOS ANGELES COASTAL AREA,                     CALIFORNIA.         (a) Definitions.--In this section:        (1) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary       of the Interior.        (2) Study area.--The term ``study area'' means the       coastline and adjacent areas to the Santa Monica Bay from       Will Rogers State Beach to Torrance Beach, including the       areas in and around Ballona Creek and the Baldwin Hills and       the San Pedro section of the City of Los Angeles, excluding       the Port of Los Angeles north of Crescent Avenue.        (b) Special Resource Study.--        (1) Study.--The Secretary shall conduct a special resource       study of the study area.        (2) Contents.--In conducting the study under paragraph (1),       the Secretary shall--        (A) evaluate the national significance of the study area;        (B) determine the suitability and feasibility of       designating the study area as a unit of the National Park       System;        (C) consider other alternatives for preservation,       protection, and interpretation of the study area by the       Federal Government, State or local government entities, or       private and nonprofit organizations;        (D) consult with interested Federal agencies, State or       local governmental entities, private and nonprofit       organizations, or any other interested individuals; and        (E) identify cost estimates for any Federal acquisition,       development, interpretation, operation, and maintenance       associated with the alternatives.        (3) Applicable law.--The study required under paragraph (1)       shall be conducted in accordance with section 100507 of title       54, United States Code.        (4) Report.--Not later than 3 years after the date on which       funds are first made available for the study under paragraph       (1), the Secretary shall submit to the Committee on Natural       Resources of the House of Representatives and the Committee       on Energy and Natural Resources of the Senate a report that       describes--        (A) the results of the study; and        (B) any conclusions and recommendations of the Secretary.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous materials on the measure under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1487, introduced by my colleague Ted Lieu from  California, would direct the National Park Service to conduct a special  resource study to determine the suitability and feasibility of  designating a new national recreation area along the Santa Monica Bay  coastline or incorporating the area into the existing Santa Monica  Mountains National Recreation Area.   Expanding the National Park Service to include this area would  significantly enhance recreational and public lands access in one of  our Nation's most congested, polluted, and park-poor regions, Los  Angeles County.  [[Page H9089]]    Although our public lands belong to all Americans, many simply don't  have the opportunity or the resources to visit these incredible places.  H.R. 1487 would help us take an important step toward ensuring that  public lands access exists for all Americans, and I thank my colleague  Congressman Lieu for championing this proposal.   Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge my colleagues to support this bill, and  I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from California (Mr. Ted Lieu).    Mr. Speaker, I urge an ``aye'' vote with no caveats, and  I thank the gentleman, and I yield back the balance of my time.
