 Mr. Speaker, I regret to inform the House that my  predecessor, Anthony ``Tony'' C. Beilenson, died over the weekend.   Anthony Beilenson was known for integrity, civility, intelligence,  courage, and a willingness to work across the aisle, even when that  caused him to differ from the orthodoxy of his own party.   He served in this House for 20 years, from 1977 through 1997, and  served for 2 years as chair of the House Permanent Select Committee on  Intelligence. He passed on Sunday, and I ask that Members rise and that  the House observe a moment of silence.                            ____________________
