 Mr. President, the House's plan to repeal the Affordable  Care Act is dangerous and irresponsible. Just listen to Governor John  Kasich, Republican Governor of my State, who says we should not be  throwing 500, 600, 700,000 Medicaid beneficiaries--mostly people who  have jobs and work in low-income jobs--we shouldn't throw them off  their insurance. In fact, in Ohio there are 900,000 people--700,000 on  Medicaid, 100,000 on their parents' healthcare plan, and another  100,000 on the exchanges--who would lose their insurance if the House  succeeds and the Senate goes along in changing dramatically or  repealing the Affordable Care Act.   My office is flooded with letters and calls from Ohioans begging us  not to take away their care. Let me share some of those letters.   A woman from Beachwood, OH, in Northeast Ohio wrote to me on January  11 terrified of possible changes to the Medicaid system that helps fund  nursing homes like the one where she lives. She writes:         I strongly believe changes would drastically diminish my       quality of life and many other residents' in the nursing home       setting. My care needs are currently well managed by       qualified and caring staff members. I am a 2-person assist       with dressing, bathing, and getting to the bathroom. I also       require two people with getting dressed every morning.        Medicaid cuts would decrease the number of staff members. .       . . Without adequate staff, I am afraid of extensive wait       periods and frequent bathing accidents. . . . It would be       very difficult to endure, cause embarrassment, while       destroying my dignity in the process.        I am not as strong as I used to be. I have children who       love and care for me and placed me in a safe environment.       Living in the nursing home has allowed me to live a little       better, smile a little longer, and enjoy my days with family       members.    ``Please consider,'' she writes, ``the people who will be affected  the most.''   Understand that most Medicaid dollars--dollars that unfortunately  Republicans want to block-grant or capitate in some way, whatever terms  they want to use here, send to the States, shrink those dollars, and  people like this lady from Beachwood will be the losers as a result.  Understand again that most Medicaid dollars--two-thirds of them--go to  nursing home care. ``Please consider the people who will be affected  the most,'' she writes.   Another woman from Mount Vernon, OH, a part of the State where I grew  up in Mansfield, wrote to urge us not to rip coverage away from  individuals who are currently receiving mental health and addiction  services. She writes:         As a constituent concerned about preserving access to       lifesaving mental health and addiction services, I am writing       today to urge and request your support in protecting the       Affordable Care Act and preserving Medicaid expansion.        I work as a substance abuse counselor in Knox County and       work with adolescents and women with co-occurring disorders.       Without the Medicaid expansion, many of our clients would not       be able to get the help they need.    Without ObamaCare, without the Affordable Care Act.         Without the Medicaid expansion, many of our clients would       not be able to get the help they need.    Today in Ohio, 200,000 people are in the midst of opioid addiction  treatment, and 200,000 of them have insurance so they could get that  treatment delivered in the right way and have insurance because of the  Affordable Care Act. This House proposal would just rip it away from  them.   She goes on to write:         Knowing that they can receive help and healthcare often is       one of the motivating factors for our clients to begin to       make change. Their ability to access medications such as       Vivitrol through Medicaid has been a strengthening point in       the recovery process of many. With our teens, I have seen       them be able to change substance use with the resources that       Medicaid provides.    In other words, some of them are breaking their addiction and some of  them are being cured because of the Affordable Care Act, because they  have Medicaid.         Medicaid allows our rural and low-income teens--    And of the 88 counties in Ohio, 70 or so are classified as small town  or rural, like the county I grew up in, Richland County--       many of whom otherwise would not be able to attend treatment       due to transportation barriers--to attend treatment through       public transportation. Working with these clients, you learn       their stories. So many have been through unimaginable trauma,       losses, and emotional/physical pain. Many have never had the       support to help them begin to work through these issues       underlying the substance use.    She is worried. The lady in Mount Vernon, OH, is worried, with very  good reason, that these repeal plans would ``leave millions of  Americans without access to needed mental health and addictions  treatment in our state and communities.''   Most recently, a woman in Butler County--the congressional district  of former Speaker John Boehner and some members of my staff, past and  present--writes:         I am extremely concerned about the cuts President Trump and       the Republican-led Congress propose to make in the Medicaid       program and services for the developmentally disabled.    Her son is 14 years old. He was diagnosed with a specific type of  autism. He is nonverbal, with severe cognitive and physical challenges.  She wrote to my office how Medicaid has been ``a godsend'' for her and  her family. Before her son received a waiver under the Medicaid  Program, her family was spending $100 a month in copays for psychiatric  medications alone. That is in addition to all the extra medical costs  in caring for a severely challenged child. They couldn't afford the  physical therapy he needs, despite having insurance coverage through  her husband's employer. She wrote that Medicaid ``more than anything  else, improved the quality of my son's life, and by extension, the life  of our whole family.''   Understand that health challenges--especially mental health  challenges but health challenges overall--in one member of a family  afflict the whole family. That is something we should remember as this  Congress seems to rush pell-mell into trying to repeal Medicare, trying  to repeal the Affordable Care Act.   These three letters are three of hundreds of thousands that we  received--hundreds of thousands of letters and calls that Members of  the Senate are receiving. I don't understand how, when 20 million  people will lose their insurance, so many Members of Congress, who  themselves have government-financed health insurance--we have health  insurance in this body paid for by taxpayers, most of us. Yet we think  it is appropriate to pass legislation in part giving tax cuts to the  richest Americans and at the same time stripping away Medicare  benefits, taking 22 million people who now have insurance off of that  insurance and proposing minor insurance for some of them but not nearly  all of them. If we are people of God, if we are people who care about  our constituents, how we can do that is just beyond me.   I go back to the quote from one of the people I read about today from  Beachwood. She writes: ``Please consider the people who will be  affected the most.''                     Consumer Financial Protection Bureau    Mr. President, President Trump declared this week Consumer Protection  Week, but his proclamation has gaping holes. It ignores the many ways  large corporations cheat consumers and the biggest tool Americans have  to fight back.   Not once did the proclamation mention the Consumer Financial  Protection Bureau, which has returned $12 billion to 29 million  consumers. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau was created under  Dodd-Frank 8 or 9 years ago. Not once does it talk about the  unscrupulous lenders who targeted Americans with predatory mortgages  before blowing up the economy in 2007 and 2008. Not once does the  President's Consumer Protection Week proclamation mention the millions  of fake accounts opened by Wells Fargo. Not once does it mention the  shady outfits that set up shop outside the gates of our military bases  and the payday  [[Page S1632]]  lenders and other unscrupulous lenders who set up shop outside the  gates of the military bases because they aren't allowed on the military  bases as they try to exploit our service men and women and their  families.   Not only did the President ignore some of the most pressing consumer  protection issues, his administration is attacking the most important  consumer advocate indeed--the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.   Last week, President Trump's Department of Justice filed papers in  Federal court signaling that it will argue that the CFPB shouldn't be  independent. The President and White House want the CFPB under their  control so they can weaken it, so they can help Wall Street, so they  can take away some of its power. They think the President should have  the power to fire the head of the agency for any reason.   The whole reason we wrote it to be independent was to protect it from  a President who chose Wall Street over Main Street. It was Presidential  Candidate Trump who sounded pretty good standing up to Wall Street and  helping Main Street. If you look at the nominees, his appointments, and  his actions so far, it has been exactly the opposite. He has been the  president of Wall Street and at the same time exploiting Main Street.  It means that what the President has proposed is that the President can  fire his director for doing his job: stepping on the toes of special  interests.   The CFPB works in part because it has an independent Director. The  current Director of the CFPB, Richard Cordray from Ohio, has protected  consumers, has returned billions to Americans who were cheated and who  were taken advantage of by big companies.   The CFPB has an independent budget. Banks can't kill it by lobbying  it and cutting off its budget. That is the point. People whom he has in  many cases recovered money from because he represents consumers--those  banks, those large Wall Street banks and other financial institutions,  because of the way it is set up, can't lobby Congress to take money  away from it and put it out of business. Special interests have  relentlessly attacked the CFPB since the day we created it.   President Trump ran on the promise of protecting the little guy, but  he hasn't followed through on the promise of protecting ordinary  Americans from some of the wealthiest, most privileged special  interests in this town.   If you are one of the 29 million Americans who received help from  CFPB, you might know how important saving it is, but you might not know  how important it is to especially protecting one group of people, and  that is protecting our veterans and our servicemembers. The CFPB has an  entire office that is dedicated to helping men and women who have  served in uniform--the Office of Servicemember Affairs.    A couple of weeks ago, my Rhode Island Senator friend, Jack Reed, was  in the Armed Services Committee with the senior enlisted advisers of  military services--the Army, Air Force, Navy, Marines. Their job is to  make sure our servicemembers and their families are getting the support  they need. Every one of them had great things to say about the CFPB's  Office of Servicemember Affairs--of the value it provides and the  support it provides to the men and women who sacrifice so much for our  country.   Senator Reed brought up an alarming figure. A recent report estimated  that thousands of servicemembers are forced out of service every year  because of financial hardships--problems with their mortgages, with  payday loans, with credit card debt. One will remember earlier in the  presentation that I talked about how many of these financial groups set  up right outside military bases. That causes a tragedy for these men  and women who want to serve their country, and it causes tragedy for  their families. It costs taxpayers $57,000 every time someone is forced  out of service. Many other servicemembers lose their security  clearances because of financial trouble, which directly affects the  mission readiness that is brought on by shady business practices.   The CFPB is stepping in to protect these heroes who are often taken  advantage of. The CFPB's Office of Servicemember Affairs is led by men  and women who have served in the military and know what kind of help  servicemembers need. They visit 145 military facilities across the  country in order to help servicemembers get their finances straightened  out and to hear about their concerns. They have handled 70,000  complaints from servicemembers and veterans about abusive practices by  financial institutions. They have returned $130 million back to  servicemembers and their families simply by enforcing the law and  protecting those consumers.   The CFPB protects the men and women who protect our country. It  protects all of us. The best way to celebrate Consumer Protection Week  is not through words and proclamations, it is through actions.   We need to combat cyber crimes and identity theft, as the President  mentioned, but we also need to combat all kinds of tricks and traps-- loans with outrageous interest rates, for-profit colleges that promise  far more than they deliver, lenders who discriminate based on race. The  list goes on and on.   I urge my colleagues to join me in working to ensure that the CFPB  remains a strong, active ally in the cause of consumer protection this  week, next week, every week.   I yield the floor.
