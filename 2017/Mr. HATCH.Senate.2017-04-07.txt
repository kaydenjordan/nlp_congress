 Madam President, I really appreciate my colleague for his  comments. He is one of the great Senators here, and we all pay  attention to what he has to say, especially on foreign policy and  military affairs, but also on so many other things as well. People  ought to be listening to what he is saying with regard to this  judgeship. I have great respect for Senator McCain and always will. He  is one of the truly great Senators in this body. I just wish my  colleagues on the other side would pay a little more attention to what  he is having to say here today. So I thank the Senator.
