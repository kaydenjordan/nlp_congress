 Mr. Speaker, recently, a grassroots group of  servicemembers created a survey called the ``Congressional Survey of  Accountability, Truth, and Freedom.'' The survey includes over 60 pages  of testimony from nearly 600 servicemembers describing the  discriminatory treatment they have received from the Department of  Defense in their attempts to receive a religious or medical exemption  from COVID-19 vaccine mandates.   Experienced servicemembers are facing an unfair choice: Get the shot  against their personal or religious beliefs in order to continue their  patriotic service in defense of our freedoms or sacrifice their  military careers and risk the benefits that help their families make  ends meet.   I am aware that certain branches of the military are self-reporting  information on religious and medical exemptions. However, it is  important that there is a detailed, congressionally mandated report  that requires the Department of Defense to be as transparent as  possible regarding their denials of religious and medical exemptions.   My amendment would require the DOD to report every 60 days on the  number of religious and medical exemptions for the COVID-19 vaccine  requirement requested and denied and the reasons for such denials; the  number of members denied an exemption who then complied with the  requirement and got the shot against their beliefs; and the number of  members denied an exemption who did not comply and were separated from  service. We need to bring to light just how many servicemembers have  been coerced to get the vaccine or forced to separate and for what  reasons.   This mandate is putting our national security at risk for no good  reason, and I am certain this amendment will prove that.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support my amendment.
