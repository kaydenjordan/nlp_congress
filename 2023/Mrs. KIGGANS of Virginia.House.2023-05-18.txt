 Mr. Speaker, over the past 2 years, our  Hampton Roads and Navy communities have been devastated by multiple  sailor suicides, in particular aboard the USS George Washington and at  MARMAC.   As a former Navy helicopter pilot and a primary care nurse  practitioner, it infuriates me that the number of sailors who die by  suicide continues to rise.   It is clear for anyone to see we have to better serve those who serve  our great Navy and our country.   That is why this week I introduced the Sailor Standard of Care Act.  This important bipartisan legislation would increase mental health  resources and require mental health screenings for sailors assigned to  limited duty, address challenges servicemembers and their families face  accessing mental health care through TRICARE and implement a system to  track quality of life programs and their success rates.   It is imperative that we address the mental health challenges facing  today's Active Duty servicemembers and veterans and that we do it  today. This is exactly why I came to Congress.   We speak so much about providing our military men and women with the  necessary equipment, technology, training, et cetera, to be able to  ``fight tonight,'' and rightfully so. However, all those resources in  the world are meaningless without the capable men and women behind it.   Right now, the harsh reality is that suicides among Active Duty  servicemembers are at an all-time high. Tragically, they increased by  more than 40 percent between 2015 and 2020. We owe it to our  servicemembers to do everything in our power to make sure they have the  support and mental health care they need.   They put their well-being on the line to serve our Nation, and our  Nation must put their well-being first. We must prioritize our  servicemembers and their families by focusing on the quality of life we  provide for them while they serve.   As a veteran, granddaughter of a veteran, spouse of a veteran, and  mother of future veterans, I am honored to fight every day for the  quality of life they deserve.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of  National Police Week. I am proud to stand with Virginia's police  officers, not just during National Police Week but each and every day.   Our brave men and women in blue selflessly confront danger to protect  us and our families, and I firmly believe it is only right to recognize  all they do to keep our communities safe.   Unfortunately, as Americans face a rise in violent crime across the  Nation, law enforcement officers have faced significant challenges and  grave threats that have jeopardized the safety of those sworn to  protect our communities.   These challenges range from increased violence against officers,  efforts to defund police departments, lagging technology, recruitment  and retention issues, and rising mental health concerns.   Last year, 246 law enforcement officers were tragically killed in the  line of duty. This year, there have already been 41 officers killed in  the line of duty serving their communities.   We must do more to support brave men and women of our Nation's law  enforcement who serve our communities with courage, dedication, and  strength. This week, I was proud to vote for several bills that showed  them that we have their backs just like they have ours.   Whether it is through legislation or simple actions, we must  prioritize appreciation of the men and women in blue who put themselves  in harm's way to protect their communities.   The people of Virginia's Second District do an excellent job of  showing our support for our men and women in law enforcement. This  week, members of my team attended the annual National Police Week  ceremony at the Virginia Beach Law Enforcement Officers Memorial. The  ceremony and memorial serve as a solemn reminder of what our police  officers put on the line every day when they wake up and go to work to  protect our community.   Mr. Speaker, please join me and the people of Virginia's Second  District in recognizing the brave men and women of our law enforcement  community for putting their lives on the line to keep us safe.
