 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, earlier this week, I described the  terrible flooding across my home State of Kentucky. Rivers reached  historic levels. Whole communities are still underwater.   Yesterday, my staff and I spoke with leaders in some of our hardest  hit counties. The Estill County judge executive told me that he  personally joined crews to help families escape danger. Small business  owners in Lee County, who survived one COVID obstacle after another,  now saw their life's work literally washed away. The situation in  Powell County is so dire that at least one city can only be accessed by  boat. Road crews, first responders, and the Kentucky National Guard are  doing their best to help out, but they can't get a handle on the full  scope of the damage until the water recedes.   Once the assessment is complete, the Governor will formally request  an emergency disaster declaration from the Biden administration. As  soon as he does, my team and I will do our part to get Federal  assistance to these communities as soon as possible.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on a completely different matter,  yesterday, our Democratic colleagues had planned to begin ramming  through their partisan spending spree, but it seems they have had some  difficulty getting to the starting line. After all, Senate Democrats,  including committee chairs, are essentially being jammed with text from  over in the House. Their own Members have barely been able to read this  thing, let alone shape it.   So let's think back to where we were 1 year ago. Eleven-and-a-half  months  [[Page S1039]]  ago, the Senate was also discussing a major spending package. In fact,  it was the same size as what is being proposed right now--about $2  trillion--an appropriate pricetag back at the start of the crisis, but  that is where the similarity actually ends.   Last March, the Senate was working overtime, in a bipartisan fashion,  to craft good policy from the bottom up. I assembled bipartisan task  forces. We had Republicans and Democrats and staff working around the  clock to build the policies that would save our health system and our  economy.   The CARES Act sustained us for almost a year of shutdowns. It funded  the healthcare fight, saved small businesses, and funded Operation Warp  Speed, which helped pave the way for these pioneering vaccines and  preordered hundreds of millions of doses for Americans. The law sent so  much relief to households that, even as the GDP declined, personal  incomes and savings actually went up. Even liberal economists say  President Biden has inherited an economy that was already primed for a  swift recovery. It was the largest American rescue package ever. Yet it  passed the Senate without one single dissenting vote because it was  built the right way.   That was last March. So what about today?   Instead of heading into a dark tunnel, we are accelerating out of it:  incredible vaccines, a rebounding economy. That is what the Biden  administration inherited thanks to what we did last year.   Yet Washington Democrats are trying to exploit the last chapters of  this crisis to pass what President Biden's Chief of Staff calls ``the  most progressive domestic legislation in a generation,'' and they have  told Republicans: Take it or leave it. No openness to meaningful  bipartisan input. Ten Republican Senators approached President Biden  and proposed cooperation on the order of hundreds of billions of  dollars. They were refused. All that interested the Democrats was a  partisan hodgepodge of, largely, non-COVID-related items.   Last year, the Democratic leader said:         Sitting in your own office, writing a bill, and then       demanding the other side support it is not anyone's idea of       bipartisanship.    As recently as last November, he said:         We need a true bipartisan bill--not ``this is our bill,       take it or leave it.''    Another time, our friend from New York told everyone to ``go look up  in the dictionary what `bipartisanship' is. It's both parties working  together, not your party doing a bill and then saying it's  bipartisan.''   In less than 4 months, we have had two completely different versions  of the Democratic leader. The two of them could have a fascinating  debate with each other.   But look, the real tragedy here is not Senate process; it is how ill- suited this bill is to what Americans need right now. There are no  policies to get schools reopened right away and no smart solutions to  directly spur rehiring. Less than 1 percent of the money goes to the  vaccines that will end this nightmare--only 9 percent to the entire  healthcare fight altogether.   I guess it has become a rite of passage for a new Democratic  President to begin with a poorly targeted spending spree that doesn't  give Americans what they need.   We already laid the foundation for a roaring comeback. The Biden  administration inherited a tide that was already turning, but they have  chosen to ignore the approach that got us this far                            ____________________     Mr. President, now, on one final matter, yesterday  evening, House Democrats repassed their plan to give Washington  unprecedented power over the way our Nation conducts elections. Just  like their partisan spending spree from last week, the only thing  bipartisan about the vote was the opposition.   The same party that wants to change Senate rules when they lose a  vote, pack the Supreme Court when they lose a case, and throw out the  electoral college every time they lose the White House now wants to  forcibly rewrite 50 States' election laws from Washington. It is  unprincipled. It is unwarranted. Large portions of it may well be  unconstitutional. One of the key principles of American elections is  that Federal officeholders cannot personally micromanage the way in  which voters can hire and fire us.   Different States and localities settle questions around early voting  or absentee voting or voter registration in very different ways.  Washington Democrats want every county in America to have to answer all  of those questions the way they want. For example, no State would be  able to have a simple voter ID requirement unless they neutered it with  a massive loophole, but every State would be forced to allow ballot  harvesting, where paid political operatives can show up, carrying a  stack of ballots with other people's names on them.   Imagine looking at this national landscape, where we have seen the  losing side doubt the legitimacy of two consecutive Presidential  elections, and thinking: This is the time for a sweeping, one-party  rewrite of election law.   Democrats are also coming after Americans' free speech. The Federal  Election Commission was set up after Watergate to be a bipartisan panel  by design. The FEC intentionally needs bipartisan consensus to throw a  penalty flag. Washington Democrats want to scrap that as well.   Their bill would convert the FEC into an odd-numbered, partisan body,  and this partisan FEC would get even greater scope to nose around in  even more of Americans' speech and Americans' activities. The bill also  tramples on citizens' privacy with new mandates that would intensify  ``cancel culture'' and help mobs harass people for their private views.  Even the leftwing ACLU condemns this part of H.R. 1.   This is what the ACLU had to say:         It could directly interfere with the ability of many to       engage in political speech about causes that they care about       and that impact their lives.    That was from the ACLU.   That is right. House Democrats have swung so far to the anti-free  speech left that they have even lost the ACLU.   Speaking of political swings, Democrats who want Washington to take  over elections should remember that majorities in Congress actually  come and go. It would be absurd for election regulations in every  precinct in America to go boomeranging back and forth every time  Congress changes hands. Millions of American voters elected 50  Republican Senators and a whole lot of House Republicans to make sure  that Democrats play by the rules, not rewrite the rules. For one party  to seize unilateral control over elections nationwide would be a civic  catastrophe.   It is worth asking: Why are Washington Democrats so desperate to  forcibly rewrite election law before the next time voters decide their  fates?                            ____________________
