 Mr. Speaker, I rise to commemorate the 157th  anniversary of the Homestead Act passing the House of Representatives.   The Homestead Act was instrumental in bringing settlers to the  Midwest and forming the State of Nebraska, as it allowed any qualified  person to claim up to 160 acres of Federally owned land in exchange for  5 years of living on and improving the property.   Homestead National Monument, which is located in Nebraska's Third  Congressional District, commemorates this law.   Unfortunately, the name of this facility does not represent its  cultural and historical value, as many tourists show up looking for a  physical monument rather than a park, which would more accurately  describe it.   For this reason, and at the request of the local community, I  introduced a bill on Thursday, February 28, the law's anniversary, to  reclassify Homestead National Monument as a national historical park.   I ask my colleagues to support this bill in order to maximize its  value in terms of education, tourism, and economic development for the  surrounding community as it commemorates an important event in our  Nation's history.                            ____________________
