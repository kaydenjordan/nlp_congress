 Madam Speaker, news flash: Extreme MAGA Republicans hold  the Nation hostage, put America's full faith and credit in jeopardy,  and flirt with economic disaster.   Imagine seniors not getting their Social Security checks,  unemployment spiking, small businesses closing their doors, 401(k)  accounts and pensions tanking.   President Biden has been negotiating in good faith, agreeing to  future spending caps and other concessions, but they want more. They  want to cut programs for seniors, veterans, and children, all while  protecting tax cuts for the very wealthy.   So I ask: Will Republicans make a deal or cause a disaster?   I am asking for a few million hardworking central Floridians.   Mark my words, if you break it, you own it, and we will make sure the  American people know about it.                            ____________________
