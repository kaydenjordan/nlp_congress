 Madam Speaker, I rise today to welcome the Towing and  Recovery Association of America to Washington and thank them for their  work.   Tow truck operators from nearly 20 States are attending to advocate  on behalf of road safety. I have championed these issues for my entire  career in Congress, but through the advocacy of TRAA, I have learned  that tow truck operators and all our first responders face harrowing  conditions during roadside emergency response. Even one roadside  fatality is too many.   That is why I proudly introduced a resolution supporting the goals  and ideals of ``move over'' laws to raise awareness of the need to move  over and slow down while passing roadside responders.   Last year, the House adopted this resolution, and the Transportation  and Infrastructure Committee just voted to advance it again this year.  This is not a partisan issue.   Madam Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to send a message by joining  me in support of this resolution. Together we can save lives.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Last night, the Rules Committee met and reported out a rule for three  bills.   First, let me just say, this is an awful rule; and I don't want to  hear my Republican colleagues talk about fairness or openness ever  again. We got lecture after lecture about how they wanted to be more  open and more inclusive.   Well, guess what? So far, in this Congress, 22 of the 26 rules have  been completely closed. I mean, there are more closed rules in this  rule than Democratic amendments made in order.   Speaker McCarthy promised he would open things up, but he has locked  things down more than ever.   My colleague from Kentucky (Mr. Massie) said that he joined the Rules  Committee to be our conscience. So I would ask him, I mean, does he  think this is okay?   Madam Speaker, 43 of 44 amendments submitted by Democrats were  blocked by his majority; is that right? Is that the openness that we  were promised by his Speaker?   The bottom line is the last time Republicans controlled the House  they had more closed rules than any other time in the history of our  country, and they are on track to beating their own record.   Our first bill today, considered under a closed rule, is S. 619, the  COVID-19 Origin Act of 2023.   I think I speak for everyone when I say that we all want to know how  COVID started. But I also want to point out, for the Record, that  Donald Trump was President when COVID started, not Joe Biden.   Donald Trump said: ``China has been working very hard to contain the  coronavirus. The United States greatly appreciates their efforts and  transparency. It will all work out well.'' Joe Biden didn't say that.   What Joe Biden actually did do is he ordered this investigation, and  thanks to his investigation and the work of the intelligence community,  we now have a report that gives us some answers.   The gentleman from Kentucky says, Democrats all believe this was a  conspiracy theory. Yet, strangely enough, it was a Democratic President  who told the intelligence community to look into the origins of COVID.  So I am just a bit confused here as to his logic.   I will quickly mention two other bills. H.J. Res 27, also considered  under a closed rule, seeks to roll back a majority of the protections  on rivers, lakes, and streams that have been implemented since the  creation of the Clean Water Act.   I find it particularly ironic that Republicans go to East Palestine,  Ohio, saying, we stand with you, we are with you, while here in  Congress, they are passing a bill that makes it easier for the company  that dumped toxic waste into their rivers to get off scot-free.   Finally, we have H.R. 140, the Protecting Speech from Government  Interference Act, which does not protect free speech from government  interference. In fact, it seeks to expand the First Amendment to  include Vladimir Putin and the Chinese Communist Party, while telling  America's own Federal law enforcement agencies that they are now  forbidden from even notifying social media companies of attempts by  Russia and the CCP to spread propaganda.   But there is one more thing I want to bring up today, Madam Speaker,  and it is not in this rule, but it is just as important and  consequential for our democracy.   On Monday of this week, FOX News aired an offensive, dishonest,  shameful representation about what happened on January 6, 2021. For  nearly an hour, Tucker Carlson said that January 6 was not, in fact, a  violent attack on American democracy. In fact, he said it was not an  attack at all.   He called it a peaceful sightseeing day; downplayed what happened;  tried to sanitize and gloss over the first responders who were attacked  and died; called the people attacking our Capitol Police officers meek;  ran interference  [[Page H1163]]  for a racist mob that came into these Halls that day to overturn an  election.    I am furious because I was here that day. I was literally in this  room. I was one of the last ones off the House floor. I sat in the  Speaker's chair that day. I saw how close we came to disaster, and I  don't need Tucker Carlson or anyone else to tell me what happened that  day.   I am not just furious for me; I am furious for the people he lied to.  I am furious for the memory of the officers he insulted. I am furious  for the police officers who were beaten and injured that day. I am  furious for the staff who thought that they were going to die.   January 6 was an attack on our democracy, and now Tucker Carlson has  chosen to side with the enemies of democracy.   But what is most alarming about all of this, what is most dangerous,  is that he was aided and abetted by Republican Speaker of the House  Kevin McCarthy.   I have to say, this is a new low. Speaker McCarthy's treacherous  decision to coordinate with Tucker Carlson to deliberately distort what  happened that day is beyond the pale; and the worst part is the blatant  lying.   On November 21, 2020, Carlson said in a private text that lies about  voter fraud were shockingly reckless and called the very conspiracy  theories he was promoting on the air as insane and absurd to his  colleagues.   He called those propagating the big lie dangerous as hell. He knew  that claims the election was stolen were dangerous lies.   But instead of owning up to the truth, he went on TV, and with zero  respect for his viewers and for the people of this country, zero  respect for the truth, zero respect for our democracy, he sold those  dangerous lies to the American people. He should be ashamed.   Speaker McCarthy's disgraceful decision to help him spread these lies  will forever be a stain on this institution.   So my question for the Speaker is: Was it worth it?   Was the backroom deal with the far right to help Tucker Carlson lie  about what happened that day worth the damage done to our democracy?   Was it worth insulting the memory of the law enforcement officers who  died defending this building and what it symbolizes?   The family of fallen Officer Brian Sicknick doesn't think so. I want  to enter their full statement into the Record today, but our rules  prevent me from doing that. So let me just read a part of it here:   ``The Sicknick family is outraged at the ongoing attack on our family  by the unscrupulous and outright sleazy so-called news network of FOX  News who will do the bidding of Trump or any of his sycophant  followers, no matter what damage is done to the families of the fallen,  the officers who put their lives on the line, and all who suffered on  January 6 due to the lies started by Trump and spread by sleaze- slinging outlets like FOX.''   They go on to say: ``Every time the pain of that day seems to have  ebbed a bit, organizations like FOX rip our wounds wide open again and  we are frankly sick of it.''   That is what Speaker McCarthy is doing here. It is sick. It is  indefensible. Frankly, I find it disgusting.   So when the hell will House Republicans stand up here and say this is  wrong?   At least some Senate Republicans, to their credit, have actually  denounced Carlson's lies.   Senator John Kennedy said: ``I was here. It was not peaceful. It was  an abomination.''   Senator Thom Tillis says: Tucker's depiction was B.S. He called it  indefensible.   Senator Mitt Romney says: ``You can't hide the truth by selectively  picking a few minutes out of tapes and saying this is what went on.  It's so absurd. It's nonsense. It's a very dangerous thing to do. . . .  `'   But all we get out of this side of the Capitol is deafening silence;  and every moment House Republicans do not come out and condemn these  evil lies, more damage is done to the fabric of our democracy because,  mark my words, January 6 will happen again if we do not correct the  record and tell the truth about what happened that day.   It was an attempt to overthrow the government of the United States,  based on lies spread by the former President of the United States. So  for the sake of this institution, for the sake of the country, it is  time to tell the truth.   For my Republican colleagues, it is time for you to condemn these  lies.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert into the Record a  USA Today piece titled: ``Fact check: COVID-19 vaccines primarily  designed to prevent serious illness, death.''    Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert into  the Record an AP News article titled: ``Ex-Twitter execs deny pressure  to block Hunter Biden story.''    Madam Speaker, Twitter itself is saying the government  isn't telling them to suppress anything. This is yet, unfortunately,  just another Republican conspiracy theory.   Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert into the Record an  article from The Hill titled: ``Trump officials roll back Obama oil  train safety rule.''    Madam Speaker, on February 3, 2023, a train with 38  cars derailed in East Palestine, Ohio, and the full devastating  aftermath of that tragedy is ongoing. The affected community needs  answers and change to make sure that something like this does not  happen again.   The Trump administration rolled back train safety rules. Now,  Republicans want to make it easier for polluters to pollute. They put a  chemical industry lobbyist in charge of the EPA office in charge of  chemical safety. I mean, you can't make this stuff up. They rolled back  regulations on train brakes, and they reduced rail inspections.   I just want to say one thing to my colleague from Kentucky. I have no  problem with releasing all the tapes, but that is not what happened.  The Speaker of the House selectively and carefully released them to one  person, to one news agency, who then deliberately cherrypicked things  to advance a distortion of what happened that day, an insult to the  people who work here, an insult to the Capitol Police officers who were  injured that day. That is not transparency. That is propaganda. That is  deliberately distorting a horrific event in which this Capitol was  attacked, our democracy was attacked. So, please, give me a break.   Madam Speaker, I urge that we defeat the previous question, and if we  do, I will offer an amendment to the rule to provide for consideration  of a resolution that affirms the House's unwavering commitment to  protect and  [[Page H1166]]  strengthen Social Security and Medicare and states that it is the  position of the House to reject any cuts in the program.   Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment into the Record along with any extraneous material  immediately prior to the vote on the previous question.    Madam Speaker, Social Security and Medicare are the  bedrocks of our Nation's social safety net. Yet, as my Republican  colleagues demand reckless cuts in exchange for paying our Nation's  bills, these programs are under threat.   Despite recent rhetoric to the contrary, Republicans claim that they  won't cut Social Security and Medicare benefits. Well, Madam Speaker,  today, Democrats are yet again giving Republicans another chance to  back up that claim with action by providing them a chance to reassure  the American people not just with their words, but with their votes.  Today, they can vote unequivocally that they will not cut these vital  programs. Anything short of that is an empty promise.   Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Alaska (Mrs.  Peltola), to discuss our proposal.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I don't want to be lectured about farms and our  farmers. I represent a district with thousands of farms in it.   The bottom line is my farmers care about things like clean water.  They care about the environment because they know that contaminated  water can contaminate the food supply, among other things. My farmers  are worried about climate change and the impact it is having on their  ability to grow crops.   I don't want to be lectured about farms or what farmers want. I don't  know of any farmer who wants to create a situation where polluters are  basically not held accountable for the pollution they cause.   Think about what happened in East Palestine, Ohio. Is it the position  of the Republicans that the railroad should not be required to pay for  the damage that they have done, that the community should assume those  costs, or the Federal Government? I don't know who should pay for it.  The farmers should pay for that? Come on.   We can hear a lot about, ``This does X, Y, and Z,'' when we know it  is an exaggeration.  [[Page H1167]]    Putting that aside, I will say for the record that I represent a lot  of farmers. I talk to my farmers all the time. I do farm tours every  single year. What they talk to me about is making sure that we have a  clean environment, that they have access to clean water, and that we  actually start paying attention to climate change, which is destroying  their ability to be profitable and to be able to thrive.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I don't think there is any controversy over the bill  to make as much of the classified report unclassified that is possible.  There is no controversy over that.   I want to make sure that people understand who is responsible for  actually doing the investigation. It was Joe Biden, not the previous  President.   I want people to remember what the previous President said. On  January 24, 2020, Donald Trump said: ``China has been working very hard  to contain the coronavirus. The United States greatly appreciates their  efforts and transparency. It will all work out well. In particular, on  behalf of the American people, I want to thank President Xi.'' Really?   On February 7, 2020, Trump said: ``I just spoke to President Xi last  night, and, you know, we are working on the problem, the virus. It is a  very tough situation, but I think he is going to handle it. I think he  has handled it really well. We are helping wherever we can.''   On February 7, he said: ``Just had a long and very good conversation  by phone with President Xi of China. He is strong, sharp, and  powerfully focused on leading the counterattack on the coronavirus. He  feels they are doing very well, even building hospitals in a matter of  only days. . . . Great discipline is taking place in China, as  President Xi strongly leads what will be a very successful operation.  We are working closely with China to help.''   Then he also said: ``Late last night, I had a very good talk with  President Xi, and we talked about--mostly about the coronavirus. They  are working really hard, and I think they are doing a very professional  job. They are in touch with the world organization--CDC also. We are  working together, but World Health is working with them. CDC is working  with them. I had a great conversation last night with President Xi. It  is a tough situation. I think they are doing a very good job.''   Then he said on February 10: ``I think China is very, you know,  professionally run, in the sense that they have everything under  control,'' Trump said. ``I really believe they are going to have it  under control fairly soon. You know, in April, supposedly, it dies with  the hotter weather, and that is a beautiful date to look forward to.  But China, I can tell you, is working very hard.''   On February 13: ``I think they have handled it professionally, and I  think they are extremely capable. And I think President Xi is extremely  capable, and I hope that it is going to be resolved.''   On February 23, President Trump said: ``I think President Xi is  working very, very hard. I spoke to him. He is working very hard. I  think he is doing a very good job. It is a big problem, but President  Xi loves his country. He is working very hard to solve the problem, and  he will solve the problem. Okay?''   Then, on February 29, he said: ``China seems to be making tremendous  progress. Their numbers are way down. . . . I think our relationship  with China is very good. We just did a big trade deal. We are starting  on another trade deal with China, a very big one, and we have been  working very closely. They have been talking to our people. We have  been talking to their people, having to do with the virus.''   Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to include in the Record an  article from Politico titled: ``15 times Trump praised China as  coronavirus was spreading across the globe.''    Madam Speaker, I remind my Republican colleagues that  the leader of their own party repeatedly applauded China during the  peak of the pandemic.   The bottom line is that we should all be grateful that we have a  President now that has actually launched an investigation to get to the  bottom of this.   Today, hopefully, we will, in a bipartisan way, vote to make as much  of that investigation declassified as possible.   Let's not forget the history here. Let's not forget who was praising  China's reaction to the coronavirus because I think it is important  that we keep that in mind, especially listening to some of the rhetoric  coming from the other side.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, this is the second time the gentleman has said that  all the tapes of what happened on January 6 were released. Maybe he can  tell us where the general public can find them. How do they get access  to them?    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman.    Madam Speaker, reclaiming my time, the gentleman said  that all the tapes had been released. The only person who got the tapes  was a political hack at FOX News who used them to distort the reality  and the truth and to insult the service of the people who work up here,  including our Capitol Police officers.   I am for releasing as much as can be released so long as it doesn't  violate any security protocols. Let's listen to what the U.S. Capitol  Police chief said in response to Tucker Carlson's coverage of January  6. He said: ``Last night, an opinion program aired commentary that was  filled with offensive and misleading conclusions about the January 6  attack. The opinion program never reached out to the department to  provide accurate context.   ``One false allegation is that our officers helped the rioters and  acted as  [[Page H1170]]  `tour guides.' This is outrageous and false. The department stands by  the officers in the video that was shown last night. I don't have to  remind you how outnumbered our officers were on January 6. Those  officers did their best to use deescalation tactics to try to talk  rioters into getting each other to leave the building.    ``The program conveniently cherry-picked from the calmer moments of  our 41,000 hours of video. The commentary fails to provide context  about the chaos and violence that happened before or during these less  tense moments.   ``Finally, the most disturbing accusation from last night was that  our late friend and colleague Brian Sicknick's death had nothing to do  with his heroic actions on January 6. The department maintains, as  anyone with common sense would, that had Officer Sicknick not fought  valiantly for hours on the day he was violently assaulted, Officer  Sicknick would not have died the next day.   ``As some people select from 41,000 hours of video clips that  seemingly support the narrative they want to push, those of you who  were here on January 6, those of you who were in the fight, those of  you who ensured that no Member of Congress was hurt, those of you who  contributed to the effort to allow this country's legislative process  to continue know firsthand what actually happened.''   I would just simply say, Madam Speaker, if we want to make sure that  we do not see another January 6 ever again occur in our country's  future, then we all ought to speak with one voice, condemn what  happened that day, and characterize it for what it was: an attack on  our democracy.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1315     Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, when the gentleman says that what Tucker Carlson aired  somehow destroyed the narrative, I mean, give me a break, he is  essentially basically saying what happened on January 6 conforms with  what Tucker Carlson said. It is offensive to everybody who was here  that day. It is offensive to the staff, and it is offensive to the  Capitol Police officers. It is offensive to everybody.   Madam Speaker, let me just say to the gentleman that what I said  before was that I favored releasing tapes so long as they did not--it  is my personal opinion--so long as they do not at all compromise any  security. That is what I said.   But it is so sad to be on this House floor after what happened on  that day and to hear Members of Congress basically try to cover up the  horrendous atrocity that occurred that day, the attack on our  democracy. It is shameful.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, may I inquire how much time I have  remaining?    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, what is just as revealing as what we are debating this  week is what we are not talking about.   We are now 3 months into the Republican majority. They haven't passed  a single bill into law yet, and, in fact, rather than debating things  that people care about, we are spending week after week passing bills  that are designed to get Facebook likes and retweets instead of making  an actual difference with the people back home.   Three out of four Americans say that the Republicans in Congress do  not have the right agenda.   Madam Speaker, if you want proof that they are right, then look no  further than what so much of today's debate was focused on.   Democrats passed bills to bring jobs back from China and take on  Putin's war of aggression. Republicans are passing bills to make it  easier for Russia and China to spread their propaganda here in the  United States.   Democrats passed laws holding polluters accountable, took action to  get rid of lead pipes and clean up our rivers and lakes. Republicans  are passing bills to protect the polluters that dump toxic chemicals  into our water.   The American people expect more. They expect us to pass bills that  actually matter to our families. Democrats have been putting people  over politics to do it. We get stuff done while Republicans are chasing  down the approval of the hyper online far right that spends all their  time on Twitter trying to own the libs.   So that is why I am asking my colleagues to join me in defeating the  previous question so we can get this House on record as saying that we  are going to protect Social Security and Medicare.   Finally, Madam Speaker, again, the idea that the leadership on the  Republican side was complicit with FOX News and with Tucker Carlson to  spread lies and distortions about what happened on January 6 and to  insult the service of the brave men and women who protect this building  and all of us who are in it is unconscionable.   It would be so refreshing for Republicans to join us in condemning  the distortions that were on FOX News. It is stunning to me that we  can't get any of them to condemn. Some of them--their Senate  counterparts--did, and I praise them for it. But the silence here is  deafening, and it is offensive. It is offensive.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    On that, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.
