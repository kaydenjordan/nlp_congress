 Madam Speaker, in an anti-Semitic attack this last week,  cowards desecrated over 75 headstones of the Temple Israel Cemetery in  Omaha. Countless headstones were pushed from their bases, with many  broken in the process. It is vile. It is reprehensible. It is  disgusting.   This hateful action toward the Jewish community causes great pain in  my heart. As Rabbi Abraham of Beth El Synagogue in Omaha recently  reminded us, cemeteries are one of the most holy places, and the Talmud  teaches us that ``gravestones are fairer than royal palaces.''   This attack happened around Veterans Day, which provided a dark  reminder that the cause of defending freedom and combating hate never  rests.   On that note, I call upon the leadership of Congress to move H.R.  943, the Never Again Education Act by Congresswoman Carolyn Maloney.   Education is a powerful weapon combating anti-Semitism, and this bill  will provide valuable tools in that fight.   As we near the 75th anniversary of the end of World War II, one of  the darkest chapters in human history, we must never forget the lessons  of the past so that we never again repeat those horrors in the future.                            ____________________
