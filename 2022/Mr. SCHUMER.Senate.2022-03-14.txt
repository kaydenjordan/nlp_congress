 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, last week was an exceedingly productive  week for the Senate. We funded the government, passed postal reform,  kept our promise to the Ukrainian people, revived VAWA, and unanimously  passed anti-lynching legislation. President Biden is going to be busy  this week signing a lot of bipartisan bills into law that will impact  the lives of millions of Americans, and I thank my colleagues on both  sides of the aisle for their good work.   Today, we are picking up right where we left off--confirming more of  the President's nominees, maintaining our laser focus on lowering costs  for American families, and continuing to explore how we can help  Ukraine in their war against the evil Mr. Putin.   First, on this last point, earlier today, the Speaker and I announced  that President Zelenskyy will deliver a virtual address to Members of  the House and Senate this Wednesday, March 16, at 9 a.m. As you know,  it is one of the highest honors of any Congress to welcome remarks by  foreign heads of state, but it is nearly unheard of in modern times  that we hear from a leader fighting for his life, fighting for his  country's survival, fighting to preserve the very idea of democracy.   Let me say that again. It is one of the highest honors of any  Congress to welcome remarks by a foreign head of state, but it is  nearly unheard of--unheard of--in modern times that we hear from a  leader fighting for his life, fighting for his country's survival, and  fighting to preserve the idea of democracy--something Americans  cherish.   As war intensifies in Ukraine, we have all been inspired by the  courage of President Zelenskyy and that of the Ukrainian people.  President Zelenskyy can rest assured that he will always have friends  in Congress ready to listen, to stand in his corner, and we are honored  to have him speak to us later this week.
