 Madam Speaker, kids and teens are facing a mental health  crisis.   In Orange County, the hospitalization rate for children's mental  illness and substance use disorder increased 88 percent between 2010  and 2019. Just last year, our children's hospital saw a 40 percent  increase in mental health admissions in its emergency department.   On March 2, National Teen Mental Health Day, we recognize that caring  for mental health is a part of raising and educating our kids.  Communities should support children's well-being before mental health  issues become crises.   In Orange County schools, like the ones my kids attend, that work has  already begun. Using funds from the American Rescue Plan, the Irvine  Unified School District has hired qualified mental health specialists.  These professionals are dedicated resources for mental health recovery,  and they allow counselors to focus on academic issues and peer  relationships and teachers to focus on education.   Together with the Children's Hospital of Orange County, schools are  building safe, comfortable places for students to heal. These retreats,  called WellSpaces, are supported by mental health professionals and  help students with the pressures of being kids.   WellSpaces are an innovative way to ease the transition to in-person  learning after pandemic school closures and to teach mental wellness  skills. Just like with physical health, even the best prevention  tactics do not eliminate emergencies or stop chronic illnesses.   For kids that need more care, CHOC offers world-class treatment.  CHOC's intensive outpatient program keeps children living at home with  their loved ones and allows them to remain in school. This healthcare  delivery keeps kids connected to their families and their teachers.  CHOC built a pediatric inpatient center to give younger kids the acute  care that will help them have healthier teen years.   Mental healthcare providers are moving mountains to care for our  kids. Thanks to the work of dedicated professionals and health centers  like CHOC, raising a family in Orange County means our kids will have  the resources to stay healthy, mentally and physically. But these  resources mean little if families cannot afford them or if insurers  refuse to cover them.   That is why I am making sure that big insurers follow the law and  cover mental healthcare. I am proud that my bill, the Mental Health  Parity Compliance Act, was signed into law in 2020. This legislation  provides tools to enforce the requirement that insurance companies  cover mental healthcare the same way they cover physical health.   Children need lawmakers to prioritize their well-being, including  mental healthcare. This means supporting high-quality, innovative  programs; increasing connections between families, schools, and  healthcare providers; and closing loopholes used by insurance companies  to deny families affordable mental healthcare. The youth mental health  crisis will not improve without investment in care.   As an Orange County mom, I am proud that my community is leading the  way in responding to the youth mental health crisis. Our younger  generations are counting on us to help them toward health and wellness,  and I am committed to working across the aisle to get that done.                    2022 SOTU Virtual Guest Nazy Shabazian     Madam Speaker, when my 1-year-old daughter, Betsy, went  to daycare, I was worried. My family was in upheaval with a divorce,  and Betsy was new to childcare. But when the door opened, Betsy was  scooped up in a hug.   Irvine resident Nazy Shabazian provided Betsy with years of fun but  firm guidance--painting, racing cars, dancing, and even snacking on  Persian cucumbers.   A single parent herself, Nazy inspired me by successfully running her  small business and raising two terrific daughters. During the pandemic,  she adjusted to new health protocols, employee changes, and different  parent schedules. Today, her business, Melody Child Care, is thriving-- and so are the children in her care.   Nazy is an exemplar of the compassion and resilience that childcare  providers and small businesses showed during the pandemic. I am proud  to honor her as my 2022 State of the Union guest.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, reports to Congress are not just for us.  They are a tool for Americans to hold our government accountable.   I joined Republicans and Democrats to pass the Global Respect Act to  require the White House and State Department to name foreign  individuals who violate the human rights of LGBTQ people. People put on  this list would be ineligible for visas to enter into the United  States.   This report of human rights violations should not fit on some desk in  Washington, D.C. gathering dust. My amendment to the Global Respect Act  gives every American the opportunity to read the report on protecting  LGBTQ rights abroad.   The public, our partners, and our allies need to see that the U.S.  Government is holding human rights abusers accountable. My amendment  will require a published report and will improve transparency and  accountability.                            ____________________
