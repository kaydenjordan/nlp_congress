 Mr. Speaker, I rise today as the chairman of the Republican  Study Committee's American Worker Task Force. This task force was  established to provide policy recommendations to empower millions of  American workers to reclaim their version of the American Dream.   This task force, really, Mr. Speaker, is all about the American  Dream, which is the idea that the condition of your birth should not  determine the outcome of your life and that, in America, because of the  blessings of freedom that we are given, anyone, regardless of race,  color, creed, gender, or any station in life, through hard work,  persistence, and determination, can achieve upward mobility, can  achieve his or her God-given potential, and can realize that American  Dream.   This afternoon, the American Worker Task Force will unveil its report  to change flawed policies from Washington, D.C., to unleash the spirit  of the American Dream and to give workers their opportunity at upward  mobility.   First, we are going to propose policy changes that will refocus labor  policy to unleash American workers and allow them to realize their God- given potential. This includes increasing opportunities for  apprenticeships, not just Department of Labor, Washington-directed,  centrally planned registered apprenticeships, apprenticeships that may  or may not yield fruitful careers in in-demand jobs in the labor  market, in the real world, but, instead, also recognizing  apprenticeships that are industry-recognized, industry-driven, and that  meet the jobs that are actually available in the labor market.   We are going to be proposing ideas about eliminating overly  restrictive occupational licensing requirements and giving workers  greater flexibility in the way they are compensated, to choose comp  time as opposed to just overtime.   Secondly, we want to reimagine our failed welfare policies to remove  the trap of government dependency and, instead, create a system that  propels American individuals and families to extraordinary success and  prosperity.   This includes providing alternatives to the failed Housing First  policies: to provide Americans access in housing assistance with  wraparound services to actually meet those individuals where they are;  to provide them with career counseling and perhaps, if needed,  addiction recovery services and financial literacy.   We want second-chance employees to have access to the labor market.  Whether they have been incarcerated before, whether they are struggling  with an addiction, whether they have failed to get the skills that they  need, we believe that second-chance and third-chance employees are  desperately needed in America's economy today.   We also want work incentives for able-bodied, work-capable adults,  especially those without dependents, because we know that work is a  blessing; work is not a punishment.   And, third, we want to refine our education system to debunk the  bachelors-  [[Page H4649]]  or-bust mentality, to encourage innovative careers and better equip  American workers with the skills they need to adapt and thrive in the  ever-changing 21st century economy. That means in preparing people for  higher education, it is not just about a 4-year degree; it is also  about career and technical education, skills-based education.   We believe that there should be deductibility for up-skilling so that  employers can give workers the skills that are needed for them to move  and advance in their careers.   We think there should be transparency outcomes in higher education.  And we think, to deal with the student loan debt crisis, we need to  recognize that the return on investment is very important, and career  and technical education can provide that opportunity.   We believe in income-sharing agreements as an alternative to the debt  trap of Federal student loans.   The policies that constitute these three key policy platforms are the  result of over a year and a half of deliberations by task force  members. We conducted listening sessions with think tanks and policy  experts, small business owners, and workers from across our districts.   Mr. Speaker, in the Sixth Congressional District of Kentucky, which I  represent in Congress, I have already seen the benefits of investing in  career and technical education and job training.   The Kentucky Welding Institute in Fleming County, Kentucky, graduates  students in less than 6 months, readying them for careers in welding  that can earn them over $100,000 a year.   In Estill County, Kentucky, the Estill County Area Technical Center,  currently under construction, will be a state-of-the-art job training  facility that is scheduled to open in August of 2021. Kentuckians will  train for jobs in advanced manufacturing, in diesel mechanics, health  sciences, information technology and science technology, engineering  and math, in addition to many other industries.   I am proud to have supported a $4 million grant from the Economic  Development Administration that will yield a return on investment in  just a few months, graduating taxpayers.   Mr. Speaker, this report could not be a more timely endeavor in the  face of the COVID-19 pandemic and the ensuing economic uncertainty that  has followed.   Although progrowth tax, regulatory, and trade policies have enabled  unemployment to come back down to single digits and the stock market to  rebound, Americans still need Congress to take up a bold, comprehensive  agenda to pave the way for more jobs.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage everyone to consider these very important  proworker recommendations.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I am grateful to have my bill, H.R. 7795, the  Veterans Benefits Fairness and Transparency Act of 2020 before the  House of Representatives today.   I would like to thank my good friend, Ranking Member Roe, for his  support of this legislation, and would especially like to thank my  colleague across the aisle and chair of the Disability and Memorial  Affairs Subcommittee, Representative Elaine Luria, for co-leading this  bipartisan legislation with me. I appreciate Representative Luria's  leadership on this issue.   This bill is vitally important because it will restore access for  veterans and their representatives to the disability benefits  questionnaires forms previously available on the VA's public website.  Our veterans used these forms to submit evidence to the VA for their  disability claims until the VA removed them in April of this year in  the middle of a pandemic, making it harder for veterans to submit their  evidence and get the benefits owed to them.   The idea for this legislation was brought to me by a member of  Kentucky's Sixth Congressional District Veterans' Coalition, Chief  Warrant Officer Denny Hart. I know Mr. Hart, he is a good patriotic  man, and he continues to serve our country by helping other veterans  file their disability claims with the VA.   However, after the VA removed these forms from being publicly  available, they effectively shut out Mr. Hart and others from assisting  our veterans. There were only 11 VA contract examiners in the Sixth  District of Kentucky in January of this year. Now, to their credit, the  VA has increased the number of those contract examiners, probably  because of this legislation. But until we have the assurances that a  sufficient number of VA contract examiners are able to assist all of  the veterans with their disability claims, we need public-facing DBQs.   My legislation gives the VA additional manpower to process a  veteran's DBQ by maintaining the ability of a veteran's own provider to  fill out the form. This is something vital to veterans in rural  communities who may be far from a VA medical center or contract  examiner.   Furthermore, our proposal prevents veterans from having their  disability claim delayed or denied because the VA changed their DBQ  form during the application process without the veteran knowing. During  this pandemic, we must ensure our veterans' disability  [[Page H4687]]  claims process is not paused or compromised solely due to a change in a  bureaucratic form.   We must protect veterans from unnecessary burdens while securing  benefits owed to them. No veteran should be denied the disability  benefits to which he or she is justly entitled solely because a DBQ is  not publicly available or because the VA changed the form in the middle  of the process.   This is commonsense legislation supported by multiple veteran service  organizations, such as the Disabled American Veterans, the Paralyzed  Veterans of America, Minority Veterans of America, Iraq and Afghanistan  Veterans of America, and more.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan  legislation and restore this vital resource for our Nation's heroes.
