 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the life of the  Reverend T.F. Tenney, who died last week after dedicating more than 65  years of his life to the ministry through the United Pentecostal  Church.   Bishop Tenney began preaching at the young age of 16. He and his  wife, Thetus, were elected to the pastorate when they were just 19 and  18 years old, respectively, to lead a newly formed church in Monroe,  Louisiana.   It was in Monroe where Bishop Tenney cultivated his leadership skills  that would serve him throughout his career as he would go on to lead  ministries directed toward youth, foreign missions, and the greater  Pentecostal church as a whole throughout Louisiana.   Bishop Tenney will be remembered as a man who took new ideas and  turned them into action. That enthusiasm made him a perfect fit for  youth ministry, and he served for 6 years as the youth president of the  Louisiana District United Pentecostal Church and 9 years as the  international youth president.   In 1970, Bishop Tenney relocated to the UPC headquarters in Missouri  to serve as the UPC's foreign missions director, a position that  allowed him to share his belief in Christ with the rest of the world.   Bishop Tenney returned home to Louisiana to pastor a church in  DeRidder. Later, he was elected as the Louisiana district director of  the United Pentecostal Church, where he oversaw about 300 churches and  800 other ministers. He served in that post for 27 years before  retiring to become bishop emeritus of the Louisiana district.   I am proud that Bishop Tenney called Louisiana and the Fifth  Congressional District his home, though we know now that he is in his  true home with the Father.   He was a true man of God, who touched the lives of countless people  both at home and around the globe. He published a dozen books, created  thousands of YouTube videos, and had a Twitter following of more than  44,000 people, all signs of the incredible legacy of the Christian  devotion that he left behind.   Bishop Tenney will be greatly missed, and Dianne and I will keep him  and his family in our prayers.                            ____________________
