 Mr. President, I am glad to be here following my  colleague who is the ranking member of the subcommittee and who has  done such excellent work, as well as with the Senator from Alaska, in  undertaking and really bringing together a vision for their  subcommittee that we have needed on this floor for a long time--well  done.   I stand here as the ranking member of the Agriculture Appropriations  Subcommittee. I am very pleased to be able to pass this bill today--or  we will hopefully soon do so--with strong bipartisan support.  Appreciation to the chairman of the subcommittee, Senator Hoeven, and  his excellent Appropriations Committee team, including Carlisle Clarke,  Elizabeth Dent, Patrick Carroll, and Carlos Elias. They worked hand in  hand with my team of Dianne Nellor, Jessica Schulken, Bob Ross, and  Teri Curtin. I came to the floor the other day to speak to the  excellent work Jessica Schulken has done over her career, serving for  nearly two decades on the committee and just being a powerful,  intelligent, persuasive, and insightful force in agricultural policy. I  think, together, we have produced a very good bill. It provides funding  for programs that are important to every American in every community,  from the smallest rural town to the biggest city. And we rejected  draconian cuts proposed in the President's budget.    Some of the essential items that we find in the Ag appropriations  bill include rural development, which is very important to my State and  my colleagues on both sides of the aisle--we have so much going on in  our rural towns. It is important to fund our rural business, rural  utility service, and rural broadband. Rural business and rural  broadband, by the way, were zeroed out by the President and faced  draconian cuts. I am so pleased we were able to reach a bipartisan  decision to support these rural development programs.   We also support nutrition for Americans. In our country, there is no  reason Americans should be going hungry.   We also maintain international assistance, which largely means buying  American food and shipping it overseas to places in the world that are  desperate. I had the chance to visit some of those areas in Africa and  see firsthand how important our contribution to the World Food Program  is.   Our environmental programs assist farmers in the stewardship of the  land. It is something they have in their hearts, and it is helpful to  have the EQIP program and the NRCS to support them.   The Agricultural Research Service is essential and so important to  the great diversity of crops we have in my State and the unending list  of potential pests, problems, and diseases that occur. We have to  continue that research. I recently visited, for example, a wheat  research station, and it was fascinating to see. From a distance, you  would say: Well, that is just another field of wheat; what could be the  issues? Well, it turns out there are all kinds of important issues that  require agricultural research. Then there is risk management for our  farmers and having that structure to support them so they aren't wiped  out in rough times.   It has been a pleasure to work on this subcommittee and to see the  broader Appropriations Committee returning to regular order, bringing  bills to the floor, having a chance for all Senators to have a say in  the process. So here we are in a better place, and I hope it is a  course that we can continue.                      Recognition of the Minority Leader     Mr. President, I come to the floor tonight with a simple  and clear message, which is that we must not allow internment camps to  be built in the United States of America.   I come with this message because we have heard on Capitol Hill that  even as I speak, individuals are planning to bring forward legislation  that would, in fact, create internment camps as a strategy of family  incarceration--a strategy that President Trump has been championing. So  I say tonight, absolutely not. We must not allow internment camps to be  established in the United States of America.   When we look at the history of the world and the history of America,  we realize that in many ways, we are still a very young nation, with  less than three centuries behind us. In that comparatively short time,  we have accomplished great things. We have helped save the world from  tyranny and fascism, while pushing the boundaries of science. We spread  democracy and human rights to nations far and wide. We have broken down  barriers of race and gender and sexual orientation here at home in a  vision of equality and opportunity for all.   Yet we cannot forget that along with those great accomplishments,  there have also been some dark chapters in our history. We all are  aware of these chapters when the United States embraced slavery from  its founding up through the Civil War; that we embraced discrimination  through segregation and Jim Crow laws; that we had in World War II a  strategy of creating internment camps to imprison our citizens who were  of Japanese ancestry.   Now, we have another dark chapter--a chapter in which our government  has decided to treat those fleeing persecution from around the world as  if they are criminals, to greet them not with Lady Liberty and a torch,  saying, ``Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning  to breathe free'' but a different saying--a saying that if you are  fleeing persecution and you wash up on the shores of the United States,  we will treat you as a criminal. We will tear away your children, and  we will throw you in prison.   In the span of just a few weeks, from May 4 and into June of this  year, the Trump team tore around 2,600 young boys and girls from their  parents' arms. They were families coming to the United States. They  were fleeing persecution. They were seeking asylum. They were going  through all kinds of trials and tribulations back in their home  countries. They were going through all kinds of difficulties on the  path of arriving in the United States. They had, in their minds, that  vision that we are a nation where almost everyone has in their family  history someone who fled persecution, who fled civil war, who fled  drought and famine, who fled religious persecution, so surely they  would be treated with dignity and understanding as they sought asylum  from the persecution they faced back home.   Instead, many were stopped from coming through the entry points to  claim asylum. Many resorted, therefore, to coming across other points  in between the official border points, and they faced this new policy-- this policy concocted by Attorney General Jeff Sessions, President of  the United States Donald Trump, the Chief of Staff, and Steve Miller.  This plan was deterrence--deterrence by afflicting children so as to  send a message, if you flee persecution, do not think of coming to the  United States.   Let us recognize that the whole idea of establishing a political  tactic, a political goal of deterrence through the infliction of trauma  on children is a dark and evil place for our government to have gone.  One that--now that light has been shed on it, now that America has  cried out from boundary to boundary, from East to West and from North  to South and said that this is wrong, it is immoral, no religious  tradition in the world would support this, the administration has ended  those family separations, those children being ripped out of their  parents' arms. They are now under a responsibility to reunify the  children with their parents. They have been ordered by the court to  have deadlines for those children under 5 and for those children 5  through 17. They missed the first and second deadlines, and 700  children are still not reunited with their parents.   Reports are coming in on the impact, the trauma inflicted on the  children and how seriously this modified their behavior. A recent piece  in the New York Times told the story of a 5-year-old boy from Brazil  who was separated from his mother for 50 days.   Thiago used to love playing with toys of the Minions from the  ``Despicable Me'' movies, but now his new favorite game is patting down  and shackling migrants with plastic handcuffs, and now when people come  to their home, he flees. He runs away. He hides behind the couch,  afraid he will once again be torn from his mother's arms.   His story is not unique. In fact, we hear story after story after  story of children and the reverberations of the trauma they have  experienced at the hands of the Trump administration; children  terrified of being separated from their parents for even just a few  moments; children whose whole outlook on life--their whole  disposition--has been modified; children afraid of engaging in a life  outside the house.   The act of tearing families apart has supposedly stopped with the  President's order. He has an Executive order  [[Page S5562]]  which I have in my hand, but what this Executive order plans next is  also horrible and shameful. This is a plan to establish internment  camps in the United States of America. The President has gone from  family separation, tearing children out of their parents' arms, to  family incarceration, where families would be detained indefinitely  together. Internment camps, tent cities out in the middle of the desert  or maybe on military bases. We have seen this type of policy before. We  know how badly it ends for our Nation. We made a huge mistake in World  War II locking up Japanese-American families in internment camps, and  we are still dealing with the consequences.   After visiting one of those camps in 1943, Eleanor Roosevelt remarked  that ``to undo a mistake is always harder than not to create one  originally, but we seldom have the foresight.''   In this instance, we should have the foresight. We know the history  of the horror of internment camps. We have the ability to stop our  Nation from making a terrible mistake. We know how history will look on  us if we fail to prevent this mistake and follow the President's plan  for internment camps, which he has laid out.   In the aftermath of the attack on Pearl Harbor, we allowed fear and  bigotry to consume us. We took away the freedom of more than 110,000  Americans. Freedom, the most basic human right, was taken away by our  government from 110,000 American citizens. We locked Japanese-Americans  in prison camps behind barbed wire fences in some of the most  inhospitable parts of the Nation for no other reason than their  Japanese ancestry. Children grew up not in their communities but behind  barbed wire. Adults were torn off their land, their farms, their  orchards. They were torn away from their professions, which ran the  full spectrum of professions across America, to be able to earn just a  few cents a day, working inside those prisons. Families who once owned  their homes, had a vision for the future, had a vision for the  children's future were crammed together for years in wooden shacks  behind barbed wire.   In a 1943 radio interview, Dillon Myer, the head of the agency in  charge of the camps, spoke out against them. Mind you, this was the  middle of the war. He was in charge of the camps. He knows it is wrong;  he knows it is destructive. He said: ``Public opinion feeding on  prejudice and fanned by hatred and fear of the unknown will do some  peculiar things.''   He went on to say: Even though the war relocation authority is  responsible for the operation of the relocation centers, we are  convinced that they are not good things. It is not a normal way of  life. It produces many kinds of abnormal conditions that are not  desirable.   Indeed, as former First Lady Laura Bush pointed out in her op-ed  article in the Washington Post a few months ago: ``We also know that  this treatment inflicts trauma; those who have been interned have been  twice as likely to suffer cardiovascular disease or die prematurely  than those who were not interned.''   One Japanese-American hero, Fred Korematsu, challenged this racist  policy. He challenged it all the way to the Supreme Court. In a 6-to-3  decision the Court would long regret, it upheld the constitutionality  of these camps. Seven decades later, history embraces the view of the  three dissenting justices. In the words of Justice Frank Murphy:         Racial discrimination in any form and in any degree has no       justifiable part whatever in our democratic way of life. It       is unattractive in any setting, but it is utterly revolting       among a free people who have embraced the principles set       forth in the Constitution of the United States [of America].    This is why a commission, created by President Jimmy Carter in 1980,  found that the internment camps were a ``grave injustice'' that stemmed  from ``race prejudice, war hysteria, and a failure of political  leadership.''   It is why, when awarding him the Presidential Medal of Freedom in  1998, President Clinton said:         In the long history of our country's constant search for       justice, some names of ordinary citizens stand for millions       of souls: Plessy, Brown, Parks. To that distinguished list,       today we add the name of Fred Korematsu.    Fred Korematsu challenged the legitimacy of internment camps under  the Constitution of the United States. In fact, just earlier this year,  2018, Chief Justice John Roberts said: ``Korematsu was gravely wrong  the day it was decided, has been overruled in the court of history,  and--to be clear--'has no place in law under the Constitution.'''   So it was called a failure of political leadership that we  established internment camps in World War II, and it would be an  enormous failure of political leadership if we were to establish  internment camps in 2018; yet I keep hearing this very plan is being  cooked up to be put on the floor of the Senate when we return. That is  why I am speaking about it tonight to say: No, absolutely not; those  among us who are planning such a deed will face enormous opposition,  not just from me but from everyone who cares about justice in the  United States of America, everyone who cares about decency and  fairness, everyone who knows that the strategy of ripping children out  of their parents' arms was dark and evil and wrong. We are not going to  allow family separation to be replaced by family incarceration.   But here we are, with this Executive order, and it says, in somewhat  bland language, ``Affording Congress an Opportunity to Address Family  Separation.'' This Executive order--this order right here--is an  argument for establishing internment camps in the United States of  America. This strategy, laid out by the President, must not happen.   This statement says that it is the official policy of the Trump  administration to detain immigrant families together. What are they  talking about? Internment camps--not handcuffs for the parents where  the children are ripped out of their arms; it is handcuffs for all. It  is an Executive order calling on the military to provide facilities for  housing the immigrant families and, if they can't find them, to  construct them, if necessary. This document instructs the Attorney  General of the United States to try to find a way to overturn a legal  settlement known as the Flores consent agreement, which says that  children cannot be detained indefinitely.    So this document lays out two strategies to internment camps: one, by  getting the courts to overturn the Flores consent agreement and the  second, affording Congress an opportunity to address family separation.  It calls on Congress to act, to make it legal to establish internment  camps. Have we learned nothing?   Here is what I have to say about this Executive order: no internment  camps in the United States of America, not now and not in the future. I  will absolutely resist such a strategy. This Presidential vision is  anything but Presidential--this vision of a President who is operating  in a fashion outside of a vision of the Constitution. I know there will  be many among us who will join in this effort to resist this strategy.   So if my colleagues--any one of them--should bring this to the floor,  I want them to know this will be a fight. This will be a battle. We  will call up the horror of the past and say that it will not be  accompanied by a horror of the present. We will not go from family  separation to family incarceration. Internment would be just as wrong  today as it was seven decades ago. If we allow this to happen, it is  more than a failure of political leadership. It is to allow America to  dwell in a deep and dark and evil place.   Some may say that families fleeing persecution are coming to America  to ask for asylum, which they are allowed to do under the Refugee  Convention, of which the United States is a member.   They may say: Senator Merkley, you believe it is wrong to rip  children out of their parents' arms, and you believe it is wrong to  establish internment camps. What would you do? Well, here is what I  would do: I would reestablish the Family Case Management Program. That  is a program that worked well--that worked very well--but was  dismantled by this administration approximately a year ago to pave the  way for family separation, to inflict trauma on children.   What is the Family Case Management Program? I don't think the  President of the United States knows about this program--the program he  ended--or he doesn't want to know about it. He wants to paint some  other vision. So let's remind the President of the United States how  this works, the program that he got rid of, the program that worked so  well.  [[Page S5563]]    A family comes seeking asylum. They present themselves with that  case. They are treated with respect and dignity because we are a nation  of individuals with family histories of individuals fleeing  persecution. We understand what that is like. We understand what it is  like, and we treat people with decency.   The families are put into a case management program while their  asylum case is being prepared. The whole point of the program is to  make sure they show up for their court appointments, make sure they  show up for their check-ins, make sure they have someone who guides  them through the system so they understand how it works. If they  understand how it works, they know when to show up and where to show  up, and they know how to prepare for those meetings.   This program was created by ICE and Homeland Security. They put their  heads to work: How do we treat people with dignity and respect and make  sure they show up at their check-ins and their court appointments? They  designed a very good program, the Family Case Management Program. So  families lived their life in preparation for their appearances in  court, and we did not inflict trauma on the children. We did not treat  them as pawns in some broader scheme of deterrence. We treated families  with basic dignity.   Then, if they won their asylum case, then they came into a country  that had received and treated them with dignity. If they lost their  asylum case, they went back to their country. They were deported, but  they had memories of a country that treated them with respect and  decency until that asylum case date arrived.   This program had such a phenomenal success rate that I was stunned  when I got hold of the inspector general's report. I want to make sure  that folks can see this. This inspector general's report says, based on  the information provided by ICE, that the overall program compliance  for all five regions is an average of 99 percent for ICE check-ins and  appointments and 100 percent attendance at court hearings.   That number is stunning, and I wouldn't share it if it were anything  other than from the inspector general himself or herself reporting  after a thorough investigation--99 percent for ICE check-ins, 100  percent attendance at court hearings. Wow. How often do you see a  program that works that well?    There is another report, and that report came when the program was  terminated. That report proceeds to have some additional numbers in it.  This one came after the second report. It was an afterprogram report.  It is called the Family Case Management Program Closeout Report,  February 2018. This was in the hands of the Trump administration even  as they were planning to end the program, actually did end the program.   What it says is, the program operated for 17 months. It says it was  launched in the following cities: Baltimore, Chicago, Los Angeles,  Miami, New York City, and Newark. It had different nonprofits that  operated it: Bethany Christian Services, the Frida Kahlo Community  Organization, the International Institute of Los Angeles, the Youth Co- Op, Inc. in Miami, the Catholic Charities of New York. They served over  2,000 immigrants. It treated them by educating them about how this  worked as they prepared for their asylum hearing. It provided them with  individualized needs assessments and service plans, orientation and  information sessions on legal rights and responsibilities and  obligations, tracking and monitoring of those obligations, including  showing up for check-ins, which they did 99 percent of the time, and  showing up for court hearings, according to the IG, 100 percent of the  time.   ICE concluded it was an overall success. This evaluation came after  the IG's report. It was no longer 100 percent attendance of court  hearings. Instead, it was 99.3 percent--a 99-percent success rate, 99- percent compliance with ICE monitoring requirements, including  telephonic and in-person check-ins.   When participants reported on how they were treated, they talked  about positive relationships with their case managers, and it centered  on the trust that was established between the case manager and the  participant. That is pretty amazing success for a program that the  administration shut down in favor of choosing to deliberately inflict  trauma on children.   We have not one report, not one evaluation; we have two. This report  from February this year, with all this positive information about how  the program worked, is not easy to find online. It has essentially been  hidden.   After I raised this issue of the Family Case Management Program, a  person brought this report to my team and said: Hey, did you know there  is this other closeout evaluation that lays out the vision of how well  the program worked in far more detail than the IG report?   I said: No, I didn't know about that. Great, I will share it with my  colleagues, which I am doing right now.   I don't know why it wasn't circulated. Maybe it is because it had  such glowing reviews of the program the administration shut down that  they were embarrassed by their argument; the fact of this report says  their argument that people wouldn't show up for their court hearings is  simply wrong. I imagine that is why it wasn't circulated.   In this Family Case Management Program, they talk about costs in this  evaluation. They go through the different strategies. The Family Case  Management Program costs $38 per day. That is per participant, per day,  $38. That compares with family residential facilities at an average  cost of $237 per day. That is $38 versus $237.   The program worked incredibly well, and it was far less expensive  than detention--family residential facility detention. In addition, we  now have some recent numbers that have been put forward. Health and  Human Services has told news outlets that it costs American taxpayers  $775 per person, per night to house people at tent city internment  camps--$775 per person per night versus $38. Thirty-eight dollars, no  trauma--a relation of respect and trust versus incarceration at $775  per night.   This Trump strategy of inflicting trauma on children is wrong at  every single level you can imagine. It is a costly, inhumane, damaging  program, with lifetime consequences for the children versus decency and  respect and trust, and the program costs just a fraction, one-twentieth  of this reported $700-plus per night.   If you have those two options, which one would you choose? Would you  choose the program that costs a fraction, one-twentieth, of the tent  city internment camp strategy? Would you choose a program that builds  trust and relationships and has a 99- to 100-percent rate of success in  people showing up for their check-ins, a 99- to 100-percent rate of  showing up for their court hearings versus a program that does so much  damage to so many.   I have come to the Senate floor to say one thing as clearly as I  possibly can to every colleague. If you are part of the plan to bring  an internment camp strategy to the floor of the Senate, I will fight  that plan with everything I have. It is an evil and dark place for this  country to go. We know that from our history.   We know history has said it was a failure of political leadership to  allow it to have happened in World War II. I will do everything I can  to make sure we do not have another failure of political leadership  that allows the vision of internment camps imbedded in the President's  Executive order to occur in the United States of America.   Lady Liberty says: ``Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled  masses yearning to breathe free.''   It speaks to the fact that almost all of us come from family roots  that involved immigrants, involved people fleeing persecution.   In that poet's words, Emma Lazarus, goes on to speak about ``the  wretched refuse of your teeming shore. Send these, the homeless,  tempest-tost to me, I lift my lamp beside the golden door!''   Let's keep that lamp lit here in the United States of America. Let's  treat those fleeing persecution with respect and decency. That is what  is in our blood as an American. That is what is in our DNA--a vision of  compassion and freedom and opportunity that knows, through all too  personal of family experiences, what it is like to flee religious  persecution or famine or war and what a beautiful thing it is to be  treated with respect and decency if you  [[Page S5564]]  come to the shores of the United States of America.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my intern,  Erin McGinnis, be granted privileges of the floor for the remainder of  the day.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my  legislative fellow Long Lam and intern Erin McGinniss be granted  privileges of the floor.
