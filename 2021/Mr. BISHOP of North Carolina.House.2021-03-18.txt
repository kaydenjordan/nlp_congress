 Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to observe  the recent, almost simultaneous, passing of three prominent members of  the Lumbee Tribe and the citizens of Robeson County, North Carolina:  Mr. Lycurous Lowry, Mr. Paul Brooks, Sr., and Mr. Wyvis Oxendine.   These men displayed great fidelity to this important community and  our Ninth District of North Carolina throughout their lives.   Mr. Lycurous Lowry dedicated 50 years of his life to Robeson County,  serving 41 years as the president of the Robeson County Farm Bureau.   Mr. Paul Brooks, Sr. spent many years as a public servant to Robeson  County, including being elected as the fourth chairman of the Lumbee  Tribe.   Mr. Wyvis Oxendine leaves behind over 20 years of devotion to his  community, which includes stints as a county commissioner, a  magistrate, and an educator.   Mr. Speaker, these three men take their leave from us at almost the  same time and leave behind an indelible impact on our community. I  honor them for all they have done.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, the American people are a  generous people, instinctively drawn to the idea of amnesty. It is a  fine word, ``amnesty.'' It means a general pardon for offenses, an act  of forgiveness for past offenses.   Of course, in the immigration arena, amnesty means not only pardon or  forgiveness for violating our laws, but also a grant of important  rights; ultimately, the privilege of citizenship. Sometimes that  important distinction can be overlooked.                                time  1330    But what is particularly despicable in the present legislation is  that Democrats exploit that fundamental spirit of generosity by  misleading the American people about the scope of the proposed amnesty,  its recipients, and its implications.   They would have you believe that this legislation responds to those  President Obama dubbed Dreamers. In the gentlewoman from California's  description, it is a 17-year-old who worked hard and became a model  student and quarterback on the high school football team who doesn't  even remember the time before he lived in the United States.   But this bill is not the Dream Act. Rather, it crushes the dreams of  American workers. It is not for only 641,000 active DACA recipients. In  this bill, Democrats want to provide amnesty for more than 2.9 million  illegal immigrants, including even people who entered the United States  illegally by January 1, 2021, just over 2 months ago, and all at a time  when our unemployment rate is over 6 percent and working Americans are  the hardest-pressed by the economic impacts of Democrats' affinity for  lockdowns.   This bill also allows dangerous criminals and gang members to gain  amnesty benefits, even if they have been convicted of multiple  misdemeanors. If this bill is signed into law, adults from Syria,  Yemen, Sudan, Somalia, Liberia, and Venezuela will receive amnesty.   This body should be prioritizing relief for American citizens, not  illegal immigrants. I urge my colleagues to reject this misleading  rhetoric and this dangerous bill.
