 Madam Speaker, I thank Representative Cole for yielding.   This impeachment process is a total sham. This resolution, which  seeks to legitimize it, misleads the American public. Section 2 of this  bill is titled, ``The Open and Transparent Investigative Proceedings by  the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence,'' but the process set  forth in this resolution is far from open and far from transparent. In  fact, it is the exact opposite.   The resolution continues the closed-door meetings that blocks entry  to Members of Congress and prohibits the President's due process  rights. And it merely authorizes, but does not require, Chairman Schiff  to make transcripts public.   Last night Republicans offered 17 amendments to add some fairness  into the process, but Democrats rejected them all.   I had an amendment to ensure minority witnesses could call an equal  number of witnesses as the majority. Democrats said no.   I had an amendment to require the Intel chairman to turn over  exculpatory materials to the Judiciary Committee. Democrats shot it  down.   I had an amendment to give ranking members the same authority as the  chairman to submit materials to the Judiciary Committee. Democrats  rejected that, too.   The process set forth by this resolution violates basic standards of  fairness.   I urge opposition to this resolution.    Madam Speaker, I rise in observance of Domestic Violence  Awareness Month.   Over 25 years ago, I was in an abusive relationship with my ex- husband. I became a single mother to a young daughter, working just to  survive day to day. I never dreamed in a million years that I would be  standing here before you today as a Member of Congress, speaking on the  floor of the U.S. House of Representatives. But I not only survived, I  thrived.   I share my story in hopes of helping others. I hope they find  strength in our efforts to acknowledge their suffering and recognize  the many organizations that exist to help them today.                            ____________________
