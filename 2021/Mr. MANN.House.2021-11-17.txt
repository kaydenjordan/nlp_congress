 Madam Speaker, I thank Congressman Keller for hosting this  Special Order and for his hard work and leadership.   I rise today with you and scores of our colleagues to call for  congressional review of President Biden's vaccine mandates.   During his tenure in the White House, President Biden has  circumvented this Congress to issue multiple executive orders imposing  vaccine mandates on all Federal employees, Federal contractors,  healthcare workers, and even private businesses with more than 100  employees.   These mandates are forcing Americans to choose between their  paychecks and their principles.   I have heard from multiple agents at the USDA's Farm Service Agency  who have chosen to resign rather than receive the vaccine. Just a year  ago, these same agents were deemed essential, connecting vital  resources to farmers and ranchers, and today, they are out of a job.   Congress should immediately review these mandates in full and take up  legislation like my bill, the Stop Vaccine Mandates Act, which would  have prohibited OSHA from implementing a vaccine mandate on private  businesses altogether.   Anyone who wants to receive a vaccine should do so, but that is a  personal healthcare decision. It is not an arena for mandates from the  government, and I am deeply disappointed by President Biden's policies  and lack of responsible, legitimate concerns surrounding them. I will  continue to push against these overreaching mandates with all of us and  will fight to protect the freedoms of the American people.
