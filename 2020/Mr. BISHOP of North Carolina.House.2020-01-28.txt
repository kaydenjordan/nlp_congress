 Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the memory  of Philip M. Van Hoy of Charlotte, who passed away unexpectedly  Saturday morning.   Phil was a preeminent attorney, a mentor to a generation of  conservatives, and a dear friend of 30 years.   Phil grew up in Charlotte and graduated from Duke University and the  University of North Carolina Law School, but he was a lifelong Duke  fan. Upon graduation, Phil enlisted in the U.S. Army Reserve,  eventually leaving as a first lieutenant.   As a lawyer, Phil served Duke Power and, in due course, founded the  law firm Van Hoy, Reutlinger, Adams & Dunn, where he handled some of  the most complex employment cases at every level, including the United  States Supreme Court. In 2013 and 2019, Phil was named Lawyer of the  Year for employment law by Best Lawyers in America.   Though Phil was a gifted lawyer, his true passion was Republican  politics. Phil served as vice chairman of the Mecklenburg County  Republican Party and was an alternative delegate to the RNC convention  that nominated Ronald Reagan.   But most significantly, Phil was a mentor to a generation of  conservatives. He organized a lunch that still goes on in Charlotte,  and they refer to it affectionately as the ``Hun Lunch''; although, as  Phil was quick to point out, Attila the Hun was no conservative. He was  a collectivist.   Phil welcomed me 30 years ago to the Hun Lunch, and it continues  weekly today. Its members are devastated by his loss.   I am lucky to count Phil as a cherished friend. Friends will  remember, particularly, his trademark sharp wit, the ever-ready joke,  and the gleam in his eye much more since his untimely passing and will  remember his consistent kindness and commitment to values.   Jo and I extend our deepest condolences and prayers to Sylvia and  their two sons, Travis and Marshall. May Phil Van Hoy rest in peace.                      Honoring the Life of Terry L. Hunt     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the  life of Terry L. Hunt, who passed away this weekend while on a business  trip to Kenya.   Mr. Hunt was president of Lumbee Tribe Enterprises and a valued  member of the Lumbee Tribe. Terry's life was dedicated to the success  of the Lumbee people, and his passing represents a grave loss.   Mr. Hunt was a native of the Fairmont community in Robeson County,  North Carolina. Terry graduated from Fairmont High School in 1979 and  served his community as a police officer with the Fairmont Police  Department.   In 1993, Terry rose to the position of chief of police and was  selected by the Attorney General to help shape the national law  enforcement initiative for cases of missing children.   Mr. Hunt was deeply devoted to his community, and when he retired  from law enforcement in 2001, he continued his public service. Mr. Hunt  represented his district on the Lumbee Tribal Council from 2011 to 2017  and was elected as economic development chairman, taking an active  interest in economic affairs of the Lumbee people.   While Mr. Hunt left us far too young, it is altogether fitting that  he passed while finalizing a new contract for the Tribe-owned business  that he led. Mr. Hunt served his community until the very end, a  community that is deeply mourning his loss.   Terry's work will go on, but no one will be able to fill his shoes.  May his love and dedication for his people be an example for all of us.                            ____________________
