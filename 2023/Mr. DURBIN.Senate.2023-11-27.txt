 Madam President, I am going to follow the lead of the  Democratic leader, who noted what he did last week.   I was fortunate enough to be part of a family reunion of the Durbin  family, honoring my sister-in-law Lorraine on her 90th birthday. She is  a wonderful person and a mother of 10--9 boys and 1 girl.   We all gathered to enjoy Thanksgiving, the inevitable birthdays  during that period of time, as well as anniversaries--63 Durbins.  Somehow, America survived. We all came together for a wonderful week.  They are wonderful people. I am so happy to be part of the family and  to give honor to my sister-in-law Lorraine.   I would just say that, when it comes to the rewards of life, there is  hardly anything that can match a loving family, and I have that.    I announce that the Senator from Pennsylvania (Mr.  Fetterman), the Senator from New Hampshire (Ms. Hassan), the Senator  from Massachusetts (Mr. Markey), the Senator from Georgia (Mr. Ossoff),  the Senator from Georgia (Mr. Warnock), and the Senator from  Massachusetts (Ms. Warren) are necessarily absent.
