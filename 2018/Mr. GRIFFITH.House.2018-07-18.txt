 Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman very much, and I  appreciate my colleague for introducing this amendment.   He is absolutely right. The Clean Air Act never gave the EPA this  authority. They just created it out of thin air.   Their rationale is kind of interesting, because they took the  authority that said that they could regulate new motor vehicles or new  motor vehicle engines, and then the definition of new motor vehicle  meaning any self-propelled vehicle designed for transporting persons or  properties on a street or highway, and applied it to trailers. They are  not self-propelled.   When I asked Janet McCabe, who was the Acting Director of the Air  Division of the EPA, when she came in front of the Energy and Commerce  Committee how in the world could they do this, and I presumed she  wasn't a lawyer and she said: Well, yes, I am.   I was surprised, because the language is pretty clear. They don't  have the ability to do that.   She said: Well, you can't haul any goods if the trailer is not  attached to a truck.   That is not in the code. The code says that they only have authority  over self-propelled vehicles. They created this out of whole cloth.   It doesn't make any sense to allow an agency to create law. That is  our job, and I told her that that day.   I said: Look, you think this needs to be changed, bring in a bill,  and we will discuss it.   They have never done that. They don't have authority. We shouldn't  fund something that is clearly illegal based on the plain English  reading of the terms.
