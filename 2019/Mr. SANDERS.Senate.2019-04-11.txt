 Mr. President, I would like to recognize the  tremendous work of Vermont's Meals on Wheels programs. Last year, Meals  on Wheels prepared and home-delivered nearly 800,000 freshly cooked  nutritious meals to more than 5,700 Vermont seniors. In our State the  second oldest in the Nation, these meals are essential to helping  ensure that older Vermonters, particularly those living in rural areas,  have access to adequate nutrition.   These meals are made possible by the hard work of hundreds of  dedicated professionals and volunteers at Vermont's five Area Agencies  on Aging, local Meals on Wheels providers, and senior centers. From the  chefs who prepare the nutritious meals, to the senior center staff that  coordinate deliveries, to the volunteer drivers who deliver the meals,  Vermont's Meals on Wheels network is a critically important part of our  social safety net for older Vermonters.   Of course, Meals on Wheels is much more than just delivering a  nutritious meal, as important as that is. Volunteer drivers also  provide invaluable social interaction and companionship for the seniors  they visit, which goes a  [[Page S2432]]  long way to combat the effects of isolation that many older Vermonters  face, especially if they live alone or in a more rural community.  Without this social interaction, seniors are more likely to have  feelings of loneliness and depression, which puts them at higher risk  for dementia, chronic disease, falls, and hospitalization.   The regular visits by Meals on Wheels volunteers serve another  purpose, as well. The drivers check to make sure that the seniors are  safe, secure, and warm. They know each person they visit and recognize  immediately if something doesn't seem right. It is no exaggeration to  say that Meals on Wheels volunteers have averted tragedies and even  saved lives after finding seniors who have fallen or are in the midst  of a medical emergency.   Last month was ``March for Meals,'' when Meals on Wheels programs  across the country commemorate the March 1972 signing into law of an  amendment to the Older Americans Act of 1965 to create a national  nutrition program for seniors 60 years and older. As we often do, many  of my Vermont staff rode along with Meals on Wheels volunteers across  the State to see the wonderful work they are doing and highlight the  importance of Meals on Wheels in the lives of thousands of Vermonters.   Let me end by thanking the Meals on Wheels staff and volunteers in  Vermont for their remarkable work.                            ____________________
