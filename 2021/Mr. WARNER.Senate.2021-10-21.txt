 Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the 60th  anniversary of the National Reconnaissance Office, NRO.   Born in September 1961, the present day National Reconnaissance  Office was formed by agreement between the Secretary of Defense and the  Director of Central Intelligence during the height of the Cold War. In  the first decade of the Cold War, American ingenuity and engineering  had enabled significant advances to meet the demand for better  reconnaissance as new, high-altitude aircraft like the U-2 and its  high-speed successors, the A-12 and SR-71, were developed. However,  even this new technology had its limitations. This became acutely clear  with the shoot-down of CIA pilot Francis Gary Powers' U-2 in 1960.  Thankfully, American aerospace engineers were also maturing new rocket  and sensor technologies that enabled the United States to meet the  increasing national security challenge of how to analyze Soviet forces  to avert a nuclear war.   Carrying over from the Eisenhower to Kennedy administrations, a group  of remarkable Americans brought the foresight of combining a number of  government satellite efforts into a single U.S. intelligence  organization that would become the modem NRO. These optical experts,  chemists, physicists, engineers, military officers, mathematicians, and  photography entrepreneurs recognized the value of a national policy of  peacetime strategic reconnaissance in addressing the Soviet threat as  well as future, unforeseen, national security challenges.   Assuming control of the previously initiated Corona  photoreconnaissance program and following up with the Gambit, Hexagon,  and signals intelligence programs, the NRO was able to supply the  essential intelligence information needed to understand Soviet missile  capabilities. The intelligence information the NRO provided to analysts  and policymakers was critical in keeping nuclear tensions in check at  the most tense points of the Cold War.   With the arms limitation treaties of the 1970s, the need for the  verification of Soviet military capabilities posed a new challenge for  policymakers. The scientists and engineers of the NRO would once again  rise to the challenge by designing and building the Kennen digital  imagery satellite and other unique overhead technological capabilities  to respond to these daunting intelligence requirements.   In recent times, the capabilities of the NRO have been vital to  helping us better understand and react to our Nation's toughest  challenges, helping to see the unseen across the globe, from the hunt  for Osama bin Laden and supporting counterterrorism operations around  the globe, to helping us recover from natural disasters like hurricanes  and wildfires here at home.   While this 60th anniversary is an appropriate time to celebrate the  rich history and innovations of the NRO of the past, I think it is also  important to recognize where the NRO is moving today and into the  future and for the American people to understand why the NRO is so  vital to our security.   Our colleagues on the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence and I  have challenged the NRO to move faster in building and acquiring the  next generation of space reconnaissance capabilities, including  commercial technologies, as the great power competition with Russia and  China takes shape.   NRO is rising to this challenge. Even as the COVID-19 pandemic has  impacted so many parts of our society, economy, and supply chain, the  NRO's workforce has stayed on task. In the last 18 months the NRO has  not only maintained 100 percent of its mission capability, but the NRO  also has had a record series of launches and payload deliveries into  orbit, with 8 launches and 16 payloads in 2020 and 2021, including a  launch from Wallops Island, in the Commonwealth of Virginia. I am also  pleased to point out that the NRO also delivered its 12th consecutive  clean financial audit during this pandemic period.   The NRO of today and tomorrow is growing its partnerships in both the  private and public sectors. Within the Department of Defense, the NRO  is partnering with the U.S. Space Force and U.S. Space Command to  integrate national space operations with the combatant commander and  Federal decision-maker requirements and to protect and defend our  Nation's assets in space.   Likewise, the NRO is increasing engagement with allies, and  particularly the Five Eyes nations, to better leverage capabilities and  take advantage of new opportunities, such as the NRO's first satellite  launch from an overseas location in 2020 from New Zealand. The NRO  works side by side with intelligence community partners such as the  National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency to support the NGA's imagery  analysis mission and the National Security Agency to support the NSA's  analysis of signals and radio frequency signatures.   In the private sector arena, the NRO is building off a 60-year  history of working with U.S. industry by embracing the benefits of the  growing U.S. commercial space industry and delivering more capabilities  at a lower cost to the taxpayers, taking advantage of a full range of  services from commercial imagery and commercial cloud services to  commercial launch.   Speeding innovation in anticipation of tomorrow's intelligence needs,  the NRO is working with universities and research institutions across  the Nation, looking for new ways to adapt existing capabilities and to  bring online new technologies, The NRO is pushing the boundaries of  advanced science and technology for new phenomenology and applications  that will improve and enhance the NRO's ability to provide policymakers  and warfighters with advanced warning of events and provide critical  insights into the capabilities and intentions of our adversaries.   None of this work could be done without the women and men of the NRO.  The NRO workforce, a blend of military, civilian, and contract  employees, is one of the most technical and highly skilled in the  government. They are engineers, scientists, IT professionals, space  system operators, and acquisition and program managers, with advanced  degrees and a diversity of backgrounds and experiences. They are some  of the best our Nation has to offer. They are the vital piece that  makes the NRO not only a great place to work but makes the NRO the best  place to work if you want to build the satellites, rockets, and ground  systems that support our national security.   From the NRO pioneers to the workforce of today, the women and men of  the NRO can always be counted on to stand true to their motto, ``Supra  Et Ultra,'' always going Above and Beyond. I offer my congratulations  to the NRO on an exceptional 60 years, and I look forward to seeing how  the NRO will lead us into the next 60 years of space reconnaissance.                            ____________________
