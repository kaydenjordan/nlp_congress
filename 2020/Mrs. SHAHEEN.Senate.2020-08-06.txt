 Mr. President, I rise today to salute Neal  Elliott for his many years of dedicated service and forward-looking  leadership at the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy,  ACEEE. Neal will soon retire from his role as senior director for  research, the capstone to a distinguished career at ACEEE that began in  1993. An internationally recognized expert on energy efficiency, he has  helped slash energy waste in the United States. Neal leaves a legacy  worthy of our praise and gratitude.   ACEEE is a nonprofit, nonpartisan organization that researches and  advances energy efficiency policies, programs, technologies and  behaviors as a way to strengthen the economy, reduce pollution, protect  public health, and address climate change. Since its establishment in  1980, ACEEE has helped to mold U.S. policies that have cut domestic  energy use in half relative to the size of the U.S. economy and  delivered more than $2,000 in annual savings per individual.  [[Page S5267]]    Neal has been instrumental in that success. He has helped to grow not  only ACEEE as an organization, which has more than tripled in size  since his arrival, but also the field of energy efficiency. He oversees  ACEEE's overall research, which includes dozens of reports, fact  sheets, and topic briefs each year. He has spearheaded its work on  industrial, agricultural, and rural issues, including on such topics as  combined heat and power--CHP--electric motor systems, smart energy  management, and industrial decarbonization. Neal helped coin the term  ``intelligent efficiency'' to reflect the growing need to incorporate  the Internet of Things, connected systems, and big data into energy- saving efforts. He was also a key player in the design of the rural  energy programs in the 2002 farm bill that expanded into the Rural  Energy for America Program in the 2008 farm bill. An expert on energy  efficiency policies and programs, he has pushed to overcome market  barriers to integrating CHP and distributed energy resources into a  cleaner, intelligent power grid. He holds six patents in thermal  storage and produce processing, has written dozens of articles and  reports, and is a frequent speaker at domestic and international  conferences.   Just as important, Neal has played a vital, avuncular role in  expanding the energy efficiency community. He is adept at bringing  people together and forging effective partnerships. With a doctorate  degree in engineering from Duke University, where he previously taught,  he has mentored and encouraged countless young professionals. He is  passionate about energy efficiency, which he sees as a critical tool  for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, mitigating climate change, and  securing a more hopeful tomorrow for future generations.   Neal has been a stalwart friend to me and my staff. I am thankful for  his leadership and ACEEE's support for my proposals over the years. On  behalf of the people of New Hampshire, I ask my colleagues and all  Americans to join me in thanking Neal Elliott for his years of service  and wishing him all the best in the years ahead.                            ____________________
