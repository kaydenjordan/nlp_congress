 HICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman  for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, we all know that the United States Secret Service is one  of the Federal Government's premier law enforcement agencies.   The agency's critical mission is to protect the President, his  family, and other senior government officials. Agency personnel may  also provide protection at high-profile events. It has a zero-fail  mission; therefore, it is vital that the Secret Service is fully  staffed with nothing but the best.   Unfortunately, the agency has faced tremendous staffing problems. The  Committee on Oversight and Government Reform released a bipartisan  report in 2015, finding the Secret Service has faced challenges related  to hiring and retaining personnel.  [[Page H9636]]                                     time  1245    The report states that the staffing crisis threatens to jeopardize  its critical mission. Staffing issues have persisted, although the  agency has implemented a series of reforms to help get its hiring and  attrition problems under control.   The consequence of these hiring and attrition problems is that the  agency does not have enough personnel to fulfill its zero fail  protective mission. This means existing personnel are working excessive  overtime.   With all the overtime, many Secret Service personnel have reached the  cap on premium pay set in law. As a result, agents are not paid for  overtime hours if doing so would result in compensation above the cap  during any biweekly pay period. These max-outs, as they are known,  contribute to the agency's low morale and unsurprisingly cause the rate  of attrition to spike.   Congress first lifted the pay cap for the Secret Service in 2016 to  help the agency handle the demands of staffing the Presidential  campaign. However, nearly 1,300 employees are at risk of exceeding the  pay cap in 2017.   Due to the extraordinary staffing problems facing the agency, this  bill extends the pay cap waiver provided last year until the end of  2018. Employees will receive compensation up to the basic pay currently  given to members of the Executive Schedule, Level II.   Every Secret Service employee who has exceeded the cap or who is at  risk of doing so because of excessive overtime will receive additional  compensation under this bill.   I want to be clear. This bill is narrowly targeted to fix a problem  currently facing the agency and does so in a timely manner.   The Secret Service cannot continue to rely on expensive overtime, and  Congress fully expects the agency to get its hiring attrition problems  under control. To this end, the bill also requires a report by the  Government Accountability Office focused on the Secret Service's  implementation of recommendations found in the 2014 Protective Mission  Panel report.    HICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, the recommendations, which  include reforming the recruiting and hiring process, hiring additional  personnel, and implementing a zero tolerance disciplinary system, are  instructive and will help the Secret Service develop a world class  human resource system.   Mr. Speaker, in closing, I would like to thank the House Judiciary  Committee, the Homeland Security Committee, along with the Oversight  and Government Reform Committee on putting forth this important  legislation and bringing it to the floor in a timely manner.   Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the extra time and I urge all Members to  support this bill.
