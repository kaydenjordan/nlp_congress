 Thank you, Mr. President.   I wish to commend my colleague from Ohio. The national parks mean so  much to us in Alaska, and I am looking forward to getting on that bill  as a cosponsor. It is a very important piece of legislation. Once  again, Senator Portman is leading the way in the Senate on so many  issues.                                 NATO Summit    Mr. President, this afternoon, I want to say a few words about the  President's visit to NATO and the NATO meeting we just had and talk  about the importance of alliances and our allies. If you read the press  accounts, I think you will see that this trip and the meeting of the  President with all of the NATO leaders in Brussels was, overall, a good  trip.   There has been this commitment by NATO members since at least 2014-- but it really goes way earlier than 2014--for each country to spend 2  percent or more of their GDP on defense spending so that we share the  burden of defense.   The United States has essentially always met this target--easily met  this target--but a lot of other countries haven't. They have heard time  and again from Presidents about this, and yet they have kind of ignored  it.   The success of this trip is that it looks like for the first time in  years, NATO countries are moving away from cuts in defense spending.  Even in the United States, from 2010 to 2016, we were cutting our  defense spending. Although it was way above 2 percent, we cut it by  almost 25 percent. We saw a huge drop in readiness. We are changing  that. Almost all of the NATO countries are starting to add billions of  dollars to defense spending. I think the President deserves a lot of  the credit for really pressing this issue. Other U.S. Presidents have  pressed it, and the Europeans have kind of ignored it, and it seemed to  go away. President Trump stayed focused on it, and we are starting to  see a shift, and I think he deserves credit.   The President also highlighted a big national security issue that is  in Europe that doesn't get a lot of attention, but that should get a  lot of attention, and that is the issue of energy, particularly natural  gas and how Russia feeds a lot of Europe--particularly, in this case,  Germany. That undermines energy security and national security in  Europe and in NATO. It is a controversial topic. A lot of countries in  Europe don't like the fact that Germany is spending so much to import  Russian gas when NATO is actually focused on defending Europe against  Russia. I think the President also did a good job highlighting this  issue and how we need to focus on this.   We are seeing some Europeans protesting the visit of our President,  but I will state this--and you don't read about this a lot: There has  been no Western leader who has done more to undermine Western interests  and Western national security and European energy security than the  former Chancellor of Germany, Gerhard Schroeder. He was the Chancellor  of the Federal Republic of Germany, and when he left office, what did  he do? He immediately went to work for Gazprom and Vladimir Putin to  sell natural gas to European countries, including his own government  and his own country, Germany.   To me, that represents a remarkable betrayal of Western values, NATO  security, and European energy security. It doesn't get highlighted,  but, for our German friends--and they are our good, close allies--it is  one thing to protest our President, but take a look at your former  Chancellor. He is doing more damage to the national security of Europe  and the energy security of Germany and our allies than probably anybody  else in Europe.   The bottom line is this 2 percent GDP goal and this concern that we  have with Russian energy going into European capitals. These have been  bipartisan concerns of Democratic and Republican administrations of the  United States for decades, and I think at this NATO summit we are  starting to see some good progress.   The President ended the NATO meeting by saying: The United States'  commitment to NATO is very strong, remains very strong, and the spirit  of countries willing to spend additional amounts of money is amazing to  see. To see that level of spirit in the room of all the leaders is  incredible.   That is what the President said today, and I think that was a good  message with which to end this NATO leaders' summit in Brussels.   I want to emphasize another point about our alliances and about NATO.  It is also important to know that NATO is not just the sum of the  amount of money that countries spend. That is important. There is no  doubt about it. But this alliance, which many have viewed as the most  successful military alliance in history, is a lot more than just money.  At its heart, it is about common values. At its heart, it is about  countries coming together to defend democracy. At its heart, it is  about countries that have the same core national security interests.   This is very important. At its heart, it is about shared sacrifice.  There is shared sacrifice in the checkbook, yes, but it goes way beyond  this. It is very important to remember article 5 of the NATO treaty,  which is the treaty by which countries invoke the common defense. When  you invoke article 5, that means that all of the other allies are  coming to help you. All of the other allies are coming to defend you.  Article 5 has been invoked in the NATO treaty, which was passed by this  body in 1949, one time. It was invoked one time--one time. When was it  invoked? After the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001.   Our NATO allies said: We are going to help defend America--that is  really important--and they did. They did.   Again, we talk too much about dollars, and I commend the President  for what he has done, but let's talk about other shared sacrifice. The  alliances we have around the world aren't just about money. Since 9/11,  over 1,000 non-U.S. NATO troops have been killed in action in  Afghanistan, coming to our defense after 9/11 and going after the  terrorists who killed over 3,000 Americans on 9/11. Over 1,000 NATO  soldiers--non-American NATO soldiers--have paid the ultimate sacrifice  because of the alliance they have with the United States.   You can't put a pricetag on that. You can't put a pricetag on that.  Some sacrifices are more than just dollars. Some sacrifices can't be  measured in dollars, and I think it is important for all of us here in  the Senate, for the Trump administration, and for all Americans to  remember that.   I wish to thank the families of those over 1,000 NATO alliance  soldiers who have been killed in action and the thousands and thousands  more who have been wounded in Afghanistan, hunting down terrorists who  killed our citizens. It is very important to remember that.   The bottom line is this when it comes to one of the most important  and enduring strategic advantages we have anywhere in the world: We are  an ally-rich nation, and our adversaries--  [[Page S4939]]  such as Russia, North Korea, and Iran--and our potential adversaries---  such as China--are ally-poor. We are ally-rich. Countries trust us.  Countries want to join alliances with the United States, and our  adversaries and potential adversaries are ally-poor.   That system of alliances has been built for over 70 years through the  hard work of Democratic and Republicans Presidents, Secretaries of  State and Defense, and U.S. Senators. It has been a joint collective  effort.   Here is something else that is important to know. Our adversaries and  potential adversaries know that this is the most important strategic  advantage we have over any other country, and that is why for years-- for decades--countries such as Russia, China, Iran, and North Korea  have tried to split up our alliances. We shouldn't let that happen. It  is important to remember this as we continue to deal with these  countries. I think this NATO summit sent a strong message that we are  going to stand together for decades more to come.   When it comes to alliances, this body, pursuant to the U.S.  Constitution, plays a very important role. The alliances I have talked  about--including, especially this week, NATO--came to the Senate for  ratification. Again, it is important as we talk about national  security, we talk about 2 percent, and we talk about burden sharing.  Yes, we need that from our allies, but we also need to remember that  our alliances go well beyond the checkbook--common values and shared  sacrifice. Sometimes that is the most important issue to remember as we  continue to deepen our alliances and expand them throughout the world,  which is the best way to keep peace and prosperity, not just for us but  for the entire world.                      Tribute to Governor Bill Sheffield    Mr. President, it is Thursday afternoon, and the new pages here will  hopefully see that this certainly is one of my favorite moments in the  Senate, and I know it is the Presiding Officer who gets to see the  ``Alaskan of the Week'' every week around this time. I guarantee the  young men and women who are doing a great job as our pages are going to  start to view this as their favorite time, too, because they get to  hear about Alaska and great stories about Alaska. They get to hear  about great and wonderful people in the great State of Alaska who are  doing great things for their community, their State, and their country.  We call that person our Alaskan of the week.   From the onset, we have tried to focus, generally, on people who are  unsung heroes in their communities--people who have worked diligently a  lot of times without a lot of recognition. With my colleagues, I get to  come and tell stories about what they have done for their community or  State or even for their country. At other times, we recognize someone  in our State who has made the headlines, someone whose contributions  are well known through all parts of the State. We just do that because  we want to reemphasize it, because it is important.   Today we are going to recognize one of those people who is well known  in Alaska but whom we think is worthy certainly of the title of Alaskan  of the week because of all he has done. His name is Bill Sheffield. He  was our State's Governor in 1982, and he has spent his adult life  making Alaska a better place for all of us.   Governor Sheffield's story in Alaska embodies what many of us love  about our great State. It doesn't matter where you come from or your  social status, in Alaska, if you have grit, tenacity, determination,  and a servant's heart, nothing can hold you back.   Governor Sheffield was born in 1928 in Spokane, Washington. When the  Depression hit, his family had to grow and sell vegetables to survive.  It was during this time that he saw firsthand how President Roosevelt's  New Deal, passed by this body, helped people, including his father, who  was struggling. The idea that government was there to help people  stayed with him and turned him into a lifelong Democrat.   He joined the Air Force and, after his release, joined Sears, Roebuck  and Company. In 1952 he moved to the great State of Alaska to work for  the company as it expanded throughout the State. He repaired  televisions and appliances and took on sales roles, excelling both in  repairs and sales. He did this all while suffering from a serious,  difficult stutter, one he had carried with him throughout his  childhood. He said that when he was a child, he simply couldn't or  wouldn't talk. ``I had to point to pictures,'' he told one interviewer.  But his stutter lent him tremendous empathy, and it also steeled his  determination to work hard to overcome obstacles and succeed.    And succeed he did. He got into the hotel business, eventually owning  a chain of 19 hotels across Alaska, but he still wanted something more.  He wanted to give back to his community. So, in 1982, as a long-shot  politician, he ran for Governor. The long shot came in, and he won.   He always understood, and still does, that infrastructure is the key  to creating a path for economic growth in Alaska. We are a resource- rich but infrastructure-poor State. The policies that he undertook as  Governor and the projects that were built during his administration-- likely more infrastructure projects than any other Governor--still have  a huge impact on our State today.   Let me just mention a few of them.   The largest zinc and lead mine literally in the world, the Red Dog  mine in Northwest Alaska, was made possible by his hard work and that  of countless other Alaskans.   The Ketchikan Shipyard was built during the Sheffield administration.   An aggressive road and construction program was undertaken throughout  the State, particularly in the city of Anchorage.   The Bradley Lake hydro project near Homer was built during his  administration, along with several other hydro projects throughout  Southeast Alaska.   He traveled extensively throughout rural Alaska. He went to almost  every single village in our State. We have over 200 that are not  connected by roads, so that was hard to do. Almost every one was  visited by our Governor.   But his crowning achievement was the purchase of the Alaska Railroad.  When he first became Governor, the Federal Government had owned the  railroad and was threatening to shut it down, which would have been  devastating to our State. There were no private buyers, so Governor  Sheffield worked with the State legislature and the congressional  delegation to buy the railroad from the Federal Government. Then they  created a State-owned corporation designed to be operated like a  private business, and that railroad, the Alaska Railroad, still serves  as a critical transportation link for goods and people throughout  Alaska. Since his time in office, Governor Sheffield has continued his  ties to the railroad as CEO and chairman of the board.   He has also continued to serve in other public service capacities,  such as the port director in Anchorage, and he has contributed to  numerous causes and served on many charitable boards, like the Alaska  Community Foundation board, and has received countless awards and  recognition for his public service.   But what really makes Governor Sheffield so special to so many is  that he is just a kind, warm person. He is always lending a hand to  others. He is always there for many when he is needed. He does this  without regard for political affiliation. His house is always full of  Republicans, Democrats, and Libertarians. Last year, I was at a great  event at his house, where he honored the Coast Guard Foundation. Many  members, both current and past, from both sides of the political  aisle--including from this body--have eaten wonderful dinners in his  home, including my good friend Senator John McCain, who had dinner in  Governor Sheffield's house with Senator Hillary Clinton. That is  bipartisanship. When he opens his doors to his beautiful home, all are  welcome.   Governor Sheffield recently celebrated his 90th birthday with a party  in Anchorage. Unfortunately, I was not able to attend, but I heard it  was one for the ages. Hundreds of people showed up. People from all  walks of life and all political affiliations were there, all of them  sharing deep affection for one of our State's giants, a man with a huge  heart, who has made life better for countless Alaskans.   Governor Sheffield, from the Senate, happy 90th birthday. Thanks for  your great service to our great State and all you have done.  Congratulations on being our Alaskan of the Week.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.  [[Page S4940]]
