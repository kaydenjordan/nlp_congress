 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2169, the Improving Fusion  Centers' Access to Information Act of 2017.   Mr. Speaker, today we consider H.R. 2169, a bill that seeks to  authorize DHS' State, Local, and Regional Fusion Center Initiative. The  bill requires the Secretary of Homeland Security to carry out outreach  to identify gaps in information sharing.   This measure highlights the importance of equipping fusion centers so  that they can quickly adapt to the ever-evolving terrorist threat  landscape. Congress has given particular attention to fusion centers  and, in the 114th Congress, enacted measures to support fusion centers.   Fusion centers operate as State and major urban area focal points for  the receipt, analysis, gathering, and sharing of threat-related  information between Federal, local, and private sector partners.   I want to particularly highlight a provision of this bill focused on  improving the interagency collaboration by requiring the DHS Secretary  to consult with other Federal partners in order to develop new methods  to address such gaps.   DHS must continue to address and improve the Nation's fusion centers'  capabilities in gathering, analyzing, and sharing threat-related  information between partners on every level.                                time  1545    Mr. Speaker, in closing, I want to again express my support for this  bill and thank Mr. Katko for his efforts in bringing this bill forward.   We live in a time when the threats we face as a nation remain  complex, and this bill is an important tool to ensure our law  enforcement professionals have the resources and methods to prevent and  deter terror threats.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 2281, the Border  Enforcement Security Task Force Reauthorization Act of 2017.   Mr. Speaker, this bill, H.R. 2281, seeks to reauthorize the Border  Enforcement Security Task Force, or BEST, program within the Department  of Homeland Security.   U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement leads 42 BEST units across  16 States within the United States and Puerto Rico. Each unit is  comprised of members from ICE's Homeland Security Investigations, U.S.  Customs and Border Protection, as well as other Federal, State, and  local law enforcement agencies who investigate criminal activity along  the southwest and northern borders and at the Nation's major seaports.   These units play a critical role in advancing DHS' border security  efforts by ensuring all levels of domestic law enforcement are sharing  information and leveraging resources. BEST units have been instrumental  in coordinating joint operations with our law enforcement partners in  Mexico to thwart threats posed by transnational criminal organizations.   This legislation is in furtherance of my efforts as ranking member of  the Subcommittee on Boder and Maritime Security to bolster law  enforcement collaboration on cross-border threats and to ensure that  resources are used in a strategic manner to effectively mitigate such  threats, particularly in response to the drug cartels.   Those of us representing border districts are well aware that cartels  adapt quickly to exploit real or perceived weaknesses in our security.  As they shift their criminal operations to new locations along our land  borders, smuggle their contraband into the United States through our  ports of entry, or utilize maritime routes into this country, DHS must  be at the ready to quickly intercept and disrupt their operations.   This legislation seeks to ensure that DHS continues to use BEST units  to maximum effect. This bill instructs DHS, before standing up a BEST  unit, to consider the cross-border threats posed by transnational  criminal organizations, the Department's homeland and border security  strategic priorities, as well as the operations of DHS' joint task  forces and other multiagency efforts.   H.R. 2281 also updates existing reporting requirements so that  Congress has better information on how effectively BEST units are  reducing criminal activity, such as the traffic of drugs, weapons, and  people along our borders; enhancing information sharing among law  enforcement partners; coordinating with the Department's joint task  forces; and generally advancing the DHS homeland security and border  security strategic priorities.   I also want to thank my colleagues on the Border and Maritime  Security Subcommittee who have cosponsored this legislation, including  Subcommittee Chairwoman Martha McSally. I urge my colleagues to support  H.R. 2281.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2281, the Border Enforcement Security Task Force  Reauthorization Act of 2017, is a commonsense, bipartisan bill that  seeks to maximize the effectiveness of the successful border security  program and ensure that, going forward, the program continues to  contribute to making our Nation more safe and secure.   H.R. 2281 was approved by voice vote by the full committee on May 3  and enjoys broad, bipartisan support.   Before I yield back, I would like to thank Chairman McCaul and  Ranking Member Thompson, as well as Subcommittee Chairwoman McSally,  for their work on this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.
