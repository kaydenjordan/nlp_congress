 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2333 and  taking action to address the crisis of veteran suicide.   As we know too well, data from the Department of Veterans Affairs  indicates that 20 veterans die from suicide every day. I want to thank  Chairman Mark Takano, and Ranking Member Phil Roe for their  bipartisanship and their commitment to addressing this crisis and  bringing these bills to the floor today for a vote.    One area we have to get right is the work of VA's suicide prevention  coordinators. Suicide prevention coordinators are the face of the VA's  efforts to combat veteran suicide. They identify high-risk veterans and  ensure they receive appropriate care. They conduct outreach and promote  awareness and suicide prevention best practices within the VA.   However, many suicide prevention coordinators report being overworked  and unable to keep up with their many responsibilities. In an effort to  improve suicide prevention and mental health resources at the VA, I  introduced H.R. 2333, the Support for Suicide Prevention Coordinators  Act with my friends on the other side of the aisle, Congressman Banks,  and Congressman Bost.   Clear Path for Veterans, which is a veteran service organization in  my district doing incredible work to engage with and support veterans  after they return home from service described this bill very well.   They said:         In the last decade, a large number of bills and initiatives       have come out of Washington, D.C. aiming to combat veteran       suicide. While all great in concept, we have not seen a huge       change in suicide rates.        H.R. 2333 is a great way to measure what is effective, what       is not, and how the VA should pivot on what they are       currently doing to better meet the mental health needs of the       veterans they serve.    The Support for Suicide Prevention Coordinators Act would help ensure  prevention coordinators have the resources they need to effectively  provide veterans with critical mental health resources to prevent  future veteran suicides.   Specifically, this bill would require the Comptroller General of the  United States to conduct an assessment of the responsibilities,  workload, and vacancy rates of the Department of Veterans Affairs  suicide prevention coordinators and submit a report to Congress within  1 year.   It is critically important that we provide our suicide prevention  coordinators with the resources they need to successfully address the  veteran suicide epidemic, and I believe this bill is a good step toward  making sure that happens.   Again, I thank the committee for their bipartisan work. Taking care  of our veterans is the responsibility that belongs to each of us, and I  urge my colleagues to support this important legislation and all of the  veterans bills on the floor today.
