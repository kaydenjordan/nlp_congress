 Mr. President, my colleagues and I on the Agriculture  Committee will mark up the farm bill today. It is a landmark piece of  legislation that will benefit farmers and communities throughout our  country. I will have much more to say on the subject in the days and  weeks ahead, particularly when it arrives here on the floor.   I am particularly excited that the legislation being considered today  includes provisions from the Hemp Farming Act of 2018, of which the  occupant of the Chair is an original cosponsor and which I introduced  earlier this year. This provision will empower farmers in Kentucky and  other States to fully realize the potential of industrial hemp.   For now, I just want to thank Chairman Roberts for his leadership and  congratulate him and all of our colleagues on the committee for their  bipartisan collaboration and the impressive bill it has produced.                            ____________________     On another matter, Mr. President, last week, Secretary  of Defense Mattis met with our NATO allies in Brussels. He offered an  important reminder: ``Threats to our collective security have not  waned.'' In other words, it remains a challenging time to defend our  Nation, our interests, and our values.   Secretary Mattis has been consistent. Our new national defense  strategy makes this clear. Though we face a constant threat from  international terrorism, our Nation must also enhance our capabilities  for a renewed era of international competition among great powers.   He, along with our senior military commanders, have shared this  message with Congress time and again. They have detailed our  servicemembers' pressing needs and explained the importance of steady  resources in the face of evolving threats. We have heard them loud and  clear.   Earlier this year, our bipartisan spending agreement eliminated  harmful, arbitrary limits on defense spending and delivered the largest  year-on-year increase in funding for our military in 15 years. Now it  is time to build on this progress and pass our 58th annual Defense  authorization bill.   This year's NDAA is rightfully named for our friend and colleague  John McCain. It would authorize $716 billion to equip and train  America's 21st century forces to meet and overcome today's challenges.   As the Iranian regime continues its aggressive efforts to expand its  sphere of influence throughout the Middle East, this bill will empower  our forces to support our strategic partnerships in the region.   As China continues testing the boundaries of its power in the Pacific  region, the NDAA will extend the authority of the Indo-Pacific maritime  security initiative and extend the reach and readiness of naval and air  forces within the U.S. Pacific Command.   As Russia persists in its efforts to destabilize western democracies  and sow doubt within NATO, the bill before us would enhance  multilateral security  [[Page S3864]]  cooperation throughout the alliance and give U.S. Cyber Command the  resources to disrupt, deter, and defeat cyber aggression.   The legislation before us sends a clear message to our men and women  in uniform. It tells them that we have their backs. After years of  uncertain funding and arbitrary funding limits, we have their backs. In  the face of diverse and evolving threats, we have their backs.   When I vote, I will do it to tell the brave Kentuckians serving at  home and abroad that we have their backs. I hope that each of our  colleagues will do the same.   This bill was crafted in a thorough, bipartisan committee process and  was modified to include more than 40 amendments. I look forward to  concluding our consideration and passing this NDAA very soon.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on another matter, there has been no  shortage of recent reporting on the economic progress that is flooding  across our country. Take a New York Times headline from earlier this  month: ``We Ran Out of Words to Describe How Good the Jobs Numbers  Are.''   Let me say that again. This is from the New York Times: ``We Ran Out  of Words to Describe How Good the Jobs Numbers Are.''   This is from a Wall Street Journal editorial:         The U.S. economy is picking up speed, and it's paying       dividends in an expanding job market. . . . President Trump's       tax reform and deregulation agenda appears to be working.    And here is a welcome development for America's parents:         Workers age 25 to 34 made up 1.04 million of the 2.58       million jobs added over the last year. Job and wage growth       may finally be inducing young people to move out of their       parents' basements.    More jobs, more wage growth, more opportunities for middle-class  Americans--it is good news, plain and simple.   Well, apparently, it is not so simple for our friends across the  aisle. While Republicans and the rest of the country are cheering on  this new prosperity for working families, our Democratic friends are  trying to pretend that the facts don't matter and things aren't  actually getting better.   Here is how the leader of the House Democrats, the distinguished  Congresswoman from San Francisco, tried to sarcastically brush away the  facts a few days ago:         Hip, hip, hooray, unemployment is down! What does that mean       to me?    I couldn't make this up. ``Hip, hip, hooray,'' she scoffs.  Unemployment is at an 18-year low, the fewest Americans on unemployment  insurance since 1973, and Democratic leadership can't quite fathom why  this would matter for American families and small business owners. I  know plenty of families and job creators in Kentucky who would be happy  to explain.   Texas Roadhouse is a restaurant chain based in Louisville that  employs more than 2,500 Kentuckians. They shared recently that tax  reform will allow them to invest in their company, customers, and  employees. Plus, this economic climate has them planning to open 30-- 30--new locations across the country next year. Maybe the new cooks and  wait staff at 30 new restaurants could explain to the House Democratic  leader why a falling unemployment rate is a victory for American  families.   Just today, Glier's Meats in Covington, KY, is sharing similar good  news. Tax reform is enabling this small business, famous for its  German-inspired sausage, to make life better for its nearly 30  employees and plant deeper roots in Kenton County. Since the new law  passed in December, Glier's has been able to make capital investments,  including new machinery, which is critical to the daily operations of  the business. They have been able to resume offering comprehensive  health benefits, which it had to give up 6 years ago as costs soared  under ObamaCare. They have been able to significantly increase  employees' wages, and they are on track to hire five new workers in the  coming months.   Our Kentucky State treasurer, Allison Ball, had it just right. She  said in a recent column: ``Kentuckians have immediately benefited from  federal tax reform.''   These immediate benefits are only the beginning. More and more  stories like these are being written all the time as tax reform,  regulatory reform, and the rest of Republicans' opportunity agenda  continue helping American workers and job creators.   There are transformative new equipment purchases for Main Street  small businesses, pay raises for hard-working middle-class employees,  and new job openings all over the country so that new workers who are  just starting out have more opportunities, and midcareer professionals  who have been on the sidelines have the opportunity to clock back in.   Unlike leading Democrats, apparently, Republicans don't need it  explained to us why this news matters to workers and families. It is  exactly what we hoped to achieve. It is exactly the result that our  policies were meant to produce.   The distinction could not be more clear. On one side of the aisle are  those who mock multithousand-dollar tax reform bonuses as ``crumbs,''  who can't grasp why an 18-year low in employment would matter to  American families, and on the other side of the aisle are those of us  who have helped make it happen.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I understand there is a bill at the  desk that is due for a second reading.    In order to place the bill on the calendar under the  provisions of rule XIV, I object to further proceedings.    I suggest the absence of a quorum.
