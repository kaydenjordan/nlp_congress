 Mr. Speaker, the other side of the aisle is peddling a  false narrative. This bill is not loaded with pork. It is not a blue  State bailout.   It is a comprehensive plan to help people crushed by the virus beat  the pandemic into the ground and ensure a rapid economic recovery.   Yet my friends across the aisle and their cable news and social media  enablers continue to promote fake news.   Let's set the record straight. It is true that 9 percent--their  favorite talking point--9 percent, or $171 billion is for vaccines,  testing, and other healthcare infrastructure.   Well, what about the other 90 percent? $424 billion for $1,400  stimulus checks, $350 billion for struggling State and local  governments, $246 billion for unemployment insurance, $219 billion for  children and childcare so parents can return to work, $178 billion to  help reopen schools, $109 billion for farmers and small businesses, $28  billion for restaurants and live venues, $40 billion for renters and  homeowners who need assistance.   Let's pass this bill. Stop the phony-baloney talking points and get  the American people the relief they need.                                time  1300
