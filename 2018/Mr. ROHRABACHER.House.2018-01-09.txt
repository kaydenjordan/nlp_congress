 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Res. 676,  which puts America squarely on the side of courageous Iranians who risk  their lives in opposition to the corruption and oppression of the  mullah regime in Tehran.   Iran is a country made up of oppressed minorities. It is a country  made up of Kurds--there are more Kurds in Iran than there are in Iraq-- Balochis, Azerias, Arabs, and yes, anticlerical Persians. These people  have lived under a regime that terrorizes their population into  submission and supports terrorist attacks on other nations.   Unlike our last President, who closed his ears to the pleas of the  Iranian oppressed and brutalized people--and also, I might add,  facilitated the transfer of billions of dollars to that regime in the  name of an arms control agreement--that President is gone, and our new  President is making us proud today by endorsing the rights of those who  are struggling for freedom and putting our country and people squarely  on the side of those people who share our values in freedom and justice  throughout the world.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today to draw attention to the  American people to information that is being kept from them. So often  the good will and good-heartedness of the American people is  manipulated to achieve goals that sometimes are detrimental to our  people and detrimental to our country as well.   Today, the American people are being told that there are young people  who are here illegally, brought by their parents at an early age--they  call them DREAMers--and that we must be concerned about them, as we  are. Of course, we are concerned about them. Our sympathy is with young  people anywhere who want a better life.   But what the American people are not being told is that there are  850,000 of these young people. That is being left out of the  discussion. They are looking to be legalized. When they are legalized,  that means they can apply for family reunification, which means that  they then will receive government benefits and even more people will  come in under their platform.   I suggest that we take a look to see what 850,000 more young people  and the millions more who will come will do to the American people.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to participate in this  message to the Iranian people tonight and also a message that we will  deliver to the American people as well. To those brave souls who are  now in the streets to oppose the mullah dictatorship that now governs  Iran, we send you this message: We are with you. We are thinking of  you. You are within our vision. We are siding with you against tyranny.  Do not think you are alone. The American people, our hearts and our  souls, are with you; and, yes, we are proud of our President for making  sure the world knows that we are officially on the side of those people  who are struggling in the streets of Tehran, as we speak, to make sure  that the mullah dictatorship is overthrown and replaced by a democratic  government.   These people have a right to democratic government just the same as  anyone else. We talked about it in our Declaration of Independence. We  talked about rights that are given by God to every individual, and that  government only has those powers that are granted to it by the consent  of the governed.   Yes, we had our own revolution. Remember, the French helped us in  that revolution. The French helped us win our freedom. We owe that to  people who have helped us win our freedom to side with people who are  struggling in Iran today and against other radical Islamic  dictatorships today to help them create a more democratic society.   In fact, as I look around in this Hall tonight, I see that there are  only two pictures on the floor of the House. One is George Washington,  and one is Marquis de Lafayette. Look into Lafayette's eyes. This is a  picture of a man who came to us 50 years after our revolution and was  the ultimate American hero for helping us win our freedom. Are there  tears in his eyes tonight? No. But there were tears in his eyes in the  picture of Lafayette when we sided with the mullah regime during the  last administration when we actually cut a deal with the mullahs  keeping them in power, not giving any support to those who were  struggling for democracy in order to give them $1 billion to get them  to go along and sign up for a bogus arms treaty.   Now, this President of the United States today has left those  policies behind. We are proud of this President for what he is doing,  and we send this message to the American people: We will stand for  freedom, and we will be safe. If we cower and we don't support those  people struggling for freedom throughout the world, we will not be  safe.   Nowhere is that more evident than in the streets of Tehran tonight.   People of Iran, we are with you, just as the French were with us when  we won our freedom. We will make this a better world, we will make it a  safer world for all people who believe in any type of democratic, open  government.   The mullah regime must be overthrown but by its own people, and we  must be true to those patriots who established our own country by  supporting those who are struggling for freedom in Iran.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I  also want to thank Mr. Gohmert for the great courage that he has had on  this issue, the fact that he has been willing to speak up for something  that the establishment in this country is trying to shut us up about,  trying to put blinders on the American people about what is going on  and how we are losing our country.   I was there with Ronald Reagan, and, yes, he was sold a bill of goods  in 1986. He was told there were 3 million illegals in the country; and  that is what we are going to do, we are going to legalize their status.  He had a good heart, Reagan had a wonderful heart, and he saw these  people were being exploited and living in the shadows. Three million  people, you could take care of that, but the agreement has to be that  we are now going to control our borders.   Of course, back then, there was never even any question about whether  someone who is here illegally should be getting a government benefit or  be able to be treated just like a U.S. citizen, that wasn't even in the  works, but Ronald Reagan said: Okay. We will secure the border, and  then we will make sure that we take these 3 million people and save  them.   Instead, how did it end up? The border security was done not even  halfheartedly. We ended up, when all was said and done, with not 3  million people, but 11 million people who eventually came here based on  that amnesty program.   Well, today, it is a lot worse what we are facing. Today, the  American people are being told a lie. Maybe someone is not just lying  directly to them, but they are feeding them a false image of what the  issue is today.   How many people have heard about the DREAMers, these wonderful young  people, yes, who came here at an early age? The American people are not  being told what we are talking about when we talk about the DREAMers.  Most Americans think we are talking about 25,000 or 30,000 kids at the  most. That is what most Americans think we are talking about.   What we are talking about is 850,000 young people, who, yes, have  dreams, and most of them are fine young people, I am sure, but they are  here illegally, they have been brought here illegally by their parents,  and they want their status legalized.   What will that do? 850,000 young people, not 25,000, almost a million  young people, and all right, what will happen when they are legalized?  Well, what we are not being told is, as soon as they are legalized,  they then have the rights of everybody else, as anyone who is residing  here legally should, and, thus, they are eligible for family  reunification, and their families that are now being brought in from  other countries then have the right to bring in their families. So we  have a family reunification that creates a snowball effect and millions  and millions more.    Then, of course, we also have, with the legalization, the eligibility  for government benefits, which, as I say, during Reagan's time, there  wasn't any question you are not going to give benefits to illegal  immigrants. Well, now we find illegal immigrants receiving education  and healthcare benefits just as if they were American citizens.   In California, they have even treated criminals as if they are  citizens, setting up sanctuary cities and sanctuary States.   Let me note that, with free education and free healthcare, there is  no limit to the number of people around the world who will want to come  here. By the way, there is no securing the border as long as we are  giving education and  [[Page H77]]  healthcare benefits to people who have come here illegally.   In fact, what we are talking about now is basically opening up major,  major expenditures in our budget, that right now we can't afford even  to take care of our own people, yet we are going to have an obligation  not just for these 850,000 young people, but all of the people whom  they will bring in as well, not to mention the millions of other young  people throughout the world who will say: My gosh, if I could get  there.   And mothers and fathers throughout the world: We have got to get our  child there so they can get the education and healthcare that is being  provided to young people even when they come there illegally.   Now, let us note, for funds for our education system, our own young  people are suffering from a lack of funds for their education; we lack  money to have a very good healthcare plan for our people, yet the  millions of other people who have come here illegally, we are going to  let them drain that money and invite millions more people to come here  from overseas.   This is the most dishonest debate that we have had. That whole  concept of having millions and millions more coming in because of DACA,  the DREAMers? No, no. This is being kept out of the debate; this isn't  going to be part of America's vision of what is going on.   The idea that we now have veterans whom we cannot afford to take care  of, we have children of our own people whom we cannot afford to  educate, we have seniors whom we are trying to take care of, all of  these are expenses that we have, and we are already in the hole, yet we  are going to take care of millions of other people who have come here  illegally, starting with the DREAMers?   There are not just 10 million, by the way, 11 million people here  illegally. Let me be clear. We have got, I am guesstimating, 20  million, but I bet there are other people who are much more  sophisticated in their analysis than I am on this who say it is even  more than 20 million people who have come here illegally.   So what happens? We are draining our resources for people who have  come here illegally.   What does that mean? We don't care enough about our own people. That  is what we are really saying. Those people are more important than our  own people.   Then, of course, you have the fact that people are coming here, and,  yes, they are able-bodied, yet they still get education and healthcare,  but they get jobs, and, yes, they bid down the wages of people at the  lowest end of our spectrum.   I used to be an ice cream scooper at Marineland snack bar. That is  what I did when I was in high school. I scooped ice cream.   You know what, those jobs now, what we have got are people who have  gone into those jobs so that in order to get people to work for them,  they haven't had to increase the wages of the people at that level. And  if they have increased wages, they haven't increased the wages as much  as they would have had to had they not had groups of people there who  say: I will do that work at half the price.   Something else I was, I was a janitor in college. I was a janitor,  and I cleaned toilets. There is nothing wrong with anybody, whatever  work they have got. We know that we respect every working person in  this country.   Yes, I cleaned toilets, and guess what? I looked back a few years ago  and found that the salary, the wages, of people who clean toilets has  not gone up, the janitors are not making more money.   Now, why is that? Are we saying that people who work at lowly jobs  aren't worthy of having a pay raise, they shouldn't benefit? The income  of our Nation now is three or four times higher than it was, yet those  people in the lower scale have not been going up with that. The main  reason is those lowly jobs that they get, they have been bid down, the  salaries have been bid down by this massive flow of illegals.   Now, if we care about our people, we have to ask: What is America?  America is not one race, not one religion, not one ethnic group.  America is a country in which we believe in freedom and we have come  from every ethnic group and race in the world.   What makes us Americans, then, is that we have to care for each  other. We are an American family, but that being an American family  means we must take care of those people who are less fortunate in our  country before we spend and even borrow more money in order to take  care of the needs of people who have come here illegally.   Let us just note the worst part of this whole debate is that  Republicans and others who are concerned about this are being labeled  like we are anti-immigrant. Well, in fact, we know that immigration is  an important part of our country.                                time  1900    But this is the greatest lie of all because we believe that our  country has been prospered by having a legal immigration system. We, in  fact, take in a million legal immigrants a year. So anyone who is  thinking about this should think about it. That represents more legal  immigration into our country than all the other countries of the world  combined, allowing people to immigrate into their country, all the  other countries of the world.   Yet, because we don't want to destroy this system, we don't want it  to go out of control, we are being labeled as anti-immigrant, even  though we sing praises for those people who have come here legally.   In fact, the people who are the most anti-immigrant are the ones who  mix the title ``illegal'' and ``legal'' together. And what we have got  now is the worst possible outcome in that we have limited resources  being drained away from our own people of every race, religion, and  ethnic group, and jobs that are being bid down by illegals; and  everyone, including legal immigrants, are being hurt.   But what we have now is a recognition that we cannot even enforce the  law. We have sanctuary cities in which criminals are being kept from  being arrested by Federal agents.   What is that all about? Who do we care for?   Now we are saying our police can't even protect our families; and  that if there is some criminal gang from another country that comes  here, that we are going to have a sanctuary State or a sanctuary city  for these people.   This is absolutely ridiculous. It is a horror story, and it is up to  us to alert the American people that we are losing our country. We are  losing our country. And when I say ``our country,'' us, United States  is us, every race, every religion, every ethnic group.   Let us care for each other. Let anybody who is saying we care more  about someone who is coming here illegally from another country, I  don't care how old they are, their children, yes, are less important  than our children. Those people's well-being, yes, are less important  than the well-being of all Americans, whatever their status in this  society. We need to make sure we make that clear.   And DACA, if we bring in 850,000 young people and encourage millions  more to come in by doing that, we have betrayed the interests of our  own people, and they are looking to us to protect them.    Mr. Speaker, I believe that there are people who,  with sinister motives, are trying to destroy the United States of  America. They are  [[Page H78]]  there. There are people out there who hate us for what we stand for.  They have always hated America. We have been what stood between the  forces of evil on this planet for 200 years now.   If it wasn't for our guys--my mom and dad left North Dakota, these  small farms--out to fight in World War II, we saved the world from  Nazism and from Japanese militarism.   And then during the Cold War, we stood firm until communism--that  evil that wanted to create atheistic dictatorships throughout the  world, thinking that that is going to cleanse us from our profit  motive, the idea that we are going to change human nature but we are  going to establish dictators and dictatorships and murder millions and  millions of people, we defeated that evil. We held firm until it had a  chance to collapse on its own.   Now we face radical Islam, which is not a force, by the way, that--it  is a powerful force. There are Muslims who hate us. There are Muslims  who love us as well. But there are Muslims who hate us, who have lots  of money and lots of oil. We cut deals with them, so they have lots of  money and resources.   And what did they do?   They have financed terrorism to try to terrorize us into retreat.  They hate America. They hate America. These are forces. And there are  still forces in the world today that hate us, and that group is  applauding when we lose control of our borders.   And you know darn well the terrorists of this world have seen those  open borders to the South, and the terrorists are among us.   But we also have lost control of what you are talking about; that  loss of control will destroy our chance to have an economic activity  that succeeds in establishing a currency and a system in which  prosperity and a good life for ordinary people can exist.   No, it is going to go down unless we stop this massive flow. And the  massive flow is already gone, but it will become a flood of people if  we send the message: Kids who get here get free education, free  healthcare, legalized status, and they will bring their parents in.   We will have tens of millions of more people flooding our country. I  can't agree to that.    Mr. Speaker, establishing the rule of law here will  not only protect our own people, will not only make sure that our own  less fortunate people are bid into low-paying jobs so that people who  work as janitors, as I did, and as decent people are doing now, that  their wages aren't bid down; they can live a decent life so their  families can live with some security here. So by doing that, we will  also take away this major instability that we are creating throughout  the world by not obeying the rule of law.
