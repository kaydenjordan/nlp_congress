 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 3 minutes.   First, I want to thank Chairman Shuster and Ranking Member DeFazio  for working with me and Mr. Polis, listening to our concerns, and I  appreciate their assistance.   I rise today to offer an amendment we have been working on for almost  3 years, which is designed to improve helicopter fuel system safety for  newly manufactured helicopters.   As the chairman knows, on July 3, 2015, a Flight for Life air  ambulance helicopter took off in Frisco, Colorado. Just seconds later,  the helicopter crashed in a parking lot next to the helipad. After  impact, gasoline began to leak from the helicopter and a fire quickly  erupted trapping the crew. The crash itself was largely survivable, but  the post-crash fire contributed to the death of the pilot, Patrick  Mahany, and severely burned the two flight nurses--Dave Repsher and  Matthew Bowe. One of the flight nurses suffered burns on more than 90  percent of his body.   As we began learning what happened in Frisco, we discovered that a  1994  [[Page H3662]]  FAA rulemaking required all newly certified helicopter designs to  incorporate crash resistant fuel systems. The problem is that  helicopter designs are certified once and then can be manufactured for  years. So new helicopters, like the 1-year-old helicopter which crashed  in Frisco, Colorado, are being built to a now unsafe design from the  1970s.   Mr. Chairman, this is wrong. Since that 1994 rulemaking, there have  been more than 175 post-crash fires and at least 80 deaths. We can do  better, and we must do better.   Since 2015, the FAA has finally started to address the issue. They  convened the Rotorcraft Occupant Protection Working Group and tasked  them with determining what requirements to place on newly manufactured  helicopters moving forward. That working group submitted their final  report last month and made evidence-based recommendations about what  safety features should be required.   My amendment today implements those recommendations of the working  group by requiring all newly manufactured helicopters to be built with  safer fuel systems within 18 months. We have known about this problem  for decades, and it is past time we close the loophole from 1994 and  improve the safety of these helicopters.   Two people deserve special thanks: Patrick Mahany's wife, Karen, for  her tireless advocacy for safer helicopters; and Chris Vanderveen, from  KUSA-Channel 9, for his diligent reporting about the dangers of these  fragile and outdated fuel systems.   I would also like to thank Air Methods, the Air Medical Operators  Association, the General Aviation Manufacturers Association, and  Helicopter Association International for working with me and my staff.   Mr. Chairman, I include in the Record letters of support from Air  Methods, Helicopter Association International, and Air Medical  Operators Association.                                                    Air Methods,                              Greenwood Village, CO, April 24, 2018.      Hon. Ed Perlmutter,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative Perlmutter: As the House of       Representatives prepares to consider HR. 4, the Federal       Aviation Administration (FAA) Reauthorization Act of 2018, on       behalf of Air Methods, I want to thank you for your       dedication and attention to aviation safety, and in       particular your tireless efforts to make helicopter fuel       systems safer by equipping them with crash resistant fuel       systems (CRFS).        At Air Methods, safety is our top priority. We have worked       continuously to strengthen our practices, instill a culture       of safety throughout our organization, and contribute to       industry-wide advances in aviation safety. As part of Air       Methods' dedication to the safety of its crews and patients,       we have committed to retrofitting our Airbus H125 and H130       (formally known as EC130) fleet with the updated CRFS.        As you may know, in 2015 we partnered with Vector Aerospace       to conduct CRFS testing and seek certification for a crash       resistant fuel system for all Airbus single-engine       helicopters we operate. The first H125 with the new system       arrived at Air Methods' headquarters in Denver, CO on Dec.       30, 2017, following the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)       supplemental type certificate approval. To date, Air Methods       has received and completed the installation of 14 CRFS in our       fleet. The Company intends to roll out an entire fleet of       retrofitted Airbus H125 and H130 over the next two years.        We believe the CRFS program is critical to the air medical       transportation industry and have been advocating for and       supporting CRFS for several years. We look forward to       continuing to work together with you and other legislators to       support efforts to improve industry-wide safety standards in       aviation safety and ensure the safety of those who fly with       us.        Thank you for your leadership and willingness to engage Air       Methods while working toward ensuring safety for our patients       and crews. We look forward to working alongside you and your       office to promote aviation safety.            Sincerely,                                                 Mr. Aaron Todd,                                            Chief Executive Officer,      Air Methods Corporation.                                   ____            HAI Statement on Representative Perlmutter's Amendment         Washington, DC, April 25, 2018.--Helicopter Association       International (HAI) commends Rep.

Hon. Ed Perlmutter,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Congressman Perlmutter: On behalf of the Air Medical       Operators Association (AMOA), I am writing today to express       our support for your proposed amendment on ``Helicopter Fuel       System Safety''. This amendment would codify the       recommendations of the FAA's Rotorcraft Occupant Protection       Working Group on Crash Resistant Fuel Systems (CRFS).        Since its founding in 2009, AMOA and its member companies       have committed to an ongoing series of safety enhancements       and investments. Our efforts include actions to comply with       the FAA's Helicopter Air Ambulance rule, such as installing       Helicopter Terrain Awareness and Warning Systems (HTAWS) and       Flight Data Monitoring Systems (FDMS), and establishing       Operations Control Centers (OCC). AMOA member companies have       also gone above and beyond regulatory requirements by       undertaking voluntary safety initiatives, including the use       of Night Vision Goggles (NVGs).        In November, 2015, AMOA announced a commitment to the       installation of CRFS in all new aircraft and equipping       current aircraft with CRFS as those products become       available. We also supported the inclusion of Section 2105 of       the ``FAA Extension, Safety, and Security Act of 2016'',       which directed the FAA to ``evaluate and update, as       necessary, standards for crash-resistant fuel systems for       civilian rotorcraft''.        We are pleased to support your amendment as another       positive step in the continuous effort to improve the safety       of the life-saving transportation provided by AMOA's member       companies. AMOA urges the House to adopt your amendment.        Thank you for your work on this very important issue.            Sincerely,                                                    Sally Veith,                                                 Executive Director,                                 Air Medical Operators Association.    Mr. Chairman, I would like to thank Chairman Shuster and Ranking  Member DeFazio for their help through this process.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may consume to  another gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Polis).    Mr. Chairman, I have no other speakers on this. I  would ask for an ``aye'' vote on amendment No. 49, and I yield back the  balance of my time
