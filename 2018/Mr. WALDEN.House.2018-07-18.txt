 Mr. Chair, I move that the Committee do now rise.   The motion was agreed to.   Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr.  Weber of Texas) having assumed the chair, Mr. Hultgren, Acting Chair of  the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported  that that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R.  6147) making appropriations for the Department of the Interior,  environment, and related agencies for the fiscal year ending September  30, 2019, and for other purposes, had come to no resolution thereon.                            ____________________
