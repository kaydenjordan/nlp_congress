 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a pillar of  our community who has had a profound influence on the lives of so many  students in our community in Bucks County and beyond.   Lou Volpe, who dedicated 44 years of service to the students of Harry  S. Truman High School in my hometown of Levittown, retired in 2013 as  its longtime theater director.   Recently, Lou was inducted into the Bucks County Playhouse Hall of  Fame, an event I was honored to attend, joining the likes of Oscar  Hammerstein and Angela Lansbury, among others.   Throughout his esteemed career, Lou has left an indelible mark on the  thousands of students he taught. Under his leadership, Truman regularly  participated in the Student Theater Festival at the Bucks County  Playhouse.   A pinnacle of his career included a coveted invitation to the  Thespian Festival at the University of Nebraska for his production of  ``Good Boys and True.''   Mr. Speaker, fortunately for us, Lou's legacy will live on with the  new NBC TV series ``Rise,'' of which his tenure at Truman served as an  inspiration.   It is comforting to know that this theatrical brilliance of Lou's  will live on in our community and in our Nation for decades, and I ask  all of my colleagues in this House of Representatives, Democrat and  Republican, to honor Lou for his incredible service to our community  and to our country.                            ____________________
