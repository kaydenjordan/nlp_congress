 Mr. Speaker, I serve on the House Judiciary  Committee and serve as the ranking member on the Crime, Terrorism,  Homeland Security, and Investigations Subcommittee, which means that I  deal with every single Federal law enforcement entity across the  Nation.   I am disappointed and I am outraged by the language from the  Commander in Chief to suggest that the FBI is in tatters. We have  agreements and disagreements with the chief law enforcement agency, but  these men and women protecting us in this Nation, but also against  domestic terrorism and even beyond, are called around the Nation to  investigate heinous crimes. Their expertise is respected.   I remember when there was a child molester in my community. I worked  with local police, but I insisted that the FBI get involved. They were  willing to do so even though it was not a matter across State lines.  Their very presence made a difference.   I think we owe them a better response, and I certainly think the  Commander in Chief has a responsibility to do a better job.   I also believe that we have got to pass CHIP because thousands of  children need healthcare. It is important for us to do our job.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I am opposed to the House agreeing to  conference with the Senate on their cruel and immoral $1.7 trillion tax  giveaways to wealthy corporations and the top one percent, but as a  member of the Budget Committee, I rise in strong support of the  Democratic Motion to Instruct Conferees appointed by the House to  conference with the Senate on H.R. 1, the so-called ``Tax Cut and Jobs  Act,'' which more accurately should be called the ``Republican Tax Scam  Act.''   The Motion to Instruct does two things: first, it directs House  conferees to disagree with Section 11081 of the Senate amendment which  would eliminate the Affordable Care Act's individual mandate by  instructing conferees.   Second, the Motion to Instruct would also oppose eliminating the  current tax deduction for state and local property, income, and sales  taxes by instructing house conferees to recede from Section 1303 of the  House bill.   Instead, we should junk this shameful legislation and start over in a  bipartisan manner that provides relief to working and middle class  families, does not increase the deficit, and ensures that the  government has the resources needed to make the investments required to  keep our country strong, safe, healthy, and economically competitive.   H.R. 1, on the other hand, raises taxes on poor, working, and middle  class families; explodes the deficit by adding an additional $2.2  trillion over ten years; and will require an estimated $5.4 trillion  cut in funding for the programs ordinary Americans depend on for health  security, educational opportunity, and economic progress.   Mr. Speaker, in the last several months we have witnessed and borne  the brunt of several of the most powerful storms ever recorded,  including Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria.   I remember so well that the President visited Texas and promised the  people affected by Hurricane Harvey of his unwavering commitment to  provide everything needed to recover.   We need that promise kept now, and approval of this reckless and  immoral tax plan will make it virtually impossible to keep the promise.   Residents of Texas who are facing the long road to recovery need at  least $61 billion for home flood mitigation, repair, replacement, and  home buyouts.   There are other states with pressing needs related to disaster  recovery.   My colleagues across the aisle and the President should understand  that the Texas and Florida congressional delegations are in full  agreement regarding the need to meet the disaster recovery needs of the  states and territories.   There are particular concerns for our seniors who survived the  terrible storms that ravaged the Texas Coast, Florida, U.S. Virgin  Islands and Puerto Rico because so many of them are alone, while trying  to do the difficult and hard job of cleaning out their homes, or  removing debris from their yards.   That work is nowhere near done in my State of Texas.   Thousands of families have no home because of the storm, and many  more thousands are living in gutted out shells of structures they once  called home and too many others are sleeping in cars.   Houston's response to the immediate disaster was impressive and all- encompassing for the size and complexity of the disaster caused by  unprecedented flooding due to Hurricane Harvey.   The efforts of Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner and the work of the  Public Works Department, Police, and First Responders, as well as  Federal and State agencies that were joined by citizen volunteers  helped save thousands of lives.   We have communities in Texas that are struggling to find the new  normal that FEMA officials warned Texans would need to accept following  the historic flood.   The effort is being made difficult by a lack of appreciation by the  Administration of the true cost of recovery for Texas, Florida, the  U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico.   FEMA has proven that it is excellent at disaster response, but is  showing that they are not very good at recovery management for  individuals and families.   The Administration risks a shutdown over not adequately meeting the  needs of hurricane impacted areas.  [[Page H9612]]    Mr. Speaker, Americans are not fooled; they know trickle-down  economics has never worked, and they see right through this phony tax  plan and recognize it for the scam that it is.   That is why Americans reject this Republican tax giveaway by an  overwhelming 2:1 margin according to a poll released recently by  Quinnipiac.   Specifically, 61 percent think the Republican tax scam will benefit  the wealthy the most; only 16 percent say the plan will reduce their  taxes.   59 percent think it a very bad idea to eliminate the deduction for  state and local income taxes.   Nearly half of respondents (49 percent) think it a bad idea to lower  the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 20 percent.   This Republican tax plan is even more toxic to my constituents in the  Eighteenth Congressional District of Texas.   Mr. Speaker, as you may know, my constituents and others in Texas are  still struggling to recover from the devastation caused by Hurricane  Harvey, the worst storm ever to make landfall in the continental United  States.   My constituents understand that it is important that the United  States has a tax system that is fair, balanced, smart, and provides the  resources and opportunities to allow all Americans to reach their  potential.   And by margins exceeding 90 percent, they reject:   1. Any cuts to Medicare or Medicaid to finance tax cuts for wealthy  corporations and the top 1 percent;   2. Eliminating the mortgage interest deduction;   3. Eliminating the deductibility of state and local taxes;   4. Eliminating existing deductions for student loan interest or  making taxable college endowment funds or college fellowships expenses.   Mr. Speaker, the average annual tax cut for the top one-tenth of one  percent is $320,000; for the top one percent it is $62,000, and for  those earning $1 million a year it is $68,000.   Nearly 25 percent of the tax cut goes to households in just the top  one-tenth of one percent, who make at least $5 million a year (2027).   While super-wealthy corporations and individuals are reaping  windfalls, millions of middle-class and working families will see their  taxes go up:   1. 13 million households face a tax increase next year.   2. 45 million households face a tax increase in 2027.   3. 29 million households (21 percent) earning less than $100,000 a  year see a tax increase.   On average, families earning up to $86,000 annually would see a $794  increase in their tax liability, a significant burden on families  struggling to afford child care and balance their checkbook.   It is shocking, but not surprising, that under this Republican tax  scam, the total value of tax cuts for just the top one percent is more  than the entire tax cut for the lower 95 percent of earners.   Put another way, those earning more than $912,000 a year will get  more in tax cuts than 180 million households combined.   The core of this Republican tax scheme is a massive tax cut from 35  percent to 20 percent for corporations, but that is not the only way  that the wealthy are rewarded.   The massive tax cuts for corporations are permanent but temporary for  working and middle-class families.   Another immoral aspect of this terrible tax scam is that it abandons  families that face natural disasters or high medical costs by repealing  deductions for casualty losses and medical expenses.   Mr. Speaker, in what universe does it make any sense to eliminate, as  this bill would, a deduction for:   1. teachers who purchase supplies for their classroom;   2. moving expenses to take a new job and taxes employer-provided  moving expenses; or   3. dependent care assistance, making it harder for families to afford  day care, nursery school, or care for aging parents?   This Republican tax scam jeopardizes American innovation and  competitiveness by eliminating the deduction for student loan interest,  which affects 12 million borrowers, and cuts total education assistance  by more than $64 billion.   Under the extraordinary leadership of President Obama and the  determined efforts of ordinary Americans, we pulled our way out from  under the worst of the foreclosure crisis when the housing bubble burst  in 2007.   Inexplicably, Republicans are now championing a tax scheme that will  make the homes of average Americans less valuable because deductions  for mortgage interest and property taxes are much less valuable than  under current law.   A tax plan that reduces home values, as this one does, puts pressure  on states and towns to collect revenues they depend on to fund schools,  roads, and vital public resources.   Mr. Speaker, the $5.4 trillion cuts in program investments that will  be required to pay for this tax giveaway to wealthy corporations and  individuals will fall most heavily on low-income families, students  struggling to afford college, seniors, and persons with disabilities.   This tax scam is not a revenue policy adapted for the real world that  real Americans live in but a fantasy resting on the monstrous belief  that the wealthy have too little money and that poor, working, and  middle-class families have too much.   Congressional Republicans continue to cling to the fantasy belief  that their tax cuts for the rich will pay for themselves despite all  precedent to the contrary and evidence that their tax scheme is  projected by experts to lose between $3 trillion and $7 trillion.   Mr. Speaker, in evaluating the merits of a taxing system, it is not  enough to subject it only to the test of fiscal responsibility.   To keep faith with the nation's past, to be fair to the nation's  present, and to safeguard the nation's future, the plan must also pass  a ``moral test.''   The Republican tax bill fails both of these standards.   That is why I support the Democratic Motion to Instruct Conferees,  even though I strongly oppose the Motion to Go to Conference on H.R. 1,  the ``Republican Tax Scam Act.''
