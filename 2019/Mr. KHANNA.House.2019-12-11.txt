 Madam Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to this  defense authorization.   There are many things that you can call the bill, but it is Orwellian  to call it progressive. Let's speak in facts.   When President Obama left, the defense budget was $618 billion. This  defense budget is $120 billion more than what President Obama left us  with. That could fund free public college for every American. It could  fund access to high-speed, affordable internet for every American.   But it is worse: the bipartisan provision to stop the war in Yemen,  stripped by the White House; the bipartisan amendment to stop the war  in Iran, stripped by the White House; the bipartisan provision to  repeal the 2002 George W. Bush authorization for the war in Iraq which  is sending our troops overseas, stripped by the White House.   At some time, we can't just rhetorically give standing ovations when  the President says that we are going to end endless wars and continue  to vote to fund them.   It wasn't just President George W. Bush who committed the biggest  blunder of foreign policy in the 21st century by sending us to Iraq. It  was the abdication of this body, with many Members of Congress who  voted right with him.   My question is: When are we going to listen to the American people?  When are we going to do our Article I duty and stop funding these  endless wars and start funding our domestic priorities?                                time  1630
