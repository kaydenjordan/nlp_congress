 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the men and women of  law enforcement who put their lives on the line day and night  protecting our communities, like my nephew Ethan Meehan.   As we close this year's Police Week, I would like to pay particular  tribute to the law enforcement personnel who have been killed or  wounded in the line of duty, like Officer Christopher Dorman of  Folcroft, Delaware County, Pennsylvania, who was shot and wounded last  June but bravely back on the job just weeks later.   Sadly, four of Pennsylvania's finest lost their lives in the line of  duty last year:   Pennsylvania State Trooper Eugene Weaver;   Canonsburg Patrolman Scott Bashioum;   Pennsylvania Corrections Officer David Weaver; and   Luzerne County Corrections Officer Kristopher Moules.   We thank them for their service, and we are indebted for their  sacrifice. We honor their memories, and our thoughts and prayers are  with their families.                            ____________________
