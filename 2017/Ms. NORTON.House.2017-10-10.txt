 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the remarks of my good friend from  Pennsylvania, and I, too, rise in support of S. 1617, a bill to  designate the checkpoint of the United States Border Patrol located on  United States Highway 77 North in Sarita, Texas, as the Javier Vega,  Jr. Border Patrol Checkpoint.   Javier Vega, Jr., was killed in the line of duty on August 3, 2014,  while trying to stop a criminal act and trying to protect his family in  Raymondville, Texas. While fishing with his wife, with his children,  and with his parents, two men approached him and tried to rob his  family.   Agent Vega attempted to stop the robbery by drawing his gun, and we  know that Border Patrol agents may carry their guns when they are off  duty because they are law enforcement officials. He was shot in the  chest. Agent Vega was rushed to the hospital after he was shot but died  soon thereafter.   It was determined that Agent Vega was aware of a pattern of robberies  in the area due to his role as a Border Patrol agent and that he  identified himself as an agent before he was fatally shot. The U.S.  Border Patrol considered those facts and later determined that Javier  Vega, Jr., was murdered in the line of duty, ensuring that Agent Vega's  name was enshrined at the Customs and Border Protection Valor Memorial.   Agent Vega was a U.S. Marine veteran and had served with the United  States Border Patrol for 6 years before his untimely death. He served  his country with honor and distinction.   Mr. Speaker, I strongly support this legislation honoring the life  and death of Javier Vega, Jr., by naming this checkpoint after him. I  urge my colleagues to pass S. 1617, and I yield back the balance of my  time.
