 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.                                  Healthcare     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.                                  Healthcare     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.                                  Healthcare     Mr. President, first of all, I rise with a sigh of  relief that the decision has been made not to go forward with a vote on  a very divisive healthcare bill.   More importantly today, I rise to say this is really an opportunity  for us to work together to get something done--something very  positive--as it relates to healthcare costs and healthcare coverage for  the people whom we all represent in our States and the people across  the country. I am hopeful we will see action soon, and I am hopeful it  will be this week when we can come together around very good work that  is being done in the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee  with our two great leaders--Senator Alexander and Senator Murray.   They have been holding a number of committee meetings and forums, and  I am very pleased to have participated in those. We have had great  bipartisan participation in focusing on how to stabilize the current  insurance marketplace. We know that has to be step one  [[Page S6123]]  if we are going to bring down rates, bring down costs, and create a  path forward so more insurance companies are participating in the  current system. I have great confidence that we can come together and  get that done. It needs to get done immediately because decisions are  being made about rates this week, and I am hopeful we can take action  on that this week.   Mr. President, we have two other things that are very important--open  dates that are looming by the end of the week. One is for the  Children's Health Insurance Program, which covers 9 million American  children across the country. In Michigan, we call it MIChild. We have  children today who can go to the doctor and parents who can take their  children to the doctor because of the MIChild Program. The Federal  funding for that ends on September 30, this weekend, if we do not take  action.   This is another piece of good news because the distinguished chairman  of the Finance Committee, Senator Hatch; the distinguished ranking  member, Senator Wyden; others; and I have introduced a bipartisan bill  that will extend that program for an additional 5 years. It needs to  get done this week. It is a bipartisan effort, and I am hopeful that  can get done as well.   We have community health centers in our country--our federally  qualified community health centers--whose funding runs out, again, this  weekend. Funding health centers has strong bipartisan support. Senator  Roy Blunt and I, along with a total of 70 out of 100 Members of the  Senate, have joined in a letter to continue the funding for health  centers. That needs to get done right away. In addition to that, there  are what we call certain health extenders or policies that are  bipartisan that can be done together as well.   We see a picture of important efforts of stabilizing the insurance  markets to bring down costs, creating more opportunity for competition  in the marketplaces, continuing the Children's Health Insurance  Program, continuing the funding for health centers, which are so  critical in communities in every one of our States, where people are  getting the care they need at their local health centers.   Bringing those things together can be done. Now, it is a lot of work  to do that in a couple of days, but these are bipartisan efforts that  can be done together to show that in fact we can come together and get  things done. I know the people in Michigan want us to do that. They  want us to work together to get things done. They want us to focus on  lowering costs for healthcare and increasing coverage, and they are  anxious to see that we can come together to do that.   I am hopeful. It is only Tuesday, and I am hopeful, with the  remaining days of the week, given the bipartisanship that is there and  the agreements that have been made on legislation already, that we  could go into high gear in the next few days and come together and have  a positive story, a good news story to tell at the end of this week  about what we are able to do, working together, to be able to fix  problems in the healthcare system and to be able to continue very  important programs that provide healthcare for children and for  families in local communities around the country.   Thank you.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.   The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
