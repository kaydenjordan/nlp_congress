 Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr.  Hill), my neighbor.                           Week of Prayer for China     Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Arkansas for his  comments and for his tireless commitment to pointing out the atrocities  in China; our needs and interests in making sure that we stand with the  people of Taiwan and stand strong in the globe and stand up as a strong  country.   I would note, as we sit here today, that we had a number of issues  that are of paramount importance to the American people. One of which,  of course, being from the State of Texas, is the state of our border.   Today, official numbers came out from Border Patrol that there were  234,088 encounters in April. Of those, some 96,908 were turned away  under so-called title 42 of our health code. But what that means is  that at least 137,180 were released into the United States, and perhaps  more.  [[Page H5093]]    Madam Speaker, 1,300 pounds of fentanyl, intercepted. Of course,  today, Alejandro Mayorkas, the Secretary of Homeland Security, is down  at the Rio Grande Valley doing photo ops. Going down to the Valley so  he can try to hide what he said to me and what he said to Republicans  in the House Committee on the Judiciary who were questioning him just  two weeks ago.   We said: Do you have operational control of the border?   And he said, Yes, I do.   Well, I wonder if my friend from Pennsylvania could help explain to  the American people how 234,000 apprehensions, of which almost 130,000  are being turned into the United States, how that is somehow  operational control.   The gentleman was an officer in the United States military. Does that  sound like operational control?   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr.  Perry).    Well, as the gentleman knows, as we sit here in the people's  House, I just got an update from the border showing the Border Patrol  is building a new soft-sided tent compound in Eagle Pass, Texas.   Another picture of it shows a big tent with chain-link fences up-- remember the kids in cages?--chain-link fences up. And it says it is  roughly 215,000 square feet, which is almost five acres.   So to the gentleman's point, why would they be doing that? Why would  Secretary Mayorkas be ordering Border Patrol to build a five-acre tent  facility in Eagle Pass, Texas?    I know exactly why. Could it be because they believe their  mission is to process more aliens coming to the United States? That it  would encourage more to come; have them come across the river--never  mind being exploited by the cartels--then get put into this facility to  be processed and released.    Madam Speaker, the gentleman knows that we are feeling that  impact in Texas.   He just mentioned fentanyl. We just got the new data from the CDC:  117,000 dead Americans.   Yet, nothing but crickets coming from our colleagues on the other  side of the aisle. They don't care. They don't care about 117,000 dead  Americans, directly as a consequence of Chinese-produced fentanyl  pouring in through cartels, through Mexico, into the United States.  Nothing. Crickets.   Have you seen a bill on the floor of this body to deal with that?   Have you seen any efforts by our friends on the other side of the  aisle to secure the border of the United States legitimately or force  the hand of Secretary Mayorkas to actually enforce the policies of the  United States?   Madam Speaker, very specifically, we have a discharge petition at the  desk with the signature of every Republican but not one Democrat  willing to go to the Democrats leading the administration and say, We  need to secure the border of the United States and enforce the  policies, including title 42 and whatever it takes to secure the  border.   Is the gentleman aware of that?    Madam Speaker, I would ask the gentleman a question. We are  talking about the extent to which the American people are hurting. He  talked about the baby formula. We are talking about the border--wide  open borders, fentanyl pouring in, American people dying. What about  the fact that gasoline prices are skyrocketing, energy prices are going  up?   We know we are producing 55 million fewer barrels of oil in February  of 2022 than we did in February of 2020. The United States is expected  to revert to being a net oil importer in 2022 after we had become a net  oil exporter.   In the March 2020 debate, President Biden said no more drilling on  Federal lands. No more drilling, including offshore; no ability for the  oil industry to continue to drill, period.   Yet, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, they don't want to  talk about that because they know full well it is precisely the  policies of the administration to purposely limit the ability to  produce oil and gas in this country that is empowering Putin to go  after Ukraine and that is damaging the price of gas at the pump and  harming the American people.   Our Democrat colleagues sit silent because they worship at the altar  of the green agenda. Because that is their agenda, not the benefit of  the American people, not the ability to drive your car, go to work,  take care of your  [[Page H5094]]  family, afford gas, afford the goods and services that are going up  because the diesel prices are going up, the inflation is skyrocketing.  Because they refuse to open up American oil and gas, which we sit on a  bevy of.   It is enormously important for our national security and the national  security of our friends around the world. I know the gentleman, being  from Pennsylvania, is well aware of the absurd energy policies that are  harming the American people because they worship at the altar of the  Green New Deal and the green agenda.    Absolutely. It is this green agenda that has us bowing down  to China in order to get the minerals and resources in order to make  solar panels and wind farms. If you look at Texas that produces as much  wind as any State in the country, Texas only had 17 percent wind  production from its wind farms last week, which was a big chunk of the  problem that we had in terms of energy production.   Our grid is over-reliant on wind and solar. When you have a windless  cloudy day, what do you need? You need fossil fuels. What else do you  need? Nuclear power. Do you know how much nuclear power or fossil fuel  generation we have in the pipeline, so to speak, right now across this  country or even in Texas? Minuscule. Because of the worshipping at this  ridiculous agenda.   Do you know how many coal-fired plants they have in China? Something  like 1,100.    And opening one a week.   Do you know how many coal-fired plants we are opening in this  country? Zippo.   Do you know what kind of rules we have coming out right now to hammer  the coal industry in Texas and elsewhere? Massive rules.   Do you know what that means for the American people? No energy, lower  energy, higher costs. That is 100 percent true and provable.   Yet, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle walk around in some  daze saying, oh, we are going to get this magic unicorn energy from  wind and solar on a windless, cloudy day. It is absolutely absurd.   The American people are suffering. The American people are suffering  because of the Democratic policies that are causing harm to them,  driving up prices, making it impossible for them to have a reliable  grid, reliable energy. We are sitting on a mountain of it in this  country. We are exporting liquified natural gas from this country.  CO2 is going down. We are not relying on China. We are  sticking it back on them, and our people are benefiting and prospering.   The Democrat agenda is: stop that. Go beg China. And then pay more  for your goods and services. Then what does Joe Biden say? What does  Jen Psaki say in all of her infinite wisdom heading off to MSNBC after  she accuses our Border Patrol agents of whipping people? She says:  ``Oh, buy a Tesla.'' Go spend $60,000 and go buy an electric car.   Do you know what? If you are in Austin, Texas, and you want to drive  to Midland, I guess you have to stop somewhere in the middle and hope  you can charge.    Yes.    You know what I have here in front of me? I have a  photograph that a friend--I think he is one of the six people watching  on C-SPAN right now--just texted me and said, Here is a picture of  gasoline at the pump. Diesel I should say, not gasoline. Diesel, 194  gallons. Do you know what the bill was? $1,090.   You want to know what is coming, American people, this summer? Have  you looked at the inventory numbers for diesel? Ladies and gentlemen,  it is coming. All of those goods and services sitting in trucks, trucks  that are having to pay $1,090 to fill their tank, that is getting  passed on to you. You are going to pay for that. You, the American  people, are going to pay for that while Democrats in this body, in the  Senate, and in this administration wave it off, laugh it off, and say:  ``Go buy a Tesla.''   Well, that isn't going to make your prices any cheaper. That isn't  going to enable you to be able to afford the goods and services you  need.   I know we have only got a few minutes left, so I want to ask one more  thing of my friend from Pennsylvania. We are talking here about energy,  and we know how much energy is at the central debate about what is  going on between Russia and Ukraine. And we know the administration  didn't do a darn thing leading up to what is happening in Ukraine to  cut off Nord Stream 2 to open up American oil and gas to try to cut off  what we knew was coming and what Putin was doing.   Yet, last week we had a vote on the floor of this body on a $40  billion unpaid for blank check in the name of standing with Ukraine.  Only 57 Members of this body out of 435 possible Members--however many  are here right now--57 dared to say, Hey, wait a minute, maybe we  should actually debate $40 billion that is not paid for that is going  to go into the State Department, go into the Department of Defense,  going around the world, paying  [[Page H5095]]  for refugee resettlement, paying for food around the world, paying for  continued support of military operations in Ukraine.   I know the gentleman supports Ukraine and Zelenskyy, and I know the  gentleman opposes Putin, but did you have a problem with a $40 billion  blank check?    I agree with the gentleman. I support Ukrainians, but I  represent Americans, and Americans want to stand alongside Zelenskyy  and push back on Putin, but they want us to do our job responsibly.   When I hear the majority leader of the other party say, ``a time of  war.'' When I sat with the majority leader in a Rules Committee meeting  upstairs, and he said: ``We are at war,'' I was wondering when we voted  to go to war. If we are going to have a proxy war, and we are going to  give $40 billion to Ukraine because we want to look all fancy with our  blue and yellow ribbons and feel good about ourselves, maybe we should  actually have a debate in this Chamber, a debate in this body because  the American people expect us to do that.   When the border of this country is wide open, and cartels have  control of it, and fentanyl is pouring in, and we have $30.5 trillion  in debt, and gas prices are spiking, and it cost $1,100 to fill a tank  of diesel, and we go, Oh, blank check, $40 billion. By the way, I am  looking at my colleagues on this side of the aisle on that same point.   The American people deserve and expect better than that. I yield to  the gentleman from Pennsylvania.    Heaven forbid we vote on bills put before this body.    I know the gentleman is correct. I know we are just about  out of time.   I would just say in closing, the American people expect us to do our  job. The American people expect us to vote, the American people expect  us to stand up for them, and that is what we are happy to be here  doing. I appreciate the gentleman joining me tonight.    Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
