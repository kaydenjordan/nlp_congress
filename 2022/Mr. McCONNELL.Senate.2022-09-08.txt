 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, first this morning, the Senate and the  American people are watching the news regarding our friends in the  United Kingdom and the health of their beloved Queen Elizabeth.   The Queen is an exemplar of steady leadership and a beloved figure  around the world. She has been a historic friend of the United States.  The decades of her reign have seen a profound deepening of the special  relationship between our two countries that has literally changed the  world.   The Queen, the royal family, and all our friends in the United  Kingdom have our thoughts and our prayers.                            ____________________     Mr. President, now on a completely different matter, I  have been talking all week about the ways that liberal policies hurt  American families in their daily lives.   After 2 years of total Democratic control in Washington, we have seen  how reckless spending comes home to roost in the form of decades-high  inflation and shrinking paychecks for working Americans.   We have seen what happens when one of our two major political parties  decides in its rhetoric, in its personnel, and in its policies that  keeping our streets safe, our border secure, and  [[Page S4499]]  criminals behind bars are simply not their priorities. And despite  multiple glaring cautionary tales both at home and abroad, we are  seeing the early warning signs of our Democratic colleagues' hostility  to an all-of-the-above American energy strategy.   In Europe, some of America's closest allies are reaping the painful  effects of years of shortsighted green policies. By swapping affordable  and reliable domestic power for half-baked fads, our friends have  placed themselves at the mercy of Vladimir Putin to meet demand ahead  of another cold winter.   Working families and small businesses are taking this tradeoff on the  chin. I saw one shop owner in Ireland explain she has just had to pay  almost as much for 2 months of electricity as she did throughout all of  last year. Unfortunately, millions of Americans can sympathize. An  estimated 20 million U.S. households are already behind on their energy  bills thanks to Democrats' runaway inflation.   And out in California, State and local Democrats have wasted no time  taking things even further--even further--in the wrong direction.  Democrats have made California's electrical grid into a giant  experiment to try out all of their misunderstandings about energy  policy. It is not going well. With hot weather demand surging,  California authorities are sweating political shortfalls of up to 5,000  megawatts. California's love affair with fickle, unreliable green  energy could force its residents to put up with rolling blackouts just  to conform to wealthy liberals' preferences.   The government had to send out an emergency message begging citizens  to ration power. Ironically, just weeks after announcing a future ban  on gas-powered automobiles, the State is now begging folks not to  charge their expensive electric cars to avoid crashing the grid.   So California Democrats don't want you putting gas in your car; they  don't want you to plug in your car either. That is exactly where their  war on energy would leave the American people: Going nowhere fast.   President Biden's Secretary of Energy, Secretary Granholm, literally  said less than a week ago that:         California is in the lead--    In the lead--       and can show the rest of the nation how it is done.    So at home and abroad, our Democratic colleagues have been given  sobering warnings of what not to do on energy. They have seen what  happens when you wage war on abundant fossil fuels, abandon nuclear  power, and go all in on the least--the least--reliable energy sources.   But this all-Democratic government has spent 2 straight years running  head-on toward these bright red flashing warning signals. They have  frozen new domestic energy leasing, canceled new pipelines, and  reinstated a maze--a maze--of redtape designed to strangle entire  domestic industries.   As gas prices skyrocketed on President Biden's watch, his  administration approved less new oil drilling than any since Harry  Truman was in office. Our Democratic colleagues have doubled and  tripled down. Last month, while they rammed through their reckless  taxing-and-spending spree, they voted in lockstep multiple times  against Republican amendments that would have helped shore up American  energy and rebuild our independence.   Europe in thrall to Putin's gas supply, California talking about  rolling blackouts--exactly what further warning do our Democratic  colleagues actually need?                            ____________________     Mr. President, now on another matter, in January 2019,  a bipartisan supermajority of the Senate voted for an amendment I  authored warning that the ``. . . precipitous withdrawal of United  States forces from [Afghanistan] could put at risk hard-won gains and  United States national security.''   Two years later, senior experts and advisers repeated the same  warning to President Biden. His own experts made it clear that a hasty  retreat from counterterrorism operations in Afghanistan would lead to  the collapse of the Afghan Government.   Those warnings, of course, fell on deaf ears. Thirteen American  servicemembers died fulfilling the Biden administration's rush to  evacuation. The Taliban now rules again in Kabul, as it did before U.S.  forces arrived. Now, 1 year on from last August's disaster, the  devastating scale of the fallout from President Biden's decision has  come into sharper focus. Afghanistan has become, once again, a global  pariah. Its economy has shrunk by nearly a third. Half of its  population is now suffering critical levels of food insecurity. Afghan  women and girls have had their rights to work, attend school, and live  independently torn away under Taliban rule. And just as we feared, just  as was predicted, Afghanistan is again becoming a serious haven for  terrorists.   The recent American strike that took out al-Qaida's leader al- Zawahiri is a credit to decades of work by the professionals of our  intelligence community.   Ah, but the fact that a terrorist kingpin felt comfortable in Kabul  just months after America's withdrawal is a damning condemnation of the  Biden administration's unjustified confidence that the Taliban could be  trusted not to lay out the welcome mat for our most consequential  terrorist enemies.   The strike was a success, but the underlying fact that President  Biden's policies led this top terrorist to set up shop with impunity  right in downtown Kabul is a colossal failure.   In fact, just weeks before the strike that killed Zawahiri, when the  administration already knew full well that the Taliban government and  senior Haqqani terrorists were harboring him, the administration  still--still--released another hardened terrorist from Guantanamo and  returned him into the Taliban's waiting arms.   So al-Qaida is rebuilding under the patronage of the Taliban and the  Haqqanis. There is no question that so-called over-the-horizon  counterterrorism operations are becoming much more difficult. Senior  administration officials have acknowledged that our intelligence about  the growing threat is drying up--so is our ability to combat it.   And the damage, the fallout, isn't limited just to Afghanistan  itself. America's reckless abandonment has done lasting damage to the  coalition partnerships that had made our operations there so  successful. President Biden showed America's allies we couldn't be  trusted or reasoned with, and he showed our adversaries the weakness of  our resolve. There is no question in my mind that Russian, Chinese, and  Iranian leaders watched us retreat from Afghanistan and, of course,  were emboldened.   I advised three consecutive Presidents not to withdraw from  Afghanistan--three of them. I believed a small residual presence was  sustainable, would help us keep pressure on the terrorists, and protect  us here at home.   Gen. Frank McKenzie, CENTCOM commander during the withdrawal, has  said repeatedly that he voiced the very same view to President Biden.   But even now, a year after the President's orders were carried out,  the Biden administration continues to shirk accountability and  responsibility.   The fact that their haphazard scramble required an unprecedented  airlift was not a success; it was a failure. The fact that over a year  later, the administration still cannot really account for who they  brought into our country, while both Americans and vulnerable Afghan  partners still remain in Afghanistan as we speak, is not a success; it  is a failure.   President Biden has rejected practically every part of his  predecessor's agenda, foreign and domestic, but he pretends he was  somehow powerless to alter the previous administration's Doha agreement  to pull out of Afghanistan--the one time President Biden decided the  previous President had it right. Of course, the truth is that President  Biden wanted to withdraw from Afghanistan. He campaigned on it.  According to public reports, he spent the entire Obama administration  pushing back against the generals' advice not to cut and run. And once  in office himself, he pushed ahead.   Senate Republicans will continue to press for accountability, will  continue to pursue answers to tough questions about why the Biden  administration  [[Page S4500]]  ran headfirst--headfirst--into this national embarrassment. Just as  importantly, we will also keep pushing to rebuild America's military,  both to meet major threats from Russia and China and to defend the  terrorist challenges President Biden has left to fester.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, today, all Americans stand with our  great friends across the Atlantic in mourning the passing of Her  Majesty Queen Elizabeth II. Our deepest sympathies are with the royal  family and the many millions of people across the United Kingdom and  the Commonwealth and the entire world who have drawn reassurance and  inspiration from her historic reign, sterling character, and shining  example.   For 70 long years--from the aftermath of World War II well into the  21st century, across 15 different Prime Ministers, through great  triumphs and great challenges--the Queen's steady leadership  safeguarded the land she loved. Despite spending nearly three-quarters  of a century as one of the most famous and admired individuals on the  entire planet, the Queen made sure her reign was never really about  herself, not about her fame or her feelings or her personal wants or  needs.   She guided venerable institutions through modern times using timeless  virtues like duty, dignity, and sacrifice. She offered our contemporary  world a living master class that it needed badly.   Of particular importance to all Americans, the decades of Her  Majesty's reign saw an intense deepening of the special relationship  and close bond between the United States and the United Kingdom. The  Queen met sitting President Harry S. Truman when she was a 25-year-old  princess. She went on to meet with a dozen more of our Presidents  during her reign. She presided over a period of historic strengthening  of the alliance between our nations that has changed the course of  world history for the better.   So, Madam President, today, the Senate and the American people are  joined with our dear friends across the ocean. We are joined in prayer,  in grief, and in gratitude for such a remarkable leader and such a  successful reign.                            ____________________
