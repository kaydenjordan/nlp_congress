 Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend and colleague,  Representative Jody Hice, for the opportunity to speak this evening on  such an important issue.   We are here today to discuss the recent revelations that the Obama  administration, in their pursuit of the Iran deal, blocked important  efforts by U.S. law enforcement officials to fight the terrorist  organization Hezbollah.   The past administration's treatment of Iran reveals an imprudent and  negligent approach to American foreign policy that must never be  repeated. We see in their actions, at best, an incompetence born of a  lack of clarity and information and, at worst, an administration  determined to create a false foreign policy legacy so that America's  [[Page H10338]]  best interests were thrown to the wayside.   In a recent report from Politico mentioned by some of my colleagues  already, we have learned that the Obama administration allegedly  blocked efforts by U.S. law enforcement officials to fight Hezbollah's  transnational drug and weapons trafficking operations.   Hezbollah, Iran's terrorist proxy organization, has also become one  of the world's most powerful and dangerous criminal organizations,  receiving over $1 billion every year from their illicit activities. We  have learned that, through an expansive criminal trafficking network,  they funnel cocaine throughout the Middle East, Europe, Africa, Latin  America, and the United States.   It has also come to light that Hezbollah launders millions of dollars  through schemes involving used car purchases in the United States, and,  ultimately, the money earned through these activities can be used for  violent terrorist activities aimed at spreading fear and pain  throughout the world.   Politico quoted the following from a confidential DEA report on  Hezbollah's criminal activities: Hezbollah ``has leveraged  relationships with corrupt foreign government officials and  transnational criminal actors . . . creating a network that can be  utilized to move metric ton quantities of cocaine, launder drug  proceeds on a global scale, and procure weapons and precursors for  explosives.''   It ``has at its disposal one of the most capable networks of actors  coalescing elements of transnational organized crime with terrorism in  the world.''   The DEA's acting deputy administrator in 2016 stated that Hezbollah's  criminal operations ``provide a revenue and weapons stream for an  international terrorist organization responsible for devastating terror  attacks around the world.''   Certainly, an organization like that deserves America's utmost  scrutiny; and for years, the men and women of the Drug Enforcement  Administration's Project Cassandra poured their lives into  investigating Hezbollah's criminal activities. These agents tracked  financial transactions, cultivated sources, and trailed operatives.  But, in several cases, when the DEA asked for prosecutions, arrests, or  sanctions, President Obama's Department of Justice delayed or denied  their requests. The State Department also reportedly declined to demand  the extradition of important suspects who could have aided the  investigation and spearheaded the downfall of this international  operation.   Unfortunately, thanks to multiple sources involved in the matter now  coming forward, we have learned that the Obama administration likely  stalled the Hezbollah investigations and prosecutions in order to keep  Iran happy and nuclear deal talks on the table. If the DEA rocked the  boat by arresting and charging key members of Hezbollah's drug and  weapons trafficking operations, then Iran might walk away from the  negotiating table.   This thinking reveals a fundamental blindness to reality. Hezbollah  is funded by Iran. Hezbollah is Iran. While negotiating with Iran, the  former administration turned a blind eye to Hezbollah's extensive  criminal activities that were only worsening the drug crisis here in  the United States and feeding weapons to terrorists in the Middle East  region.   American foreign policy can be pragmatic, but this was not  pragmatism. This was foolishness. U.S. foreign policymakers traded an  end to Iran's nuclear program for the protection of Iran's terrorist  program. And even then, we can't even trust Iran to abide by the  agreement meant to end their nuclear program.   So we are left with a bad deal. I have said it many times before. But  now we know the deal is even worse than we suspected. Aside from just  delivering pallets of cash to Iran, aside from just freeing billions in  frozen assets, aside from just lifting important sanctions, we are also  giving a transnational criminal organization and terrorist network free  rein over the world.   We are here today to affirm to the world that Iran and its affiliated  terrorist organization, Hezbollah, are enemies of the free world.   We should never negotiate with terrorists. I urge President Trump and  America's law enforcement community to once again turn its attention to  Hezbollah. This terrorist organization has spread its evil influence  throughout the world, and we have a duty to fight it.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend, the gentleman from Georgia, for this  opportunity today, and I thank him for bringing this issue up and  shining some light on this important subject.   Mr. JODY B. HICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Buck  in his leadership on this, as well.   Mr. Speaker, I just want to say, not only to Mr. Buck, but to all of  the participants in our discussion this evening, a big thank you for  coming and being a part of this.   As more information is beginning to come to light, I am convinced  that we are just at the tip of the iceberg of gaining information as to  what has taken place here that has jeopardized our national security. I  believe it is incumbent upon Congress at this time to fulfill the  obligation that we have to exercise oversight over the executive branch  and follow through with a thorough investigation of the Obama  administration's refusal--absolute refusal--to follow through on the  work that was done by the DEA.                                time  2000    We had these terrorists in our grasp, Mr. Speaker, and we let them  go. How could this happen? The American people deserve to know why, and  we need to get to the bottom of this.   That is why tonight we are calling for an investigation into all  aspects of this Hezbollah scandal, regardless of where it leads us: to  the very top of the Obama administration, the Secretary of State, the  previous Department of Justice, wherever it may lead. We need to get to  the bottom of this, and we are calling for an investigation.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
