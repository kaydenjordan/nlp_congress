 Mr. Speaker, thousands of members of the military have  terminated their service for our country because of the COVID military  vaccine mandate.   Thousands more have chosen early retirement, and thousands have not  enlisted. Recruitment is down. Our national security is suffering  because of this.   It is time to treat the men and women of our military who have signed  up and pledged their lives to defend this country with the respect they  deserve. It is time to get rid of the COVID vaccine mandate for the  military.   My bill, H.R. 3860, would do that. I introduced it in June 2021.  Since then, we have garnered over 90 cosponsors for that bill.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues, as they consider the language of  the National Defense Authorization Act this week, to include the  language of H.R. 3860 to protect the brave men and women of our  military.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, there is not a more fierce fighter than  Louie Gohmert in this House, and if you are serving in this House and  have a bigger heart than Louie Gohmert, I haven't met you yet. I am  sorry. I need to find you. I haven't found anybody with a heart the  size of Louie Gohmert's.   One of the measures, I think, of a Member here is how they treat  their staff and how their staff responds to them. Louie Gohmert  attracts the best talent of anybody in this Chamber, and they love him.  We love Louie Gohmert.   I remember my first week in Congress. I was in conference. We were  going to elect a Speaker, and nobody was challenging Speaker Boehner.  Louie Gohmert got up to nominate somebody else. He reminded us all that  you didn't have to be a Member of the House to be nominated for  Speaker. I was just praying that he didn't nominate Ron Paul because I  knew I would have to second that nomination.   I leaned to the person next to me, and I said: ``Who is that guy  making that nomination?'' He said: ``Oh, that is Louie Gohmert. He is  crazy.''   Well, within a week, I realized Louie Gohmert was the only sane man  in this Chamber, and for 10 years, he has been guiding me. He has a  photographic memory and is sharp as a whip. He is like an encyclopedia  of everything that has happened in this Chamber while he was here,  before I got here.   One day in conference, they were telling us: Look, when the  quarterback calls the play and snaps the ball, you don't execute  another play. They were imploring us to do something, frankly, that  wasn't in the best interests of the people from Tyler, Texas, nor in  the interests of the people from Kentucky.   I asked Louie: Louie, what are you going to do when the quarterback  snaps the ball?   He said: When the quarterback snaps the ball and runs for the wrong  end zone, I am not obligated to block for him. In fact, I might have to  tackle him.   Louie Gohmert has never been afraid to go against the grain when it  means supporting the people from Texas' First District, and that is the  people I thank for loaning us Louie Gohmert, for having the good  discernment to send him to Congress in the first place and then to send  him back. America has benefited from the good judgment of the people in  Texas' First District.   We are going to miss you very much, sorely, Louie.    Yes.
