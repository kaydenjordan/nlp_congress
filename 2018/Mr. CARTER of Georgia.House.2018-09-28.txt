 Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank Chairmen  Walden and Burgess for working so hard with our partners across the  aisle as well as across the Capitol to come to a consensus on this  critical legislation necessary to combat the opioid epidemic.   As the only pharmacist currently serving in Congress, I have seen  families saved by pain medications and have seen families torn apart by  the same drugs.   Since this body began tackling the opioid epidemic, I have said there  are three major components to this crisis: prevention, law enforcement,  and treatment.   This legislation touches all three prongs of the opioid crisis with a  number creative solutions in addition to providing offsets to ensure  that solving a public health crisis does not lead to a fiscal one.   This package is not a silver bullet, but as legislators we need to do  everything in our capacity to prevent the addiction and overdoses that  occur every day in the United States.

I voted for many of these bills when they came before Energy and  Commerce for markup, and once again I want to offer my full support for  this legislation.   I am pleased that this package includes three of my own bills, the  Special Registration for Telemedicine Clarification Act, the Abuse  Deterrent Access Act, and the Empowering Pharmacists in the Fight  Against Opioid Abuse Act.   This package is not a silver bullet--but as legislators we need to do  everything in our capacity to prevent the addiction and overdoses that  occur every day in the United States.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate  September being National Recovery Month.   Sponsored by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services  Administration, SAMHSA, I encourage everyone to take time this month to  reach out to those who they know are suffering or have suffered from  mental and substance abuse disorders.   Currently, 115 people die every day from opioid abuse. Clearly, that  is way too many, and, sadly, only one example of numerous types of  mental and substance abuse disorders in the United States.   If you or anyone you know is struggling, there are resources  available, including a Suicide Prevention Lifeline, SAMHSA's National  Helpline, and more. SAMHSA's website, www.samhsa.gov, has these phone  numbers, treatment center locations, grant applications for local  governments, and general health information.   With hard work, smart policy decisions, and a dedicated American  public, we can turn these numbers around.                            ____________________
