 MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, I thank the  gentleman for yielding and for his extraordinary leadership on H.R. 2.   I thank my colleague on the other side of the aisle, but I am urging  a ``no'' vote on his amendment. We are in the midst of a national  emergency caused by the coronavirus, and it is having a dire effect on  the Postal Service.   Despite better-than-expected revenues in recent months, the Postal  Service is still at risk of running out of money. It could be forced to  cease operations if it does not receive financial assistance from the  Federal Government soon. This amendment would eliminate the critical  funding that the post office needs.   Throughout the pandemic, the Postal Service has continued to deliver  lifesaving medications and vital supplies, especially to rural America.  If the Postal Service ceases to exist, rural Americans will suffer the  most, because it is the only delivery company that serves them.   If any issue should be bipartisan, it is this one, because the post  office affects every American and is critical to many of us. The Postal  Service helps bind us together and delivers to every address in the  Nation, no matter how remote.   But the dedicated staff that braves the coronavirus pandemic every  day cannot continue to do their job without reliable transportation or  funding. We must fulfill our constitutional duty and act now to save  the Postal Service.   I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to oppose this  amendment.    MALONEY of New York:        H.R. 7463. A bill to require States to meet assisted living       facility reporting requirements to qualify for future COVID-      19 response funds; to the Committee on Energy and Commerce,       and in addition to the Committee on Ways and Means, for a       period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each       case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the       jurisdiction of the committee concerned.
