 Madam Speaker, I come to the House floor  today with a heavy and grieving heart for my home State of Tennessee.  No one should ever have to endure what the Covenant School community  has gone through.   I know that my colleagues here today understand how difficult the  situation is, and your prayers for our community are deeply appreciated  as we mourn this senseless loss of life.   I want to take a moment to remember the victims of this horrible  attack: three schoolchildren, William Kinney, Evelyn Dieckhaus, Hallie  Scruggs, all age 9; and three staff members, Cynthia Peak, a substitute  teacher, Mike Hill, a custodian, and Covenant School Headmaster  Katherine Koonce.   All the lives were precious.   Mike Hill, for example, worked for the Covenant School for 15 years.  He not only served the school and the church, but he learned every  student's name. He was the father of seven children.   Cynthia Peak was a beloved wife and mother.   Dr. Katherine Koonce was a dedicated and passionate educator, who  always put children first.   Words cannot describe how hard it is to lose children, three precious  9-year-old children, one of whom was the daughter of the lead pastor of  the Covenant Presbyterian Church. These children never had a chance to  grow up, and my heart is completely broken for these families. I cannot  imagine.   Nothing can be said to dull the pain of this tragedy. Tennesseans,  and Americans worldwide, are praying and grieving with this Covenant  community.   Madam Speaker, I also commend all the first responders that were on  the scene and the medical professionals that treated victims at  Vanderbilt Medical Center.   I especially commend the five Metro Nashville Police officers who  arrived at the school first. These men ran toward the sound of the  gunfire instead of away from it. Their bravery absolutely saved lives.   The two officers that shot and killed, with a gun, the shooter,  Officers Rex Engelbert and Michael Collazo, are heroes. They did not  hesitate, and because of their quick response, lives were saved.   Though unspeakable grief holds Nashville in its grasp, I honor the  incredible heroism of Metro Nashville's first responders. Instinct and  courage took over in the face of evil and fear. I join Tennesseans in  expressing my sincere gratitude for their quick response.   The outpouring of love means the world to the Covenant community and  all Tennesseans.                            ____________________
