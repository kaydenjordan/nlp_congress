 Madam Speaker, I have had the privilege and honor of  serving most of my career in Congress on the Permanent Select Committee  on Intelligence. It is important work that goes on in secret,  typically, and it is really important. Typically it involves the  oversight of 17 agencies which we empower to protect this Nation from  enemies abroad.   That important work has been highjacked by this investigation, which  is being led by the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. The  Intelligence Committee works with sources and methods. Madam Speaker,  there is nothing classified about anything that is going on downstairs  in our SCIF. There are no sources or methods at risk here.   This is a jurisdictional issue. This investigation, should it be  happening at all, should be done by the Committee on the Judiciary.  That is where Articles of Impeachment will have to come from, not the  Intelligence Committee. Our good work that is important to this Nation  is being highjacked by this process that should not even, in my view,  be going on. But if it should be going on, Chairman Nadler should be  the one leading this effort, not Chairman Schiff.   I ask the Speaker to go the normal route, put the inquiry on the  floor, have us vote on that, allow all of us to express our opinion,  not just hers, but all of our opinions on this issue.                            ____________________
