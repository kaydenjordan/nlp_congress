 Mr. Speaker, this is just one more example of the  Democrats attacking the President instead of trying to solve the  problem.   We all know how serious the problem was. We have known it for months  and months and months. For months, we said there was a crisis on the  southern border, and the Democrats said: No, no, no, not really a  crisis. It is manufactured. It is not real.   Even though there were 144 apprehensions in the month of May alone,  they said: Oh, no, no--manufactured.   Finally, the real crisis got so extreme, even the Democrats had to  say: You know what? That money the President is asking for, we are  going to have to give him a little money. We are going to have to do  something here.   They put all kinds of strings on it, but they finally admitted there  was a real crisis on the border. But they limited what the President  could do.   In the broader context, never forget what they have said. They said:  Abolish ICE. Members of the United States Congress: Abolish ICE.   We had a Member from the majority say to abolish the whole  Department. We had the Speaker of the House, even though she has a wall  in her own State, say walls are immoral.   The majority says they are okay with noncitizens voting. This is the  perspective they offer, and now they bring this bill?   Of course we should vote against this thing. Of course we should vote  against this thing.
