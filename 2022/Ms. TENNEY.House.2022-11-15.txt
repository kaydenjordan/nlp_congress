 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the Joseph family from  Utica, New York, and their dedicated and honorable service in defense  of our great Nation.   During World War II, five of the Joseph brothers served in our Armed  Forces, rising to the challenge to democracy and freedom and defending  all free people's rights across the globe.   The Joseph brothers served in all branches of the military across  multiple fronts, in harm's way constantly. Sadly, none of the brothers  could return home for their mother's funeral, as she died when they  were deployed across multiple fronts and theaters of combat.  [[Page H8500]]    While it is impossible to comprehend and appreciate what they all  went through, all just young men coming of age literally under enemy  fire, I want to provide this body and this country with a small  snapshot of what each Joseph brother endured and did for their  community, State, and our country.   Seaman Second Class Edward Michael ``Chick'' Joseph, having served in  the United States Navy during World War II, receiving an honorable  discharge from the Navy on November 28, 1944. Ed, otherwise known as  ``Chick,'' earned the Combat Action Ribbon, Navy Good Conduct Medal,  American Campaign Medal, Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal with three  bronze battle stars, World War II Victory Medal, and foreign awards of  the Philippine Republic Presidential Unit Citation and the Philippine  Liberation Ribbon with one bronze battle star.   Torpedoman's Mate Second Class Joseph Edward Joseph, honorably  discharged from the United States Navy on January 4, 1946, serving in  World War II aboard the USS Aulick. On November 29, 1945, six Japanese  planes attacked the Aulick in the Leyte Gulf while on antisubmarine  patrol, with 31 men giving their lives in defense of their ship,  comrades, and country, 64 being wounded, and 1 sailor missing in  action.   Anthony Joseph, United States Marine Corps, World War II, died in  1945, sadly, due to cancer.   Louis Joseph, United States Merchant Marines, World War II, serving  in the Atlantic, Pacific, and Mediterranean theaters, visiting 31  countries, islands, and territories. Two of the ships Louis served on  were sunk, with one sinking causing Louis to spend 17 days adrift in a  raft. Louis' unit earned the Presidential Unit Citation with two battle  stars. Louis used his brother Joseph's identification to enlist  initially in the Coast Guard, as he was underage to serve his country.   John G. Joseph, United States Coast Guard during World War II, also  served as a corporal and auto equipment operator in the United States  Army during the period immediately after World War II, serving from  December 1945 through December 1948, having been separated from Fort  Slocum in New York.   I have been fortunate enough to know many World War II veterans and  to hear firsthand their actions and experiences. Sadly, members of our  Greatest Generation are dwindling in numbers, and our current  generation may not know of their sacrifice and service other than what  is portrayed in Hollywood or in history books.   The Joseph family should be an example to all Americans of what  answering the call to service means, especially when our ideals and our  values are directly threatened by tyrants and oppressors.   Their family stateside supported them while under great stress,  knowing these sons of Utica, New York, were direct players in one of  the greatest military struggles in our Nation's history.   I am honored to represent subsequent generations of the Joseph  family, who all continued the tradition of the six Joseph brothers in  public service and community service.    I thank the Joseph family for their service and all of our veterans  in the 22nd Congressional District and across the United States of  America for their sacrifice and their inspiring service to all of us,  to our country, our States, our communities.   Thank you from the bottom of our hearts. God bless these wonderful  people who answer the call to serve.                            ____________________
