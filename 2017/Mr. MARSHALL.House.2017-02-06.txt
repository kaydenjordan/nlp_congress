 Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight with fellow physicians and  other colleagues to speak out against the shameful act being allowed in  some parts of this country: physician-assisted suicide.   When I became a physician, I took an oath in which I promised to help  the sick and to abstain from all intentional wrongdoing and harm. To  help intentionally take the life of a patient is morally abhorrent.   It is not only the beginning of a slippery slope that devalues the  sanctity of all human life. It is not only based on a subjective set of  qualifications lawyers and lobbyists agree to. It is against the very  oath that my fellow physicians swear to uphold. I encourage my  colleagues to fight for these same beliefs, to treat life as sacred,  and, first of all, to do no harm.
