 Madam President, today I wish to honor the memory of 18  of Butte, America's finest.   Since 1892, 18 brave police officers have lost their lives in the  line of duty protecting the people of Butte-Silverbow County, the most  of any county in Montana.   These men put the lives of others above their own, rushing into  danger to keep their community safe, and paying the ultimate sacrifice  as a result.   I want to honor: William F. Jordan; Dennis W. Daly; Federick  Kranbeck; Fred A. Palin; John J. Streb; Joseph A. Freshman; Charles E.  Streb; Ivan W. Lincoln; James H. Pace; Bart J. McCarthy; Joseph E.  Sage; Batt Arrigoni; Jeremiah J. Murphy; Thomas O'Neill; Nicholas  Aleksich; Colin McMillan; Tom Monroe; and David V. Thomas and their  families and loved ones who sacrificed so much as well.   May their memories never be forgotten. May all current and future  peace officers in Butte-Silver Bow, around Montana, and this Nation  return home safe at the end of their watches.                            ____________________
