 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to mark the beginning of my  final year in Congress. Throughout my five terms, I have always made  working families my number one priority.   So, in my final year, what is at the top of my list to make sure that  I am focusing on? Well, right now it is reinstating the child tax  credit that just expired this month. Hardworking families who are just  trying to get by have come to count on that support month to month  since we passed that last year.   Now, there are 71,000 families, just in the congressional district  that I serve, who won't see that deposit into their bank account  starting this month. So let's get to work.   In Illinois, more than half of the children living in poverty don't  have a seat in the pre-K classroom. So let's get to work.   Parents across our Nation are spending a good chunk of their take- home pay for the childcare that they need in order to be able to go to  work, and it is our job to help make that more affordable. So let's get  to work.   I have got 1 year left in Congress and so much to accomplish, so I  say to my own staff, I say to myself, I say to everybody in this body,  let's get to work.                            ____________________
