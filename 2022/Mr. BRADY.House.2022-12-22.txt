 Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I thank Chairman Neal for his leadership of this  committee and his friendship. You care about the institution; you care  about this committee. Your word has always been good, and together our  committees have done good things: banning surprise medical billing, new  trade agreements with Mexico and Canada, repeated efforts to help  people save. It has been an honor to serve with you.   Now, if you will excuse me, I intend to peel the bark off this bill  in front of us right now.   Madam Speaker, this bill is a charade. It is a flimsy excuse that for  years has been used to justify the political targeting of former  President Trump.   This week, Democrats in Congress finally accomplished their goal: for  the first time in history making public the full, actual tax returns of  a private citizen. This unprecedented action jeopardizes the right of  every American to be protected from political targeting by Congress.   We are told President Trump's returns must be released in order for  the IRS to conduct its Presidential audits. That is absurd. That is  like going to the doctor and being told your private medical records  must be released in order to be examined. One has nothing to do with  the other. And then you would quickly realize, someone just wants to  release your medical records, and any excuse will do.   Let me be clear: Republicans' concerns are not whether the President  should have made his tax returns public as has been tradition, nor  about the accuracy of his tax returns, that is for the IRS and the  taxpayer to determine.   Our concern is that this politically motivated action sets a terrible  precedent that unleashes a dangerous new  [[Page H9993]]  political weapon reaching far beyond any President, and overturns  decades of privacy protections for average Americans that have existed  since the Watergate reforms.   Our current law was put in place specifically to prevent Presidents  and Members of Congress from targeting political enemies through their  tax returns. Unfortunately, the Supreme Court chose not to intervene to  stop the flimsy and admittedly partisan Democrat efforts to target the  former President.    Now, as a result, thanks to this week's actions, longstanding privacy  protections for all taxpayers have been gutted.   Going forward, the majority chairman of the House Ways and Means  Committee and the Senate Financial Committee will have nearly unlimited  power to target and make public the tax returns of private citizens,  political enemies, business and labor leaders, or even the Supreme  Court Justices themselves.   No party in Congress should hold that power. No individual should  hold that power to embarrass, harass, or destroy a private citizen  through disclosure of their private tax returns.   After nearly half a century, the political enemies list is back in  Washington, D.C., and it will unleash a cycle of political retribution  in Congress.   Many of us in Congress believed the current law was strong enough to  protect private citizens against this political targeting, but it is no  longer. That is frightening.   Republicans will continue to fight to protect American taxpayers from  this abuse of power that will surely have severe consequences for  taxpayers and democracy for years to come.   We have urged our Democrat friends to turn back because making  private tax information public will be a regrettable stain, both on our  committee and on Congress. It will make American politics even more  ugly and divisive. In the long run, we believe every Member of Congress  will come to regret this.   Madam Speaker, we strongly oppose this bill today. Not because  portions of it doesn't have merit, some do, but it has serious flaws,  of course, because it didn't exist 48 hours ago.   And had it been brought forward 4 years ago, 3 years ago, 2 years  ago, as an honest attempt to improve Presidential audits, I am  convinced we could have found common ground with no need to expose  private tax returns of anyone. But not now, not this bill, and not this  way.   Republicans will not support any measure whose only purpose is to  provide cover for the political targeting of a private citizen.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I include in the Record an article from  yesterday's Los Angeles Times confirming the release of tax returns  does nothing to evaluate the IRS auditing process or to advance any  legitimate oversight goal.                [From the Los Angeles Times, Dec. 21, 2022]    Column: Should Congress Post Trump's Tax Returns Publicly? I Don't                                  Think So                           (By Nicholas Goldberg)         Donald Trump should have released his tax returns when he       was running for president, and in not doing so he was       deceptive, sleazy and in violation of a long-standing       tradition that fosters transparency and honesty. He obviously       hoped to hide unfavorable information from the voters.        Despite that, I don't believe the House Ways and Means       Committee should release his tax returns to the public now.        The committee fought a long battle all the way to the       Supreme Court to obtain copies of the returns. It argued that       it needed them to evaluate the effectiveness of an IRS       program that audits the tax filings of presidents.        Republicans squawked all the way, saying the Democrats who       controlled the committee were being disingenuous, and that       no, no, no, they weren't seeking to do a legitimate       evaluation--they were just creating a pretext to get ahold of       Trump's returns for a humiliating public fishing expedition       into what taxes had or hadn't been paid.        The courts ultimately ruled that the committee could have       six years of Trump's federal tax returns. That battle ended       last month.        But on Tuesday, the committee voted to do something that       goes well beyond what's necessary to evaluate the IRS'       presidential audit program: The committee is now going to       release Trump's taxes publicly, posting the full returns       (minus certain identifiers like Social Security numbers and       bank account numbers) for all to see. And quickly too, in the       coming days, before the Democrats lose control of the       committee to the Republicans on Jan. 3.        Why make the returns public? How does that help Congress       figure out whether the IRS auditing process is working? How       does it further the legitimate oversight goals of the       committee?        Answer: It doesn't. It turns out the Republicans are right.       (This may be the first time since the Civil War.) As they       correctly noted, this is a politically motivated move to       release information that might harm or embarrass the former       president.        In theory, I'm all for embarrassing Trump. (With these two       caveats: First, no one can embarrass Trump more than he       embarrasses himself, and second, he's entirely shameless so       he doesn't really get embarrassed in any normal sense of the       word.) The ex-president is a dishonest thug who needs to be       called to account for his misbehavior.        But in this particular case, I think the Democrats are in       the wrong. For one thing, releasing the private tax returns       probably won't shed much light on anything. The New York       Times already received leaked details of more than two       decades of Trump's tax filings and published long stories       that should've shocked the world. Billionaire pays less in       federal taxes in some years than you and I do! Trump paid no       federal income taxes at all in 10 out of 15 years!        Furthermore, the Manhattan district attorney's office has       many of Trump's tax returns as well, and prosecutors can       pursue cases using the data they uncover.        But the main reason I object to posting the returns is that       I worry--perhaps quaintly, in this day and age--about the       continued politicization of governmental processes, and the       continued breaking of established norms, in this case making       private tax filings public. I know I'll get a thousand emails       saying ``the Republicans wouldn't hesitate to do the same to       us'' and ``if we're civil and respectful and always play by       Marquess of Queensberry rules while our political opponents       continue their underhanded tricks, we will always be       beaten.''        There's certainly some truth to that. But there's truth to       the flip side too: If nobody plays by the rules, there will       soon be no rules to play by. When you're doing something as       sensitive and politically explosive as investigating a former       president--at a tense time in history when there's talk of       civil war and violence is on the rise and bitter political       partisanship is smoldering--it makes sense to be careful to       respect the established process, be as honest as possible,       refrain from unnecessary politicization and not escalate       conflict unnecessarily.        Among other things, posting Trump's taxes seems likely to       result in tit-for-tat posting of other people's private tax       returns. Will we soon be seeing Hunter Biden's tax returns on       the web?        It'll also give Republicans some basis for saying that,       actually, it is Democrats who go low when others go high.        Unsurprisingly, the committee vote was along party lines.       Like so much of what goes on in Washington these days.        If Congress thinks all presidents or presidential       candidates should release their tax returns for public       scrutiny--which I believe is a good idea--it should pass a       law that mandates that going forward. It should not find       circuitous, pretextual ways of going after particular       presidents.        The returns the Ways and Means Committee received       apparently showed that Trump often paid little or nothing in       federal income taxes between 2015 and 2020 despite reporting       millions in earnings, thanks to  [[Page H9994]]       steep losses elsewhere. That's similar to what the New York       Times found in its reporting.        The unembarrassable Trump once said in a debate when       Hillary Clinton accused him of not paying much in federal       taxes: ``That makes me smart.''        Voters need to know more about the sources and scope of       presidential candidates' wealth and about potential conflicts       of interests.        But posting Trump's returns at this point and under these       circumstances and given the arguments that were made to       obtain them, serves politics much more than transparency.     Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Nebraska (Mr. Smith).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Kelly), the Republican leader of the Select Revenue  Measures Subcommittee.    Madam Speaker, I include in the Record one page from the  Democrats' own report showing that, contrary to what we just heard,  every single year, tax returns at issue are under audit, debunking this  claim that the IRS hasn't examined the tax return.        Notably, the IRS sent a letter to the former President       notifying him that his tax year 2015 return was selected for       examination on April 3, 2019, which is the date the Chairman       sent the initial request to the IRS for the former       President's return information and related tax returns.        The designated agents were told by the IRS that two of the       entities the Chairman requested were included in the       mandatory audit program--DJT Holdings LLC and DJT Holdings       Managing Member LLC (DJTH Managing Member). The designated       agents found the below information regarding DJT Holdings       LLC's date of filing on the transcripts and selection for       examination and very little information for DJTH Managing       Member.         Tax Year, Date Return Filed, Date Selected for       Examination, Designated by IRS as Mandatory Audit:        2015, October 10, 2016, July 25, 2019, No.        2016, October 16, 2017, February 11, 2020, No indication.        2017, October 8, 2018, March 19, 2021, No.        2018, October 21, 2019, January 28, 2022, No.        2019, October 12, 2020, April 5, 2022, No.        2020, February 21, 2022, None, No.        During the prior Administration, it was clear that the       mandatory audit program was not a priority and was not       provided with the resources needed to ensure compliance by       the former President. An internal IRS memo stated: ``With       over 400 flow-thru returns reported on the Form 1040, it is       not possible to obtain the resources available to examine all       potential issues.'' The designated agents found that the       following issues, among others, warranted examination by the       IRS:        Charitable contributions--whether the 2015 conservation       easement deduction of $21 million and other large donations       reported on the Schedule A were supported by required       substantiation.        Verification of Net Operating Loss Carryover Schedule--      whether the amount of net operating loss carryover in 2015 of       $105,157,825 and future years was proper.        Unreimbursed partnership/S corporation expenses--whether       the terms of the partnership agreements supported       unreimbursed expense deductions totaling $27 million over six       years.        Related party loans--whether loans made to the former       President's children are loans or disguised gifts that could       trigger gift tax.        Cost of goods sold deductions by DJT Holdings--whether       these deductions of about  [[Page H9995]]       $126.5 million over five years is appropriate when it is not       clear what DJT Holdings is selling from the face of the       return.        LFB Acquisition LLC--whether there is any support for       changes in the management fees and general and administrative       expenses of LFB Acquisition that were significantly higher in       2017 ($1.9 million and $2.8 million, respectively) than 2016       ($750,000 and $549,000, respectively) and 2018 ($707,000 and       $570,000, respectively).    Madam Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Missouri (Mr. Smith), the Republican leader of the Budget Committee.    Madam Speaker, I would note that our professional staff  was ready to join in redaction; however, we were forced to prepare for  this floor action and offered to do that together after we were done  this morning.   Madam Speaker, I include in the Record a recent legal journal that  notes that because Ways and Means Democrats did not pursue the  Presidential audits of any of the other eight Presidents in that  system, that the committee undermines their own credibility by  releasing returns outside the context of a comprehensive review, an  honest review of the Presidential audit program.                 [From Chicago-Kent Law Review, April 1999]            I.R.C. 6103: Let's Get to the Source of the Problem                             (By Mark Berggren)                                 INTRODUCTION         Each year, millions of taxpayers in the United States       voluntarily disclose the most intimate details of their       private lives to the Internal Revenue Service (``IRS''). A       government official can glean, among other things, a       taxpayer's name, social security number, marital status,       income, and religious and political affiliations from a tax       return's attachments and completed schedules. Despite the       plethora of private information supplied to the IRS, prior to       the enactment of the Tax Reform Act of 1976, Internal Revenue       Code (``I.R.C.'') Sec. 6103 stated that a taxpayer's tax       return was a ``public record'' and as such was ``open to       inspection only upon order of the President and under rules       and regulations prescribed by the Secretary or his delegate       and approved by the President.''        The lack of protection afforded to returns and return       information resulted in the widespread misuse of what       taxpayers believed was confidential information. These abuses       took the forms of the unauthorized use of tax information for       political purposes by presidential administrations and the       authorized use of tax information by governmental agencies       other than the IRS. However, it was not until the Watergate       scandal that these governmental abuses were thrust into the       public limelight. The Watergate investigation led to       allegations that President Nixon had used return information       for unauthorized purposes and sought to use IRS audits and       investigations for political purposes.        In response to these misuses of tax information and their       potential effect on the voluntary assessment system, Congress       amended I.R.C. Sec. 6103. The amended version of Sec. 6103       states that return and return information (``tax       information'') shall be confidential and shall not be       disclosed except in thirteen specific circumstances.       Violations of this prohibition may result in criminal       sanctions under Sec. 7213 and civil sanctions under       Sec. 7431.        These necessary amendments, however, have not silenced the       controversy surrounding Sec. 6103. Section 6103's thirteen       exceptions do not contain an exception for tax information       that is part of a public record. This omission forced several       of the Federal Courts of Appeal to consider the question of       whether an authorized disclosure of tax information that       subsequently becomes part of a public record loses its       Sec. 6103 protection. In order to resolve this question, the       Federal Courts of Appeal have adopted different approaches to       the problem. The Sixth and Ninth Circuits look to see if the       disclosed tax information has lost its confidentiality. Based       on this analysis, these circuits reason that tax information       that is part of a public record is no longer confidential       and, thus, loses its Sec. 6103 protection. In contrast to       this approach, the Fourth and Tenth Circuits look at the       literal language of Sec. 6103. Because Sec. 6103 has no       public records exception to its nondisclosure norm, these       circuits conclude that tax information in a public record is       still protected by Sec. 6103 and any subsequent disclosures       of that information violate Sec. 6103. Not to be outdone, the       Seventh and Fifth  [[Page H9996]]       Circuits have also considered the issue. These circuits focus       on the source of the information disclosed. If the disclosure       is taken directly from a public record, the disclosure does       not contain tax information as statutorily defined and       Sec. 6103 is not violated. However, if the disclosure comes       directly from tax information, then Sec. 6103 is violated       regardless of whether the disclosure is also part of a public       record.        The resolution of this issue has far-reaching implications       if one considers the answer's potential effect on taxpayer       compliance. If courts create judicial exceptions to       Sec. 6103, taxpayers may not comply with tax laws because       their tax information will not be protected from governmental       abuse. On the other hand, if the IRS is prevented from       publicizing any tax information taken from any source, it may       be unable to deter noncompliance. The legislative history of       Sec. 6103 indicates that Congress was aware of these concerns       and sought to balance them in Sec. 6103 in order to maximize       taxpayer compliance. However, both Sec. 6103 and its       legislative history are silent as to whether tax information       that is part of a public record loses its Sec. 6103       protection. Thus, a uniform interpretation of Sec. 6103 is       needed not simply for uniformity's sake, but for the effect       on taxpayer compliance.        This note explores each circuit's approach to the public       records problem and its possible effect on taxpayer       compliance. Part I provides the history of Sec. 6103 with an       emphasis on the legislative purpose behind the 1976       amendments to Sec. 6103. Part II outlines the split in the       circuits according to the three approaches the circuits have       taken: the confidentiality approach, the disclosure approach,       and the source approach. Because the Fifth Circuit's recent       decision is the most comprehensive analysis of the public       record disclosure dilemma to date, this note discusses its       opinion in detail. In Part III, the note critiques each       approach in light of the legislative and political history       behind Sec. 6103. It concludes that the ``source'' approach       of the Seventh and Fifth Circuits is the best approach       because it effectuates the purpose behind Sec. 6103 without       imposing a judicially created exception on Sec. 6103.     Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Kansas (Mr. Estes).   MR. ESTES. Madam Speaker, I thank my friend from Texas for yielding.   Madam Speaker, what a shameful way for the majority to end their  reckless tenure in House leadership.   Today, we are debating and voting on rushed bills that will cost  Americans trillions of dollars, expand the Federal government, and  eviscerate personal privacy.   The timing of this atrocious bill is an assault on the institution  and further undermines the public trust in the United States House of  Representatives and Federal agencies.   Let us be clear: This bill has one purpose, to help the majority  party justify their prejudiced release of personal and private data of  the former President, his wife, and his 16-year-old son.   The supporters of this bill claim that releasing personal tax returns  is needed to prove the Presidential mandatory audit process works. It  does not.   Congress should oversee the Presidential mandatory audit process to  ensure it does work correctly; but this invasion of privacy does not do  that.   Another point, the Presidential mandatory audit process is completely  separate from the voluntary release of tax returns done by seven of the  last nine Presidents.   Democrats have supercharged the IRS weapon to not only go after  political enemies, but their spouses and minor children, too. Minor  children aren't even exempt from the Democrats' desire to take down  their opponents.   Regardless of one's political preferences or attitudes toward a  former President, every American should be vehemently opposed to this  un-American attack on privacy, and I urge my colleagues to vote ``no.''    Madam Speaker, I yield myself 20 seconds to note that  every year of President Trump's tax returns are under audit.   Madam Speaker, I include in the Record an article explaining the  purpose of the taxpayer privacy law the Democrats have dismantled this  week, exposing all Americans to political attack via tax information.                      [From the Lawfare, Dec. 2, 2022]     House Democrats Can Release Trump's Tax Returns. But Should They?                            (By Daniel J. Hemel)         Now that a House committee has obtained access to six years       of former President Trump's tax returns, congressional       Democrats face an easy question and a harder one.        The easy question is whether, as a matter of law, the House       Ways and Means Committee--which gained access to the former       president's tax filings after the Supreme Court dismissed       Trump's last-ditch bid to block the Internal Revenue Service       from handing over the documents--can make Trump's returns       public before Republicans take control of the chamber on Jan.       3. The answer to that question is straightforwardly yes.        The harder question is whether, as a normative matter, the       committee ought to make Trump's returns public in the waning       weeks of the Democratic majority.        On the one hand, Trump's tax filings should have seen the       light of day long ago. Trump should have released his returns       voluntarily--as every elected president since Richard Nixon       has. The Trump administration should have allowed the IRS to       hand the president's tax returns over to the House Ways and       Means Committee when that panel's chair, Rep. Richard Neal       (D-Mass.), requested those documents in April 2019. And the       federal judiciary shouldn't have allowed Trump to stall the       release of his returns for three and a half years through       litigation.        On the other hand, the Ways and Means Committee has       maintained throughout the litigation over Trump's tax       returns--which culminated with last week's Supreme Court       decision--that it is seeking the documents as part of its       plan to review the IRS's presidential audit program. (The       presidential audit program is the procedure--mentioned in an       IRS manual but not codified in any statute or regulation--by       which the IRS examines individual tax returns filed by the       president and vice president each year.) Any review of the       presidential audit program that starts now and ends when the       GOP takes control of the House in January would be slapdash       and superficial. If Democrats on the House Ways and Means       Committee rushed to release Trump's returns in the lameduck       session--without conducting the comprehensive review of the       presidential audit program that they promised--it would look       like their stated motive for seeking the documents was       indeed, as Trump has alleged, pretextual.        Fortunately, the Senate Finance Committee--which will       remain under Democratic leadership in the next Congress--has       both the resources and the apparent inclination to conduct       the comprehensive review of the presidential audit program       that House Democrats initially set out to undertake. So even       if the House Ways and Means Committee doesn't release Trump's       tax returns this month, the likely consequence is not that       Trump's returns will remain under wraps forever. The Senate       Finance Committee will be able to obtain the returns itself,       and that committee then can release return information that       is relevant to its review of the presidential audit program.  [[Page H9997]]         Full disclosure: I've been advocating for the release of       President Trump's tax information since April 2017, when I       suggested in a Washington Post op-ed and a Yale Law Journal       Forum article that New York could enact a law requiring the       release of Trump's state tax filings. I've advised state       lawmakers in New York on strategies to make Trump's tax       returns public. I've criticized House Ways and Means Chairman       Neal for acting too slowly to obtain Trump's returns. So I'm       no apologist for Trump's tax secrecy.        Still, it's important that Democrats on the House Ways and       Means Committee remain true to their word. Chairman Neal said       his committee needed Trump's tax returns to evaluate the       extent to which the IRS audits and enforces federal tax laws       against the president. To turn around now and release Trump's       returns--outside the context of a thorough evaluation of the       IRS's presidential audit program--would make the stated       rationale look much like a head fake. That would seem       especially gratuitous given that the Senate Finance Committee       stands ready, willing, and able to carry out its own review       of the presidential audit program.   The Easy Question: Can House Democrats Make Trump's Tax Returns Public?         The law is clear that the House Ways and Means Committee       can now make Trump's tax returns public if a majority of the       committee members vote to do so.        The relevant statute, Section 6103(f) of the Internal       Revenue Code, instructs the IRS to release otherwise-      confidential tax returns or return information to three       congressional tax committees--the Senate Finance Committee,       the House Ways and Means Committee, and the Joint Committee       on Taxation--upon written request from the chair of any of       those panels. The statute also instructs the IRS to release       returns or return information to other congressional       committees under a narrower set of circumstances.        The key language regarding the receiving committee's       confidentiality obligations lies in Section 6103(f)(4). That       paragraph says that any return or return information obtained       by the Senate Finance Committee, House Ways and Means       Committee, or Joint Committee on Taxation ``may be submitted       by the committee to the Senate or the House of       Representatives, or to both.'' It goes on to say that any       return or return information obtained by another committee       ``may be submitted by the committee to the Senate or the       House of Representatives, or to both, except that any return       or return information which can be associated with, or       otherwise identify, directly or indirectly, a particular       taxpayer, shall be furnished to the Senate or the House of       Representatives only when sitting in closed executive session       unless such taxpayer otherwise consents in writing to such       disclosure'' (emphasis added).        Some textualist judges and justices are fond of the Latin       phrase ``expressio unius est exclusio alterius'': the       expression of one thing is the exclusion of the other. But       one doesn't need to be a textualist--or a classicist--to       recognize the importance of the contrast between the two       submission provisions. Absent the taxpayer's consent, other       committees can submit returns to the full Senate or House       ``only when sitting in closed executive session.'' The Senate       Finance Committee, House Ways and Means Committee, and Joint       Committee on Taxation can submit returns to the full Senate       or House without condition.        Judge Trevor McFadden of the U.S. District Court for the       District of Columbia reached the same conclusion in his       December 2021 decision rejecting Trump's bid to block the IRS       from releasing his returns. ``It might not be right or wise       to publish the returns,'' McFadden wrote, but the House Ways       and Means Committee has the ``right to do so.'' And if the       House Ways and Means Committee exercises that right with       respect to Trump's returns, its action wouldn't be       unprecedented: In 2014, the House Ways and Means Committee       published return information regarding 51 taxpayers as part       of its investigation into allegations that the IRS had       discriminated against conservative nonprofit organizations       seeking tax exempt status.        In the definitive scholarly treatment of Section 6103(f),       longtime University of Virginia law professor George Yin, who       served as chief of staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation       from 2003 to 2005, concludes that the choice to allow the       three tax committees to publish private tax information was a       ``conscious decision'' by Congress. Prior to 1976, Yin       explains, the president--along with the three congressional       tax committees--had statutory authority to make return       information public. A 1976 amendment eliminated the       president's authority to publicize return information but       preserved the power of the three tax committees. ``Congress       no doubt felt compelled in 1976 to preserve some outlet for       Congressional disclosures to the public,'' Yin writes, and it       ``was natural to give this authority to the tax committees.''        On top of all this, the Speech and Debate Clause immunizes       lawmakers from liability for statements they make in       committee and on the House or Senate floor. So even if it       weren't for Section 6103(f)(4), a Ways and Means Committee       member could--without legal consequence--read Trump's tax       returns aloud, line by line, with the C-SPAN cameras rolling.       But House Democrats don't need to rely on constitutional       super-immunity here: The relevant statutory provisions       clearly empower the Ways and Means Committee to enter Trump's       tax returns into the public domain.     The Hard Question: Should House Democrats Make Trump's Tax Returns                                  Public?         Before delving into the normative question of whether the       House Ways and Means Committee ought to publish Trump's tax       returns, let's clear three points out of the way.        First, presidents ought to release their tax returns.       Disclosure of presidential tax returns helps to dispel the       pernicious notion that taxpaying is only for the ``little       people.'' Disclosure also helps voters and lawmakers evaluate       presidential conflicts of interest (for example, by revealing       whether presidents would benefit personally from their       administrations' tax proposals). Finally, disclosure serves       as a check on improper presidential influence over the IRS.       By virtue of their position at the apex of the executive       branch, presidents are the nation's tax enforcers-in-chief,       but they are also taxpayers against whom the federal tax laws       may be enforced. Disclosure helps to reduce the risk that       presidents will exploit their dual roles to their own       pecuniary advantage.        Second, the Trump administration should have allowed the       IRS to release Trump's tax returns to the House Ways and       Means Committee when Chairman Neal requested those returns in       April 2019. Section 6103(f)'s instructions are clear: ``Upon       written request from the chairman of the Committee on Ways       and Means'' or the chair of the other congressional tax       panels, the treasury secretary (or the IRS commissioner as       the secretary's delegee) ``shall furnish such committee with       any return or return information specified in such request''       (emphasis added). The statute makes no exception for cases in       which disclosure might embarrass the president. And while       case law suggests that the executive branch may reject an       information request from Congress if the request does not       further a ``legitimate task of Congress,'' Neal's April 2019       request manifestly stated a legitimate basis: so that his       committee could conduct oversight of the IRS's presidential       audit program and, if needed, consider legislative reforms       related to presidential audits.        Third, the litigation over Neal's April 2019 request       shouldn't have dragged on for as long as it did. It was       nearly three and a half years ago--in July 2019--when the       House Ways and Means Committee first asked a D.C. federal       district court to order the IRS to hand over Trump's returns.       The lengthy delay in resolving that litigation meant that       Trump could effectively evade congressional oversight of the       presidential audit program for the duration of his term.       Fault for the delay lies at the feet of multiple people-and       Neal himself bears some culpability for waiting until April       2019 to submit his request and until July 2019 to file his       lawsuit rather than seeking the returns immediately after       Democrats took control of the House in January of that year.       However one allocates blame, though, it shouldn't take three       and a half years for the federal courts to confirm that the       word ``shall'' in Section 6103(f) really means ``shall.''        But here we are in December 2022, and over the course of       the three-and-a-half-year fight over Trump's returns, Neal       and other members of the House Ways and Means Committee made       several statements that constrain their options now. In the       initial April 2019 letter requesting Trump's returns, Neal       said his committee needed the documents ``to determine the       scope'' of the IRS's audit of the president ``and whether it       includes a review of underlying business activities required       to be reported on the individual income tax return.'' As       recently as last month, the Ways and Means Committee told the       Supreme Court that its document request ``is well-tailored to       illuminating how the IRS conducted any audits of Mr. Trump       while he was President and whether reforms are needed to       enhance the IRS's ability to audit Presidents in the       future.'' Throughout the litigation, Neal and the House Ways       and Means Committee adamantly denied that ``the request is       driven by exposure solely for the sake of exposure'' (as       Trump had argued). In a June 2021 letter to Treasury       Secretary Janet Yellen and IRS Commissioner Charles Rettig,       Neal put it succinctly: ``There have been claims''--including       from Trump himself--``that the true and sole purpose of the       Committee's inquiry here is to expose President Trump's tax       returns. These claims are wrong.''        Plainly, the House Ways and Means Committee is not going to       be able to carry out a thorough evaluation of the IRS 's       presidential audit program in the four and a half weeks       between now and the GOP takeover. The committee's document       request is extensive: It has asked for returns filed by Trump       and seven of his business entities from tax years 2015       through 2020, a status report for each audit, and       administrative files such as examiner workpapers associated       with each of the Trump returns. With competing demands for       the attention of committee members and staffers (including a       Dec. 16 deadline to avert a government shutdown), reviewing       those documents may consume the better part of the next four       and a half weeks. But even after the committee reviews all       those documents, it will still need more information before       it can complete the comprehensive assessment of the       presidential audit program that it has promised.        For example, the committee will need to know how the IRS's       handling of items on Trump's tax returns compares to the       service's treatment of similar items on returns filed by       other high-net-worth business owners who weren't president of       the United  [[Page H9998]]       States. If the IRS allowed Trump to claim an inflated       charitable contribution deduction for a conservation easement       at his golf course in Westchester County, New York, is that       because examiners gave special treatment to Trump, or is it       because the service generally lacks the resources to       challenge conservation easement appraisals? The committee       also will likely need to hear testimony from IRS examiners       involved in the presidential audit program. Did they       personally experience improper political influence? And the       committee will need to compare the audits of Trump's returns       to audits of other presidents and vice presidents. For       example, when Joe Biden became president, did the IRS go back       and review Biden's aggressive use of a self-employment tax       loophole to save hundreds of thousands of dollars on his and       his spouse Jill's 2017 and 2018 returns? While Biden--unlike       Trump--released his returns voluntarily, we don't know what       happened to those filings after they entered the IRS audit       vortex.        To be sure, the House Ways and Means Committee could begin       its review of the presidential audit program now and then       release everything it has when the clock strikes noon on Jan.       3, like a test-taking student who drops her pencil mid-      sentence when the proctor says ``time's up.'' Trump's tax       returns and additional information collected by the committee       would then enter the public domain, allowing journalists and       others to probe further. If Neal and the House Ways and Means       Committee had said all along that their purpose was to       vindicate the principle of presidential tax transparency       using the powers at their disposal under Section 6103(f),       perhaps that course of action would be justified. Indeed,       releasing Trump's tax returns for the sake of releasing       Trump's tax returns might not be such a bad thing--given all       the arguments for presidential tax transparency outlined       above.        Yet Neal and the House Ways and Means Committee insisted       all along that their motive was not exposure for the sake of       exposure. That was a strategically wise thing to say for       litigation purposes, but the statement circumscribes what       they can (or, at least, should) do next. Neal and the House       Ways and Means Committee would undermine their own       credibility--and could be seen as hoodwinking the courts and       the public--if they proceeded to release the returns outside       the context of a comprehensive review of the presidential       audit program.                          Can the Senate Take Over?         Enter stage left: the Senate Finance Committee. While the       Republicans who take control of the House Ways and Means       Committee in January are exceedingly unlikely to continue the       Democrats' inquiry, the Senate Finance Committee under the       leadership of Chairman Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) is quite capable of       conducting the comprehensive review of the presidential audit       program that House Democrats won't be able to complete. Wyden       will have to send his own written request to the IRS for       Trump's returns, but this shouldn't be much more than a       formality: Wyden could send the request this morning, and the       IRS could send the documents back this afternoon. There is no       requirement that Wyden or the IRS even inform Trump of the       request before the IRS fulfills it. By the time Trump could       file a lawsuit to stop the IRS from complying, Wyden already       would have the documents in hand. In any event, a lawsuit by       Trump to stop the IRS from fulfilling Wyden's request would       be frivolous given the D.C. Circuit's decision resolving the       issue in the House litigation--and almost certainly would be       dismissed much more quickly than Trump's earlier bid to block       the House.        Section 6103(f)(4) also allows Neal, as chair of the House       Ways and Means Committee, to appoint agents to examine the       returns that he has obtained through his request. In theory,       Neal could appoint Senate Finance Committee staffers--or       Chairman Wyden himself--as the House committee's agents. But       Neal's GOP successor as House Ways and Means chair could       revoke that appointment, ending the Senate's inquiry in       midstream. Thus, the better course of action is clearly for       Wyden to issue his own written request for the returns on the       Senate Finance Committee's behalf.        In sum, even as the window closes for the House Ways and       Means Committee to conduct a comprehensive review of the       presidential audit program, Congress still can comb through       Trump's tax returns and determine whether the IRS fairly and       fully audited the former president. It would be in a       different chamber of Congress--the Senate, not the House--but       Trump would nonetheless be subject to legislative branch       scrutiny.        Hopefully, House Democrats will recognize that deferring to       their Senate colleagues is preferable to reneging on their       own word and publishing Trump's returns outside the context       of the presidential audit program review that they promised.       If, instead, House Democrats release the returns now, Trump       and his supporters will charge Democrats with duplicity for       saying one thing in litigation and doing another thing       afterward--and the charge won't be entirely baseless. That       would, perversely, allow Trump to transform the matter of his       tax returns from a political vulnerability for him to a       potential liability for Democrats. And beyond questions of       political strategy, promise-keeping is--of course--an       important value in itself.        So yes, presidents should release their tax returns, but       that doesn't release House Democrats from the avowals about       their motives that they have made since 2019. In their last       weeks in the majority, House Democrats have another       opportunity to demonstrate why they deserve the nation's       trust. They should seize it--even if that means those of us       who have been waiting for years to know what's buried in       Trump's tax returns might have to wait a little longer.     Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1015     Madam Speaker, I include in the Record an August 2, 2022,  blog post from the Committee on Ways and Means titled: ``New Schumer- Manchin Bill Will Supercharge Long History of IRS Abuses.''   New Schumer-Manchin Bill Will Supercharge Long History of IRS Abuses,                              August 2, 2022.         Despite a long history of IRS abuses, Democrats have       revived their proposal to send 87,000 new IRS agents after       you and your family-owned business on the belief that       everyone is a tax cheat. The IRS has already been targeting       lower and middle income earners, yet Democrats want to hire       new IRS agents to audit individuals and small businesses.       They've also promised to revive their invasive bank       surveillance scheme.   democrats want to increase audits for all individuals by more than 1.2                             million per year:         A Senate Finance Committee analysis shows the $45.6 billion       for ``enforcement'' would ``predominantly hit taxpayers who       have low (or very low) Adjusted Gross Income. Nothing in the       proposal would change that fact.''        Nearly half of the audits would hit Americans making       $75,000 per year or less.        Low-income taxpayers making up to $25,000 per year would       see more audits too.        Despite a clear need for greater taxpayer customer service       amidst a historic tax return backlog, only $3.2 billion of       Democrats' $80 billion is earmarked for that purpose.        Supercharging the IRS will lay the groundwork for the       monitoring the Biden Administration has pledged to impose.       Top Biden officials have made clear they have not given up on       implementing IRS bank surveillance.    Overly broad IRS targeting spanning decades has claimed many victims,                   and Democrats are trying to revive it.         Former IRS official Lois Lerner apologized in 2013 that Tea       Party groups and other groups had been targeted for audits of       their applications for tax-exemption, which effectively       delayed that status until they could no longer take effective       part in the 2012 election. The Treasury Inspector General       found that ``Inappropriate Criteria Were Used to Identify       Tax-Exempt Applications for Review back in 2013.        In 1998, the Waslington Post reported that ``An Oklahoma       tax-return preparer, a Texas  [[Page H9999]]       oilman and a Virginia restaurateur told lawmakers how raiding       parties of armed agents from the IRS Criminal Investigation       Division barged into their homes or offices, frightened their       employees and families--and ultimately came up empty-      handed.''        ``Two of the men said they later found that former       employees had precipitated the raids, and that the IRS had       done little or no checking on their informants' credibility.        The third witness said he never could determine why he was       targeted.''        In 1997, CNN reported testimony from an expert that the IRS       was ``the best secret-keeping agency in our government today:       ``I discovered that the IRS does keep lists of American       citizens for no reason other than that their political       activities might have offended someone at the IRS; about how       the IRS believes that anyone who offers even legitimate       criticism of the tax collector is a tax protester; about how       the IRS shreds its paper trail, which means that there is no       history, no evidence and, ultimately, no accountability.''        Robert Schriebman, a tax professor at the University of       Southern California and author of eight books critical of IRS       practices and procedures, decried the agency's ability to       ignore citizens' due-process protections. ``The IRS can take       a taxpayer's home by just the signature of the district       director alone,'' he said.        These abuses led to numerous attempts at overhauling the       agency, and the latest still has not yet been implemented.     Irs agents have wrongly seized millions from small businesses when                           given the opportunity         In an apparent show of strength, past IRS actions led to       the seizure of more than $43 million from bank accounts of       hundreds of small businesses; the results of those actions in       a recent case led to local wedding dress shop being       permanently shut down.        Only after intense pressure from Congress did the IRS       return the money that had been taken to some of the       businesses, including a Maryland dairy farmer.   IRS political leaks have been a problem whenever Democrats have been in                              the White House         The last time President Biden was in the White House in       2011, Democrats pushed for billions more in enforcement       without providing clear, independent analysis supporting the       funding, relying on information provided by activist groups       aligned with their political objectives, and the IRS, which       stood to gain funding.        Prior to the 2021 leak, ProPublica previously received (and       published) leaked taxpayer information from the IRS in 2012       that just so happened to include critics of the Democrat       administration.      Political targeting By IRS threatens religious organizations and                               critics alike         The IRS initially denied a Christian organization tax-      exempt status because its emphasis on certain ``Bible       teachings are typically affiliated with the [Republican]       Party and candidates.''        This is particularly concerning given the agency's prior       history of targeting tax exempt groups for additional       scrutiny based on their perceived political affiliation.        Recently, Democrats in Congress asked the IRS to increase       scrutiny of groups seeking church status.                     IRS mismanagement is well documented         An audit of the IRS itself, conducted from FYs 2010-2012       and published in 2013 found ``inappropriate use of taxpayer       funds being spent on conferences and reviews selected       conferences to determine whether the conferences were       properly approved, and the expenditures were appropriated.''        Another audit in 2019 found that the IRS wasted millions of       dollars on software licenses it purchased but never used due       to mismanagement of IT contracts and systems updates.        Despite the Biden Administration's claim that more money       will increase IRS audits and increase revenue from wealthy       individuals and corporations, the Inspector General actually       found that after spending $22 million and 200 hours auditing       large businesses, the IRS was unsuccessful in bringing in       money to the Treasury from those audits nearly 50 percent of       the time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I include in the Record a 2017 House report  where the chairman said: ``Committee Democrats remain steadfast in our  pursuit to have [President Trump's] individual tax returns disclosed to  the public,'' which can be found at: https://www.congress.gov/ congressional-report/115th-congress/house-report/73/1    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I would note that, every year, President Trump's tax  returns were under audit and that the tradition of making Presidential  tax returns public is just that, a tradition, not a law, and unrelated  to the Presidential audit program.   I would also note that while I have loved serving with my colleagues  from Houston, I would note that they were among the very first Members  of Congress to introduce impeachment resolutions against this President  in the very first year of his Presidency, revealing that this is  political targeting and nothing else.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Madam Speaker, I include in the Record an October 2018 article, 4  years ago, from the San Francisco Chronicle, where the Honorable Nancy  Pelosi said to expect Democrats to immediately try to force President  Trump to release his tax returns if they take back the House in  November, exposing the true purpose of this effort.               [From the Bloomberg Government, Oct. 11, 2018]   SF Chronicle: Pelosi: Trump's Tax Returns are Fair Game if Democrats                                 Win House                            (By John Wildermuth)         Expect Democrats to immediately try to force President       Trump to release his tax returns if they take back the House       in November, Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said Wednesday.        Demanding the president's tax returns ``is one of the first       things we'd do--that's the easiest thing in the world. That's       nothing,'' Pelosi told The Chronicle's editorial board in an       hour-long interview.        Although a 1924 provision of the Internal Revenue Code       gives certain congressional committees the right to request--      and release--the tax records of even the president, it's       unlikely Trump would surrender those documents without an       all-out legal battle. He has refused to release his returns       since he announced he was running for president, arguing       first that he was being audited and later that voters don't       care.        The GOP-led Congress has joined in keeping those records       private, regularly voting down Democratic efforts to make       Trump turn them over.        Forcing Trump to release his returns would not necessarily       make them public, but would allow a Democratic-run       congressional committee to decide whether there is       information in those returns that needs to be investigated.        Whether that happens hinges on Democrats winning the House       or the Senate. With the Nov. 6 election less than four weeks       away, Pelosi sounded confident about both the House       Democrats' chances and her own political future.        ``I believe we would win if the election was today,'' she       said. And although more than 50 Democratic candidates have       said they wouldn't vote for Pelosi to lead the House, the San       Francisco Democrat said, ``I believe I will be speaker if we       win.''        Releasing the president's tax returns to a congressional       committee would not be revenge for the way Trump and GOP       leaders have treated the Democratic minority for the past two       years, but a simple matter of oversight by Congress, ``a co-      equal body of government,'' Pelosi said.        ``We have to have the truth,'' she said.        Payback isn't going to be part of a Democratic-led House,       Pelosi promised, pushing back against what she called the       ``pound of flesh crowd'' of Democrats eager to repay       Republicans for every political slight and attack since Trump       was elected.        ``We will seek bipartisanship where we can,'' Pelosi said.       ``One of the reasons we should win is that we're not like       them, and we're not going to be like them.''        The Democratic leader also says she doesn't have much       choice. No matter what happens on election day, Trump is       still going to be president and she will have to work with       him.        ``We need to get a signature, which requires some       bipartisanship, some common ground,'' Pelosi said, which she       admitted wasn't always easy.        ``I, probably more than most people do, respect the office       he serves in, probably more than he does,'' she said. ``But       he is the president--we have to find our common ground. . . .       We want to get results for the American people.''        But that's going to mean discussions and compromise, not       surrender, Pelosi said. Democrats ``will never negotiate away       our values,'' she said.        Pelosi is confident there are areas where Democrats can       reach agreement with Trump and Republicans, as they did when       Republican George W. Bush was president.        Despite disputes over the Iraq War and other issues, ``we       worked together, we disagree and we agreed, and that's the       marketplace of ideas that we live in,'' she said.        Areas where there could be common ground include national       infrastructure improvements, a plan for Dreamers,       undocumented residents who arrived in this country  [[Page H10001]]       as minors, and ways to curb gun violence, Pelosi said.        There's also public support for efforts to allow the       Department of Health and Human Services to negotiate for       lower drug prices, she added.        Pelosi also weighed in on some local issues, saying she       supported San Francisco's efforts to establish a safe       injection site for drug users, something Gov. Jerry Brown       vetoed last month. She also backed changes in federal       marijuana laws, although she admitted, ``I don't see this       president signing any such thing.''        But those concerns are far from the top of the Democrats'       ``to-do'' list if they take back the House. ``The first order       of business is the economic security of America's working       families--that is what people care about,'' Pelosi said.        For Pelosi, that concern connects directly with San       Francisco's Proposition C, which would tax large companies to       raise an estimated $300 million a year for homeless programs.        Pelosi said she supports the measure because it's something       the city needs to do. She acknowledged the opposition from       her political ally Mayor London Breed, who has said that       before the city pours millions of dollars more into homeless       programs, ``San Franciscans deserve accountability for the       money they are already paying.''        ``I don't disagree with the mayor that there should be       accountability and there should be a plan'' about how to use       the funds, Pelosi said. ``I have great confidence in the       mayor that she can handle it if Prop. C wins.''        Efforts to deal with social problems like homelessness,       hunger and housing insecurity require a new vision from       Congress, she said.        ``We have to think in a different way about it, and when we       think big, we have to put our hands in the pockets where the       money is,'' Pelosi said.        Homelessness ``is not an issue, it's a value. It's an ethic       that we have not properly addressed.''    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Madam Speaker, Nancy Pelosi is not alone. Democrat after Democrat on  this committee and in this Congress made it clear years ago that they  were targeting President Trump to try to force his tax returns to be  made public, even though the law doesn't require it at all and, as was  revealed in our committee hearing, it has nothing to do with the  Presidential audits.   In fact, in our markup, again and again, we heard from Members who  said we must force these private tax returns to be made public so we  can see his dealings, so we can see his taxes, so we can criticize.  Nothing to do with the Presidential audit process.   That is our concern today, that under the new standard that has been  set, and the Supreme Court has affirmed, two individuals in Congress,  the chairman of the Committee on Ways and Means and the chairman of  Senate Finance Committee, will have nearly unlimited power, with almost  any excuse, to obtain, to investigate, and to make public those very  private tax returns.   We are not alone in our concerns. Other scholars have made the point  that we have a voluntary tax system and that if Americans don't believe  and can't trust that their tax returns won't be kept private, if they  have to worry that if they end up on the enemy's list in Congress, that  they, too, can be a target. Under this new process and this new  standard, the privacy protections of the last half a century are gone.   My worry, and I think the worry of every Republican here, and I hope  some of our Democrat friends, as well, is that this will provide a  dangerous new political weapon that invites political retribution where  that cycle will continue and our politics will be worse, harsher,  uglier, and more divisive because of this action.   Again, at the end of the day, whether a President makes their tax  returns public or not, today it is not the law. While I would recommend  it for all, the truth of the matter is, at the end of the day, this is  political targeting. It can be applied not just to the President but to  every American.   I am worried that it is not just public officials at risk. It is  private citizens. It could be supporters. It could be business or labor  leaders. It could be the Supreme Court that someone seeks to  delegitimize. That is our concern here.   This is why we are fighting this fight as Republicans, to protect the  privacy of every American, to make sure they are not targeted by  partisans in Congress.   I will tell you, I am very worried that every chairman of those two  committees will face incredible pressure to target Americans, political  enemies, and opponents, and I don't think we should ever go down that  road. Regrettably, we are, and that is why we are here.   I have respected Chairman Neal for many years and treasure our  working relationship and the accomplishments we have done. I will miss  you, friend.   Before we conclude today, I want to say a special thank-you to  several members of the Committee on Ways and Means Republican staff who  have worked so hard on this issue for years: Sean Clerget, Derek  Theurer, Caroline Jones, Molly Fromm, Brittany Havens, Paige Decker,  J.P. Freire, and, of course, the remarkable staff director of the  Committee on Ways and Means Republicans, Gary Andres. He has done a  great job for this committee and this country.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
