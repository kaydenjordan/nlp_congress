 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 533, I call up  the bill (H.R. 2792) to amend the Social Security Act to make certain  revisions to provisions limiting payment of benefits to fugitive felons  under titles II, VIII, and XVI of the Social Security Act, and ask for  its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous materials on the bill currently under  consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2792, the Control of Unlawful  Fugitive Felons Act of 2017. In 1996, Congress and President Clinton  worked together to reform welfare and reignite the American Dream for  families in need.   Aligned with this goal was a provision prohibiting a range of welfare  benefits--including Supplemental Security Income--to fugitive felons  and violators of probation and parole because safety net programs need  to be protected from abuse so they can remain in place for those  individuals who need them.   Individuals who evade justice violate the social contract that grants  them this safety net. Simply put, it is incoherent and self-defeating  that a nation of laws would pay a wanted person and prolong their  flight from justice. Unfortunately, due to a number of factors  involving the courts, these provisions have been watered down in recent  years and rendered ineffectual.   Through the CUFF Act, Congress can stand up, once again, on behalf of  our communities and affirm what every participant in our society should  understand: if you have an outstanding warrant for your arrest, you  have an obligation to face justice or clear your name.   This legislation not only stops benefits from going to those who are  not following the law, but it also helps law enforcement apprehend  those suspects. A 2007 report by SSA's inspector general found that  this policy aided law enforcement in apprehending almost 60,000  individuals who were evading arrest for outstanding warrants. In fact,  law enforcement thinks this policy is so effective that the Fraternal  Order of Police, the National Sheriffs' Association, and the South  Dakota Sheriffs' Association have expressed support for the CUFF Act.   Unfortunately, despite the fact that this commonsense bill is  endorsed by law enforcement and has a proven track record of success, I  anticipate that my colleagues across the aisle may try to convince you  otherwise.   I have heard many of their arguments when the Ways and Means  Committee considered this bill and when the Rules Committee also  considered this bill.   So let's take each of those concerns in turn.   Some may say that this is an old, failed policy.   In reality, this policy has a long track record of success. In 2015,  the Social Security inspector general said, at a hearing, that this  bill would stop hundreds of millions of dollars in payments to  individuals with felony warrants.   Some may say this bill targets people with outdated warrants.   In reality, SSA already has a wide authority to exempt individuals if  the alleged offense is nonviolent and not drug related.                                time  0930    Some may say that this bill would throw beneficiaries off the rolls  with no warning. In reality, the SSA provides beneficiaries advance  notice of 35 days before suspending SSI benefits, and there is a robust  appeal process for recipients who have had their benefits suspended.   Some may say that this policy is burdensome to law enforcement. In  reality, this bill is supported by the Fraternal Order of Police, the  National Sheriffs' Association, and the South Dakota Sheriffs'  Association because it helps them do their job to locate individuals.   Finally, some may raise concerns that it targets minority populations  caught up in overcriminalization or overly harsh sentencing. To those  concerns, I say that these issues are absolutely important, and I look  forward to us having those conversations about criminal justice reforms  here in Congress. However, that conversation is outside the scope of  the legislation that we have before us today.   My legislation does not speak to the content of a warrant, just the  fact that one exists. The decision to grant a warrant is made by a  judge in a court of law, not by the Social Security Administration. It  should not be the duty of the American taxpayer to subsidize  individuals who are wanted by the police.   Simply put, Mr. Speaker, if an individual has an outstanding warrant,  it must be addressed and cleared. This bill does nothing to change  that.   Under my bill, nobody will lose their SSI benefits because of  misdemeanor offenses such as merely having a parking ticket, petty  theft, or even driving under the influence. This bill stops payments to  individuals who have outstanding warrants for felonies. These are  crimes like murder, rape, and kidnapping. It also stops payments to  individuals with probation and parole violations, limiting their  ability to evade arrest.   Supplemental Security Income is a lifeline to those who are in need.  We must ensure we are not further facilitating criminal activity in  communities that are all too often already struggling.   Mr. Speaker, I am grateful for the time that we are spending to  consider this important legislation, and I appreciate the opportunity  to stand in support of my bill today.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record two letters of  support. One is from the over 330,000 members of the National Fraternal  Order of Police, and the other is from the National Sheriffs'  Association.                             National Fraternal Order of Police,                                      Washington, DC, June 29, 2017.      Hon. Kristi L. Noem,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Samuel R. Johnson,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representatives Noem and Johnson: I am writing on       behalf of the members of the Fraternal Order of Police to       advise you of our support for H.R. 2792, the ``Control       Unlawful Fugitive Felons (CUFF) Act.''        In August 1996, President Clinton signed the Personal       Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act into       law, which restricted the eligibility of fugitive felons, and       probation and parole violators for Social Security benefits.       The Social Security Administration's Office of the Inspector       General (OIG) reported that this law has contributed to over       59,000 arrests since the inception of the program in 1996.        However, three different court decisions have eroded the       law's effectiveness and the original intent of Congress,       allowing fugitives to continue to collect benefits while on       the run. This legislation will restore the original intent of       the law by prohibiting an individual who is the subject of an       outstanding arrest warrant for a felony or parole violation       from receiving Social Security benefits.        The legislation will apply only to felony charges and amend       the Social Security Act to make clear that the suspension of       benefits is not just in cases of ``escape, flight to avoid       prosecution, or confinement, and flight-escape.'' The       American taxpayer should not be forced to support those who       are evading justice.        On behalf of the more than 330,000 members of the Fraternal       Order of Police, thank you for your support for law       enforcement. If I can be of any further assistance, please do       not hesitate to contact me or Jim Pasco, my Senior Advisor,       in my Washington office.            Sincerely,                                                  Chuck Canterbury,      National President.                                   ____                                   National Sheriffs' Association,                                      Alexandria, VA, June 20, 2017.      Hon. Dave Reichert,      Chairman, Subcommittee on Trade, Committee on Ways and Means,           House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Reichert: On behalf of the National Sheriffs'       Association, I write today to endorse H.R. 2792, the       ``Control Unlawful Fugitive Felons (CUFF) Act.'' Too often,       criminal felons receive federal benefits they are not       entitled to collect. We believe this clarifying legislation       will help remediate this recurring problem and strike the       right balance.        The bill does a number of important things including:       amending the Social Security Act to prohibit an individual       who is the subject of an outstanding arrest warrant for a       felony or parole violation from receiving Social Security       Benefits; restoring the original intent of the 1996 law,       revising current law to discontinue benefits for individuals       who are ``the subject of an arrest warrant . . .'' compared       to the previous language of ``fleeing to avoid'' arrest,       which was the main legal challenge; and applying only to       felony charges, or a crime carrying a minimum term of one or       more years in prison. This policy does not intend to punish       individuals convicted of misdemeanors, such as outstanding       parking tickets, as some have alleged.        Like you, I believe this is a commonsense bill that will       give more Americans piece of mind in knowing that tax dollars       aren't supporting criminal activity through continued       benefits to those breaking the law. I applaud your efforts on       this issue and look forward to working with you to ensure the       passage of this key legislation.            Sincerely,                                              Jonathan F. Thompson,                                        Executive Director and CEO.     Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I want to clarify exactly what this legislation does.   This legislation will take SSI benefits from individuals and stop  those payments to those who have felony arrest warrants or who have  violated their probation and parole.   I want to go through the process so that everybody recognizes that  there is plenty of time for individuals to go through the appeal  process. Notice is given if there is a warrant that they need to get  rectified with the jurisdiction that has authority. So let me step  through this process.   Step one is through the Office of Inspector General. Law enforcement  agencies give OIG information about individuals who have outstanding  felony arrest warrants or who are violating conditions of probation or  parole.   Then OIG compares this information to its computer files of  individuals receiving these dollars or serving as representative  payees. If there is a match, OIG verifies the identity of the  individual, ensures that the warrants for the individual are still  active, works with local law enforcement to attempt to locate the  person, and then OIG refers the cases to SSA to begin the suspension  process.   When this process gets to the Social Security Administration, SSA  sends an advance notice to the individual. This notice proposes the  suspension of benefit payments and informs the individual of their  right to appeal the suspension decision, payment continuation, and the  timeframe to take such actions after receiving the advance notice.                                time  0945    This notice includes why the SSA is suspending benefits and where,  why, and when the warrant was issued. If SSA finds out, through a data  match, 35 days is given for the individual to protest. If the  individual protests, SSA will not suspend benefits until it figures out  if the individual qualifies for a good cause exception. If the  individual does not appeal his or her advance notice, then the SSA will  suspend the benefits.   If the individual does appeal and gives his or her advance notice and  provides evidence for the payment continuation, the SSA verifies the  evidence and then continues the payments.   Other things that we should know about this legislation and what this  includes is that warrants may only be resolved in the issuing  jurisdiction. Grounds for dismissal of a warrant include identity  theft, administrative error, and the individual's own move from the  jurisdiction, especially if low income.   Warrants for misdemeanors remain warrants for misdemeanors and cannot  become felonies. There is also latitude for the Commissioner to make  decisions in special areas where there may be something to be  considered, such as dementia or low-income abilities.   Mr. Speaker, this bill has been thoroughly vetted. We are making sure  that the only people who are denied their SSI benefits are those who  have felony warrants for their arrest or have violated probation or  parole and have not gotten straight with law enforcement and rectified  that past infraction.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I live in the State of South Dakota. I have some of the  poorest counties in the Nation in my State, and they happen to be my  Native American Tribes. They face 80 to 90 percent unemployment,  poverty like no other place in the country, and they are isolated. They  also have very high drug and crime rates.   In fact, we have seen a record number of murders in these  communities, especially on the Pine Ridge Reservation, in this calendar  year, and it is deeply discouraging and disheartening to me to think of  someone who could have committed a murder in one of my communities in  the State of South Dakota, that there is a felony warrant out for their  arrest, and that we may not be able to find them. This bill will fix  that situation.   If that individual is receiving SSI payments, that helps law  enforcement locate those individuals who have gone out and committed  crimes against innocent people. Rape, murder, kidnapping, they all  happen in my Native  [[Page H7598]]  American Tribes, and this helps law enforcement find them and bring  them to justice. It is one of the important things that this  legislation will help us do in some of our most vulnerable communities.   I also recognize that the previous speaker talked about the fact that  we need criminal justice reforms, and that is a very good debate that  we should be having in Congress. But this is not the bill to talk about  criminal justice reforms because this is not germane to the discussion  that we are having today.   I wanted to speak for a minute on what is good cause because there is  latitude for good cause within statute today, and I think there is some  confusion as to exactly how this bill would be interpreted when it is  signed into law.   In some cases, the SSI will not suspend or seek an overpayment of  payments for good cause exceptions. There are two types of good cause  exceptions that already exist in statute. The mandatory good cause  exception is the SSA cannot suspend payments if a court has found an  individual not guilty or has dismissed charges. If a court has vacated  the warrant or issued any similar exoneration, then they cannot suspend  payments. They also cannot suspend payments if there is a mistaken  identity due to identity fraud.   The other exception in statute today is discretionary good cause  exceptions. The SSA may suspend benefits for mitigating circumstances  under two options:   Option A is the individual must prove that the criminal offense was  nonviolent and not drug related. We also have that the individual has  not been convicted of a felony crime since the warrant was issued, and  the other point is that the law enforcement agency that issued the  warrant reports that it will not act on the warrant. That is other  exceptions for good cause.   Option B, the individual must prove all of these factors: if the  criminal offense was nonviolent and not drug related; the individual  has not been convicted of a felony crime since the warrant was issued;  the warrant is the existing warrant and was issued 10 or more years ago  and the individual lacks the mental capacity to resolve the warrant,  which includes those living in a nursing home or mental treatment  facility.    So as we have listened to opponents of this bill talk, they have  discussed all of these issues as to how these benefits could be taken  away from individuals that are clearly covered by good cause exceptions  that are already in statute, and those situations are not relevant to  the debate that we are having today.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, taxpayers should not be subsidizing those who have  felony warrants for their arrest or violating parole and probation.   I wanted to remind everyone today that in 1996, the same provision  was amended into other programs that we have at the Federal Government  level. Temporary Assistance for Needy Families--cash welfare--has these  same provisions included in that program.   Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program--SNAP or food stamps--has  these same provisions in the program. Housing programs, such as public  housing, Section 8 vouchers, project-based Section 8, all have these  same provisions in that program.   In addition, there are similar provisions added to Social Security  disability and retirement programs, and the Department of Veterans  Affairs benefits has this same provision that we are putting back into  statute today when it comes to SSI payments.   Mr. Speaker, you can clearly see that this is bringing this program  up to the same level of accountability to taxpayers and not subsidizing  those who commit crimes against innocent individuals, and is an  entirely appropriate debate here today.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Nebraska (Mr. Smith), the chairman of the Subcommittee on Human  Resources. I thank him for his leadership on this issue.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I just want to remind everyone that the bill we are debating here  today would suspend SSI benefits for those who have felony warrants for  their arrest and those who have violated probation or parole. That is  the discussion that we are having here today. And let's go back over,  in summary, what the policy actually does and says.   This policy should not be thought of in isolation. This is part of a  larger effort to reauthorize the evidence-based, outcome-focused  Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting program.   H.R. 2824, which passed this Chamber on Tuesday, will be joined with  this bill upon passage. It helps to improve the lives of families in  at-risk communities, focusing on the first years of a child's life.   Unlike most Federal social programs, MIECHV funding is tied to real  results, which ensures limited taxpayer dollars are actually delivering  the intended results and helping those that are most in need.   Under current law, the program is 100 percent federally funded, but  H.R. 2824 introduces a Federal match similar to what States must  already do in other social programs, such as foster care,  [[Page H7600]]  Medicaid, child support enforcement, childcare, and others. The rest of  the package ensures this program remains a shining example of evidence- based policy by expecting the program to continue to demonstrate  effective outcomes. That reauthorization is fully offset by the bill  that we are considering here today, H.R. 2792.   Instead of focusing on our Nation's debt, we should be doing more of  what we are doing right here in these bills: prioritizing Federal  spending and focusing on what works by improving the integrity of one  program to provide funding for another.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no other speakers, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, in closing, the CUFF Act is commonsense. The American  taxpayer should not subsidize individuals who are fleeing from law  enforcement.   Because the Social Security Administration already possesses in place  processes that will ensure due process and protect beneficiaries,  claims about this bill are overblown and, quite frankly, they are  wrong.   I am proud that this bill is supported by the Fraternal Order of  Police, the National Sheriffs' Association, and the South Dakota  Sheriffs' Association.   I urge my colleagues to support this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
