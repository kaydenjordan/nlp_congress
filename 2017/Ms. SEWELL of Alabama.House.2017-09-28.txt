 Mr. Speaker, today I rise in opposition to  H.R. 2792, the misleadingly titled Control Unlawful Fugitive Felons Act  of 2017, which would prohibit the payment of Supplemental Security  Income benefits to anyone with an unresolved arrest warrant for an  alleged violation of a condition of probation or parole or an alleged  felony offense.   H.R. 2792's title falsely claims to target fugitive felons. In fact,  fugitive felons are already prohibited from receiving benefits under  current law. If this bill were enacted, some of our country's most  vulnerable low-income seniors and disabled Americans, who are neither  fugitives nor felons, would not be able to get their SSI benefits.   While proponents of H.R. 2792 continue to claim that the bill only  targets violent fugitive felons, H.R. 2792 threatens many other  individuals, like those who received arrest warrants because of an  inability to pay court fines or fees. Just last week, the United States  Commission on Civil Rights published a report, titled, ``Targeted Fines  and Fees Against Low-Income Communities of Color: Civil Rights and  Constitutional Implications,'' which found that many local  jurisdictions rely on court fees or other fines to support their  municipal budgets, including fees charged to those under court  supervision.   Some of the people charged with these fees are elderly or disabled  SSI beneficiaries who are unable to work and have no way to pay court  costs. When they cannot pay, a warrant is routinely issued for their  arrest. If this bill were enacted, these people would lose their SSI  benefits, which is the only source of income for many of these low- income disabled individuals.   During the markup of H.R. 2792, I offered a commonsense amendment  which would have prevented SSI benefits from being cut off if the  result would be the loss of benefits for individuals whose arrest  warrants were issued for nonpayment of court costs. Unfortunately, my  Republican colleagues rejected the amendment, as well as all other  Democratic amendments to this bill.   I stand united with over 119 national, State, and local organizations  who oppose efforts to cut SSI benefits, and I urge opposition to the  final passage of this bill.   Further, I would like to go on the record to say that we should have  a clean reauthorization of the Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood  Home Visiting program, MIECHV, which expires on September 30. The  majority's decision to tie home visiting to this harmful cut for our  most vulnerable citizens only makes this harder to accomplish.   MIECHV programs are proven programs, evidence-based programs that  work. We actually should reauthorize these programs, but we should not  tie it to this horrible bill.   Mr. Speaker, I urge opposition to the bill.                                time  1015
