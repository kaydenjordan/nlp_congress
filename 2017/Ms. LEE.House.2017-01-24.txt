 Madam Speaker, I want to thank the gentlewoman for yielding  and for her tireless work and leadership on behalf of women's health.   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 7. This  discriminatory bill would undermine a woman's access to abortion care,  which is a constitutional right as affirmed by Roe v. Wade, 44 years  ago, by making the Hyde amendment permanent. This bill would restrict  access to reproductive health care for millions of women and  disproportionately harm low-income women and women of color.   As if this isn't enough, H.R. 7 comes on the heels of a dramatic  expansion of the global gag rule which denies lifesaving health care to  women around the world; not to mention continuous Republican attacks on  contraceptive access, comprehensive sex education, and Planned  Parenthood.   Madam Speaker, when I was a staffer on Capitol Hill when the Hyde  amendment was passed, I remember the days very clearly of back-alley  abortions.   Clearly, Republicans are trying to take us back to the days when  women died from unsafe abortions in this country.   That is why I offered an amendment that would have recognized that  women--not employers or politicians--have the right to make their own  reproductive health choices.   Shamefully, the Rules Committee refused to make it in order and allow  for a debate.   Madam Speaker, women should be able to make their own decisions about  reproductive health care, including abortions, without Members of  Congress or employers interfering.
