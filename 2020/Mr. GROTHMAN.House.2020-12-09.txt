 Mr. Speaker, we just wrapped up an election here, and  we were told this election was about hatred and bias. I don't really  know any haters on my campaign, and I don't think there is this huge  amount of bias, in general, in this country that some people tried to  make this election about.   Recently, I did have a woman come up to me from my district talking  about real bias and perhaps hatred in America. She talked about her  children who went to college. Her and her husband got married before  they had children, and both worked hard and made an average income.  Both of her kids had about 30 or $40,000 in student loan debt, and she  had good kids who were working hard to pay off that debt.   But she felt that if her and her husband had not gotten married, the  government probably would have given them something they couldn't get  as married and working people. Her kids may have gotten $30,000 plus in  Pell Grants, and they were probably eligible for other grants. At least  in the State of Wisconsin you would receive similar State grants, as  well as be eligible for a work study program.   Unfortunately, her kids were not eligible for that, and at least she  feels they are being significantly discriminated against, and hatred is  being displayed by the American Government. Here is real hatred and  real bias.   Is she right? Is there really U.S. Government hatred and bias against  people who got married?   How did this happen? I have talked about this issue before, and  people imply that maybe it happened by mistake, not just the Pell Grant  program, but other government assistance programs just inadvertently  sprung up and punished people who got married.   However, in this election I had a little bit of an eye-opener.   In this election we had Black Lives Matter get involved. If you read  the website, which was eventually scrubbed or taken down in part about  two months ago with a month left to go in the campaign, on its website  it said, first of all, two of its three co-founders were trained  Marxists, and secondly, it said one of their goals was to disrupt the  western-prescribed nuclear family structure.   First of all, I think they are a little bit historically inaccurate.  I think there are all sorts of cultures in the world, other than just  European cultures, in which you have a wife and a husband and kids. But  nevertheless, they clearly consider it a problem. And it doesn't  surprise me that this group would have this on their website that they  consider it a problem, since they were founded by two Marxists.   And when I think of Marxists, I think of three things: First of all,  of course, I think of Socialism and the fact that government should own  everything, and we shouldn't have lots of different people own lots of  different businesses or different rental units or what have you. They  want everything controlled by the government.   The other two things I always think of when I think of Marxism is:  First of all, they hate God. And whether you are talking about  countries in which Marxists take over, be it Red China, Vietnam,  Russia, they follow Karl Marx in saying abolition of religion is  demanded for the true happiness of people. So when I associate Marxism  and people associating with such a group, I associate the hatred for  God.   But the other thing we have got to remember is Karl Marx himself was  very antifamily, and that is why I assume on the website it appeared  that Black Lives Matter wants to disrupt the western-prescribed nuclear  family.   So here is a group that I am sure cheers programs which penalizes  people who are married and discriminates in favor of people who aren't  married. And to my surprise, people did not run from this group.   To me, every politician should say for some groups, I am not going to  ask for your help. Years ago, when I was in the State legislature, I  fought the drug companies who I think are over-drugging our kids. I  fought the drug companies who I think were prescribing too  [[Page H7059]]  many opiates, which were leading to deaths, and so, I don't take money  from the prescription drug companies. I don't take money from the  payday lenders because I think it is a horrible service, and they rip  people off. I have known people who got cancer. I don't take money from  the cigarette companies.   So you don't have to take support from everybody who is willing to  support you. But when Black Lives Matter puts on their website, we  disrupt the western-prescribed nuclear family, and we have an American  government right now which, to me, is discriminating against couples  who are married, you have to wonder, was this by chance, or are these  people who want to set up government programs to discriminate against  families?                                time  1130    I would like to give people a chance to publicize this problem in  hearings and see if there's something we can do about this problem.   So I have asked the chairman of the Education and Labor Committee,  which has something to do with programs like Pell grants, to have a  hearing and see whether my constituent is right: Are we really, in the  United States Government, expressing strong bias against couples who  are married, and penalizing them?   I have forwarded a request like this to the chairman of the  committee.   I think it is a problem that has been out there ever since Lyndon  Johnson, in the 1960s, began his war on the family.   I personally think he was the worst President in this country's  history, and it is not just because he declared war on the family. He  did a bad job in prosecuting the Vietnam war, his personal life was a  hodgepodge, but of all the bad things he did, I think his programs  aimed at destroying the family was the worst thing.   So I guess to illustrate that Members of the other party are also a  little bit concerned about these programs that penalize what they refer  to as the traditional western family, though it is the traditional  family used by people who are not western European at all, I would like  to ask for such a hearing.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to be removed as a  cosponsor of H.R. 1434.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the Representative from Colorado  for putting together this fine ceremony for National Bible Week.   Mr. Speaker, it is kind of fitting that we be here on the floor of  the Congress. I am not sure how many people realize, in this day in  which so many people run from the Bible, the degree to which the Bible  itself had such a great influence on the building we stand in and in  the room we stand in right here.   Look in front of us: ``In God We Trust.''   For people who aren't aware back home, around us we have the reliefs  of 23 wise men: Mason, Hannibal, Justinian, Hammurabi, Solon. But the  one who gets the greatest place of honor behind us here is that of  Moses, who, of course, wrote the first five books of the Bible.   When you review the statements of our Founding Fathers, again and  again you find statements of this. And I will lead off by quoting  William Penn:         I do declare to the whole world that we believe the       Scriptures to contain a declaration of the mind and will of       God. We accept the Bible as the Words of God himself.    The first Chief Justice of the United States, John Jay, was the  president of the American Bible Society.   Can you imagine that happening today? You can barely become a Justice  if you are a member of the Knights of Columbus.   Noah Webster said: ``Education is useless without the Bible.'' Noah  Webster, of course, known as the father of American education.    Again and again, people of that era learned to read by learning the  Bible.   When you review the statements or the Bible quotations of the early  Founders, the Bible Book that they quoted the most was the Book of  Deuteronomy, which is perhaps not surprising, because in Deuteronomy  were largely laid out a lot of the laws that eventually God's people of  Israel were to live under. So it is not surprising that Deuteronomy was  quoted so frequently.   Early American Presidents like John Adams and, later, Abraham  Lincoln, looked to the Bible as they declared days of fasting and  prayer.   Again, when we look in our history, there is no book that had more to  do with the founding of our country and the type of country our  forefathers anticipated than the Bible, so it is only fitting that  today we honor the Bible.
