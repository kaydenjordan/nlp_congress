 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Farm Bureaus  of Monterey County and Santa Cruz County.   This year, those farm bureaus will mark 100 years of serving our  agriculture communities across the central coast of California. We know  that those in agriculture are consistently evolving as they constantly  contend with Mother Nature, mandates, immigration, and the ever- changing market.   Fortunately, the local farm bureaus' leadership and consultation has  always been there to help our over 600 farmers stay competitive and  keep our communities strong. The farm bureaus are an essential  ingredient as to why our number one industry on the central coast is  agriculture and why my home can claim the title of being the berry bowl  and salad bowl of the world.   I thank and recognize the Santa Cruz County and Monterey County Farm  Bureaus for their past, present, and future work for our agriculture  industry and for our communities that feed our families throughout our  Nation and the world.                            ____________________
