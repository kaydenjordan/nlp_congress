 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I had an opportunity to watch the  majority leader's speech this morning. It was extraordinary. I want to  compliment him for providing a history lesson for Americans about the  history of the Jewish people and putting it in context with the  conflict that is underway.   So I want to thank him and associate myself with his remarks. I share  his disgust at the alarming rise of anti-Semitism in America--and  around the world--in the wake of the October 7 attacks.   So, again, I stand with him in condemning this hatred. And I stand  with our ally, Israel, as it defends, literally, its right to exist.
