 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in  morning business.    Mr. President, I rise this afternoon--and I know I will be  joined by a number of my colleagues on the floor--to talk about gun  violence and to talk about what happened most recently and tragically  in the State of Florida. I hope we can cover a number of aspects of  this challenge, but I wanted to start with the victims who were killed  at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School on February 14. I will make  reference to the individuals more specifically a little later, but we  are remembering them today. We are thinking of their families and  certainly thinking as well of the surviving students.   We are praying for the families, the victims, and the survivors. I  can't imagine what these families are dealing with right now just days  after this tragedy. There are a lot of ways to express grief, a lot of  ways to somehow articulate the loss. I can't do it adequately, so I  will turn to, in this case, a songwriter, recording artist Bruce  Springsteen. We all know a good bit of his music, but years ago, after  9/11, he wrote the lyrics to a song which was entitled, ``You're  Missing.'' Of course, it has application for those who have loved and  lost, especially in this instance, so tragically.   Bruce Springsteen's words go, in part, like this, and the refrain of  the song is ``You're missing.'' At one point he says:         You're missing when I shut out the lights        You're missing, when I close my eyes        You're missing, when I see the sun rise    He is giving us a sense of the loss--all day, every day, all night,  every night--for that family member. He was speaking and reflecting  upon the losses of 9/11, but anyone who has lost a loved one, especially this way--in this  case, victims of murder in the school--must be thinking the same about  what is missing in their lives and who is missing in their life,  whether it is a son, a daughter, or another loved one.   Gun violence in our country is all too common. It is almost hard to  comprehend how common it has become, and unfortunately it is all too  common not just for our country but especially for the younger  generation. I will not provide lines of demarcation, but a lot of young  people have known little else in their young lives but reading about or  seeing on television stories about gun violence or being in the midst  of an act of gun violence. At least hundreds of Americans have been in  schools that have been the site of gun violence in the last 20 years or  so.    What we ought to do here is, in addition to giving speeches and  pointing out where we should go--that is helpful, I guess, but the most  important thing the Senate can do is to debate and vote. It would be  ideal if we would debate one bill and then vote on it, then have  another debate on another bill and vote on that, and do that again and  again and see where we end up. I think most people here would be  willing to do that even if we knew the result, even if you could prove  to us that this particular measure will not pass or this one will be  close or that one might pass. Whatever the circumstance, we should  debate this issue. This institution is supposed to be all about open  debate on the issues of the day. That is what I think that not only  young people across the country but people of all ages are expecting of  us. They expect us to debate and vote and keep trying to pass a measure  that might reduce or maybe even substantially reduce the likelihood of  further gun violence in schools and all other kinds of places in our  society.   Of course, we are thinking particularly about schools, where students  should have a reasonable but sometimes cannot be sure of a reasonable  expectation of security. I can't imagine this as a student. In all the  years I was in school, we never even thought about this as a reality in  our lives. People my age probably never thought about it for 1 minute.  People who grew up in the 1960s or 1970s or 1980s never thought about  this. It is only in the last generation or so that students have had to  worry about and think about and unfortunately, for some, experience  this kind of violence.   I was a teacher for 1 year. I was a volunteer in North Philadelphia  in a fifth grade classroom. I only taught for a year and knew I would  only be teaching for a year of volunteer work, but I never thought  about this. I can't imagine what I would do even if I had some training  in law enforcement. Even if I had some training in how to handle a  weapon, I can't imagine having to defend a classroom against this kind  of killer with a high-powered weapon, where he can shoot bullets, one  after another, into a classroom. I can't even imagine, and most people  can't imagine.   Schools are supposed to be places of teaching, of learning, of  friendship, of competition, and of engagement with all kinds of  activities in a school. Of course, schools are supposed to be places of  growth, where young people start high school or grade school--high  school for 4 years, grade school for longer--come through that, and  grow into the kind of person their families hope they will be. Schools  should not be places of fear and trepidation and uncertainty about what  might happen in that school. This is not a common thought that students  in years past had, that they would go to school and not be safe, that  they would go to school and potentially not come home.   What has been heartening and inspiring in the aftermath of this  tragedy is what young people have done in Parkland in the State of  Florida and, frankly, throughout the country. The other day, one of my  colleagues said something that made a lot of sense. My colleague made  the statement that the Senate is not where the focus of attention is.  This Senator said that the focus of attention is on these young people.  They are leading. In this case, Congress might have to follow, but we  should follow them. They are leading on this. They are showing us the  way. Young people are charting a new course on this issue, and they are  not going away. They are going to be voting for 50 more years or  longer. They are not going away, and this issue won't go away. They are  leading us, and we should follow them. They and their families expect  us to act. That means debating and voting. It doesn't just mean giving  speeches or expressing condolence.   Many of us were moved and inspired by their leadership, and we  continue to be so inspired. Many of us were moved to tears and  outpourings of emotion on all of these tragedies. I will never forget  what I was thinking and responding to when it came to the Newtown  massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School. That, for me, was a seminal  moment in my life in the Senate. That tragedy informed how I would vote  going forward. That tragedy moved me to take a different approach to  these issues and, frankly, to vote a different way.   Starting in 2012 and 2013, in the aftermath of that tragedy, the one  question I had to ask myself at the time--and I think we are still  asking ourselves tragedy after tragedy--is there no action Congress can  take that will substantially reduce the likelihood of gun violence in a  school? Is there no action  [[Page S1276]]  that the most powerful country in the history of the human race can  take to reduce this likelihood? If our answer is no, then I guess that  is the way some will vote, and they will move on to other issues. I  don't think many Americans believe that. I think most Americans believe  there are actions we can take. It won't be one bill or one amendment or  one vote, but there are a series of steps we can take over time, and it  will take too much time, but we have to start now to consider, debate,  and vote on a number of measures.   I want to turn to my colleagues in just a moment.   In the time after the Sandy Hook Elementary tragedy, I was, as many  of us were, reading about these young children and the horror in that  classroom. I happened to tear out a newspaper page from the Wall Street  Journal. These were printed in all kinds of newspapers across the  country. You can't see it from a distance, but it is a yellowed copy of  that page. It is from the Wall Street Journal dated December 17, 2012,  page A6. The inscription above it is ``Shattered Lives.'' It has  pictures of the students and pictures of their teachers and others in  the school as well. They were all victims of gun violence. I won't go  through the stories, but these are powerful stories of their lives. We  have to ask ourselves, in the aftermath of that kind of a tragedy--just  like the most recent tragedy--are we going to celebrate their lives and  tell the world how much they contributed to the life of America but  then in the same breath say: But we have to move on to another issue. I  don't think that is an American approach. I don't think that is the  approach of a great nation, of a great people.   When we are at our best, we tackle problems. We know it will take a  long time. We know it will take a number of votes and a number of  actions. But we have to begin. I think we should begin.   In this instance, I am not going to go through all the names or all  the names from every tragedy, of course, but let me read just the first  names of the victims in Parkland. I know the senior Senator from  Florida, because of his concern for these victims and their families  and his knowledge of his home State, will go into even more detail. I  will read the first names. As we are reading them, we should think  about what we can do, what we should do as a people, or should we just  do what has been done too many other times and move on?   Alyssa, Scott, Martin, Nicholas, Aaron, Jaime, Chris, Luke, Cara,  Gina, Joaquin, Alaina, Meadow, Helena, Alex, Carmen, and Peter--17  individuals who are missing in the lives of their family, missing what  their classmates are experiencing every day; missing from the lives of  those classmates, sometimes their best friends. As the songwriter says,  those 17 are missing when they shut out the lights. They are missing  when they close their eyes at night. And they are missing when they see  the sunrise.   We have an obligation. We are dutybound as an institution but maybe  more importantly, as a people, to take action. The time is now--maybe  not to finish action, but the time is now to take action.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.
