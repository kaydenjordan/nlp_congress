 Mr. Chair, I recognize the MVP of the baseball team very  much for his heroic athletic ability during the climactic game that we  had.   I rise today in support of H.R. 4394, the Energy and Water  Development and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, which funds the  U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' civil works projects and the Department  of Energy to enhance our energy security and bolster our economic  competitiveness in FY24.   Under President Biden, Americans have been forced to pay record  prices at the pump, and our Strategic Petroleum Reserve has been  decimated. We have become further reliant on China for critical  minerals, crushed by overregulation, and watched the woke agenda  destroy America's energy independence.   This legislation rolls back America-last policies; robustly funds  construction, operation, and maintenance of our Nation's ports and  inland waterways; and provides $34.8 million for dredging in North  Carolina's Third District alone.   This bill includes $6.3 million for dredging the Atlantic  Intracoastal Waterway--we call it the ICW--which is vital to the  commercial and recreational fishing industry in my district, and $18  million for dredging the Morehead City port, where our Marine  expeditionary units deploy from Navy amphibious ships and play a vital  role in our national security. God forbid we have to use them soon.   Also included is funding for other important inlets that our fishing  industry and ferries rely on, such as Manteo Bay, New River Inlet,  Rollinson Channel, New Topsail Inlet and connecting channels, as well  as Silver Lake Harbor.   Lastly, it includes $5.2 million for the channel from Back Sound to  Lookout Bight, which connects the ferry system to Cape Lookout. It has  not been dredged in over 30 years, and it is common for vessels to run  aground that must be pulled off the shoal with a very expensive  movement by the U.S. Coast Guard.   I am very grateful for the work of Energy and Water Development, and  [[Page H5070]]  Related Agencies Subcommittee Chairman Fleischmann, aka the MVP of the  baseball team, for putting forward a bill that recognizes the unique  challenges and needs of our coastal communities across the country.   Mr. Chair, I support this year's energy and water development  appropriations bill and urge my colleagues to do the same.                                time  1815
