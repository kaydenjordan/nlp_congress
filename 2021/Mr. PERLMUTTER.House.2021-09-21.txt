 Madam Speaker, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself 1\1/2\ minutes.   Madam Speaker, I offer this amendment, which is identical to the SAFE  Banking Act the House passed by a vote of 321-101 in April. 180  bipartisan Members of Congress and 39 bipartisan Senators are  cosponsors of this important legislation to allow State-regulated  cannabis businesses to access the financial system and improve safety  in our communities by getting cash off the streets.   By bringing cash into the financial system, banks and credit unions  will  [[Page H4809]]  subject the funds and the account holders to rigorous anti-money  laundering and ``know your customer'' requirements. Under FinCEN's 2014  guidance, financial institutions must comply with a heightened anti- money laundering reporting regime when providing services to cannabis  businesses. This will strengthen the security of our financial system  and our country by keeping bad actors like foreign cartels out of the  cannabis industry.   But most importantly, this amendment will reduce the risk of violent  crime in our communities. By dealing in all cash, these businesses and  their employees become targets for robbery, assaults, burglaries, and  more. In Colorado, Travis Mason, a young father and Marine Corps  veteran, was murdered while working as a security guard for a cannabis  business. We cannot wait any longer to address this public safety  threat.   I want to thank my cosponsors on this amendment, Representatives  Velazquez, Davidson, Correa, Blumenauer, Joyce, and Barbara Lee, as  well as former Representatives Heck and Stivers.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I just would remind the gentleman from  Alabama the matter was deemed germane by the Parliamentarian.   I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Davidson).    Madam Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from  Governors from 21 States and Territories endorsing the SAFE Banking  Act, along with a list of 41 other diverse organizations who support  the legislation.       Hon. Charles E. Schumer,      Majority Leader,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Speaker of the House,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Sherrod Brown,      Chair, Senate Committee on Banking,      Housing and Urban Affairs, Washington, DC.      Hon. Maxine Waters,      Chair,      House Committee on Financial Services, Washington, DC.      Hon. Mitch McConnell,      Minority Leader,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Kevin McCarthy,      Minority Leader,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Pat Toomey,      Ranking Member, Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and           Urban Affairs, Washington, DC.      Hon. Patrick McHenry,      Ranking Member, House Committee on Financial Services,           Washington, DC.                                                    April 19, 2021.        Dear Congressional Leaders: As our States' chief       executives, we urge Congress to pass legislation allowing       states with legalized medical or adult-use cannabis to       operate safely under the national banking system. We strongly       support the passage of the Secure and Fair Enforcement (SAFE)       Banking Act of 2021 (H.R. 1996/S. 910) or similar legislation       that would remove the legal uncertainty and allow banks and       credit unions to provide services to state-licensed cannabis-      related businesses.        We were pleased that the House passed similar legislation       in the 116th Congress (H.R. 1595). The SAFE Banking Act of       2021 already has more than 165 bipartisan House cosponsors       and more than 30 bipartisan Senate cosponsors. The       legislation has also received support from more than 30       associations.        Currently, 36 U.S. states, four U.S. territories, and the       District of Columbia have legalized the medical use of       cannabis. Additionally, 18 states, two territories, and the       District of Columbia have legalized recreational use by       adults over 21 years of age. Despite legalization of cannabis       at the state-level, our financial institutions face enormous       legal risks and criminal and civil liability under the       Controlled Substances Act. These barriers disincentive       financial institutions from providing banking services to       state-licensed and regulated cannabis businesses.        Because few banks and credit unions provide these services,       state-licensed cannabis businesses predominantly operate on a       cash basis. Without banking services, state-licensed cannabis       businesses are unable to write checks, make and receive       electronic payments, utilize a payroll provider, or accept       credit and debit cards. Cash only businesses pose a       significant public safety risk to customers and employees.       The cash-only environment also burdens state and local       government agencies that must collect tax and fee payments in       person and in cash, which creates additional public expenses       and employee safety risks.        State and federal governments have a shared interest in       upholding the rule of law, protecting public safety, and       transitioning markets out of the shadows and into our       transparent and regulated banking system. Many of our states       have implemented laws and regulations to reduce these risks       while ensuring financial accountability of the cannabis       industry. These public safety risks can be further mitigated       on the federal level by passing the SAFE Banking Act to       provide state-licensed cannabis businesses with access to       banking service providers.        We urge you to pass the SAFE Banking Act of 2021 or similar       legislation that would provide a safe harbor for depository       institutions that provide a financial product or service to a       state-licensed cannabis business in states that have       legalized cannabis. We look forward to working with you as       legislation progresses to address this urgent public policy       and safety concern.            Sincerely,          Governor Jared Polis, State of Colorado; Governor Ned             Lamont, State of Connecticut; Governor John Bel             Edwards, State of Louisiana; Governor Charlie Baker,             State of Massachusetts; Governor Steve Sisolak, State             of Nevada; Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham, State of             New Mexico; Governor Doug Burgum, State of North             Dakota; Governor Gavin Newsom, State of California;             Governor JB Pritzker, State of Illinois; Governor Janet             Mills, State of Maine; Governor Gretchen Whitmer, State             of Michigan; Governor Phil Murphy, State of New Jersey;             Governor Andrew Cuomo, State of New York; Governor Kate             Brown, State of Oregon; Governor Tom Wolf, State of             Pennsylvania; Governor Albert Bryan, Territory of U.S.             Virgin Islands; Governor Jay Inslee, State of             Washington; Governor Tony Evers, State of Wisconsin;             Governor Spencer Cox, State of Utah; Governor Ralph             Northam, State of Virginia; Governor Jim Justice, State             of West Virginia.

Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time  to close.   This is a public safety and a national security matter, very germane  to the issues at hand, dealing with foreign cartels and particularly  the cash that is developed by this business that leads to crime. We  have seen murders, robberies, assaults, and then the potential for  foreign malignant forces to get into the cannabis industry here in the  United States.   I urge the passage of amendment No. 1 and yield back the balance of  my time.
