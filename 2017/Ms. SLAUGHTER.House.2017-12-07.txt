 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me the  customary 30 minutes, and I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I have great fondness for Mr. Woodall. I think he is one  of the best, most pleasant persons on the Rules Committee, and it  grieves me that I have to, right off the bat here, take issue with him,  but I have to take issue with the claim that Republicans completed  their appropriation work on time.   I have got a timetable of the budget process that came from the  website of the Budget Committee majority, on which my colleague, Mr.  Woodall, serves. Let's review the most important deadlines.   First, the President must submit his budget to Congress by the first  Monday in February. The truth: this year, the administration released  what they called a skinny budget on March 16 and didn't release the  full budget until May 23. From our reckoning, that is 4 months late.   Second, the Congress must complete action on the budget by April 15.  The truth: this year, Republicans weren't able to get the fiscal year  2018 budget through Congress until October 26, over 6 months late and  nearly a month into the new fiscal year.   Now, here is another deadline, again available on the Republican  Budget Committee's website. The Appropriations Committee is supposed to  complete their work by June 10. The truth: this year, they didn't  report out any appropriations bills until after that deadline had  passed.   Another deadline: the House is supposed to complete action on annual  appropriations bills by June 30. The truth: not only did the Republican  majority fail to meet that deadline, they weren't able to pass any of  them separately at all. Instead, they lumped four bills together and  passed them on July 27 and then passed an Omnibus with all 12 bills  together on September 14, leaving 2 weeks only for the House and Senate  to work out their differences, but the law said that they should have 3  months to do it.    I wouldn't bring this up except I know Mr. Woodall believes, with all  his heart, that what he is saying is right, because we have heard it  before.   That leads me to the final deadline that they missed. Fiscal year  2018 began October 1, but here we are more than two months later on  December 7. The Republican majority has still failed to fund the  government, because they have been too busy working to kill the  Affordable Care Act and to give big tax breaks to corporations and  billionaires.   On time, Mr. Speaker? Any school child could tell you that you don't  get credit for an assignment that is 2 months late.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the timetable of the budget  process from the website of the House Budget Committee majority.                      Time Table of the Budget Process         Title III of the Congressional Budget Act establishes a       specific timetable for the congressional budget process.        On or Before, Action to be completed:        First Monday in February, President submits his budget;       February 15, Congressional Budget Office submits report to       Budget Committees; Not later than 6 weeks after the President       submits the budget, Committees  [[Page H9724]]       submit views and estimates to Budget Committees. (Frequently,       the House Budget Committee sets own date based on Legislative       Calendar); April 1, Senate Budget Committee reports       concurrent resolution on the budget; April 15, Congress       completes action on the concurrent resolution on the budget.       (This is not signed by the President)*; May 15, Annual       appropriation bills may be considered in House; June 10,       House Appropriations Committee reports last annual       appropriation bill; June 15, Congress completes action on       reconciliation legislation. (If required by the budget       resolution); June 30, House completes action on annual       appropriation bills; October 1, Fiscal year begins.     Mr. Speaker, the majority has put before us today a 2- week continuing resolution to fund the government through December 22.   I have heard some in the majority question why anyone would take  issue with this approach, but, Mr. Speaker, the question that should be  asked is this one: What is the majority actually willing to get done  over the next 2 weeks? Because it has now been more than 2 months since  some vital national priorities have lapsed under their leadership.   The Children's Health Insurance Program, which provides healthcare to  more than 9 million children across this Nation, expired on September  30. So did the community health centers, which serve more than 25  million people. Now, this expiration has put 2,800 centers in danger of  closure and 9 million people at risk for losing their access to their  healthcare.   The Perkins Loan Program, which many low-income students rely on for  their education, was allowed to expire by the majority with no  reauthorization in sight, despite broad bipartisan support for a bill  to do just that. Unfortunately, the majority has been unwilling even to  bring it up for a vote.   Are they now ready to take meaningful action to protect our children,  our students, our public health, and our Nation?   Democrats haven't just been fighting to reauthorize programs that  expired 2 months ago, we are also trying to address the priorities that  we know our Nation will face in the weeks ahead. That includes passing  hurricane relief funding to help the families that are still recovering  from this horrendous hurricane season; and as all of us are fearful of  and sad about, California is burning once again; reauthorizing section  702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, which we depend on,  which is due to expire at the end of this month. The FISA court helps  to keep our country safe.   Mr. Speaker, if past is prologue, this majority will be missing in  action 2 weeks from now, just as they have been for months.   Just consider, for a moment, how they have squandered this year,  wasting months on fruitless attempts to repeal the Affordable Care Act  until persuaded by their constituents that they did not want that done.  It remains the law of the land today after the public overwhelmingly  demanded the majority stop that crusade.   Now they are trying to pass a tax cut for the wealthy that, if  enacted, would represent one of the largest transfers of wealth from  working families to the wealthy that our Nation has ever seen.   I want everybody to please pay attention to this, because it is proof  positive of what is happening with this majority. According to the  Joint Committee on Taxation and the Congressional Budget Office, under  the majority's plan, those making $40,000 to $50,000 would pay an  additional $5.3 billion in taxes combined over the next decade. Now,  remember, they are going to pay more into the number of $5.3 billion.   At the same time--attention, America--those earning $1 million or  more would see a $5.8 billion cut. Have you ever seen anything as cut  and dry? They absolutely want to take from the poor to give to the  rich--Robin Hood in reverse.   So we are 2 months into the fiscal year, and the majority has been so  preoccupied with the special interest agenda, that we haven't passed  full year appropriations. This has robbed the Federal agencies and our  economy of the certainty that they need.   The majority holds the House, the Senate, and the White House and  still can't get anything done. So when Democrats see a continuing  resolution for 2 weeks, we don't see a simple extension of the status  quo; we see it for what it really is: kicking the can down the road in  order to pursue reckless partisan politics, and it comes without any  plan to tackle the major issues that face our Nation today.   Let me remind my colleagues how important it has been for both  parties to work together, because in this process, both the CR and the  tax bill, there are no Democrat fingerprints on any of it. For a lot of  this stuff, there has even been no committee action.   Democrats have helped the majority pass every major funding bill  since they assumed control in 2011. That is the result of  bipartisanship.   This time, the majority decided not to compromise with us to reach a  deal. Let's see if they can cobble together the votes to get this  proposal over the finish line.   Even if it passes, we will be back here later this month to consider  another short-term continuing resolution, and we still have no idea  whether this bill, the one we are working on today, could even pass the  Senate.   This is no way to run the United States of America. The lives of our  countrymen are hanging in the balance.   All we do under this majority is to lurch from one self-inflicted  crisis to the next. Our constituents deserve much better than this.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Michigan (Mr. Kildee).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Michigan (Mr. Kildee).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Lee).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Lee).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, the gentleman from Georgia said they need the Democrats.  He must be aware that they only need us when the votes come.   There is not a Democrat fingerprint on that tax bill. We had nothing  to say about any of it. And while we begged almost on our hands and  knees to be a part of what they are doing, we are not. It always sounds  good when we hear it on the floor: Bipartisan. Oh, look, we want to  work together.   But then, oftentimes, as you know, Mr. Speaker, bills come to the  Rules Committee with no committee action whatsoever and no possible  description to be bipartisan.   Mr. Speaker, for years we have endured relentless Republican attacks  on the Affordable Care Act, including just last week in the Senate's  disastrous tax bill. By repealing the individual mandate, the Senate  bill has knocked 13 million people from their health insurance.   I must have asked 20 times when they were doing those 60 times to try  to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act: Why do you want to take  healthcare away from people?   I have never, to this day, gotten an answer as to why it is they so  despise a healthcare bill that is working and has literally insured  more Americans than have ever been insured before.    Then suddenly, just on a whim, one party decides--the one that has  been fighting to kill it over and over again--that they will come at it  piecemeal and just try to render it helpless by taking away the ability  to even say it is time to go sign up again.   I am sure they thought they would do grievous harm, but it didn't  work that way, and millions of people came out to sign up again because  healthcare is one of the most critical needs for any American family.   To make matters worse, the bill also repeals most of the State and  local tax deductions, and that is a deduction that helps middle class  families in my State of New York.   New York, on average, gives back to the Federal Government of the  United States $40 billion; money that we send to Washington and get  nothing back for it, the way we are rewarded for that. I think that  probably will not be happening anymore since the taxes are going to go  up so much higher on the people of my State, unless they do away with  what is absolutely one of the most atrocious things I have ever seen  them do.   Mr. Speaker, it is evident that the tax bill was not designed to help  middle class families put food on their table, but, instead, it gives  corporation tax cuts to line the pockets of their shareholders.   I have yet to read or see the Senate tax bill, but I understand there  are gifts in there for people who own jet planes. I don't represent any  of those.                                time  1330    But taking care, again, of the rich, as demonstrated in the figures  that supported my speech a while ago, that just  [[Page H9728]]  short of $6 billion, that goes from the poor people who make under  $40,000 to the rich people, the same office, the same amount of money,  dollar for dollar, and absolutely proves what we are saying.   But you don't need to hear from it me. Don't take my word for it.  Republican Congressman Mark Sanford recently said in a moment of great  candor: ``From a truth-in-advertising standpoint, it would have been a  lot simpler if we just acknowledged reality on this bill, which is it's  fundamentally a corporate tax reduction and restructuring bill,  period.''   There is no tiny scintilla of reform in this bill. It is simply, as  he points out, a way to lower the corporate tax and take care of the  extraordinarily wealthy in this country who don't need it.   Mr. Speaker, I wish we could provide health for middle class  families, which is what I believe the President of the United States  thinks he did. I hear him say all the time that there is nothing in  there to benefit him--except, probably, the estate tax, which we  understand would save him about $1 billion.   So, if we defeat the previous question, I will offer an amendment  that will prohibit any legislation being considered on the floor that  limits or repeals the State and local tax deduction or repeals the ACA  individual mandate.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately  prior to the vote on the previous question.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentlewoman from New York?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, let me take a moment and remind everyone  watching of the impacts of the majority's last shutdown in 2013. The  impacts on our economy were significant. We lost $24 billion in just  those 2 weeks. The impacts on our economy, as I said, were very  significant:   Federal loans to small businesses, homeowners, and families were  brought to a halt.   Banks and other lenders were unable to access government verification  services, which delayed private sector lending to small businesses and  individuals alike.   Federal permitting was brought to a standstill, which delayed job- creating projects in the transportation and energy sectors.   Experts have estimated that all told, this 16-day shutdown cost our  economy an estimated $24 billion.   So, during this shutdown, again, vital services were put on hold.   At the National Institutes of Health, hundreds of patients were  unable to enroll in possibly lifesaving clinical trials.   Federal agencies like the Food and Drug Administration and the  Environmental Protection Agency were unable to conduct health and  safety inspections.   Federal scientific research was also halted, and we lost a lot of  scientists in this country because of all that. Five Nobel Prize  winning scientists who worked for the Federal Government at the time of  the shutdown, four of the five of them were laid off.   This is all according to a report issued by the Office of Management  and Budget.   The public knows how devastating another shutdown could be. According  to a poll conducted by Morning Consult and Politico released this week,  there is bipartisan opposition, with 68 percent of Democrats, 62  percent of Republicans, and 61 percent of Independents all opposing a  government shutdown.   I forgot to mention up there about Social Security checks and things  for the Veterans Administration. They came to a halt.   So that is what makes this so frustrating. I agree with Mr. Woodall.  This is a frustrating part of what we are trying to do here. Every day  it seems we get up and we face some kind of new disaster.   We could have crafted a bipartisan bill--we sure could have--that  would have removed any question of whether a continuing resolution  would pass the House and Senate.   We could have reauthorized the Children's Health Insurance Program,  community health centers, Perkins loans, and more months ago, if only  the majority were willing to work with Democrats. Instead,  bipartisanship is all too often becoming a dirty word under the  majority. I sadly say: It is the American people left to pay the price.   So I urge a ``no'' vote on the previous question, the rule, and the  bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 and clause 9 of rule  XX, this 15-minute vote on ordering the previous question will be  followed by 5-minute votes on:   Adopting House Resolution 647, if ordered;   Suspending the rules and adopting H. Res. 259; and   Agreeing to the Speaker's approval of the Journal.   The vote was taken by electronic device, and there were--yeas 236,  nays 190, not voting 6, as follows:                               [Roll No. 665]                                 YEAS--236       Abraham      Aderholt      Allen      Amash      Amodei      Arrington      Babin      Bacon      Banks (IN)      Barletta      Barr      Barton      Bergman      Biggs      Bilirakis      Bishop (MI)      Bishop (UT)      Black      Blackburn      Blum      Bost      Brady (TX)      Brat      Brooks (AL)      Brooks (IN)      Buchanan      Buck      Bucshon      Budd      Burgess      Byrne      Calvert      Carter (GA)      Carter (TX)      Chabot      Cheney      Coffman      Cole      Collins (GA)      Collins (NY)      Comer      Comstock      Conaway      Cook      Costello (PA)      Cramer      Crawford      Culberson      Curbelo (FL)      Curtis      Davidson      Davis, Rodney      Denham      Dent      DeSantis      DesJarlais      Diaz-Balart      Donovan      Duffy      Duncan (SC)      Duncan (TN)      Dunn      Emmer      Estes (KS)      Farenthold      Faso      Ferguson      Fitzpatrick      Fleischmann      Flores      Fortenberry      Foxx      Frelinghuysen      Gaetz      Gallagher      Garrett      Gianforte      Gibbs      Gohmert      Goodlatte      Gosar      Gowdy      Granger      Graves (GA)      Graves (LA)      Graves (MO)      Griffith      Grothman      Guthrie      Handel      Harper      Harris      Hartzler      Hensarling      Herrera Beutler      Hice, Jody B.
