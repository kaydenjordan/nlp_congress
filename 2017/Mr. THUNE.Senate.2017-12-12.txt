 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, for more than two decades, under both  Republican and Democratic Presidents and Republican and Democratic  Congresses, the United States pursued a bipartisan light-touch approach  to internet regulation. The internet as we know it today flourished  under this light-touch approach, much to the benefit of American  consumers and the domestic economy. It also made America the world  leader in internet technology and positioned us to continue that  leadership in the years to come.   In 2002, broadband internet was classified by the Federal  Communications Commission, or FCC, our Nation's communications  regulator, as an information service under title I of the  Communications Act. This classification exempted the internet from  burdensome regulations contained in title II of the Communications Act,  which were designed in the Depression era for the old telephone  monopolies.   Under the Obama administration, we saw repeated attempts to bring the  internet under greater government control. Finally, in 2015, at the  explicit direction of President Obama, the FCC did as it was told and  reclassified broadband internet access service as a title II service,  subjecting broadband internet to onerous common carrier rules and  opening the door to further regulation, including price regulation. Not  surprisingly, with heavier regulation came a decline in broadband  investment. Indeed, we have seen private investment in broadband  infrastructure decline over the past 2 years. This decline should not  be mistaken as a sign that broadband infrastructure is not needed. In  fact, the opposite is true, as there are still 34 million Americans who  lack access to broadband services at home.   In States like my home State of South Dakota, encouraging broadband  deployment continues to be critical to ensuring that rural areas have  the same economic opportunity as their urban counterparts. The Federal  Government should not be putting up barriers to broadband deployment;  it should be removing them. Congress and the FCC need to ensure  regulatory framework is in place that protects consumers but that  doesn't stand in the way of investment and innovation.   Prior to the FCC's 2015 actions to bring broadband under title II,  and for more than a decade under the light-touch regulatory framework  of title I, we saw unprecedented growth that revolutionized our daily  lives and allowed us to stay better connected with our loved ones. The  internet created new jobs and expanded opportunities for education and  commerce. It became the greatest engine of innovation for our times.   Despite the fearmongering and doomsday rhetoric that continues to  plague this debate, when the FCC moves forward and restores the  internet to its pre-2015 regulatory status, the internet will continue  to thrive and serve as an engine for future economic growth.   I commend Chairman Pai at the FCC and the entire Commission for all  the hard work over the last year that has gotten us to this point. I  also commend Chairman Pai for his commitment to transparency throughout  this process. For the first time in the history of the Commission,  under Chairman Pai's leadership, the public was able to view the  Restoring Internet Freedom item 3 weeks prior to the FCC's vote. That  is true of all documents to be considered by the Commission--a major  departure from the previous administration's actions, which were often  not made public until the very last minute. As a result of Chairman  Pai's commitment to transparency, the public has the benefit of not  only viewing the item but also participating in the process.   Despite attempts by those more interested in politicizing the issue  and distracting from this debate, this item resulted in the most well  informed and most exhaustive record of comments ever submitted to the  FCC. The FCC is now well positioned to move forward to ensure that the  internet is open and free. Regrettably, however, debate doesn't end  there. The outcry from opponents of the FCC's proposal is that the  internet will fall apart without adequate consumer protections.   There is obviously immense passion that follows the issue of net  neutrality. Americans care deeply about preserving a free and open  internet, as do I and so many of my colleagues in the U.S. Senate on  both sides of the aisle.   As I have stated repeatedly and I will say again today, congressional  action is the only way to solve the endless back-and-forth on net  neutrality rules that we have seen over the past several years. If my  colleagues on the other side of the aisle and those who claim to  support net neutrality rules want to enshrine protections for consumers  with the backing of the law, I call on them today to join me in  discussing legislation that would do just that. While we are not going  to agree on everything, I believe there is much room for compromise.   Many of us in Congress already agree on many of the principles of net  neutrality. True supporters of an open internet should be demanding  such legislative protections today, not posturing while waiting for  years during protracted legal proceedings or waiting for the political  winds to shift.   If Republicans and Democrats have the political support to work  together on such a compromise, we can enact a regulatory framework that  will stand the test of time. I have stood willing to work with any and  all supporters of net neutrality protections for many years now, and I  continue to stand ready today.   It is time for Congress to settle this debate, and I welcome  discussion on ways to ensure a free and open internet for decades to  come.    Mr. President, today I recognize Lieutenant Commander  Wendy Lewis of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration  Commissioned Officer Corps, who has served as a fellow to the Commerce,  Science, and Transportation Committee for the past 3 years. I thank  Lieutenant Commander Lewis for all of the hard work she has done for  me, my staff, and the entire committee.   Lieutenant Commander Lewis has had a significant impact during her  time as a fellow. Her expertise as a ship driver and manager of our  Nation's natural resources has meaningfully informed the committee's  efforts. She has worked on several pieces of legislation that have  become law, including the National Oceanic and Atmospheric  Administration Sexual Harassment and Assault Prevention Act and the  Weather Research and Forecasting Innovation Act of 2017. Her  contributions have enhanced the ability of the National Oceanic and  Atmospheric Administration to carry out its missions and bettered the  lives of those who work there.   I would like to extend my sincere thanks and appreciation to  Lieutenant Commander Lewis for all of the fine work she has done and  for her continued service to our Nation. I wish her success in the  years to come.                            ____________________
