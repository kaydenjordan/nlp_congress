 Madam Speaker, I rise today to talk about  Reese Hamsmith, an 18-month-old child who died due to complications 2  months after ingesting a button battery. This story has become more and  more common with nearly 3,500 children ingesting button and coin  batteries each year.   Just under a year ago is when I first met with Reese's mom, Trista.  Trista's story is heartbreaking, but she has turned her and her  family's grief into action. She approached my office with an idea for a  bill so that other families are spared this experience.   Reese's Law requires the Consumer Product Safety Commission to create  safety standards for products that contain a button or coin batteries  to prevent accidental ingestion by children under 6 years old.   I thank Trista for her fierce advocacy for continuing to share  Reese's story, and for helping make this bill become a reality.   I am proud that this bipartisan bill passed the House yesterday and  my colleagues voted to protect children and help save countless lives.                            ____________________
