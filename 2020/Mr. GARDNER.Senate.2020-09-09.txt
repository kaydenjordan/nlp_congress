 Mr. President, over the past several weeks, I have had  the opportunity to visit with Colorado families and businesses across  the four corners of our great State, talking about the challenges that  Colorado faces when it comes to our economy as a result of the  pandemic, talking about the health challenges that have been created  for our State and so many of us around the world when it comes to the  pandemic and the work that needs to be done and the work that this  Congress needs to do to come together to stop the partisanship, to stop  the fighting, to stop the arguing, and actually develop real solutions  for the people of this country.   Congress has done that time and time again over the past several  months. If you go back to March 6, the passage of the Coronavirus  Preparedness and Response Supplemental Act, that was signed into law  that day. That is the first action that this Chamber took when it came  to coronavirus response. March 18, a couple of weeks later, Congress  passed the Families First Coronavirus Response Act. That was signed  into law March 18. These were unanimous consent bills--many times  unanimous consent, but had the support of every Republican and every  Democrat. The work we were doing was so evident, and we needed to do it  immediately.   March 27, as economies were shutting down, as restaurants were  closing, as hotels were closing, Congress passed the CARES Act--the  Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act. It was signed into  law on March 27. This is when you started to see some of the  partisanship that was developing as that bill's passage was delayed in  the Senate. Nonetheless, it passed, delivering trillions of dollars in  support for the American people, support for unemployment benefits-- creating new categories of help for people who had seen their jobs  eliminated, furloughed, or hours reduced--support for farmers and  ranchers, support for a vaccine, support for education, mass transit,  telemedicine, and beyond--trillions of dollars, almost a year's worth  of appropriations, a year's worth of funding in one bill, to help make  sure that we were meeting the needs of the American people.   The actions that we take can be focused, at least the way I see it,  through three primary lenses: No. 1, what we were doing to make sure we  are stopping the spread and flattening the curve of coronavirus; No. 2,  making sure that we are helping individuals who are in need, who are  worried about how they are going to meet their rent payments, how they  are going to make their mortgage, making sure that they are going to be  OK.   The third filter, the third lens of actions that we need to takeis to  go back to our businesses and making sure they are able to keep people  employed, making sure they keep their doors open, making sure that our  economy can snap back to its full strength and even stronger than ever  once the health pandemic is over.   We passed the Paycheck Protection Program and Health Care Enhancement  Act on April 24 to provide additional dollars for the Paycheck  Protection Program. We passed legislation that would extend the  Paycheck Protection Program into August, which changed the way some of  the payments are able to be made within that time and what expenses  could be utilized within that timeframe.   We passed the Great American Outdoors Act, which will create  thousands of jobs across the State of Colorado--100,000 jobs across  this country.   We continue to do more work. There is no alpha and omega legislation  when it comes to a coronavirus. There is no one single package of  legislation that we can walk away from, spike the football and say: Our  job is done here.   We passed one bill, two bills, three bills, four bills--and we will  continue to do more because the American people need it, and the  American people need that support.   I met with a restaurant owner in Pueblo, CO, who talked about the  restrictions they are facing at their restaurant. They can have only 50  people in their restaurant regardless of social distancing. They can  have only 50 people in their restaurant. They have a bar in their  restaurant, but because they are a restaurant, they can have only 50  people. The bar down the road can have 100 people in it because they  are a bar, but the restaurant can have only 50 people because they are  a restaurant, even though they have a bar. They are trying to figure  out and understand the regulations, the guidance they are under, making  sure their customers are safe, making sure their employees can be paid,  making sure they survive this and get through this.   This is what the Paycheck Protection Program represents. That is what  the help we passed with unemployment benefits means. It is to help  people get through this so that we can get back on our feet as a  country. I met with farmers in Eastern Colorado who were struggling to  find help, who couldn't find the labor that they needed, who saw  challenges to their prices before coronavirus. They saw challenges  because of coronavirus to their supply chains and what was happening to  the markets. The CARES Act provided aid and relief to many in  agriculture across the State of Colorado, but there is more work to be  done.   I met with schools across the State of Colorado that are trying to  open, that are trying to figure out the best way to keep their students  safe and their teachers safe and make sure they can stay open. Some  were doing online learning; some were doing in-person learning. All of  them were trying to figure it out.   The CARES Act and other pieces of legislation we passed provided  billions of dollars for our educational institutions from kindergarten  to 12th grade on up through higher education--billions and billions of  dollars--but more work needs to be done.   My wife turned to me a couple of weeks ago before our three children  started school and said: It is time for spring break to end. Our kids  have been out since spring break in March. A week ago, they did start,  but there are people and families across the State of Colorado who are  unsure about whether their classes will continue in person. Maybe they  never got that far.   We have to make sure we are providing help with childcare, making  sure families have a place where they can take their kids when they go  to work. In a country where more and more families have both parents in  the workplace, it is very difficult to continue that job and to do it  effectively when you don't have childcare. We have all this supply  problem where we don't have enough places for families to take their  kids and we have a demand challenge where you have people who need to  take their kids to daycare because their schools aren't open. The CARES  Act and other legislation we passed addressed that need. There is more  work yet to do.   I have heard from my colleagues across the aisle that they support  the Paycheck Protection Program and that they support funding for  businesses so that they can keep people employed, so that businesses  can hire people and get them to return to work because we made a  decision that it is better to have people on the job at the workplace  than in the unemployment insurance office. We passed the Paycheck  Protection Program. Look at these numbers in Colorado. We have a total  loan amount of over $10 billion that went to Colorado alone to help  make sure that businesses were staying open, that they could keep  people on the payroll, that they could survive the orders to shut down  that came from mayors and the States and the President. We did it out  of love for our community to make sure that we could stop the spread,  flatten the curve, and get through this together. As a result, we have  an obligation to make sure that  [[Page S5505]]  our economy comes back and that we help those businesses and those  individuals through this to make sure our Nation gets back on its feet.  The legislation that we passed has done part of that.   If you look back to May 15, you think about an economy that lost 20.5  million jobs. The unemployment rate as of May 15 was 14.7 percent.  Today, just a week ago, it is 8.4 percent, with more work that needs to  be done.   I have heard from my colleagues on the other side of the aisle that  there is a need to support childcare and a need to support education, a  need to support our efforts to get a vaccine, a need to support efforts  to continue research, a need to support the post office. I have heard  from our colleagues on the other side of the aisle that there is a need  to make sure we have unemployment benefits that continue for the  American people.   I completely agree that we should make sure the Paycheck Protection  Program continues. We should make improvements to the Paycheck  Protection Program and make sure we improve the Paycheck Protection  Program so that it benefits more businesses so that unrepresented  communities have better access to the Paycheck Protection Program, that  we get more people involved in unbanked and underbanked communities-- nontraditional lenders--so we can get the Paycheck Protection Program  out to them and save more jobs and get more people to work. I  completely agree. Let's work together, and let's pass that.   There are people who aren't as fortunate. There are people who have  lost their jobs. There are people who have seen their hours reduced,  and they are terrified about how they are going to make ends meet,  about what they are going to do for their job and their family. The  bills don't stop. They keep coming, and they have to be paid. We should  help them. We should pass unemployment insurance benefits. We should  pass unemployment benefits to help the American people. Let's vote on  that. Let's do that. Let's make it happen.   We should help people who need childcare. Let's make sure we are  funding childcare. Let's pass it tomorrow. Let's pass it tomorrow to  provide billions of dollars for childcare services. We don't have to  wait; we can pass it now.   We should provide additional assistance to our farmers and ranchers.  Thank goodness that we have the ability to produce our food in the  United States. Imagine what would happen if we were reliant for 70  percent of our food on somebody else, like China. We have seen what  happens in this country when we are reliant on China for our  medications and for other personal protective equipment. Imagine if we  relied on our food coming from somewhere else to the same extent.    We are blessed that we have farmers and ranchers who wake up each and  every day and work hard to put food on our table, but they are  struggling right now. Let's help them. We don't have to wait. We don't  have to wait another week or another month. We can pass it and vote on  it tomorrow--$20 billion for our farmers and ranchers.   We should continue our work on vaccines. I had the chance to stop at  the University of Colorado to visit with Dr. Tom Campbell to learn  about the trial that is taking place at the University of Colorado  School of Medicine on the Anschutz Campus. They are working with the  Moderna vaccine there, making sure that it goes to those who need it to  get the best representative sample of how we can get the vaccine to  succeed, to work, and get it into our community, but we need more help.  We need more work. We need more research and development dollars. Let's  vote on $31 billion on activities like vaccine development and  distribution. Let's make that happen now--$16 billion for testing and  related containment efforts.   Let's build up a personal protective equipment stockpile once again.  We know we need it. Let's vote on it. Let's vote on that tomorrow--$16  billion. Let's pass it.   This $105 billion is more money than the House of Representatives  passed. There is $105 billion for education--for K-12 and for higher  education. We have heard the need from our teachers. We have heard the  need from our colleges. Let's pass that tomorrow in the bill that we  are going to be voting on to provide that help. We don't have to  debate; we don't have to delay. We can pass it tomorrow.   The post office--I live in rural Colorado, and my grandfather was a  rural letter carrier. I remember as a child traveling with him on  county roads out in Yuma County, delivering mail. Let's provide $10  billion to the Postal Service to make sure they have the resources they  need because it matters in rural Colorado. We can pass that tomorrow.   We are going to have a chance to vote on it tomorrow. Let's pass it.  Let's make it happen. Let's get it done now.   Everything here that we are voting on tomorrow--$105 billion to  support students' safe return to in-person learning and educational  opportunities, that is in the bill we are going to be voting on  tomorrow. That $105 billion is more than the House of Representatives  asked for.   There is $16 billion for testing and related containment efforts in  the bill. Let's vote on that tomorrow.   There is $31 billion in vaccine and development distribution, $20  billion in farm assistance, $15 billion to support childcare services,  changes to the Paycheck Protection Program that will allow for a second  loan.   I met with restauranteurs in Denver and across Colorado who said that  the Paycheck Protection Program is what kept them in business. I met  with Mother Pearl in Colorado Springs--a Cajun restaurant--where they  said: This saved us.   But they are still struggling. They are not up to full capacity yet.  Let's give them a chance to get a second loan through the Paycheck  Protection Program so that they can bring their employees back, keep  their employees employed and paid, and get their doors open and through  this.   Let's simplify the loan forgiveness application process so that  people who have $150,000 or less have certainty and clarity about what  is going to happen to that loan. If you look at Colorado, the vast  majority of the loans that represent $10.5 billion in Paycheck  Protection Program loans--95,000 loans were below $150,000 in Colorado;  95,000 businesses could have certainty that their loan is forgiven.  Let's pass that. Let's pass that tomorrow. That is in the bill.   There are enhanced unemployment benefits of $300 a week. The State  could contribute up to $400 a week, lasting through December at the end  of this year. We can pass that tomorrow. It is in the bill.   Ten billion dollars in assistance to the post office is in the bill.   Every single point that we have made here is supported by my  colleagues. They want money for education. We are giving more money to  education than the House of Representatives passed. They want dollars  for testing. They want dollars for vaccine and distribution. They want  dollars and help and support for farm assistance. They want dollars for  childcare. They want dollars for the Paycheck Protection Program. They  want to keep businesses open and people employed and people hired. They  want to help people and businesses have more certainty in how their  loans are going to be handled. They want additional unemployment  benefits for the American people, and they want help for the post  office.   There is not a single person who has come to the floor and said: I  oppose money for higher education. They haven't done that because they  agree. They agree with us. They agree with the testing and the research  for the vaccine. They agree with support for childcare. They agree that  we need to do it.   Maybe somebody wants more. We passed one, two, three, four, five,  six--this could be the fifth, sixth, or seventh bill, depending on how  you count the various pieces of legislation that have gone toward  coronavirus relief. We will do more, and we should do more.   But why on Earth would you vote no tomorrow and tell the people of  this country to go pound sand because you didn't get everything you  wanted? Why would you tell the people who are on unemployment benefits  and need it now: I am sorry, but I didn't get a tax deduction for  wealthy people in California or New York so you are not getting yours.  Why would you tell the people who need the dollars in education  [[Page S5506]]  to support our kids and our teachers: I am sorry, but you are not  getting yours because somebody has a nice house in Los Angeles who  needs a tax cut. Why would you tell businesses that they may not be  able to keep their doors open because that house in Manhattan is really  nice and you want to make sure they keep their big house tax deduction?   My colleagues on the other side of the aisle would have you believe  that the American people can wait for unemployment benefits, that they  can wait for more help for businesses. They would have you believe that  they don't need to vote yes on this, even though they agree with it.  The American people expect us to do our jobs. The American people have  the chance to see this Congress work not in a bipartisan fashion  tomorrow but in a nonpartisan fashion--getting back to the very  beginning of the work we did together to pass legislation to benefit  and help the American people, who acted out of love to stop their  economies because they wanted to stop the spread of the coronavirus.  They shut their businesses and their hotels emptied out all because  they were complying with efforts to socially distance in order to end  this pandemic.   We have a chance tomorrow to vote on a bill that will provide  unemployment benefits that will help people in ranch communities--that  will provide them with billions of dollars in aid--but they are saying  no because they didn't get everything. Their theory seems to be, if I  can't get everything I want, you don't get anything, period.   Is that the message the American people are going to get tomorrow,  that it is their way or the highway? You are not going to get the help  that everybody agrees on because I just didn't get everything that I  thought I should.   Look, our family business is a farm equipment dealership, and I have  talked about it many times on this floor. I have never seen somebody  come into that dealership and say, ``My tractor is broken. I would like  a Republican to fix it,'' or ``My planter needs to be repaired. Can you  please find a Democrat to fix it?'' That is not the way people come  into the store in our economy and do business.   They don't go into Target or Walmart that way. They don't go to that  restaurant in Pueblo, in Colorado Springs, or in Denver and ask,  ``Could you serve me the Republican meal today, please, made by a  Democrat cook?'' They expect us to get the job done.   There are some in this Chamber who argue that, if we just delay a  little bit longer, we will put a big, big package together. Vote  tomorrow. Bring amendments. Have the debate. Don't hide behind closed  doors and argue that, if we just hold out a little bit longer, maybe my  tax cuts will come for that mansion in Beverly Hills or for that place  in the Hamptons.   That is what they are doing. That is what they are doing to the  American people. They are saying, even though we agree, because we  didn't get our way, no one gets their help, that no one gets the help  they need because they didn't get their way on everything.   Tomorrow's vote isn't a final vote by any means, and even if it were,  there is more work to be done. We will have additional pieces of  legislation that we will continue to provide relief for, but tomorrow  is the beginning of the debate. It is the first step in making sure  that we have that for the American people; yet they are going to say  no. They are going to vote no. They are afraid to debate. They won't  even bring amendments.   The Paycheck Protection Program has saved millions of jobs around the  country. We have a chance to extend it, to make it work for more  people. Unemployment insurance has expired. Look, we worked over August  to make sure we had an extension of unemployment insurance and  unemployment benefits for the people of Colorado and this country, as  well as payroll tax breaks and help with rent. This was over the last  several weeks. We need to act to extend it, and we have a chance to  vote on it tomorrow.   Vote yes, and we can provide that relief. Vote no, and you are  telling the American people that politics is more important than  policy, and that is wrong. If this body is interested in results and  policy, they will vote yes to provide this relief that everybody agrees  on.   Some people find the politics of pandering and partisanship way too  intriguing, inviting, and alluring. The American people find it  sickening. Vote yes. Get on this bill. Bring your amendments. Have the  debate. Let the American people know that relief is on the way--or vote  no and continue this shameless charade of people who posture about  helping the American people but who are simply interested in the  electoral outcome.   This vote is going to tell us a lot about people tomorrow. This vote  is going to tell us about people who are interested in finding that way  to relief for the American people--the opportunity is here--or is it  going to simply be a chance to provide yet one more grandstand, yet one  more finger-wagging, tongue-wagging opportunity for the American people  to see how embarrassing the debate has become?   The people of Colorado are strong, resilient, and optimistic. They  see optimism in every vale and valley as they work to climb that next  peak, but they need partners to help them, and we have a chance  tomorrow to vote to provide that help.   Do not be fooled by arguments that this doesn't do enough. We can do  more, and we will do more, but let's start with the unemployment  benefits now. Let's start with the business help now to keep people  employed. Let's start with the vaccines and the research now. Let's  start with the help for education now without delay.   Tomorrow, I hope the outcome is a surprise, and I hope that we will  see people come together in a way that we saw at the beginning of this  debate. There is always more to be done.   I ask unanimous consent to have a letter printed in the Record  following my remarks that I wrote on April 16, with my colleague  Senator Bennet and Governor Polis, that asks for more to be done.   In this letter, we talk about the need for State and local funding--a  half a billion dollars for State and local funding. We also talk about  other programs, including additional benefits for food nutrition. I  still support that. I am still fighting for that. I still want to do  those things we listed in this letter, but I am not going to let that  stop me from voting yes tomorrow because the American people need it.   I hope that my colleagues will stop the partisanship, stop the  gamesmanship, stop the power hungry approach to politics. Put it aside  for the American people. Do what is right for the American people. Vote  yes. I am delivering this critically important relief to our country so  that we can stand united, as our country has stood united for months,  and get through this together.   In the weeks before the economy shut down and we could no longer go  to church in person, we were reviewing a passage in the Bible which  read that out of our struggles and tribulations comes perseverance,  that out of that perseverance is built character, and that out of that  character comes hope. We can provide that hope tomorrow. The American  people deserve nothing less   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                     April 16, 2020.      Hon. Mitch McConnell,      Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.      Hon. Charles Schumer,      Minority Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.        Dear Leader McConnell and Leader Schumer: As you work to       extend and build upon the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and       Economic Security (CARES) Act, we write to request certain       modifications and improvements to the programs that were       included in the law. We kept these requests focused on the       areas under negotiation as we understand them including small       business reforms, state and local funding, health care, and       food assistance through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance       Program (SNAP).        Since the CARES Act became law, we have spoken with       Coloradans across the state about the Paycheck Protection       Program (PPP), including small business owners, farmers, and       non-profit directors. It is clear that we should provide       additional funding for the PPP, but we should also modify the       program to ensure it is providing support for as many small       businesses and non-profits as the program was originally       intended.        Through our conversations, we believe the following       modifications and additions to the PPP can help fix the very       real-on-the-ground issues preventing many small businesses       from participating in the program:        Increase the program appropriations and the loan amount to       4 times average monthly payroll (permitting those that       already have  [[Page S5507]]       loans to increase their loan amount to reach that level) for       firms that have suffered significant revenue losses as a       result of the COVID-19 public health emergency;        Increase the amount that can be spent on non-payroll       expenses for firms that have suffered significant revenue       losses as a result of the COVID-19 public health emergency;        Expand eligibility as follows:        Expressly provide that health care entities, such as quasi-      governmental Critical Access Hospitals and other rural health       care providers, are eligible to participate in the program;        Include certain nonprofits who should not have been       excluded in the first place, subject to the applicable       affiliation rules;        Expand the exception to the 500-employee limitation for       franchises, which is contained in the Small Business       Administration (SBA) guidance, to include franchised       businesses beyond those listed in the SBA's franchise       listing; and        Expand the affiliation rule exception to include more firms       that, for all intents and purposes have fewer than 500       employees, such as fitness centers and retail trade       establishments.        Expressly provide that, following the recently-issued SBA       guidance regarding distributions from partnerships and LLCs       (up to $100,000 annualized), existing PPP loans that excluded       such payments may increase their loan amounts accordingly;        Add the following to list of qualified expenses: mortgage       principal payments in accordance with previously-established       amortization schedules (no pre-payments), inventory expenses       in advance of re-opening businesses, and past-due inventory       invoices;        Expressly provide that businesses can participate in both       the PPP and EIDL loans, provided that funds are not spent on       the same expenses;        Set aside PPP funding to support our smallest businesses;       as well as minority-, veteran-, women-owned, and other       underserved businesses that may not have an existing business       banking relationship;        Expressly provide that Community Development Financial       Institutions (CDFIs) are authorized lenders under the       program;        Authorize the Treasury Department, the Federal Reserve,       and/or the SBA to purchase program loans for borrowers with       50 or more employees from the originating banks two weeks       after origination; and authorize the appropriate entity       purchase program loans for businesses with less than 50       employees immediately after origination; and        Ensure that small agricultural producers who employ       individuals under the H-2A program can have their payroll       expenses count for loan forgiveness purposes.        In addition to the PPP modifications, the Economic Injury       Disaster Loan (EIDL) Program that was included in the CARES       Act has been oversubscribed. The intended goal was to have       these loans paired with the PPP in order to provide       businesses a greater amount of liquidity. It has been clear       in our communications across the state that the program is       oversubscribed and EIDL needs significantly more funding and       improved efficiency to get the funding more quickly into the       economy. The CARES Act required EIDL advances of up to       $10,000 per loan to be delivered immediately, but the       oversubscription has caused the SBA to limit the amount of       those advances and they have been slow in arriving. EIDL       borrowers simply cannot wait for weeks for approval on       minimal advances. We must make sure the program is fully       funded so it can be useful for businesses.        We must also work to provide health care providers, both       those on the frontlines and those struggling with lost       revenue, the support they need. We request additional funding       through the Public Health and Social Services Emergency Fund       (PHSSEF) to support hospitals and health care providers in       the next phase of legislation. We must also ensure that there       is a transparent and evidence-based process in place to       provide relief to rural hospitals and health clinics,       Medicaid providers, including home and community-based       services providers, children's hospitals, nursing homes,       providers treating undocumented patients, and safety net       hospitals and clinics who provide critical, life-saving care       to underserved populations and were not addressed in the       Department of Health and Human Service's initial $30 billion       tranche of funding from the CARES Act.        Further, state and local governments and tribes are on the       front lines of responding to the crisis. The CARES Act       included $150 billion for these entities from the Coronavirus       Relief Fund and tens of billions of additional support for       education and housing needs. In addition to direct federal       support for education, housing, and public health needs, it       is critical that Congress provide an additional $500 billion       in flexible fiscal relief to states and hundreds of billions       of additional support directly to local governments without       population thresholds and with the flexibility to fill major       revenue shortfalls. We request robust funding to ensure       further flexible relief in the next legislative response. In       fact, any interim agreement between the leaders must include       this critical state and local funding.        Lastly, we are deeply disturbed by the severe deprivation       so many families are experiencing, manifested in scenes of       hours-long lines at food banks across the country. To       alleviate some of the pressure on the hardest-hit families,       we support increasing overall SNAP benefits by 15% and       continuing that increase until the public health crisis has       ended and the economy has returned to pre-crisis conditions,       along with other reforms to SNAP to cut red tape and expand       access to nutritional assistance.        Colorado is representative of America. We have remote rural       communities and large urban areas. We depend on the       agriculture industry, but we also have some of the most       cutting-edge technology companies in the world. We are known       for our restaurants, hotels, and outdoor recreation. Those       industries are supported by countless plumbers, electricians,       and contractors. And like America, we have our differences,       but above all, Coloradans are pragmatic--we do what works.       The ideas laid out in this letter reflect what Coloradans       have told us is needed to make these programs work. We should       waste no time in adopting them.        We thank you for your work on behalf of the American       public. We believe that we share the common goals of keeping       thousands of small businesses across Colorado and the nation       with the ability to retain as many workers as they can, our       hospitals and health care providers equipped with what they       need, and state and local governments and tribes with the       ability to respond during this pandemic. Should you require       additional information on these suggestions, our staffs are       able to further discuss. As you negotiate the next federal       response, we respectfully request you include these       modifications to the CARES Act and additional requests in       mind.            Sincerely,      Cory Gardner,        United States Senator.      Michael F. Bennet,        United States Senator.      Jared Polis,        Governor of Colorado.     I yield the floor.
