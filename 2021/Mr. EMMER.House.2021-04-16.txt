 Madam Speaker, I rise today to remember and honor the life  of Lindsay Overbay.   Lindsay lost her life, and several of her coworkers were injured, in  a tragic and senseless attack on the Allina Health Clinic in Buffalo,  Minnesota, on February 9.   We continue to pray for Lindsay and her family and for the full and  speedy recovery of her coworkers.   Lindsay was the best Minnesota has to offer. She devoted her life to  family and her community, and her career to caring for people. She was  only 37 years old. She leaves behind her husband, Donnie, and two young  children, Gavin and Ava.   Special thanks to Wright County Sheriff Sean Deringer and his  deputies and the city of Buffalo Police Department for their immediate  and professional response that ended the threat and prevented further  loss of life.   Our community must heal, and we will heal from this sad event, but we  will always remember Lindsay, Donnie, Gavin, Ava, and the entire Allina  family.                            ____________________
