 Mr. Speaker, today, we are taking up the San Francisco  Bay Restoration Act. This is legislation I have introduced every year  since 2010. Since then, the environmental conditions of the bay have  only grown worse.   The bay is the heart of the region, with a vibrant ecosystem that is  home to the largest estuary on the West Coast. It generates more than  $370 billion in goods and services annually and is home to more than  3\1/2\ million jobs.   Forty percent of the land in California drains to the estuary, as my  colleagues have mentioned. It also is home to more than 100 endangered  and threatened species. The region's tidal and seasonal wetlands  comprise a significant portion of America's coastal resources, yet over  the past 200 years, 90 percent of the bay's wetlands have been  destroyed by human activity.   Increased pollution from cars, homes, and communities in San  Francisco have absorbed into various creeks, rivers, and streams that  flow into the bay and the Pacific Ocean. By 2030, the expected sea- level rise in the bay area will exceed the rate at which the marshes  can elevate and move, effectively drowning them.   Despite the impending threats, Federal efforts for bay restoration  and pollution mitigation systems have failed to meet the enormous need.  Between 2008 and 2016, EPA's geographic programs invested only $45  million into the San Francisco Bay, while Puget Sound received over  $260 million and Chesapeake Bay $490 million. That is 10 times as much,  and the disparity becomes even more pronounced when you consider the  populations served. A mere $6 was spent on the bay for each resident of  the bay area, while almost $30 was spent for each resident living near  Chesapeake Bay and almost $60 per resident near Puget Sound.   In the most recent round of appropriations in early 2018, the San  Francisco Bay's appropriations remained at $4.8 million while smaller  geographic programs received substantially more, including Lake  Champlain with $8.3 million and Long Island Sound with $12 million.   The San Francisco Bay Restoration Act will authorize $25 million  annually for 5 years to fund water quality improvement efforts, wetland  and estuary restoration, endangered species recovery, and adaption to  climate change. We are just asking for our fair share of the dollars  set aside for estuary restoration.                                time  1315
