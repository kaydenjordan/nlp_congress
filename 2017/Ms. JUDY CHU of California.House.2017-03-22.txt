 Mr. Speaker, Republicans rushed their pay  more for less healthcare bill through committees before CBO even had a  chance to score it. And then, once they realized that 24 million people  would lose coverage, they made late night additions just 2 days before  the House is scheduled to vote.   Americans' health care is too important to be done on an artificial  deadline. It is too important for people in my district like Rachel.  Rachel is a hairdresser in her midthirties, who was finally able to get  health coverage for her husband and three children, thanks to the ACA.  But under the Republican plan, their coverage will be replaced by tax  credits that don't even come close to meeting the healthcare costs for  a family of five.   And there are millions just like her struggling to make ends meet.  Instead of abandoning people like Rachel to give tax breaks to the  wealthiest few, I urge Republicans to do what even Trump promised-- provide health insurance for everybody. That starts with rejecting this  bill.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to voice my  strong opposition to the American Health Care Act, or TrumpCare.   TrumpCare would result in 24 million people losing healthcare  coverage. In my Pasadena, California, district, nearly 70,000 people  will lose coverage. In Los Angeles County, about 1 million people will  lose the coverage they have through Medicaid expansion.   Worst of all, this bill would result in skyrocketing healthcare  costs, especially for older Americans. It would hurt people like my  constituent Patty from Claremont. Patty is 62 and never had to worry  about health care because her husband was a union member with a good  job, but in one moment, Patty's life was turned upside down.   Last September, Patty's husband passed away, suddenly. In the blink  of an eye, Patty was forced to find new insurance for herself and her  20-year-old son who suffers from a preexisting condition. She couldn't  afford COBRA and is a few years away from being eligible for Medicare.   Well, thank goodness the ACA came along and she was finally able to  get affordable healthcare insurance. She was so relieved.   But what will happen to Patty's insurance under TrumpCare? We only  have to look at the CBO's estimate that a 64-year-old making $26,500 a  year could see their health insurance premiums skyrocket from $1,700 a  year to $14,600. That amounts to over half their income.   For Patty, these changes could mean thousands in out-of-pocket  expenses for her hypertension medication, which she needs to take  consistently or face life-threatening consequences. Patty would face a  situation that so many older Americans would face: premiums that would  rise by 20 to 25 percent by 2026. The premiums rise because, in this  bill, the GOP created an age tax which allows older Americans to be  charged five times more than younger Americans.   Now, in this bill, there is no concrete plan to help older Americans  like Patty deal with the rising cost of premiums under TrumpCare. And  certainly nothing in this bill will address the enormous deductibles or  out-of-pocket costs that they will face if insurance companies can once  again offer substandard plans with limited benefits. You know, so many  people like Patty are just one accident away from losing coverage.   Why is she and 24 million other Americans going to suffer so that, in  this bill, health insurance executives earning over $500,000 can get a  tax break? so that the wealthy can get $600 billion wealthier? so that  400 of the Nation's richest families can get a $7 million tax cut every  year?   You know, the term ``coverage loss'' isn't some political tool. It  has real life-threatening consequences for people of all ages and  incomes across the country.   The bill before us today has been crafted behind closed doors. We  have had no hearings on this legislation, and Republicans have not  accepted a single Democratic amendment to the bill.   There are just too many American lives at stake. I urge my colleagues  to oppose TrumpCare.
