 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to  submit extraneous material for the Record.    Mr. Speaker, in this magnificent Chamber, we have honored  Presidents and other heads of state. We have honored titans of business  and industry, science and medicine, the arts and entertainment, and  academia and sports. Young and old, we have welcomed the best and  brightest America has to offer, and we have been the envy of the world  when it comes to personal achievement.   Mr. Speaker, that is why I am here today, to recognize and honor an  individual with remarkable accomplishment. His name is Bruce Rollinson.  He is affectionately known as Rollo.   For the past 34 years, he has been the head football coach of one of  America's truly elite high school football teams, the Mater Dei  Monarchs of Santa Ana, California.   Rollo announced some weeks ago that he was going to retire from  coaching. Now, as a fan of high school athletics, I could not let the  moment pass without recognizing this legend in coaching.   I first got to know Rollo back in 2019 when he brought his football  team to the Nation's Capital for a game against one of this area's top  teams. I was asked by a parent of one of his players to escort the team  through the United States Capitol. Little did I know that team happened  to be the Nation's top-ranked high school football team and was led by  a young quarterback who was on his way to glory.   That quarterback was a kid named Bryce Young, who that very week had  [[Page H1430]]  decommitted from the University of Southern California and announced to  the world that he was going to become a member of the Crimson Tide at  Alabama. As you know, this young man became the second such player  under Coach Rollinson to win the coveted Heisman Trophy.   The tour became one of my favorite memories of my service in  Congress. The relationship I forged with Rollo and his staff and  players has been life-enhancing for me.   While most who follow Mater Dei and Coach Rollinson are well aware of  the records, well aware of the championships and the elite style of  football they represent, I became fascinated with Bruce the man, not  just the coach, and his legacy of building young men of character and  positioning them for success.   Football was his method. Excellence was always the goal. Mr. Speaker,  the results speak for themselves.   Today, Mr. Speaker, we are going to highlight a lot of Rollo's  credentials. It is fitting, in my judgment, to begin this tribute with  a colleague of mine who knows the Mater Dei success story better than  anyone in this Chamber and certainly anyone in Congress. He is   Mike  Gallagher. He is a Mater Dei alum, and he is here to share some  personal insights into this man we honor today.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Gallagher).    Mr. Speaker, back in October I was invited by our current  majority leader, then the minority whip, to accompany him on a West  Coast swing. We landed in Santa Ana, California, about 2 hours ahead of  a program that we were going to have.    I asked the whip at the time: What are we going to do for 2 hours?  [[Page H1431]]    I think the answer was: I don't know. We will go find some coffee or  we will kill some time before our program begins at 5.   I said: Well, I have an idea, why don't we Google how far Mater Dei  High School is, and let's go over there and watch the high school  football team play. They are going to practice in a few minutes. He  agreed to do that, and we did.   It was a remarkable visit: five Members of Congress with a police  escort pulling up to Mater Dei, and getting to see this remarkable  football team ready to practice.   My colleague, Mr. Gallagher, talked about sacrifice. This next  gentleman is a living example of somebody who has endured personal  sacrifice on behalf of something greater than himself--this country.   Mr. Speaker, it is my honor and privilege to yield to the gentleman  from Louisiana (Mr. Scalise), the distinguished majority leader of the  U.S. House of Representatives, and my friend.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the leader for his remarks.   Mr. Speaker, another Member of Congress who was on that trip to the  West Coast was my friend from Texas, Pat Fallon. Pat played for Lou  Holtz at Notre Dame--a national championship when he was there. I have  got to tell you, Mr. Speaker, when we walked in the foyer of the  gymnasium and saw the trophy case with three prominent Heisman Trophies  side by side, it made an impression on me because you can walk into  virtually any high school in America and not see one. But at Mater Dei  there are three, and one of those, in particular, ended up moving on to  the University of Notre Dame where he won the Heisman Trophy in 1964.   Here to share some of his insights, as well, based on that trip is my  friend from Texas, Pat Fallon.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Fallon).    Mr. Speaker, I thank Pat for his words.   Yes, we have come a long way since the days when you played with  leather helmets without face masks.   There is little doubt that coaching a player who wins the Heisman  Trophy is a distinction that few can claim. Rollo has coached two.   The first was Matt Leinart, the 2001 graduate of Mater Dei whose  playing career at the University of Southern California earned him  college football's highest honor. I spoke with Matt ahead of this  tribute, and he asked me to include these words into the Record in  recognizing his former high school coach.   Matt Leinart:         As an athlete growing up, you have big dreams, and you can       be only so lucky to have people that can help you reach those       dreams. Coach Rollo had that impact in my life. He was not       only a coach, but a mentor and a father figure. He has had a       tremendous impact in my life in only ways that he knows.        This past year has been one of the best of my life because       I got to watch my 16-year-old son play for Mater Dei and play       for my coach.        As I watched Cole throw his first varsity touchdown pass,       he walked off and hugged Rollo on the sideline. It was a full       circle moment for me that I will always remember. Rollo is       family and one of the greatest men I know. Thank you for       teaching me the many life lessons that I have needed to grow       into the man I am today. Love you Coach.        Matt Leinart.    But there was a second Heisman Trophy winner who followed, and I  spoke of him earlier.   Ms. Kamlager-Dove is a colleague of mine in this bipartisan tribute  to Bruce Rollinson. Sydney Kamlager-Dove represents the 37th District  in California, and she has some special words for the coach and I  believe some comments from his second Heisman Trophy winner.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from California (Ms.  Kamlager-Dove).    Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for her remarks.   Bruce Rollinson is a 1967 graduate of Mater Dei. His team won the CIF  4-A championship in 1965 and played in the game of the decade against  Anaheim High School in Anaheim Stadium. He played defensive back and  wide receiver for John McKay at USC. He played in the 1970 Rose Bowl  when USC beat Michigan. Coach Rollo became the head coach in Mater Dei  in 1988 after 7 years as an assistant.   By the time it is all over, here are the numbers that qualify him for  legendary status and precisely the reason we are standing here today:   Overall record: 341 wins, 87 tough losses, and two draws.   Eight CIF championships, four State championships, five national  championships, and a parade of NCAA players, many of whom went on to  prosperous national football league careers.    Mr. Speaker, I have also asked one of my distinguished colleagues  from California across the aisle to join us in this tribute today. He  happens to be Rollo's own Congressman from the Santa Ana, California,  area.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. Correa).    Mr. Speaker, a number of friends, family, and colleagues  of Coach Rollinson wanted to offer their congratulations as part of  this tribute today. Time will not permit me to read all of those  comments, but I do want to read one because this comes from the  Rollinson family. This is from Caroline Flanagan and Catherine--who I  know as Cat--Pederson:   ``We are so incredibly proud of our dad, Coach Rollinson, known to  his grandchildren as Coach or even occasionally, Coachie.   ``Growing up, he made us a part of the Mater Dei football family, but  he also made sure that when he came home football was on the back  burner, and he was just our dad. He stayed up late to help us study for  tests, got up with us when we had an early-start class, and was present  in every way.   ``When we were in college, a call from him was an instant mood boost,  and he knew how to fire us up for a test so that we walked in feeling  like we could either take an exam or play a football game.   ``He is truly the best person we know. He lives his values day in and  day out. He makes us better people, and he has that rare gift of being  able to bring out the best in everyone who knows him. His faith and his  family are what drive him, and for the past 7 years we've gotten to see  him in possibly his greatest role--as a grandfather. Our kids get to  learn from the best and be loved by the best.   ``Coach Rollinson has won numerous championships and accolades on the  football field, but we are most proud of him for who he is to our  family, and we can't wait to see what the next chapter brings. We love  you, Coach.''   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record of today's tribute the remaining  comments from family, friends, fellow coaches, and others.                      Tribute to Coach Bruce Rollinson                                 John Hopkins         Rollo, from my initial hiring in 1989, ``get him a shirt''       to your last game in 2022, it has been my honor and privilege       to have coached with you. Your daily message of, ``you       control the effort and God controls the outcome'', has made       me a better coach, husband, father, grandfather, and       businessman. Competition is what has made this Country GREAT,       and competition amongst our players and Coaches is what you       have instilled in us, to be Great. We have been together for       34 years and 430 games, and while we have had some highs and       some lows, the highs have far outweighed the lows, and the       experience coaching with you is a memory I will cherish       forever! Love ya brother, and all the best . . . Coach Hops                                  Leo Boese         THANK YOU, on behalf of all your players over the last 34       years for the love, dedication and life lessons you have       taught them. THANK YOU, on the half of all the parents who       have experienced through their sons the many life lessons you       have taught them. THANK YOU, on behalf of all your coaches       over the years and your ability to teach them what an       outstanding husband, father, leader and mentor is. THANK YOU,       for teaching all of us discipline, toughness, dedication,       loyalty, hard work, accountability, perseverance, how to       handle adversity, and integrity in all we strive to do. THANK       YOU, constantly demonstrating to all of us the qualities of a       true Monarch, POISE--PRIDE--COURAGE. For all of those you       have touched and imprinted in our hearts and minds the       virtues of our three stripes! THANK YOU, always taking time       to listen to your players or their families in times of need.       THANK YOU, being a true and unwavering friend. You will never       be forgotten by those you have touched . . . Leo Boese                                 Geri Campeau         Bruce Rollinson has been a dedicated and inspiring teacher,       mentor and friend for over 35 years. His passion for       education and commitment to developing his players is truly       admirable. A true servant leader, Bruce challenges those he       works with to achieve their full potential through the values       of pride, poise and courage. I am honored to know him and       blessed to be his friend.          Rollinson Family--Caroline Flanagan and Catherine Pederson         We are so incredibly proud of our dad, Coach Rollinson,       known to his grandchildren as ``Coach'' or even occasionally,       ``Coachie.'' Growing up he made us a part of the Mater Dei       football family, but he also made sure that when he came home       football was on the back burner and he was just our dad.

He is truly the best person we know. He       lives his values day in and day out. He makes us better       people, and he has that rare gift of being able to bring out       the best in everyone who knows him.

Our kids get to learn from the best, and be loved by the       best. Coach Rollinson has won numerous championships and       accolades on the football field, but we are most proud of him       for who he is to our family, and we can't wait to see what       the next chapter brings. We love you, Coach!              Michael Brennan--President, Mater Dei High School         Bruce Rollinson has been a dedicated Mater Dei High School       employee for 47 years and our Head Football Coach for the       last 34 years/seasons. While known for being a winning       football coach, he is equally known for being a eucharistic       minister during Mass. His love for God, Christ and Mary Mater       Dei is first and foremost who he is. This faithful       relationship allows him to express a deep commitment and       authentic care towards each and every football player. His       players understand that he loves and cares for them  [[Page H1434]]       and thus are willing to accept the grind of being a member of       the Mater Dei High School Football program. On behalf of the       entire community, and with Honor-Glory-Love, we humbly say,       `Thank You Coach!'     Patrick Murphy--Former President, Principal & Assistant Principal,                     Mater Dei High School (1990-2020)         It was my tremendous honor and privilege to work alongside       Mater Dei High School Football Coach Bruce Rollinson for 30       years. Bruce enjoyed unprecedented success on the football       field but more importantly Coach Rollo positively touched and       influenced the lives of countless Monarchs off the field in       so many profound ways. Bruce Rollinson impacted thousands of       young men and women, in the classroom, on the athletic fields       and through his philanthropic outreach efforts for almost 5       decades at Mater Dei High School. Bruce's faith, passion,       enthusiasm and commitment to Catholic Education and to his       beloved alma mater are unmatched. The positive impact that       Coach Rollo had on growth and development of MDHS will be       felt for decades to come and I am blessed to have been able       to call Bruce Rollinson my friend for 3 decades. Bruce,       congratulations on an amazing and unparalleled career of       incredible success, influential impact and caring outreach as       an educator and coach. You truly are One of a Kind and Mater       Dei High School has been blessed with your presence for       almost 50 years. All my very best to you, Laurie, your       beautiful daughters and your wonderful grandchildren. Take       care and God Bless, my friend.                                 Kevin Turner         I will preface by noting I have had the honor to work as a       broadcaster in Southern California covering high school,       college and professional sports for 30 years. What I have       always found remarkable about the coach was his God-given       ability to communicate and teach not just football but what       it takes to champion life skills that extend well beyond the       gridiron. The coach always talks about his former players,       not the ones that are NFL stars, Heisman trophy winners, or       olympians, but the young men and women who run companies,       fighting fires, practicing law, policing our streets or       serving our country. The everyday heroes is what coach wanted       the most for his players and support staff. Coach mastered       and executed his plan everyday and did it with passion. He       provided a platform and a place in what I believe is what       this country needs more than anything--an opportunity, that's       it. He had a famous saying you provide the effort God will       provide the outcome. Simple formula, all through structure       and discipline using tough love, faith-based principles and a       belief that through hard work and dedication dreams can come       true. God bless America and Bruce Rollinson.                               Tim Strader, Jr.         Coach Bruce Rollinson is way more than just a football       coach. From teaching me U.S. History 40 years ago to coaching       both of my sons at Mater Dei, Bruce has had a positive impact       on multiple generations in Southern California. While his       accomplishments on the field speak for itself, it is his way       of turning raw young athletes into respectful, faith-filled       young men that has set him apart. I congratulate him on an       incredible career and his recognition by the United States       House of Representatives is well deserved. Sincerely, Tim       Strader, Jr.                                 Josh Higgins         It's been a great privilege to both play for Coach       Rollinson then get to stand by his side as a coach for so       many years. The effect he has had on me is one that is shared       by hundreds of his former players over the past 34 years as       Mater Dei's Head Coach.        Coach Rollinson is foremost a wonderful husband, father,       and grandfather. He has led by example, especially when it       comes to family. His players proudly bring their families       back year after year to visit him and introduce their young       families to the man who help build them into who they have       become.        A true leader and builder of men, one of the very few men I       have known who could both yell and challenge you without you       ever thinking he didn't absolutely care and love you. His       tremendous ability to command and lead was by continually       demanding high expectations while knowing he put you in a       position to succeed.        Coach Rollinson always preached to parents to never make       excuses for their boys and for his players to always respect       their parents.        He taught us to honor our country and the men and women in       the military who keep us safe.        The legacy Coach Rollinson has achieved will endure for       generations. His fingerprints will remain on Mater Dei High       School in addition to the thousands of souls he has taught,       led, and guided to be successful people throughout life.    In October, Coach Bruce Rollinson coached his last game  after 34 years of distinguished service. The sport has said good-bye to  a legend.   Today, here on the floor of the people's House, you have heard of the  remarkable accomplishments of this dedicated coaching professional.   I want the country to know what the hundreds of young men who have  worn the Mater Dei Monarch colors already know, that Rollo is not just  a coach, he is a great man.   From all of us, for my colleagues who have spoken here today, for  sports fans across America who love and appreciate excellence in  coaching, we offer our congratulations to Bruce Rollinson from his  players, his coaches, his friends, and his family.   Enjoy a well-earned retirement. Go, Monarchs.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
