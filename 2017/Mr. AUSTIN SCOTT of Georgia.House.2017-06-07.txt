 Mr. Speaker, I would like to remind my  colleague that those shots were in my bag and on our side.   We are going to win again next year. We always enjoy the friendship,  and I look forward to seeing the gentleman again out there and standing  up for the rights of sportsmen. I certainly appreciate his friendship  and look forward to traveling again with him.
