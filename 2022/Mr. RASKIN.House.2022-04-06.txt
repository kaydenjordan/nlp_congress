 Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I  call up House Resolution 1023 and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 1023         Resolved, That if House Report 117-284 is called up by       direction of the Select Committee to Investigate the January       6th Attack on the United States Capitol: (a) all points of       order against the report are waived and the report shall be       considered as read; and (b)(1) an accompanying resolution       offered by direction of the Select Committee to Investigate       the January 6th Attack on the United States Capitol shall be       considered as read and shall not be subject to a point of       order; and (2) the previous question shall be considered as       ordered on such resolution to adoption without intervening       motion or demand for division of the question except one hour       of debate equally divided among and controlled by       Representative Thompson of Mississippi, Representative Cheney       of Wyoming, and an opponent, or their respective designees.    Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the  customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr.  Reschenthaler), pending which I yield myself such time as I may  consume. During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is  for the purpose of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, on Monday, the Rules Committee met and reported a rule,  House Resolution 1023. The rule provides for consideration of the  resolution accompanying House Report 117-284 under a closed rule if the  report is called up by direction of the Select Committee to Investigate  the January 6th Attack on the United States Capitol. The rule provides  1 hour of debate equally divided among and controlled by Chairman  Thompson, Vice Chair Cheney, and an opponent.   Mr. Speaker, if 90 percent of success in life is just showing up,  then 90 percent of acting in contempt of Congress is not showing up by  failing to respond to multiple subpoenas you have been lawfully served.  The rest of contempt is not turning over documents you have been  ordered to produce and acting with open disregard and scorn for the  rule of law, Congress, and representatives of the American people.   Neither Dan Scavino nor Peter Navarro has shown up in response to  repeated congressional subpoenas. They have blown us off completely.   Neither Mr. Scavino nor Mr. Navarro has produced a single document or  offered 1 minute of testimony in response to the subpoenas sent by the  House of Representatives.   While more than 800 Americans have come forward voluntarily or  properly responded to congressional subpoenas, which are orders under  penalty of law, saying you must show up to testify under oath and  invoke any asserted privileges in person, Scavino and Navarro have  followed Steve Bannon and are acting as if they are way too busy and  way too important to bother with the mere United States House of  Representatives. They think that having worked for a former President  of the United States excuses them from complying with lawful orders.   This is clearly false; this is clearly wrong; and we must make an  emphatic statement about it today.   Mr. Speaker, I ask America to consider this: If your son or daughter  were subpoenaed to come testify before the Congress of the United  States, would you advise them to sit home on the couch and blow it off?  I know I wouldn't.   Every year, thousands of Americans are held in criminal contempt for  ignoring their legal obligations to comply with a lawful subpoena  issued by courts or legislative bodies.   Here in the District of Columbia, you can be sent to jail for 6  months and fined $1,000 for acting in contempt of a subpoena and not  showing up. We have checked on multiple days and found, on any given  day, 7, 8, 10, or a dozen people are being found guilty of contempt in  the courts of the District of Columbia.   That is the exact same criminal offense that Mr. Scavino and Mr.  Navarro committed, and that is the exact same penalty they are facing  for their misconduct.   Each of these witnesses was given ample and repeated opportunities to  comply, opportunities that continue to this day. Yet, they openly and  brazenly flout the authority of the Congress and mock their own  personal duty to comply with the rule of law.   Legal contempt exists for those who act with open disregard or  disobedience of the law, especially when acting with scorn for the  authority of government. It exists precisely for cases like this.   Here is what has happened with Mr. Scavino. In September of last  year, the committee issued its first of three subpoenas. We asked him  to come testify before us on October 15, 2021, last year.   When he could not be found to actually accept service of the first  subpoena, we issued a second subpoena, asking him to appear before the  committee on October 28, 2021. He told the committee that wasn't enough  time for him; he needed 1 extra week.   We generously gave him a week, and we set a third deposition date of  November 4, 2021, but he didn't come on November 4 either. Instead, he  requested another extension.   Bending over backward to accommodate this witness, we set a fourth  deposition date of November 12, 2021. Still, that wasn't enough time  for him.   We acted in good faith again, and assuming he was acting in good  faith, we set a fifth deposition date of November 19. When that day  arrived, did he finally show up to do his civic duty? No, he did not.  Instead, he waited until the eve of the deposition and then, for the  first time, challenged the service of the subpoena.   Out of an abundance of deference and caution, and to make every  effort to demonstrate the respect for the rule of law that Scavino was  not showing, we issued yet a third subpoena inviting him to come  testify before us once again on December 1, 2021.   Finally, with Scavino completely out of excuses and the committee out  of patience, his final deposition date of December 1 arrived, and he  simply did not show up.   Six times this committee invited Scavino to testify, and six times he  stood us up. He stood the American people up. He refused to testify  before Congress about what he knows about the most dangerous and  sweeping assault on the United States Congress since the War of 1812,  which was by a foreign power.   But even after he failed to show up in December, the committee held  an open door for Mr. Scavino to come in and  [[Page H4217]]  testify. But in the more than 6 months since the committee's first  subpoena was sent to him, he has never once come in to speak with us.  He has not given us a single document, Mr. Speaker.    It is the same basic story with Mr. Navarro. On February 9, we issued  him a subpoena to produce documents on February 23 and to testify on  March 2. There have been repeated evasions and contortions by the  witness since then.   Generous accommodations have been offered by the committee, all of it  leading to nothing but his open contempt and mockery for this process  and for the rule of law. He never showed up, and he never produced a  single document.   When more than 800 Americans have voluntarily testified and complied  with the subpoenas rendered by our committee, the witnesses have  nothing but excuses for their noncompliance, excuses you would not  accept from a teenage child.   Navarro says he wants us to send him written interrogatories, and he  will answer his questions in writing. Wouldn't that be nice? Any  witness to a car accident, a murder, an assault, or an insurrection in  the land would love not to have to answer actual questions under sworn  oath, but that is not how our system works.   The word ``subpoena'' means ``under the penalty of law.'' ``Sub''  means under; ``poena'' means ``penalty of law.'' Under the penalty of  law, you show up and you answer questions in the United States of  America. If you think you have a legal privilege excusing you from  answering questions, you assert your privileges under oath, at the time  of questioning that you show up, to specific questions, whether it is  the attorney-client privilege; the Fifth Amendment privilege against  self-incrimination, which a number of witnesses have asserted before  our committee, as it is their legal right to do; the priest-penitent  privilege; or the executive privilege.   The Court has been clear. The Supreme Court has been clear. If you  think you have one of these privileges, you show up and you assert it  to the specific questions being asked to you. But the privilege against  self-incrimination, the executive privilege, the marital privilege,  none of these is a magic wand that you can wave from your sofa and not  show up under a subpoena to a lawful proceeding.   But Navarro continues to mutter the words ``executive privilege,'' as  if it is some kind of magic wand that would keep him from ever having  to testify about anything, like Harry Potter's invisibility cloak. He  even says, repeatedly, the executive privilege is not mine to waive,  which is high comedy, Mr. Speaker, because it is not his to waive,  which means, by definition, it is not his to invoke in the first place.   We know it is not his to invoke. The Supreme Court has been clear  about this, too. The executive privilege belongs to the President of  the United States of America, the actual President. President Biden has  specifically decided not to invoke executive privilege in Navarro's  case or in Scavino's case.   Yet, Navarro says the executive privilege here belongs to ex- President Donald Trump, which is not only extremely dubious but totally  irrelevant.   It is dubious because the Supreme Court just rejected a claim by  Donald Trump himself, in Trump v. Thompson, that his materials were  protected from disclosure to the January 6th Select Committee in  Congress by executive privilege.   Even if Trump were still the President, the Court essentially said  there is an overwhelming public interest in these materials that dwarfs  whatever dubious interest in executive secrecy may linger. So the claim  would fail, even if President Joe Biden were himself here to assert it  on behalf of Navarro and Scavino.   But Navarro's attempt to stand above the law by mentioning Donald  Trump's name is also completely irrelevant. Why? Everyone, please take  note of this: Because Donald Trump has never even asserted the  executive privilege to cover Peter Navarro, not once. We have received  no communication from Donald Trump, either directly or indirectly from  Navarro, showing that Trump is trying to exercise an executive  privilege claim, which is doomed to failure anyway under the logic of  the decision just rendered by the Supreme Court.   Mr. Speaker, so what do we have? Two guys in the District of Columbia  blowing off a congressional investigation and subpoenas into a deadly  insurrection, which caused multiple deaths; inflicted brutal, savage  injuries on 150 of our officers, who ended up with broken jaws, necks,  vertebrae, noses, traumatic brain injuries, post-traumatic stress  syndrome; and interrupted Congress from executing its constitutional  duties of counting electoral college votes for the very first time in  American history--oh, yes. And it nearly succeeded in overthrowing the  2020 Presidential election and toppling the peaceful transfer of power,  perhaps for all time, as United States District Court Judge Carter  wrote in a blistering opinion last week, rejecting this exact same and  equally ridiculous claim of John Eastman, who helped cook up the absurd  legal camouflage for this attempted coup in the first place against the  American constitutional system of government.   The gentlewoman, I think, said something about the Russian hoax or  Russian collusion. I accept the heckling, Mr. Speaker. That is all  right because if she wants to continue to stand with Vladimir Putin and  his brutal, bloody invasion against the people of Ukraine, she is free  to do so.   We understand there is a strong Trump-Putin axis in the gentlewoman's  party. If she wants to continue to stand with Vladimir Putin and Donald  Trump, that is her prerogative, but please do it on her own time  forthwith.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1330     Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   This is not a partisan investigation. We were created under House  Resolution 503 after, I am afraid, the gentleman and his colleagues  voted to thwart a totally bipartisan, independent outside commission  made up of five Democrats and five Republicans with equal subpoena  power simply because Donald Trump exercised his veto within the  Republican Party; the same Donald Trump who calls the madman, mass  murderer, Vladimir Putin, a genius, but we know we have some people  echoing all of Trump's complicity with Vladimir Putin from the Georgia  delegation back there.   This is a bipartisan committee. It is the only committee I am aware  of that has a Democratic chair in a Democratic-controlled House of  Representatives and a Republican vice chair, Ms. Cheney, who was the  head of the GOP Conference. She was the head of the House Republican  Conference, now the vice chair of this committee, and they call it a  partisan exercise.   The second point I need to make is that executive privilege must be  asserted by the President. This one isn't even asserted by the former  President. It is just somebody going in and saying, ``I have got an  executive privilege.''   Is that really the precedent that my colleagues want to set, Madam  Speaker? I mean, that is pretty astonishing if that is the position  that they are taking.   Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Pennsylvania  (Ms. Scanlon), my very distinguished colleague.    No, I don't yield for that purpose, which is an  extraneous and irrelevant distraction from the resolution. All time  yielded is for the purposes of debate only.    I am sorry?    Are you yielding?    You have not been heckled by any of our Members, while I  was heckled by----    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   More than 800 Americans have come to testify before our committee,  the minority leader should be notified before he leaves the Chamber.  Four of them have categorically refused and blown off the subpoenas of  the U.S. House of Representatives.   The minority leader attacks our committee as partisan and political,  as some of his colleagues do. Well, we are a bipartisan committee with  a Democratic chair and Republican vice chair.   But today, the minority leader gave the game away as he boiled over  with rage toward our committee. He gave the game away. He is very upset  that the former chair of the House Republican Conference has been  telling the truth about Donald Trump's big lie, his incitement of  violent insurrection, and the attack on American constitutional  democracy.   And that is why he is in the very embarrassing position of having  supported, offered, and pressed for an independent, 9/11-style  commission about the January 6 attack. And as the minority leader, he  asked for five Republicans and five Democrats. He asked for equal  subpoena power on both sides, equal staff on both sides.   And Chairman Thompson, who now chairs the January 6th Select  Committee and chairs the Homeland Security Committee, he agreed to it.  A lot of Democrats were upset about that. They said, we are in the  majority. Why should we agree to have everything 50/50, right down the  middle? But he agreed, and the Democrats agreed, because that is what  the Republicans offered.   Great. We were going to have a 9/11-style independent commission.   And then you know what happened? You know who vetoed it? The fourth  branch of government, Donald Trump, who some of their Members slavishly  report to like sycophants.   And Donald Trump said he didn't want any investigation into the  attack on this body, the Congress of the United States. He didn't want  any investigation at all.   And you know what the minority leader did? He walked it back. They  pulled the plug on the independent commission, and that is why we ended  up with the January 6th Select Committee in the House of  Representatives, which the Speaker has made sure is bipartisan and has  operated, in my experience, Mr. Speaker, as the most bipartisan  committee I have ever been on.   Why? Because we don't spend an hour at the beginning of each meeting  with a bunch of empty partisan gimmicks and stunts; the kind we just  saw, wasting the taxpayers' money and time; 20 minutes of that nonsense  going nowhere; at the same time that there is an actual hearing taking  place in Cannon 310, right now, by the Committee on Homeland Security,  on the question of the border.   But instead of attending the hearing, I counted at least five or six  different Members who were in that conga line. I will be interested to  know whether they are even going to go to the hearing afterwards.  Instead, they come and participate in that empty, absurd ritual,  wasting the time of this body.   But the minority leader comes here and, amazingly, attacks our  committee, when he sabotaged his own idea. But this committee is  closing in on the truth, and that is why we get all these circus antics  and all the attempts to distract the American people.   Mr. Speaker, if I had been dealt the hand that my friend from  Pennsylvania has been dealt today, as a lawyer, as a Member of  Congress, I suppose I would have done everything in my power to  distract the House of Representatives also from the business at hand.   We have two people who are flagrantly, brazenly defying the authority  of the House of Representatives of the United States in order to avoid  coming here to tell the truth. They are acting in contempt of Congress,  and we must hold them in contempt of Congress because of that.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I wanted to go back to something else that the minority leader said  in echo of the minority floor leader's points.   They cling to the suggestion that there is no valid legislative  purpose being conducted by the January 6th Select Committee; and they  also say it is unlawfully composed.   Well, that has been rejected by several courts. In fact, all of the  arguments that they are making have been rejected by the courts. I  don't think they have won a single case in court yet.   But check out Budowich v. Pelosi with Judge Boasberg, or Eastman v.  Thompson, where these courts said, not only is there a valid  legislative purpose, but this is the quintessential legislative  purpose; that is, guaranteeing the preservation of democratic self- government. If it is not a valid legislative purpose to investigate  violent attacks, insurrections, and attempted coups against the  government of the United States, then what is a valid purpose? The  courts have said, the courts have got that right. They have written  opinions.   I guess we are going to have to send a copy to the minority leader  because he is apparently oblivious to it.   But even without the courts slapping down everything they are saying  over there, just think about it. Would they really want to say that if  there are violent attacks taking place against the Capitol we can't  investigate it?   The Eastman decision also rejected the claim that we are somehow  unlawfully composed.   I have got to say something on behalf of Representative Liz Cheney,  who I probably disagree with on 90 percent of the issues we vote on  here. But she was just maligned and castigated by the minority leader  in an utterly unfair way.   She has operated with nothing but patriotism for this country and  constitutional patriotism for the rule of law and the processes that  define us. And they can overthrow her as the head of their caucus  because she doesn't bow down on the altar of Donald Trump and Vladimir  Putin the way that the gentlewoman from Georgia was heckling me does.  And they can attack her because she thinks for herself and doesn't act  like a cult member.   But we won't do that, even though we disagree with her on a lot of  issues, but she is a constitutional patriot, and I feel she is owed an  apology.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, before the gentleman goes, I want to tell the gentleman  from Texas that I would never accuse him of performing a stunt. I was  referring to the people who should have been in the Homeland Security  Committee hearing actually dealing with the issue they profess to be  talking about here on the floor under completely different auspices.   Let me go back to the questions offered by my distinguished friend  from Pennsylvania who said, well, if they really did have a valid  legislative purpose, as all these courts are saying, then they would be  talking to the former Sergeant at Arms--well, we have--and we would be  talking to the National Guard--we have.   Somebody is going to have to dust off the talking points over on that  side because we have heard from more than 800 people who were involved.   This has nothing to do with any kind of ideological witch hunt; this  has to do with an assault on American democratic institutions.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, before the gentleman leaves, I want to say a word about  the distinguished gentleman from New York. We are all blessed to have  Mr. Katko as a colleague. He is a brilliant lawyer and a man of  exceptional character and honor.   He was the one who had been tasked by the minority leader to  negotiate with the majority about creating an independent commission to  investigate the assault on American democracy that took place on  January 6. He was given very specific instructions, and he came back a  winner. He had gotten an agreement for five Republicans and five  Democrats, equal subpoena power right down the middle.   Alas for his caucus, alas for this Congress, alas for the country,  the leadership pulled the rug out from beneath him.   We are going to be very sorry to see Mr. Katko leave Congress at the  end of this session. We will all be impoverished by his absence.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers.    Mr. Speaker, I do want to thank my friend from  Pennsylvania. Sometimes when I hear him in the committee, I think about  another great Republican who served in the House of Representatives  from Pennsylvania, Thaddeus Stevens. But today, my friend let me down a  little bit because Thaddeus Stevens was a great enemy of insurrection  and rebellion. He led the forces in this Congress who insisted upon  accountability for the people who would dare wage war against the  Congress of the United States and against the Union and the people who  were all elected to serve and to represent.   Justice Kavanaugh, of course, was not ruling in the case that my good  friend cited before. He was just opining. There was no ruling there. So  that was one Justice's opinion.   My friend cuts me to the quick when he says that we don't care about  the separation of powers. I think I am going to have to turn that  insult around and say that they don't care about the separation of  powers because the executive privilege of the Supreme Court has  repeatedly held, going all the way back to 1953, in a case called the  United States v. Reynolds that the executive privilege may be invoked  only by the President of the United States.   And this President of the United States, who represents the Article  II branch, has said he is not invoking it on behalf of Scavino or  Navarro. He has rejected it.   The funny part is that the former President they talked about hasn't  even shown up to try to invoke it. And what they are talking about  doing could never be the subject of executive privilege anyway because  it is political activity, which is a crime under the Hatch Act. It is  criminal activity. It is a crime to engage in insurrection and coup.   How could executive privilege--even if you had a President who wanted  nothing more than to try to drape the activities of Scavino and Navarro  in executive privilege, how could that President ever prove that it  applied? Navarro's job, for example, was the trade adviser. This has  nothing to do with trade. He was engaged in trying to overthrow a  Presidential election, as Judge Carter said last week.   Mr. Speaker, this is a matter of the utmost solemnity and seriousness  to the American people. We are talking about the survival of American  democratic government. For most of human history, people have lived  under people like Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump, the kings, the  queens, the dictators, the tyrants, and the bullies whom some people  would want to flatter.   But we have something else going on here in America. We have got a  project in democratic self-government. Lincoln knew how tenuous it was.  He asked whether government of the people, by the people, and for the  people shall last or shall perish from the Earth.   That is the question facing us, too. So let's deal with all the  issues and controversies we want. But couldn't we get together and all  stand up for the institutions of the country?   We are doing that in our committee, which is bipartisan. I fear that  sometimes we are moving into a Democratic/Republican caucus in Congress  and a Trump caucus. There are those of us, like Ms. Cheney, like Mr.  Kinzinger, and like Mr. Thompson on the committee, who want to work  together to get to the bottom of this and then to deal with the  problems of the country. And then there are those, like the minority  leader, who will follow the will of Donald Trump if he says he doesn't  want any investigation at all.   I am sorry, Mr. Speaker, but that is where we are today. These two  witnesses have acted with contempt towards Congress and the American  people. We must hold them in contempt of Congress and the American  people.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I  move the previous question on the resolution.    Madam Speaker, I want to underscore first the point that  was just made by Ms. Cheney. The distinguished ranking member of the  House Administration Committee was appointed to this committee, or the  appointment was accepted by Speaker Pelosi, but it was withdrawn by the  minority leader. It was not rejected by the majority; it was rejected  by the minority.   Madam Speaker, we are here in the broadest sense to defend American  democratic institutions and the rule of law. And our colleague said  before that if this investigation were valid, then we would be talking  to officials from the Sergeant at Arms Office and the National Guard.   Well, I have got good news for my friends. First, every court that  has looked at their claim that this is an invalid investigation either  because of its composition or because it was intrinsically flawed in  its pursuit of the facts about January 6, has rejected those arguments.  Every court that looked at it has rejected the precise arguments our  colleagues are floating on the floor today.   But I will go even further than that. We have, in fact, interviewed  precisely the people that they set up as a test for the validity of our  investigation from the Sergeant at Arms and the National Guard. And as  patriotic public officials living out their oaths of office and not  bowing down to the humiliating cult of Donald Trump, they didn't need a  subpoena from this committee; they came voluntarily. They not only  understood their legal duty to testify, a duty our colleagues, like my  friend, the gentleman from Ohio, clearly understands when they wield  the gavel, but they have come forward and said that it is a patriotic  honor for them. It is not just a legal duty, it is a patriotic honor  for them to render truthful testimony on this horrific attack against  America, which interrupted the counting of electoral college votes for  the first time in American history.                                time  1745    This is mandated in the 12th Amendment to the Constitution, which  says that the House and the Senate must meet in joint session in order  to count electoral college votes the first week of January, on the  Wednesday following a Presidential election.   What is remarkable to me is that the caucus that is now so drenched  in the Trump-Putin propaganda is not just trying to denounce the  Democrats for searching the truth right now. Today, they have begun the  utterly cannibalistic process of vilifying and castigating Republicans  just because they disagree with the orthodoxy, the dogma handed down by  Donald Trump.   Ms. Cheney is the former chair of the House Republican Conference,  and it is left to Democrats to defend her against the vilification and  the castigating that we hear.    It is up to us to defend Mr. Kinzinger and to defend Ms.  Cheney, because if you don't go along with what Donald Trump says, if  you don't act like you are a robot, or a member of a religious cult,  they will attack you, they will vilify you, they will denounce you.   These people, Mr. Kinzinger and Ms. Cheney, are constitutional  heroes, and they don't deserve your contempt. The insurrectionists and  the lawbreakers deserve your contempt because they are acting in  contempt of the rule of law and the Constitution of the United States.
