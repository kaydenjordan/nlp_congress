 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Jon Van  Utrecht of Ottumwa.   Since its creation in 1854 in Fairfield, Iowa, the Iowa State Fair  has been a yearly tradition for Iowans, attracting millions of people  from across the country. With a wide variety of entertainment, food,  and activities, such as the world-famous butter cow, it is not  surprising why millions are attracted to the fair.   Each year, farmers across Iowa are encouraged to enter a variety of  crops to be judged for size, weight, and quality. One of my favorite  things to do at the State fair is attending competitions and seeing the  impressive crops our farmers have grown.   That is why I was thrilled to see Ottumwa's Jon Van Utrecht's pumpkin  as one of the winners of the big pumpkin competition. Jon's pumpkin  came in sixth place and weighed 300 pounds.   Iowa's State Fair is filled with countless entertainment options for  families across Iowa and shows why Iowa is the best place to live,  work, play, and raise a family. I look forward to seeing what next year  brings.   I would also like to take this opportunity to wish a happy birthday  to Helen Friell. On September 23, Helen will become 100 years old.   Happy birthday, Helen.                            ____________________
