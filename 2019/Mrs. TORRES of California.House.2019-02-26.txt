 Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee  on Rules, I call up House Resolution 144 and ask for its immediate  consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 144         Resolved, That upon adoption of this resolution it shall be       in order to consider in the House the joint resolution (H.J.       Res. 46) relating to a national emergency declared by the       President on February 15, 2019. All points of order against       consideration of the joint resolution are waived. The joint       resolution shall be considered as read. All points of order       against provisions in the joint resolution are waived. The       previous question shall be considered as ordered on the joint       resolution and on any amendment thereto to final passage       without intervening motion except: (1) one hour of debate       equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking       minority member of the Committee on Transportation and       Infrastructure; and (2) one motion to recommit.        Sec. 2.  The provisions of section 202 of the National       Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622) shall not apply during the       remainder of the One Hundred Sixteenth Congress to a joint       resolution terminating the national emergency declared by the       President on February 15, 2019.     Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate  only, I yield the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia  (Mr. Woodall), pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume.  During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the  purpose of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members be given 5 legislative days to revise and extend their  remarks.    Mr. Speaker, on Monday, the Rules  Committee met and reported a rule, House Resolution 144, providing for  consideration of H.J. Res. 46, relating to a national emergency  declared by the President on February 15, 2019.   The rule provides for consideration of the legislation under a closed  rule. The rule provides 1 hour of debate equally divided and controlled  by the chair and ranking member of the Committee on Transportation and  Infrastructure.   Additionally, the rule provides that the provisions of section 202 of  the National Emergencies Act shall not apply during the remainder of  the 116th Congress to a joint resolution terminating the national  emergency declared by the President on February 15, 2019. This  provision was included to avoid privileged legislative action on  redundant resolutions.   Mr. Speaker, today we must stand up for democracy; we must stand up  for the rule of law; and, most importantly, we must stand up for the  United States Constitution, the Constitution that we took an oath to  defend when we were sworn into office.   Mr. Speaker, the Constitution we swore to defend granted Congress the  power of the purse. That means Congress decides how we spend the  American people's hard-earned money.   Congress spoke when we passed, and President Trump signed, a spending  bill that granted him $1.4 billion for fencing along the border. Now  President Trump is acting like a dictator by ignoring Congress and  declaring a national emergency. As a result, billions of taxpayer  dollars would be taken from high-priority military construction  projects that ensure our troops have the essential training, readiness,  and quality of life necessary to keep the American people safe.   Mr. Speaker, as a former member of the Foreign Affairs Committee, I  have visited countries where the rule of law takes a backseat to the  whims of their Presidents. Just look at Venezuela, where Nicolas Maduro  has removed every single obstacle to his power.   When he objected to the rulings of the judges, he ended their terms  early and replaced them with his political allies. When the  democratically elected congress didn't agree with him, he created a new  congress filled with his supporters.   Last year, he even banned prominent opposition leaders from running  into the Presidential election. He has demonized the press and even  took CNN en Espanol off the air. Last night, he detained one of  America's journalists, Jorge Ramos, of Univision.   Fighting with judges, manipulating elections, attacking the press.  Mr. Speaker, does any of this sound familiar?   Now you have a situation where food is so scarce that the average  Venezuelan has lost 24 pounds in the last year and more than 3 million  have fled the country. The Maduro presidency, now that is a true  national emergency for the people of Venezuela.  [[Page H2113]]    The collapse of democratic institutions is also happening in  Nicaragua and Guatemala. The President of Guatemala and his allies in  congress are taking the country down the same path, removing every  check on their power. They have expelled the international prosecutors  who dared to investigate them.   And just as Guatemala's Government has tried to undermine and  delegitimize the police and prosecutors who are investigating,  President Trump has called Robert Mueller's investigation a ``witch  hunt'' and denigrated the brave men and women of the FBI.   Mr. Speaker, we cannot allow this President--or any President,  Republican or Democrat--to take us down the same path as Venezuela,  Guatemala, and Nicaragua, all to build a wasteful and ineffective wall  along our southern border.   These women and children coming from Central America do not represent  a national emergency. That is why 58 former national security  officials, both Republicans and Democrats, issued a statement saying  there is ``no factual basis'' for the President's emergency.   Our call to duty today is to protect, to defend our Constitution. We  will vote, and we will see how many in this body have that same respect  for the rule of law.                                time  1230    Mr. Speaker, I urge our Republican colleagues to join us in this  effort. It is not too late for my colleagues across the aisle to tell  the President that this is wrong, that the Constitution that we swore  an oath to uphold really matters.   We stand here today to stop this power grab of our own democracy. A  ``yes'' vote will affirm our democracy. A ``no'' vote further erodes  the trust in our democracy and, again, expands executive power.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues on which side they stand.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time  as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I can think of many other things that we could be  talking about that truly, truly, truly call out and scream out for a  national emergency.   Homelessness in our communities: Thousands of people in our  communities sleep on a street, under a bridge, children sleeping in  vehicles every single night.   I think about the opioid epidemic, and how many of our families are  simply immune to the issues around drug abuse and how addiction  overcomes them?   I think about last year around Christmastime when 800,000 of our  Federal workers were going without a paycheck and went without a  paycheck for 35 days. Yet my colleagues on the other side of the aisle  could not find 1 minute and 6 seconds to give them a paycheck, to open  up the Federal Government, to do their duty.   Instead, in the Rules Committee, we took up an emergency order on  labeling of cheese curds. They found that to be more important than the  lives and the families of 800,000 Federal workers.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms.  Jackson Lee).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, we can talk about the scary people from our southern  border. I am not that scary looking, am I? I think not. The fact is  that the number one trading partner for California and Texas is Mexico,  a friendly country. For Central America, we are standing up for our  responsibility to uphold democracy in the Northern Triangle, to address  the root cause of migration. That is where our focus should be.   Do we need an immigration reform package that brings 11 million  people out of the shadows? Absolutely. These are the 11 million people  who our agricultural partners depend on to deliver fresh food to our  table. But we are not doing that here. What we are doing here, what the  President has chosen to do, is political theater, political theater for  2020.   In essence, a vote against this resolution means a vote against the  families of the military people who are depending on us to provide  infrastructure, schools for their children to learn, and quality  housing.   Do Democrats think and believe that fortifying our borders is  important? Absolutely. We have committed billions of dollars to ensure  that we stop the narcotrafficking that happens at our ports of entry.  That is where it is happening.   We need to work together on these issues, not relinquish our  responsibilities, our legislative responsibility, and the power of the  purse that we hold.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, political theater, political  posturing for 2020, that is what we are hearing.   This is the law. This is the Rules Committee moving forward a piece  of legislation that will prevent the President from calling a bogus  national emergency, from stealing money from our troops, from taking  from those who don't have and those who are giving everything that they  have to protect our Nation. Political posturing for 2020.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from California (Ms. Lee).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. Cicilline).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Velazquez).     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of  my time.   Mr. Speaker, fact-checking the President is not an attack against the  President. The facts matter. As a matter of fact, the President himself  at his press conference said: ``I didn't need to do this, but I'd  rather do it much faster.''   What does he mean by that? Last year, Republicans gave him $25  billion if they read the bill, but I actually brought it to their  attention on the floor that the bill actually read $75 billion that  they were allocating for a border wall. The facts didn't matter then  for one side of the aisle.   The President himself said it. ``I didn't need to do this, but I'd  rather do it much faster.'' That is not an emergency. I was a 911  emergency dispatcher for 17.5 years. I can cite many examples of what  an emergency is. Building a wall much faster is not an emergency. That  is political theater. That is political posturing for 2020.   Where is the President stealing this money from? Certainly, he is not  getting it from Mexico as he promised. Mexico said ``no.'' The  President is stealing $2.5 billion that Congress approved to combat  illegal drug activities around the world.   I know that my colleagues believe that fighting international drug  organizations is important. I know this because I traveled with  Republicans and Democrats to the jungles in South America. We talked  about eradication of narcotrafficking.   What about the $3.6 billion that the President is stealing from  military construction? A study earlier this year found that 16 percent  of military families had a positive view of their base housing. That  means 55 percent had a negative one.   Many families reported unsafe conditions, including lead-based paint,  rampant mold, exposed asbestos, faulty electrical wiring, vermin  infestations, and gas leaks. Is that not an emergency? Is that not  worthy of the bipartisan vote that we took to allocate that money so  that they can make those fixes?   I know my Republican colleagues support military families. I know  that because I have traveled with them to Afghanistan. I have traveled  with them to other countries. I know that this is wrong. This so-called  national emergency is wrong, and I know my colleagues know that this is  wrong too. This is undemocratic. This puts us at the cusp of a  constitutional crisis.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the previous question  and the rule.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of our Constitution and in  defense of our republic and urge all members to join me in voting for  H.J. Res. 46, which terminates the phony declaration of emergency  issued by the President on February 15, 2019.   The reason this resolution is before us today is because of the  petulant intransigence of a single person, the current President of the  United States.   As a senior member of the Committee on the Judiciary and the  Committee on Homeland Security, I have visited the southern border on  numerous occasions in recent weeks and months and can state confidently  that there is no national emergency or national security crisis that  justifies the President's reckless and unconstitutional decision or  compels the Congress to abdicate its responsibilities under Article I  to check and balance the Executive Branch.   The President is only pursuing this tactic of declaring a national  emergency after realizing that Speaker Nancy Pelosi was absolutely  correct when she informed him that he did not have the support in  Congress to require the taxpayers to pay for his broken promise that  ``Mexico would pay for the wall, 100 percent!''   In fact, according to the latest Marist Poll, the most recent polling  data available, Americans overwhelmingly disapprove of the President's  national emergency declaration by a 61 percent-36 percent margin.   The President's decision is opposed by both men and women in every  region of the country, by every income group and education category.   National security experts across the political spectrum are unanimous  in their assessment that the situation on the southern border does not  constitute a national emergency, an assessment echoed by leading former  Republican senators and Members of Congress.   They understand that after failing to convince the American people or  Congress to pay for his ineffective, wasteful, and immoral multibillion  dollar concrete wall, the President has now embarked on a course of  conduct that is deeply corrosive of the constitutional system of checks  and balances wisely established by the Framers and which has served  this nation and the world so well for nearly 250 years.   Having failed miserably to achieve his objective in the  constitutional legislative process, the President is trying a desperate  11th hour end-run around Congress with an unlawful emergency  declaration that contravenes the will of the American people and  negates the awesome power of the purse vested exclusively in the  Congress of the United States.   The Congress will not tolerate this.   Despite being repeatedly admonished and in the face of overwhelming  evidence to the contrary, the President continues to propagate false  information regarding the state of our southern border.   Mr. Speaker, these are the facts.   Net migration from Mexico is now zero or slightly below (more people  leaving than coming) because of a growing Mexican economy, an aging  population and dropping fertility rates that have led to a dramatic  decrease in unauthorized migration from Mexico.   Migrant apprehensions continue to be near an all-time low with only a  slight increase from 2017.   The combined 521,090 apprehensions for Border Patrol and Customs  agents in fiscal year 2018 were 32,288 apprehensions fewer than the  553,378 apprehensions in 2016.   To put this in perspective, on average, each of the 19,437 Border  Patrol agents nationwide apprehended a total of only 19 migrants in  2018, which amounts to fewer than 2 apprehensions per month.   In the last few years, an increased proportion of apprehensions are  parents seeking to protect their children from the violence and extreme  poverty in Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala.   But even with more Central Americans arriving to our southern border  seeking protection, total apprehension rates are still at their lowest  since the 1970s.   The absence of a massive wall on the southern border will not solve  the drug smuggling problem because, as all law enforcement experts  agree, the major source of drugs coming into the United States are  smuggled through legal ports of entry.   The southern border region is home to about 15 million people living  in border counties in California, Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas.   These communities, which include cities such as San Diego, Douglas,  Las Cruces, and El Paso, are among the safest in the country.   Congress has devoted more U.S. taxpayer dollars to immigration  enforcement agencies (more than $21 billion now) than all other  enforcement agencies combined, including the FBI, DEA, ATF, US  Marshals, and Secret Service.   The bulk of this money goes to U.S. Customs and Border Protection  (CBP), with a budget of $14.4 billion in fiscal year 2018 and more than  59,000 personnel.   CBP is the largest law enforcement agency in the country, and more  than 85 percent of the agency's Border Patrol agents (i.e., 16,605 of  19,437) are concentrated on the southern border.   Expanded deployment of the military to the border to include active- duty troops could cost between $200 and $300 million in addition to the  estimated $182 million for the earlier deployment by the President of  National Guard to the border.   Mr. Speaker, having been soundly defeated legislatively by Congress,  a co-equal branch of government, the President wants to finance border  wall vanity project by diverting funds that the Congress has  appropriated for disaster recovery and military construction.   The funds the President wants to steal were appropriated by Congress  to help Americans devastated by natural disasters, like Hurricanes  Harvey, Irma and Maria, or for other purposes like military  construction.   Congress did not, has not, and will not, approve of any diversion of  these funds to construct a border wall that the President repeatedly  and derisively boasted that Mexico would pay for.   In fact, the President has admitted he ``didn't have to do this,''  but has opted to do so because ``I want to see it built faster.''   Mr. Speaker, just yesterday a bipartisan group of nearly 60 national  security officials including former secretaries of state, defense  secretaries, CIA directors, and ambassadors to the UN issued a  statement declaring that ``there is no factual basis'' justifying the  President's emergency declaration.   Instead of protecting our national security, the President's  declaration makes America less safe.   The President is stealing billions from high-priority military  construction projects that ensure our troops have the essential  training, readiness and quality of life necessary to keep the American  people safe, directly undermining America's national security.   The President's declaration clearly violates the Congress's exclusive  power of the purse,  [[Page H2119]]  and, if unchecked, would fundamentally alter the balance of powers,  violating our Founders' vision for America.   Opposing the President's reckless and anti-American decision  transcends partisan politics and partisanship; it is about patriotism,  constitutional fidelity, and putting country first.   That is why nearly two dozen distinguished former Republican Members  of Congress are urging Republicans in Congress to vote for H.J.R. 46  and uphold ``the authority of the first branch of government to resist  efforts to surrender'' our constitutional powers to an overreaching  president.   To quote Thomas Paine's Common Sense: ``In absolute governments, the  King is law; so in free countries, the law ought to be King.''   Mr. Speaker, I urge all members to uphold the rule of law and the  Constitution, and reject the President's power grab; I urge a  resounding YES vote on H.J. Res. 46.   The material previously referred to by Mr. Woodall is as follows:         At the end of the resolution, add the following:        Sec. 3. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution, the       House shall proceed to the consideration in the House of the       bill (H.R. 962) to amend title 18, United States Code, to       prohibit a health care practitioner from failing to exercise       the proper degree of care in the case of a child who survives       an abortion or attempted abortion. All points of order       against consideration of the bill are waived. The bill shall       be considered as read. All points of order against provisions       in the bill are waived. The previous question shall be       considered as ordered on the bill and on any amendment       thereto to final passage without intervening motion except:       (1) one hour of debate equally divided and controlled by the       chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on the       Judiciary; and (2) one motion to recommit.        Sec. 4. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H.R. 962.     Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of  my time, and I move the previous question on the resolution.
