 Mr. President, Alaska is a beautiful State--the  mountains, the seas, the glaciers, the wildlife. Most in this room and  many watching on TV have seen my State on TV shows, on reality shows.  Almost everybody talks about at least someday coming to visit. We love  tourists, like the Presiding Officer does. So please come. You will  have a great experience, guaranteed.   But what makes my State particularly special is the people--kind  people, tough people, generous of heart, and, yes, people with a lot of  opinions. My State is filled with people who are strong-willed and  strong-hearted, creating caring communities in some of the harshest  environments in the world.   As part of an initiative that I am doing to highlight some of these  great Alaskan citizens, I would like to recognize this afternoon Eileen  Dubowski as the Alaskan of the Week. She is someone of a strong mind  and a strong heart, and she has helped to make her community and our  State a better place.   Eileen lives with her husband in a cabin in Salcha, AK, near the  Fairbanks area. This year, this area of my State has experienced some  brutally dangerously cold temperatures. Recently, it was 59 degrees  below zero near Salcha. That is cold, 59 below zero. Yet, in my State,  people work in such weather, they give to their communities, they reach  out and watch over their neighbors.    Eileen has been both a special education and regular education  teacher for almost 40 years. She is currently at University Park  Elementary School. To better communicate with her students, she went to  night school to learn American Sign Language. She is active in her  church and particularly active in Interior Alaska high school wrestling  helping dozens and dozens of students. She has been so involved over  the past 40 years in this important activity that she was recently  elected into the State of Alaska Wrestlers Hall of Fame. An article in  the Fairbanks Daily News-Miner quotes her as saying: ``Wrestling can  take any sized kid and they can be successful.''   Congratulations, Eileen, for helping dozens and dozens of kids of all  sizes in Alaska and making them successful.   She stated: ``When you help each other it makes living up here  easier,'' in the colds of Alaska. The same could be said about anyplace  in America.   So thanks, Eileen, for helping make life easier, for your service,  and for being this week's Alaskan of the Week.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I wish to talk a little bit this  afternoon about the way my colleagues on the other side of the aisle  are, unfortunately--and with no reason--delaying and delaying the  confirmation of heads of critically important agencies, Cabinet  Secretaries, for our country.   Now, we have differences of opinion in this body. That is often a  good thing. We debate, we share ideas, we agree, we disagree, we give  the voters the very best we have, and then we let them make their own  decisions, which they do at the ballot box.   On election day, the American people chose President Trump and Vice  President Pence. The American people did so knowing they would appoint  a new Cabinet and be focused on the issues they ran on, but the  American people did not vote for delay and they did not vote for  obstruction. They voted for action and they voted for a smooth  transition, which is what this body has traditionally done.   It has been a longstanding tradition of the U.S. Senate, working  hard, to confirm Cabinet nominees of a newly elected President in a  timely fashion, particularly when it comes to the President's national  security team.   For example, in 2009, upon the election of President Obama, 7 of his  Cabinet members were sworn into office on the first day, 5 more were  confirmed by the end of the first week--14 Cabinet officials inside of  a week.   Where are we right now? Two Cabinet officials and one CIA Director.  That is not what the American people expect. That is not the tradition  in the Senate. My colleagues on the other side of the aisle have a  responsibility to the American people to put a government in place and  to treat the confirmation process with the same courtesy and  seriousness the Senate gave to President  [[Page S458]]  Obama's Cabinet-level nominees, and that is not happening right now.  This is serious business, particularly on national security issues.   I am hopeful my colleagues on the other side of the aisle can start  getting serious and show this administration the same courtesy that  Republicans showed President Obama's administration when he came into  office.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.                            ____________________
