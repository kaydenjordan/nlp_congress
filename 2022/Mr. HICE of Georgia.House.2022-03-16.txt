 Madam Speaker, I rise today on behalf of the  American taxpayer to clarify that the Federal workforce exists to serve  them, not the other way around.   During the COVID pandemic, Americans faced uncertainties as  businesses literally struggled to survive. While these Americans  wondered whether or not they would receive the next paycheck, there was  one group, Federal employees, who did not face these type of concerns.  To the contrary, since President Biden took office, there has been a  nonstop effort to ensure that Federal workers are treated like a  protected, privileged class.   Democrats like to talk about the need to rehabilitate Federal workers  after the Trump administration's so-called war on civil servants. That  is absolutely ridiculous. The Democrats' road to recovery apparently  includes shielding government workers, workers whose positions exist to  serve the American people. The Democrats want to shield government  workers from accountability; from any concern of discipline; from the  obligation to actually perform the duties that they were hired to do;  and from their duty to serve the elected Representatives of the people.   But guess what? Despite the claims of trauma during the Trump  administration, Federal workers were happier during his time in office.  Why? Simply because the Federal workers were held accountable.   Let's face it: No one likes working in a situation where you can't do  anything about poor performers, where you can't do anything regarding  people who simply refuse to actually do their jobs. The consequences of  that type of environment is that the actual conscientious workers have  to pick up the slack, which only adds to their own workloads and  creates an extremely toxic work environment.   Nevertheless, Democrats want to continue the false narrative of an  abused Federal workforce. They want to curry favor with the core union  constituency by looking for as many ways as possible to increase pay  and benefits, all under the name of making the Federal Government a  model employer.   But model employers hold their workforce accountable. Model employers  put the customer first. In this case, that is the American taxpayer. We  don't hear any of this from the Democrats, but you do from the  Republicans.   Today, along with a number of my Republican colleagues, I am  introducing the Accountable Federal Employees Act, which codifies a  suite of executive orders that President Trump issued, but,  unfortunately, President Biden has repealed.   This bill includes a number of commonsense provisions, such as making  sure Federal employees actually do their jobs rather than spend time on  union activities. It makes sure that poor performers are held  accountable. That is something even Federal employees say is sorely  lacking in the workplace. It creates a process to ensure collective  bargaining agreements are negotiated in a timely manner and in a way  that looks out for the best interests of the American taxpayer. It  makes sure that Federal employees in policy-making roles actually work  to help implement the policies of the people who were actually elected  to office.   This bill represents a platform of sanity and fairness in civil  service policy and in the workforce of the Federal Government. Frankly,  any serious effort to modernize the Federal workforce has to start with  ensuring the best possible level of service for the American people.  That is what this bill does. I urge my colleagues to join me in this  effort.                            ____________________
