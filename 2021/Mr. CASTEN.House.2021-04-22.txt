 Madam Speaker, the time for action is now. No longer can  we substitute slogans for solutions. The protection of the environment  offers America its best hope. Achieving the goal of a clean and healthy  environment must be done by every American. We can reach this goal in  this decade. And in reaching it, we can trigger a chain reaction of  confidence and hope.   Those are the words of Bill Ruckelshaus on this day 50 years ago; a  Republican; the first Administrator of the EPA under Richard Nixon, and  then again under Ronald Reagan; the man who implemented the Clean Air  Act amendments of 1990.   His successor under George H.W. Bush was Bill Reilly, who implemented  the Acid Rain Program and the Montreal Protocol, a global, market-based  cap and trade program. These men knew that science and our obligations  to future generations are not negotiable. They tolerated no conflict  between conservatism and conservation.   Sixty percent of all the greenhouse gas emissions we have ever  emitted as a species have been released since that speech Bill  Ruckelshaus gave 50 years ago today.   Madam Speaker, the time for action is now.                            ____________________
