 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate Pride  Month.   For generations and across industries, LGBTQ Americans have directly  contributed to America's greatness. Chicagoland is home to many of  these leaders, like Carol A. Johnson, a union and HIV activist; Kim  Hunt, a policy expert; the late Vernita Gray, a community activist;  business leaders like Fred Eychaner and Tracy Baim.   In the last few years, we have made remarkable progress towards  equality. On June 26, we will celebrate the fifth anniversary of  marriage equality for all Americans, yet much work still remains.   Trans Americans are still too often the victims of violence,  harassment, and exploitation. Too many struggling with who they are or  whom they love resort to self-harm and suicide. And, sadly, we have a  man in the White House who is unwilling to recognize June as Pride  Month.   Despite these challenges, LGBTQ Americans and their family, including  me, stand as united as ever, and we will keep pushing until real, true,  and lasting equality isn't just encoded in law but encoded in our  hearts.   Happy Pride.                            ____________________
