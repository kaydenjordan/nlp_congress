 Mr. Vice President, parliamentary inquiry.   The VICE PRESIDENT. The gentleman from Virginia will state his  parliamentary inquiry.    Mr. Vice President, in order to follow the Speaker's  instructions that only a limited number of people be on the floor, may  I ask how one would make an objection or make a parliamentary inquiry  in the future if you are not on the floor but in the gallery.   The VICE PRESIDENT. Under section 18 of title 3, United States Code,  debate is not permitted in the joint session.    Further parliamentary inquiry.   Mr. Vice President, I am not attempting to debate. I am trying to  find out how a parliamentary inquiry or a parliamentary point of order  would be made in following with the Speaker's request that most of us  not be on the floor. How do you make one of those points of order when  you don't know what is going to happen later?   The VICE PRESIDENT. Respectfully, the gentleman's parliamentary  inquiry constitutes debate, which is not permitted in the joint session  under section 18 of title 3, United States Code.   Madam Speaker, Members of Congress, pursuant to the Constitution and  the laws of the United States, the Senate and House of Representatives  are meeting in joint session to verify the certificates and count the  votes of the electors of the several States for President and Vice  President of the United States.   After ascertainment has been had that the certificates are authentic  and correct in form, the tellers will count and make a list of the  votes cast by the electors of the several States.   The tellers on the part of the two Houses will take their places at  the Clerk's desk.   The tellers, Mr. Blunt and Ms. Klobuchar on the part of the Senate,  and Ms. Lofgren and Mr. Rodney Davis of Illinois on the part of the  House, took their places at the desk.   The VICE PRESIDENT. Without objection, the tellers will dispense with  the reading of the formal portions of the certificates.   There was no objection.   The VICE PRESIDENT. After ascertaining that the certificates are  regular in form and authentic, the tellers will announce the votes cast  by the electors for each State, beginning with Alabama, which  the Parliamentarians have advised me is the only certificate of vote  from that State, and purports to be a return from the State, and that  has annexed to it a certificate from an authority of that State  purporting to appoint or ascertain electors.     =========================== NOTE ===========================        January 6, 2021, on page H76, the following appeared: The VICE  PRESIDENT.

Mr. President, the certificate of the electoral vote  of the State of Alabama seems to be regular in form and authentic, and  it appears therefrom that Donald J. Trump of the State of Florida  received 9 votes for President and Michael R. Pence of the State of  Indiana received 9 votes for Vice President.   The VICE PRESIDENT. Are there any objections to counting the  certificate of vote of the State of Alabama that the teller has  verified appears to be regular in form and authentic?  [[Page H77]]    There was no objection.   The VICE PRESIDENT. Hearing none, this certificate from Alaska, the  Parliamentarians have advised me, is the only certificate of vote from  that State that purports to be a return from the State and that has  annexed to it a certificate from an authority of the State purporting  to appoint and ascertain electors.    =========================== NOTE ===========================        January 6, 2021, on page H77, first column and first paragraph,  the following appeared: The VICE PRESIDENT.

Yes, ma'am. The point of order would be that the  gentleman said that there were lies on this floor here today, looking  over in this direction. I ask that those words be taken down.   We may have a disagreement on matters, but--
