 Madam Speaker, I read from the Mueller report, volume II,  page 107: ``At some point after the May 17, 2017, appointment of the  special counsel, then-Attorney General Sessions recalled, the President  called him at home and asked if Sessions would `unrecuse' himself.  According to Sessions, the President asked him to reverse his recusal  so that Sessions could direct the Department of Justice to investigate  and prosecute Hillary Clinton, and the `gist' of the conversation was  that the President wanted Sessions to unrecuse from `all of it,'  including the special counsel's Russia investigation.''   Again, the Mueller report, volume II, page 107.                            ____________________
