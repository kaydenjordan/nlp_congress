 Mr. Speaker, as Christmas approaches, I rise to  share the histories behind the most beloved Christmas carols.   My wife found a book, and I started reading it at breakfast one  morning. I thought it was really interesting to know where Christmas  carols came from. I thought I would come up here and share this with my  colleagues and with the rest of the country that cares.   I have done three of these now, and I have 30 minutes to do a bunch  more. Today, we are going to talk about a lot of them.   The first one is ``It Came Upon the Midnight Clear.'' It was written  and composed by two men from similar backgrounds who never met.   Edmund Hamilton Sears was a Unitarian minister and graduate of  Harvard Divinity School. Sears, who preferred a quiet life among his  New England congregation, emphasized Jesus' message of peace on Earth,  good will towards men. The words to ``It Came Upon the Midnight Clear''  first appeared in print in 1850 in the Christian Registry.   By contrast, composer Richard S. Willis led a very public life as an  editor  [[Page H6738]]  and critic with the New York Tribune. Willis composed carols while  acting as a vestryman at The Little Church Around the Corner in New  York City.   The music of the carol was matched with Sears' words years later, and  here are the results. I can't sing, so don't ask me to sing. I am going  to read them, although I sing them in church.       It came upon the midnight clear,      that glorious song of old,      from angels bending near the Earth      to touch their harps of gold:      ``Peace on the Earth, good will to men,      from Heaven's all-gracious king.''      The world in solemn stillness lay,      to hear the angels sing.      Still through the cloven skies they come      with peaceful wings unfurled,      and still their heavenly music floats      o'er all the weary world;      above its sad and lowly plains,      they bend on hovering wing,      and ever o'er its Babel sounds      the blessed angel sing.      For lo! the days are hastening on,      by prophet seen of old,      when with the ever-circling years      shall come the time foretold      when peace shall over all the Earth      its ancient splendors fling,      and the whole world send back the song      which now the angels sing.    The lyrics of ``Joy to the World'' are based on Psalm 98, which  reads:       Make a joyful noise unto the Lord, all the Earth      Make a loud noise, and rejoice, and sing praise      Make a joyful noise to the Lord, the king.    In 1719, English minister Isaac Watts wrote more than 600 hymns for  children and adults, many of which are still sung today. Among his many  admirers was Benjamin Franklin.   The music's composer was Lowell Mason, the father of American church  music. He devoted his life to music education, eventually composing  more than 1,600 religious works. Mason called his composition  ``Antioch,'' a reference to the Syrian city where Jesus' Disciples  first came to be called Christians. Here are the words of the song:       Joy to the world, the Lord is come      Let Earth receive her king      Let every heart prepare Him room      And Heaven and nature sing      And Heaven and nature sing      And Heaven, and Heaven, and nature sing      Joy to the Earth, the Savior reigns      Let all their songs employ      While fields and floods, rocks, hills, and plains      Repeat the sounding joy      Repeat the sounding joy      Repeat, repeat, the sounding joy      He rules the world with truth and grace      And makes the nations prove      The glories of His righteousness      And wonders of His love      And wonders of His love      And wonders, wonders, of His love    There is a great deal of myth and conjecture around ``O Come, All Ye  Faithful.'' Until about 1900, people believed that this hymn could be  traced back to the 13th century and that St. Bonaventure possibly  composed the original Latin words.   A clergyman named Dom John Stephan researched the original manuscript  and discovered that John Francis Wade wrote it. Wade, a Roman Catholic,  lived in Douai, France, where he earned his living copying and teaching  music. Composed between 1740 and 1744, the hymn became quite well known  locally.   Here are the words to the song:       O come, all ye faithful,      Joyful and triumphant,      O come ye, o come ye to Bethlehem.      Come and behold Him, born the      King of angels.      O come, let us adore Him,      O come, let us adore Him,      O come, let us adore Him,      Christ, the Lord.      Sing, choirs of angels,      Sing in exultation;      Sing all ye citizens of Heaven above:      Glory to God in the highest.      O come, let us adore Him,      O come, let us adore Him,      O come, let us adore Him,      Christ, the Lord.      Yea, Lord, we greet Thee,      Born this happy morning;      Jesus, to Thee be glory given;      Word of the Father, now in flesh appearing.      O come, let us adore Him,      O come, let us adore Him,      O come, let us adore Him,      Christ, the Lord.    The next one is one I like a lot. As Phillips Brooks approached the  village of Bethlehem on Christmas Eve, 1866, he imagined the holy  family on their journey nearly 2,000 years before. The holy land was  still singing in his soul when he wrote ``O Little Town of Bethlehem''  for a children's Sunday school class 2 years later.       O little town of Bethlehem      How still we see Thee lie      Above thy deep and dreamless sleep      The silent stars go by      Yet in thy dark streets shineth      The everlasting light      The hopes and fears of all the years      Are met in Thee tonight      For Christ was born of Mary      And gathered all above      While mortals sleep, the angels keep      Their watch of wondering love      O morning stars together      Proclaim Thy holy birth      And praises sing to God the king      And peace to men on Earth      O holy child of Bethlehem,      descend to us, we pray;      cast out our sin and enter in;      be born in us today.      We hear the Christmas angels,      the great glad tidings tell;      O come to us, abide with us,      our Lord Emmanuel!                                time  1315    My wife is Dutch, and she learned this song in German where it was  originally written. When we sing it in church, she throws me off a  little by singing in German, but it is still the same song.   ``Silent Night'' possesses a simple dignity and power like the alpine  setting where it was written. Popular legend states that Joseph Mohr,  the carol's composer, a village priest in the little Austrian town of  Oberndorf, penned the words to ``Silent Night'' on Christmas Eve. He  became distraught when the organ in his church broke down and couldn't  be repaired in time for Christmas services. He enlisted a friend, a  musician, Franz Gruber, to compose a guitar accompaniment for the song.   The image of a starry night, the little church, and the lone guitar  is one of enduring humility and quiet beauty. Mohr wrote several  arrangements for ``Silent Night.''       Silent night, holy night,      All is calm, all is bright.      Round yon virgin, Mother and Child,      Holy infant so tender and mild,      Sleep in heavenly peace,      Sleep in heavenly peace.      Silent night, holy night,      Shepherds quake at the sight.      Glories stream from Heaven afar,      Heavenly hosts sing Alleluia;      Christ the Savior is born;      Christ the Savior is born.      Silent night, holy night,      Son of God, love's pure light,      Radiant beams from Thy holy face,      With the dawn of redeeming grace,      Jesus, Lord at Thy birth;      Jesus, Lord at Thy birth.    The first written record of ``The First Noel'' appeared in William  Sandys' 1833 edition of ``Christmas Carols, Ancient and Modern.'' Folk  songs enjoyed a revival in 19th century England, and there are several  collections like Sandys that include this carol.       The first noel, the angel did say,      Was to certain poor shepherds in fields where they lay;      In fields where they lay keeping their sheep,      On a cold winter's night that was so deep.      Noel, noel, noel, noel,      Born is the king of Israel.      They looked up and saw a star,      Shining in the east beyond them far;      And to the Earth it gave great light,      And so it continued day and night.      Noel, noel, noel, noel,      Born is the king of Israel.      And by the light of that same star      Three wise men came from country far;      To seek for a king was their intent,      And to follow the star wherever it went.      Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel,      Born is the king of Israel.      This star drew nigh to the northwest;      O'er Bethlehem it took its rest,      And there it did stop and stay      Right over the place where Jesus lay.      Noel, noel, noel, noel,      Born is the king of Israel.    The melody of ``Greensleeves'' is so old that it is impossible to  date. We know that Queen Elizabeth I danced to the melody and that  Shakespeare mentioned it in ``The Merry Wives of Windsor.''   As with other carols, traditional music made a late marriage to  sacred words. The English hymn writer William Dix composed these words  under the title ``The Manger Throne.''       What child is this, who, laid to rest      On Mary's lap is sleeping?      Whom angels greet with voices sweet,      While shepherds watch are keeping?      This, this is Christ the king      Whom shepherds guard and angels sing.      Haste, haste, to bring Him praise,      The babe, the Son of Mary.      Why lies He in such mean estate      Where ox and ass are feeding?      Good Christian, fear for the sinners here,      The silent Word is pleading.  [[Page H6739]]       This, this is Christ the king,      Whom shepherds guard and angels sing.      Haste, haste to bring him praise,      The babe, the Son of Mary.      So bring him incense, gold, and myrrh,      Come peasant king to own Him.      The king of kings, salvation brings,      Let loving hearts enthrone Him.      This, this is Christ the king      Whom shepherds guard and angels sing.      Haste, haste, to bring him laud,      The babe, the Son of Mary.    It is my hope that you will enjoy these histories and think about  them as you celebrate the holiday season.   On behalf of the people of my district in central Texas, I wish each  of you a merry Christmas and a happy Hanukkah.
