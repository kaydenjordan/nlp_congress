 Mr. President, as I rise today, kleptocracy is on the  march in Europe, showing how unchecked corruption leads to evil.   Vladimir Putin's corrupt regime fabricated a pretext to invade and  subjugate the sovereign and peaceful nation of Ukraine. Putin's attack  helps divert the Russian people from his festering corruption and  misrule, as jailed Russian opposition leader Alexey Navalny put it.   America and our allies are meting out stiff sanctions; and my  colleagues and I here in Congress are working on additional measures to  deliver punishing financial blows to Putin and his corrupt oligarchs.  But we must consider how we arrived at this moment.   Putin has, for decades, deployed corruption and kleptocracy to  strengthen his grip on Russia's government and to project power and  influence throughout the region. In the process, he decimated Russia's  free press, attacked--physically and economically--all political  opposition, and grew his own personal fortune to what is thought to be  the largest in the world. I say ``thought to be'' because Putin's  wealth is hidden behind shell corporations and nestled in tax havens,  far from the view of the people he robs and oppresses. And along the  way, he cultivated--through favors, force, or fortunes--a group of  oligarchs who serve him.   It is important to understand that Putin isn't special. We have  plenty of kleptocrats around the globe. Putin just happens to be in  charge of a big and oil-rich country with a military at his command, a  gangster with an army running a gas station, as Senator McCain used to  say.   America is engaged in a growing clash of civilizations against this  brand of corrupt leadership. Democracy and the free market are on one  side; kleptocracy and corruption are on the other. And we will prevail  in this clash by pursuing one powerful value of rule of law society:  transparency.   Kleptocrats and criminals seek the protection of our rule of law and  our secure financial system to stow their illicit money, but they need  anonymity. They need to hide it. That is why so much anonymously owned  luxury real estate sits empty in America, in some places actually  driving up local housing costs for normal people. And that is why shell  corporations in American States multiply.   The Pandora Papers last year revealed webs of American shell  corporations and trusts hiding dirty assets. It revealed  professionals--lawyers, accounts, and real estate agents--aiding and  abetting the hiding of those dirty assets. Shining the light of  transparency on kleptocrats' money is a potent countermeasure to their  power.   Late in 2020, Congress passed the most important anti-money  laundering  [[Page S941]]  reform law in two decades: the Corporate Transparency Act. It was very  bipartisan. Senators Grassley, Graham, Wyden, Rubio, Brown, Crapo,  Warner, Cotton, and I all spent years getting that bill done. Our aim  was to arm law enforcement with knowledge of the ``beneficial owner''-- the real person--who is behind American shell corporations.    Now, the Treasury Department's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network,  FinCEN, is implementing our beneficial ownership provisions. And the  new rule promises to be a strong countermeasure.   It requires anyone who exerts substantial control directly or  indirectly over a legal entity to identify themselves as the beneficial  owner. That is what we wanted. It is clear enough so that companies  know what they have to do, while minimizing the risk that bad actors  can evade disclosure.   And its timelines for reporting and updating beneficial ownership  information are fair, providing law enforcement and national security  officials timely information without imposing unreasonable turnarounds  for legitimate companies.   The beneficial ownership rule also avoided a trap. Some had urged  FinCEN to add exceptions to the reporting requirements on top of the  ones Congress included in the bill. Well, we worked hard to come up  with the right list of excepted entities. It is encouraging to see  FinCEN stand firm and avoid watering down the rule with new unjustified  exceptions.   FinCEN is also working on a review of Bank Secrecy Act regulations  with an eye toward a new ``anti-money laundering and counterterror  financing'' framework. This review offers a chance to take on some big  challenges.   We need to make sure American professionals aren't aiding and  abetting kleptocrats. Investing in hedge funds, luxury real estate,  high-priced art, expensive cars, mega yachts all requires help from  professionals, and those professionals aren't bound to ``anti-money  laundering and counterterror financing'' safeguards like our banks are.   Private investment funds are worth about $11 trillion. You can hide a  lot of mischief in $11 trillion. An FBI intelligence bulletin leaked in  2020 warned that ``threat actors'' used those funds to launder their  money into rule-of-law financial systems. That is a vulnerability we  need to close.   This aiding and abetting problem, giving aid and comfort to our  enemies, extends to professional services from lawyers, accountants,  company and trust formation agents, even PR firms. But on this front,  FinCEN's hands are tied. Congress will need to step in to clean that  up.   Kleptocrats and criminals constantly change the methods they use to  hide their money. Trade-based money laundering, for instance, allows  bad actors to trade everything from vegetables to washing machines as a  way to move their money around internationally. We need better  coordination among key agencies involved in overseeing trade and better  information on suspicious financial and trade activity that is shared  more efficiently among various Federal authorities.   Real estate is a massive target for money launderers. In August of  last year, the watchdog group Global Financial Integrity released a  report showing over $2.3 billion laundered through American real estate  over the previous half decade. As Global Financial Integrity would tell  you, this is just what they could identify. The real number is probably  far higher.   The good news there is we have a countermeasure that works well. In  2016, FinCEN started the ``geographic targeting order'' program, which  requires title insurers to report to FinCEN beneficial ownership  information of shell companies that stash money in high-priced real  estate. That program started in New York and Miami, then expanded to a  dozen jurisdictions nationwide. The Congressional Research Service has  reviewed it and said these targeting orders work.   Now, FinCEN is proposing a rule to make these orders permanent and  expand coverage across the United States. It looks like FinCEN will  deliver that improvement. And if it does, that is a big win,  particularly if that rule lines up with our beneficial ownership rule  and if it extends to cover commercial, as well as residential real  estate.   In Congress, we should pass legislation to help FinCEN address  professional aiders and abettors. There is bipartisan legislation in  the House, the ENABLERS Act, which I hope to introduce here in the  Senate. I have also introduced bipartisan legislation to make it a  crime for foreign officials to demand bribes from Americans. At the  moment, it is only a crime to pay bribes. And we should pay close  attention to others in the dark economy, like drug traffickers and  terrorists.   I am working on legislation to target money laundering related to the  illicit narcotics trade. Indeed, we had a hearing on it today.   Finally, we need to work together with the international community.  When U.S. defenses are strengthened, kleptocrats will direct their  dirty money to some other willing sanctuary. So it matters that the  Biden administration has announced a transatlantic, interagency task  force to help crack down on ill-gotten assets stowed in the West by  Russian oligarchs and their families, their mistresses, their stooges,  whomever. This is exactly the right approach. We must work with friends  abroad to close off hidey-holes for oligarchs, bolster the rule of law,  expand judicial transparency, and increase access to justice in  struggling jurisdictions.    I met recently with a Member of the Ukrainian Parliament who said a  phrase--that we were talking about actually during the Munich Security  Conference codel--which was: It is not enough to freeze the oligarch's  assets; we need to seize the oligarch's assets.   We can do so even theatrically, and to take a camera through the  preposterous and grotesque wealth and show the people of Russia what  was stolen from them would be as significant a public relations victory  as when Ukrainians went through their oligarch's mansion and showed  everything from gold toilet seats to private petting zoos.   Kleptocrats, like Putin and his oligarchs, can be defeated. A little  sunlight will vanquish them. Free societies and the rule of law can win  the long battle we face against kleptocracy and corruption.   This is a national security matter, not just a question of doing  good. This is a national security matter, and these are the tools--the  ones I have described, the tools of transparency--that will secure our  victory.   I yield the floor.
