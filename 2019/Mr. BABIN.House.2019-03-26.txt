 Mr. Speaker, I thank my great colleague from the State of  Kansas.   Mr. Speaker, on March 21, we celebrated World Down Syndrome Awareness  Day. What an appropriate thing to celebrate as folks with Down syndrome  make incredible contributions to society every single day that should  be acknowledged and appreciated.   I, for one, am thankful for all of those with Down syndrome that I  have had the great pleasure and honor of knowing and learning from.   With the rise of prenatal screening tests across the United States,  the number of babies born with Down syndrome every year has  significantly decreased. And while we do not know the exact number of  Down syndrome children who are aborted each year, it is estimated that  approximately two-thirds of children diagnosed in the womb are aborted.   Two-thirds of children who would go on to make a significant impact  in this world are murdered before they are given a chance to even be  able to have that opportunity.   Iceland, in particular, has almost completely eradicated Down  syndrome births.   Statistics show that they have an almost 100 percent termination rate  of Down syndrome children.   France has a 77 percent termination rate; while Denmark is at 98  percent.   I pray that the United States will reject the idea that Down syndrome  children somehow are less than other children. As a society, we should  move away from any idea that advocates killing any child in its  mother's womb. And as a pro-life Congressman, I believe that all life  is valuable, especially the lives of those who cannot speak for  themselves.   Aborted Down syndrome children are just that, they are children who  have their own hopes and dreams for a future and to live a long,  healthy life. To take away their right to life is inconceivable to me  and abhorrent.   I will continue to fight for legislation that protects every single  unborn child, regardless of whether or not they have an extra  chromosome.
