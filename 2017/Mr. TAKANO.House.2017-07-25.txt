 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to strongly oppose this CRA  opposition, which rolls back critical protections for American  consumers.   Passing this resolution would set a nearly irreversible policy that  allows Wall Street companies to commit pervasive fraud while avoiding  the accountability that comes with a class action lawsuit.   Access to our courts and the transparency and fairness they provide  is a fundamental right enshrined in our Constitution. It is a sad irony  that many of those that would be denied their constitutional rights  through this resolution are the servicemembers and veterans who have  risked their lives to protect those rights.   When the American consumer takes on a Wall Street corporation, it is  already a David versus Goliath situation. Now Republicans want to steal  David's slingshot. Mr. Speaker, don't let them steal David's slingshot.  Don't let them steal America's slingshot.   Mr. Speaker, I strongly encourage my colleagues to reject this  resolution.
