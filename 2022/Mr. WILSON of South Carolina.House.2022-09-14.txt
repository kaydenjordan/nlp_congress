 Mr. Speaker, under President Donald  Trump, in 2020, America exported more petroleum than it imported for  the first time since 1949. Donald Trump achieved energy independence.   However, since Biden came to office, the national average for a  gallon of gasoline is over $1.30 higher per gallon; electricity costs  are 15 percent more; and at this point, Biden has leased fewer acres of  offshore and Federal land for domestic oil and gas production than any  President in 70 years. Also, on day one of his Presidency, Biden killed  the Keystone XL pipeline, which could be supplying 800,000 barrels of  oil a day from Canada to America.   Higher gas prices increase delivery costs, increasing Bidenflation,  which destroys jobs.   Irresponsible decisions by Biden and the Democrats are responsible  for the energy crisis.   God bless our troops who successfully protected America for 20 years,  as the global war on terrorism moves from a safe haven in Afghanistan  to America. We will always cherish the service of Congresswoman Jackie  Walorski. And God bless Ukraine victory.                            ____________________
