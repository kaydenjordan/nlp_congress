 In fact, the day after the call, you met with       President Zelensky. This would be on July 26.        Ambassador VOLKER. Correct.         In that meeting, he made no mention of quid       pro quo?        Ambassador VOLKER. No.         He made no mention of withholding the aid?        Ambassador VOLKER. No.         He made no mention of bribery?        Ambassador VOLKER. No.         So the fact is that Ukrainians were not even       aware of this hold on aid. Is that correct?    Mr. Counsel PURPURA. They didn't tell you about this testimony from  Ambassador Volker. Why not? President Zelensky himself has confirmed on  at least three separate occasions that his July 25 call with President  Trump was a ``good phone call'' and ``normal'' and ``nobody pushed  me.''   When President Zelensky's adviser, Andriy Yermak, was asked if he  ever felt there was a connection between military aid and the request  for investigations, he was adamant that ``We never had that feeling''  and ``We did not have the feeling that this aid was connected to any  one specific issue.''   Of course, the best evidence that there was no pressure or quid pro  quo is the statements of the Ukrainians themselves. The fact that  President Zelensky himself felt no pressure on the call and did not  perceive there to be any connection between security assistance and  investigations would, in any ordinary case in any court, be totally  fatal to the prosecution. The judge would throw it out. The case would  be over. What more do you need to know? The House team knows that. They  know the record inside out, upside down, left and right.   So what do they do? How do they try to overcome the direct words from  President Zelensky and his administration that they felt no pressure?  They tell you that the Ukrainians must have felt pressure regardless of  what they have said. They try to overcome the devastating evidence  against them by, apparently, claiming to be mind readers. They know  what is in President Zelensky's mind better than President Zelensky  does. President Zelensky said he felt no pressure. The House managers  tell you they know better. This is really a theme of the House case.   I want you to remember this. Every time the Democrats say that  President Trump made demands or issued a quid pro quo to President  Zelensky on the July 25 call, they are saying that President Zelensky  and his top advisers are being untruthful, and they acknowledge that is  what they are saying. They have said it over the past few days.   Tell me how that helps U.S. foreign policy and national security to  say that about our friends. We know there was no quid pro quo on the  call. We know that from the transcripts. But the call is not the only  evidence showing that there was no quid pro quo. There couldn't  possibly have been a quid pro quo because Ukrainians did not even know  the security assistance was on hold until it was reported in the  [[Page S571]]  media by POLITICO at the end of August, more than a month after the  July 25 call.   Think about this. The Democrats accused the President of leveraging  security assistance to supposedly force President Zelensky to announce  investigations, but how can that possibly be when the Ukrainians were  not even aware that the security assistance was paused? There can't be  a threat without the person knowing he is being threatened. There can't  be a quid pro quo without the quo.   Ambassador Volker testified that the Ukrainians did not know about  the hold until reading about it in POLITICO. Ambassador Taylor and Tim  Morrison both agree. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State George Kent  testified that no Ukrainian official contacted him about the paused  security assistance until that first intense week in September.   Let's hear from the four of them.   (Text of Videotape presentation:)         Ambassador VOLKER. I believe that the Ukrainians became       aware of the hold on August 29 and not before. That date is       the first time any of them asked me about the hold by       forwarding an article that had been published in POLITICO.        Ambassador TAYLOR. It was only after August 29 that I got       calls from several of the Ukrainian officials.
