 Madam Speaker, upon assuming the chairmanship of the  committee in January 2019, the chairman of the Oversight and Reform  Committee formally initiated an inquiry into Secretary Ross' decision  to reinstitute the citizenship question on the 2020 census.   Just recently, as of June 27, 2019, the Supreme Court has issued a  ruling. The Supreme Court ruled that the administration may ask a  citizenship question, but rejected the rationale presented by Secretary  Ross for adding the question on the 2020 census.   The committee's fact-finding is still active and ongoing. The  administration is cooperating with the investigation. The DOC and the  DOJ have produced 31,000 responsive documents--14,000 from the DOC and  17,000 from the DOJ. The committee has held six transcribed interviews  with witnesses, and a seventh interview is expected.   In short, Madam Speaker, the Judiciary Committee has already held  Bill Barr in contempt for not violating Federal law. And now the  Oversight and Reform Committee is about to hold Bill Barr in contempt  for cooperating with the committee. This is wrong. This is not how we  are supposed to do business in this Chamber.
