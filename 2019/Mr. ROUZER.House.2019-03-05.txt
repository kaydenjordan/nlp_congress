 Madam Speaker, many in North Carolina and around the  country are mourning the passing of our friend and colleague,  Congressman  [[Page H2346]]  Walter B. Jones, just as much as we are. Our dear friend humbly served  the great people of eastern North Carolina in the State legislature and  in Congress for more than 30 years. Having known Walter for more than  23 years, I can attest to his great faith in our creator and his  servant's heart.   Congressman Jones was elected to Congress with the 1994 class, and it  was in his first term that I met him. I was brand new to the Hill  myself, working for U.S. Senator Jesse Helms at the time. Senator Helms  and his wife, Dot, quickly became great fans of Walter, so much so--and  many may not know this--that even after Senator Helms passed, Dot Helms  would cut radio ads for him up until her passing just a few years ago.   What Dot and Jesse Helms admired about Walter was no different than  what everyone else across the State of North Carolina and throughout  the country who knew him admired: his character, his adherence to his  convictions, and his commitment to serving others.   He was a staunch advocate, of course, for those who made the greatest  sacrifice of all while serving our country. He constantly worked on  behalf of our troops and veterans every single day, especially those  who were based in his district at Camp Lejeune in Jacksonville and  Cherry Point in Havelock.   Congressman Jones dedicated his life to serving others. He stood  strong for his beliefs and even stronger for his faith, always choosing  to do what he believed to be best for his constituency, our State, and  our Nation.   The citizens of this State and country have lost a great friend whose  life made a real difference for so many. His honesty, faith, and  integrity will not be forgotten.
