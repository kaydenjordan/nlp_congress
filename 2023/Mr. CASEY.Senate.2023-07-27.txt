 Mr. President, due to my mother's sudden hospitalization  late this afternoon for a serious illness, I need to leave Washington  unexpectedly and immediately. As a result, I will miss the vote on  final passage of the National Defense Authorization Act, as well as any  remaining amendment votes.   I would like the Congressional Record to reflect that I support final  passage of this legislation. When I return to Washington following the  August work period, I will submit another statement to the Record  detailing how I would have cast my vote on each of the amendment votes  I was forced to miss.                          Vote on Amendment No. 1078    I ask for the yeas and nays.
