 Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague from  Pennsylvania.   Madam Speaker, today, I stand in opposition to President Biden's  vaccine mandate on businesses issued by the Occupational Safety and  Health Administration, or OSHA.   The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals confirmed that the Biden  administration is severely misusing his power. While OSHA's delegated  authority was intended to be used with precision and tact, President  Biden has wielded it carelessly.   Just yesterday, in keeping with the Fifth Circuit's ruling, OSHA  itself suspended implementation of this mandate. Even so, my colleagues  and I in Congress know we, too, must fight against this mandate.   The COVID-19 vaccines are miracles of modern medicine and has saved  lives and quickened the end of the pandemic.   My family has embraced it. I am comfortable with my parents having  used this to live a more outward life, but we cannot forget that  America is founded upon principles enshrined in our Constitution that  protect an individual's ability to make their own decisions.   When I swore to uphold the Constitution, I promised to fight against  efforts to undermine these rights, and I stand by that oath today.   Madam Speaker, I urge support for this CRA.
