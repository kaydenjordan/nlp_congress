 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I  thank him for his work, and Rodney Davis' as well. Unfortunately, it  did not come to the place where we could have a bipartisan agreement.   Now, Mr. Speaker, today isn't just a day for debate. It is also a day  for remembrance. It is Peace Officers Memorial Day and the second-to- last day of Police Week. So, before I begin, I want to say thank you to  everyone who serves as a police officer or is a family member of a  police officer, including our wonderful Capitol Police and their  families who do an incredible job protecting this campus, its  employees, and its visitors. As the guardians of peace, they are on the  front lines every day. Despite the danger, they are undeterred from  performing their duty.   As the son of a firefighter, I know that they do not do their job for  recognition or praise, but they truly deserve our gratitude, especially  now. So, I thank them for everything they do, from a very grateful  Congress.   Now, Mr. Speaker, the work of our frontline heroes is the definition  of ``essential.'' It cannot be done remotely or by proxy.   Why should Congress be any different? We are supposed to represent  the people. We should strive to show a level of determination in our  important work that is worthy of the police officers we honor today.  The American people expect us to do our part to defeat this virus just  like they are doing on a daily basis.   Mr. Speaker, Speaker Pelosi said in this exact Chamber just a few  weeks ago: ``We are captains of the ship. We are the last to leave.''   But proxy voting calls on Congress to abandon the ship and be the  first to leave for months or possibly for the rest of the session. The  Speaker is on the brink of launching the most significant power grab in  the history of Congress. It runs counter to 230 years of House rules  and even the Constitution.   Mr. Speaker, our Founders would be ashamed that we aren't assembling.  I want every American to understand what it means for their Member of  Congress to whom they lend their voice in Washington. It means that you  can stay home for the rest of the year but still get paid for the rest  of the year. Many Americans will not be paid.   It means that they can let someone else--Speaker Pelosi--consolidate  power and do their job for them when they could do it for themselves.  It means that they will participate only in legislative theater while  shutting your voice out for the real lawmaking process.   A virtual Congress would be a Congress that is connected to the  internet but disconnected from the American people. That isn't fair to  our constituents, our colleagues, or our country. It undermines the  very purpose of representative democracy as our Founders designed it.   Roger Sherman, the only Founder to sign all four great state  documents, said, in 1789: ``When the people have chosen a  representative, it is his duty to meet others from the different parts  of the Union and consult and agree with them to such acts as are for  the general benefit of the whole community.''   Sherman was right. Especially in a pandemic, our presence here, our  Congress together, matters. It matters to our constituents; it matters  to our institution; and it matters to all those who will come after us.   This pandemic has claimed too many lives and livelihoods already. We  must not allow this great body that we are charged with safeguarding to  be the next casualty if you pass this bill.   In fact, aren't we proving today that we don't need a virtual  Congress?   In the middle of this virus, the House is conducting its business  while following the health guidelines. We can do that at a committee  level, too.   Our Republican colleagues, Mr. Cole and Mr. Davis, had submitted that  ``Plan for the People's House'' for the committees to work in a safe  manner. It is the only side that has produced a plan, and it was a  bipartisan plan to move forward. It is about more than reopening a  campus. It is about restoring America's voice.   We don't have to choose between the health of our Capitol community  and the health of this institution. We can continue to work in a safe  and effective manner without overturning 230 years of constitutional  and legislative tradition. Remote voting should be the final and last  option, not the first and only.   Unfortunately, rather than allowing the most reasoned voices to  prevail on this crucial matter, my friends across the aisle have  surrendered to the loudest voice.   Mr. Speaker, as I look at this reckless proposal, I am reminded of  what the great American author James Fenimore Cooper said in 1838. He  said that the most dangerous attacks on freedom are made by ``the  largest trustees of authority, in their efforts to increase their  power.''   Mr. Speaker, I believe that is worth hearing again. It was said in  1838 that the most dangerous attacks on freedom are made by ``the  largest trustees of authority, in their efforts to increase their  power.''   Cooper was correct, and that should concern each and every one of us  [[Page H2041]]  today. By changing the rules to increase the power of a select few,  Democrats will forever alter our institution for the worse.   That will be the legacy that is left this Congress, a Congress that  is a voice of people who have lent their voice throughout this Nation  to 435 Members that will now shrink to 20. We were warned that the  dangers of freedom will come from those who are the trustees of  authority. We were warned so maybe today would never happen, but now we  are witnesses of it. In a few minutes, we will be given the opportunity  to make that choice.   Mr. Speaker, will your legacy be what Cooper had warned the Nation  about? I hope it will not.   Mr. Speaker, if you are okay with overturning 230 years of tradition  and allowing 20 Members to control Congress, then vote for this  resolution.    Mr. Speaker, if you enjoy being cut out of the lawmaking process,  then vote for this resolution.   Mr. Speaker, if you ran to get a title but are willing to give your  vote in return, then vote for this resolution. But if you think our  Congress still matters, and if you think the people's voice still  matters, then I urge all of my colleagues to vote ``no.''   Mr. Speaker, I know each and every one of you will honor the police  for doing their job. Each and every one of you will honor all those in  the medical community for doing their job. I know Members will honor  the delivery driver, will honor the cashier, and will honor those who  are behind the check stands at Home Depot or in the grocery store  because Members think what they are doing is essential.   I hope that Members look deep in their hearts because when they asked  their constituents to vote for them because they believed the job they  were running for was essential for the Nation--because I think it is--I  want them to look at their vote.   Because, Mr. Speaker, if you believe 20 should have the power, if you  believe you should have the title and not do the job, and if you  believe you should be paid while you stay home, I think we have a  difference of opinion.   I believe our work is essential, and I believe we are proving we can  do it. I believed the Speaker when she said just a few weeks ago that  we are captains of the ship and that we will be the last to leave, not  the first to abandon it like you will today.   A vote for this resolution is a vote to abandon this House, to  abandon the Constitution, to abandon 230 years of tradition. You will  still have your title. You will have no power. And worst of all, your  constituents will have no voice.                                time  1430     Mr. Speaker, yesterday, Speaker Pelosi called  scrutinizing China a diversion. That could not be further from the  truth.   First, China lied to the world about the virus. According to a recent  study, 95 percent of this crisis would have been contained if China had  been honest. All they had to do was be honest. Imagine all the lives  and livelihoods that would have been saved.   Second, during the crisis, China leveraged its stockpile of personal  protection equipment for their own political gain and at the expense of  our frontline workers.   Third, just this week, it was reported that China is now hacking our  companies and universities to try to undermine our effort to find a  cure to save lives.   Speaker Pelosi should withdraw her comments. Instead, she withdrew  her Members from what was supposed to be a bipartisan task force on  China, one that we had planned and worked for for more than a year,  long before this virus came from the distant land.   Mr. Speaker, I would say to Speaker Pelosi that addressing China is  not a diversion. Justice for Americans is not a diversion. It is what  we must do to protect our country.   The real diversion is the proposal on the floor today.   This 1,800-page, $3 trillion proposal isn't a serious attempt at  making public policy.   Mr. Speaker, I listened to the talk which you had before your  conference. I listened when Speaker Pelosi told your conference to ``go  big.''   Instead of going big, it seems you went crazy.   This is a political messaging bill that has no chance of becoming  law. That is not my opinion. That is the opinion from your own Members  and from the media itself.   Why do they have that opinion? Let's look at the flaws in the bill  itself.   Its central demands were written behind closed doors, predates the  crisis, and are not targeted to the coronavirus.   Changing election laws won't speed up the development of treatments  or cures. That was the Democrats' number one bill, H.R. 1. Does anyone  remember back when they introduced that, the very first bill in  Congress, long before anyone ever heard of coronavirus?   Bailing out mismanaged pensions won't keep cash-strapped Main Street  afloat as Americans practice social distancing.   Suspending the cap on SALT tax deductions for millionaires and  billionaires won't reach the 36 million Americans who are now  unemployed. The Democrats promised to do that in their campaign, not  when the virus came forth.   This bill has more references to the cannabis industry in it than it  does to jobs, even though it is jobs, not dispensaries, that are going  up in smoke.   Millions of more dollars earmarked for the National Endowment for the  Arts won't stop China from hacking our companies and universities who  are working toward a vaccine.   America is in a serious crisis, but unfortunately, Mr. Speaker, the  House Democrats see it as leverage to pass their socialist agenda.   Mr. Speaker, Majority Whip Clyburn, who runs what I refer to as the  2.0 Impeachment Committee, called it a ``tremendous opportunity to  restructure things to fit our vision.''   Mr. Speaker, you have a Member on the other side of the aisle, who  authored the Green New Deal, who said, ``you absolutely love to see  it'' while she was cheering the loss of good jobs in the energy  industry.   There is another Member on the other side of the aisle, the co-chair  of the Progressive Caucus, who said about passing more legislation, the  concern,  [[Page H2241]]  she said, ``For me, the leverage is that there is enormous suffering.''   Mr. Speaker, I want to assure the American public that those are not  the views from this side of the aisle.   We do not view the coronavirus as an opportunity to reshape and  restructure government. We do not smile and cheer when people lose  their jobs. We do not think to use as leverage the fact that people are  suffering. We do not see that as an opportunity to grab  every philosophical idea we have that has nothing to do with the  coronavirus and put it into a bill. That is not who we are.    Today's partisan spectacle continues a trend by, unfortunately, the  Democrats that has strained Congress' relief efforts from the very  beginning.   History will write that in January, Democrats were too busy  impeaching President Trump to pay attention to what was happening in  Wuhan, China.   In March, Speaker Pelosi delayed passage of the bipartisan CARES Act  for 5 days. Her obstruction caused millions to lose their jobs and  politicized the process but changed little in the bill.   In April, Democrats dragged their feet over replenishing the crucial  Paycheck Protection Program for 14 days, allowing millions of jobs to  be lost in the meantime and creating greater uncertainty for cash- strapped small businesses.   It is time for the political games to end. It is time to put politics  on lockdown and get back to legislating.   1,800 pages. I won't ask who has read it, because I know nobody saw  it in committee. We will vote on the largest bill in the history of  Congress with not one committee hearing.   But Democrats might argue back because H.R. 1, their election law  bill that they passed more than a year ago before the crisis, they  didn't want to put it in here.   Democrats took the time to change the rules of the floor.   There are not many of us sitting on the floor today, Mr. Speaker,  because of this virus. But there are more sitting on the floor today  than can actually pass a bill after the rules they want to change.   You see, the American public, they might not understand that when  they lend their voice for 2 years to the person they vote for to  represent them in Washington, that may no longer be the case.   You see, now, after today, it only takes 20 people. Twenty Democrats  could each hold ten proxies to themselves and pass anything they want,  much like what we talked about here.                                time  1730    It won't stop China from hacking our universities to slow down our  ability to have a vaccine. It won't bring a new job. It may help the  cannabis industry, but it won't help Main Street. Maybe it helps you in  an election because you are going to take an opportunity to try to  change that as well. I will warn you, though, the American public is  smart.   We just saw, Mr. Speaker, just this Tuesday in a seat in California  where you changed the election law there. You made it an all-mail  ballot. That was okay. But when you saw the returns were not coming in  the way you wanted, you protested, so you changed it.   You actually put a place where people could walk in and vote, but not  throughout the district. You picked one area. Where did you pick? The  most Democrat precinct in the entire district.   It didn't turn out like you saw just a short time ago where a  Democrat won by more than 9 points. No. It actually flipped. It flipped  because the American public is frustrated. They are tired of these type  of games they are seeing. They are tired of what they are seeing  happening, Congress not working.   There are so many Americans, millions, who are no longer getting a  paycheck, but Congress is for not working.   What do you say to the Starbucks employee who works just two blocks  from here that shows up to work every day, but not Congress?   What do you say to the drivers who bring the food to the grocery  stores or those who restock them every night? That that is essential.  Or to the medical community who care for us? That that is essential.   What do you tell your constituents when you are going to ask them to  vote for you again? That it wasn't essential for you to work, that you  could have given a proxy to one of your friends who could vote for  them, whom they do not know, whom they did not vote for, whom they did  not lend their voice to?   What will you say to the constituent in a time of need? That you  wrote an 1,800-page bill, but you didn't write it? It was a select few,  not in a committee. It had no oversight, and that is why it ended up  talking about cannabis more than it ever mentioned a job.   Yes, this bill is up in smoke, and it should end that way. But we  should get back to what the American people expect of us: first, to  work to earn your paycheck; and second, to make sure China never has  the ability to do this again.   For more than a year, I worked with the other side to create a  bipartisan committee. They actually said yes. We went down to the date.  We named the people. It was February. We were going to announce it, but  they backed away.   To the American public, I want them to know we welcomed Democrats to  join us on this committee because we know and we understand 95 percent  of this would have never happened had they not lied.   We did not invite this virus; we did not welcome it; but we will  defeat it if we work together. The first thing is to work together to  defeat this bill, this rule, and bring the country back in this  Congress, what we were supposed to do so long ago.
