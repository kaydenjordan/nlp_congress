 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to talk to you about why  it is important to me and why it should be important to the American  people that we support those in Cuba who are fighting right now for  their future, for their freedom, for democracy, for human rights, and  for dignity.   I am the daughter of a Cuban refugee. My mother came to this great  country in 1959 to escape the oppression of the Castro regime. Sadly,  my family had been split apart, and my grandfather had remained in Cuba  to stay with his small businesses. He had two gas stations there, and  the regime had come in and taken his businesses and his home.  Unfortunately, my family never really reconnected.   As we look at what is happening right now in this island that is just  90 miles from our shore, it is incredibly important to note the role  that Cuba has played in spreading communism and socialism throughout  the Western Hemisphere. They have aligned themselves with the most  dangerous nations--our adversaries--across the world from Iran to China  to Venezuela to Russia and to North Korea. Mr. Speaker, you see them  all right now at this moment propping up this Communist regime.                                time  1030    We, the leader of the free world, must stand with the Cuban people at  this moment. We have a moment in history that is very similar to what  Ronald Reagan faced in 1987 with the Iron Curtain. This is our Berlin  Wall moment. The people in Cuba, my family included, have suffered for  six decades under a brutal murderous regime.   Tens of thousands of people have died at the hands of the Castro  brothers. Many, many more have been jailed and beaten simply for  peacefully protesting communism and wanting to live in freedom.   This regime has also played a very important role, unfortunately, in  spreading communism in the Western Hemisphere, as I mentioned. We saw  Venezuela, one of the richest nations in South America, be destroyed by  Hugo Chavez, Nicolas Maduro, propped up by the Castro regime. We see it  going into Nicaragua, Bolivia, and even here in the United States of  America.   And I can tell you, firsthand, in New York City, how painful it was  to me to see the communist symbol, the hammer and sickle, painted on  our government buildings last summer. If we end communism in Cuba, we  end its spread in the Western Hemisphere. And that is what we as the  American people, freedom-loving Americans, should be doing at this  moment in time.   And there is a reason why the Cuban people are marching in the  streets right now holding the American flag. It is because we are that  symbol of freedom, that beacon of hope and opportunity, and we must  rise to the occasion, garner support from our allies,  [[Page H3915]]  democracies from all around the world, to put pressure on this  illegitimate regime to exit.   One last thing I want to address is the issue of what some of my  colleagues say is the embargo. It is unconscionable to me that we would  have Members of Congress that would actually blame America for what is  occurring in Cuba.   What people need to understand is they do business with nearly every  country around the world, yet, nothing has changed in six decades. That  is because everything that comes into this island, whether it is food,  whether it is medicine, money, the regime takes it, and they use it to  weaponize against their people. You either go along with their  communist revolution or you get nothing, you starve. And that is the  reality. So lifting the embargo will only further prop up this regime.   Mr. Speaker, I urge the President, I urge my colleagues, and there  are Democrats and Republicans who do support Cuba at this moment, and  especially those of us who are of Cuban descent. Let's have a Berlin  moment here. Let's make history together. We need to just do it by  encouraging democracies from around the world to join us, and we need  our leadership to be extremely strong at this moment.   (English translation of the statement made in Spanish is as follows:)   Live free Cuba. We are with you. We hope to see liberty in Cuba soon.   Viva Cuba libre. Estamos contigo. Espero que vemos libertad pronto.
