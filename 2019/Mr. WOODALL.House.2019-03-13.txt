 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume,  and I thank my friend from California for yielding me the customary 30  minutes.   Mr. Speaker, when I see someone of your stature come to the chair, I  think: We must be down here to debate some serious American public  policy. We must be down here to change the law in ways that can only  happen once in a generation when people come together to make things  happen.   I don't know what they told you when you came to the chair this  morning, but let me be the first to tell you that is not at all why we  are here today. What we are here to say today is important, that the  American people have a vested interest in confidence in our democracy.  That is a value shared from the furthest side of the left to the  furthest side of the right. But the resolution we have here before us  today is just a restatement of current law.   Sometimes I think, Mr. Speaker, that we undermine faith in the  democracy when we try to pretend that division exists where division  does not, where we try to pretend that we are doing great things when,  in fact, we are not.   This is an opportunity today to speak with a voice in Congress that  says the special counsel should release the report. But let me be  clear, because we sometimes do more harm than good, that is going to be  the headline: ``House Votes for Special Counsel to Release Report.''  That is not actually what the resolution says, and I want to guide you.   If you have a copy, Mr. Speaker, you can go back through it. It is  not going to be on page 1. It is not going to be on pages 2, 3, 4, or  5. The real substance of the resolution is back on the bottom of page  5, early on page 6. It says, ``to the extent permitted by law.''   As you know from your legal background, Mr. Speaker, the law does not  allow the special counsel to release so many things. Grand jury  testimony, for example, nowhere in the country is grand jury testimony  disclosed. Those facts are gathered, but that is never disclosed.  Intelligence sources and methods, that is never disclosed, nor would  anybody on the other side of the aisle suggest that it should be.   That is why, in the resolution drafted by the Democratic chairman of  the Judiciary Committee, it says specifically that these things need  not be released because it is prohibited by law. I only make that  point, Mr. Speaker, because sometimes the headlines are all we read  when they come through on our Twitter feed. Sometimes we believe the  headline tells the whole story.    I want to make it clear that there is unanimity in this Chamber that  transparency is valuable in our Republic. But it is also true that this  is a nation of laws. The reason the special counsel exists is because  we are a nation of laws, and the substance of the special counsel's  report is going to be governed by those laws. To the extent allowable  by law, our Attorney General has already said he wants to make the  entire thing available.   I don't know how you want to characterize the resolution today, Mr.  Speaker, whether you want to characterize it as an insistence of the  House on how the administration should behave or just a big attaboy to  our new Attorney General to say: You are doing a great job, and we are  behind you 100 percent in what you have already promised the American  people you were going to do.   However you characterize that resolution--we heard it in the Rules  Committee, as my friend from California suggested--it is coming to the  floor today under a closed rule. So if anybody has any additional  changes they want to make, those changes will not be permitted. This is  a take-it-or-leave-it resolution from the Rules Committee today.   But as a restatement of current law, it is quite clear. Again, you  have to go all the way to the back of the resolution to find those 10  lines of substance. But when you get there, you will find these are  already things the Attorney General has agreed to, and all Americans  should be pleased about that outcome.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 7 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Burgess), a senior member on the Rules Committee and a  subcommittee ranking member on the Energy and Commerce Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Texas.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I want to ask my friend from Rhode Island before he  leaves the floor: The bill that he introduced, was that also a House  resolution or was that an H.R. to insist on the revealing?    I yield to the gentleman from Rhode Island.    Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman from Rhode  Island introducing the bill.   And I think that is an important distinction, Mr. Speaker, and that  is what you have heard, largely. You heard it in the Rules Committee;  you have heard it down here on the floor, that: Listen, there are lots  of things that we could be doing here, and if we wanted to pass a law  that insisted that the entire report was released--those parts that are  prohibited from being released under current law and those parts that  are intended to be released under current law--we could do that. That  is just not what we are doing.  [[Page H2694]]    What we are doing is saying: Hey, do you know what current law is?  Follow current law. Follow current law. We, the House of  Representatives, have thought about it, and in our deliberative wisdom,  we are prepared to announce that we believe current law should be  followed--Signed, U.S. House of Representatives.   There are those who would have you believe this is something more  than that. It is not. There is nothing wrong with what we are doing  today except that it is not a particularly valuable use of time.    When I opened, Mr. Speaker, you were not in the chair, but I  mentioned that I think we do great damage to trust in our Republic when  we seek division instead of highlighting our unity. To suggest that we  are down here doing something to protect our Republic from its  inevitable demise is just ridiculous. No such thing is happening here  on the floor today. All that is happening on the floor today is saying  that we, the duly-elected Members of the U.S. House of Representatives,  believe U.S. law should be followed.   Mr. Speaker, I agree, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I am looking for something to disagree with my friend  from Vermont about. I don't disagree with him about anything at all. I  thought that was a very thoughtful presentation.   The only thing I would point out is the reason that he doesn't know  what is in the Mueller report and the American people don't know what  is in the Mueller report, is because as of today, there is no Mueller  report. That is the only reason we don't know what is in it. It hasn't  been released yet.   I don't mean released to the public. I mean, Mueller hasn't written  it and handed it to the Attorney General yet, and so we don't know.  When that happens, let me tell you what the Attorney General has said,  Mr. Speaker. The Attorney General has committed to being transparent  with Congress and the public consistent with the rules and the law. I  don't think we would ask anything different of him.   The Attorney General has committed to providing as much information  as he can consistent with current regulations. I don't think we would  ask anything different of him than that, and, certainly, this  resolution does not ask anything different of him other than that.   He says that his objective and goal is to get as much information as  he can to the public. That is exactly what this resolution asks for;  exactly what he has already committed to. And he says, ``I feel like  I'm in a position in life where I can do the right thing and not really  care about the consequences. I can be truly independent.''   Well, that doesn't just mean truly independent from pressure put on  him from the White House. It also means truly independent from  statements of opinion sent to him by the U.S. House. He is going to do  the right thing, as allowed by the law and resolutions. If he doesn't,  this House can act and try to push a different outcome.   Just understand that that is not what this resolution does today. It  is simply a statement of fact. To my friend from California, there are  those Members of Congress that sometimes they speak and you just want  to get out your sharp stick, Mr. Speaker, and poke them a little bit  harder. They don't calm you down. They rile you up. My friend from  California is one of those folks whose thoughtful words always recenter  me and remind me what we have together.   He is right about the hyperbole, and I don't want to mischaracterize  this resolution. It does do one thing that is not available in current  law today, and that is, that it makes the official position of the  United States House known. I have always presumed that the Attorney  General would follow the law. This resolution says we expect the  Attorney General to follow the law.   It is not that it does nothing. It is just that it does something so  very little, perhaps our time would be better spent elsewhere, but I  support the underlying premise.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I tell my friend, I do not have any  speakers remaining at this point, so I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I hope folks pay attention to some of those things that  have brought folks together today, and I hope folks pay attention to  some of those things that haven't brought us together today.   We have talked about whether there has been overstatement and  hyperbole, whether it comes from that end of Pennsylvania Avenue or  this end of Pennsylvania Avenue. None of us are advantaged by that. It  breeds more distrust in the American public, and breeds more distrust  in this institution.   We have talked about who is to blame within the administration. Of  course, there is news today of Paul Manafort's sentence, not for  anything related to the election, but for things related to his private  business practices. There will be efforts to conflate those two  investigations. Those are two different investigations, and I think the  American people are disadvantaged if they are led to believe that those  sentences are related to the election of the President of the United  States.   But what you have heard is a lot of unanimity, as you would expect,  that we are a Nation of laws and the rule of law should be followed,  and transparency should be our touchstone, and the American People, the  boss of each and every one of us, whether we work on that end of  Pennsylvania Avenue or this end of Pennsylvania Avenue, have a right to  know what their tax dollars have paid for and what their government is  up to.   I find that very encouraging that we have that sense of agreement  here today, Mr. Speaker. What is noticeably absent in this resolution  is the dramatic overreach that I think has characterized most of the  work we have done so far in 2019. Things that could have been  partnership issues have been pushed further and further out to the edge  of the political continuum that they became partisan issues.   This resolution does not make those mistakes of the past, and to my  friend from California's point, these things are done incrementally.  Trust is built incrementally; relationships grow incrementally; and  success happens incrementally.   It is my great hope, Mr. Speaker, that those things that unite us,  transparency, rule of law, trust in and of the American people will  begin today to flourish in ways, perhaps, those common themes have not  thus far. And both parties play a role in that disappointing outcome.  But success has to begin on one day, Mr. Speaker. Perhaps success  begins today.   I serve on the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. There is  no such thing as a Republican road or a Democratic bridge. There is no  such thing as sitting in traffic on a Democratic highway or missing  your child's soccer game because of malfunctions on a Republican road.  We are all in this together.                                time  1300    I do not plan to offer a previous question today, Mr. Speaker,  because this isn't one of those issues that dramatically divides us. My  friend suggested in the Rules Committee we passed this out in, I think,  our first voice vote of the year out of the Rules Committee, and I  intend to do exactly that today.   Mr. Speaker, I appreciate my friend from California for yielding the  time and leading the debate today, and I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
