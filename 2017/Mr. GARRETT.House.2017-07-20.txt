 Mr. Speaker, there are two amendments to this important  piece of legislation that we bring forward. I want to thank the  chairman of the committee for allowing us the opportunity to be heard  and participate in this process.   The first is an amendment that ensures that there is a strategic plan  to reduce senior executive positions as it relates to the TSA. Right  now, we have more tail of the dragon than teeth of the dragon. We need  to make sure that we are focusing our assets efficiently and with  responsibility to the taxpayers who give us the money to protect the  homeland. This will save over $7 million in salary alone.   The second ensures that there is an oversight of the Homeland  Security Grant Program, which is intended to protect the homeland, so  we demonstrate that we are being good stewards of the public's dollars,  while ensuring the safest possible Nation that we can.
