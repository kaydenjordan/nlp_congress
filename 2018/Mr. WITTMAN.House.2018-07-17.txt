 Mr. Speaker, I begin by thanking the gentlewoman from  Wyoming for all of her efforts, as well as all of my colleagues for  their continued effort to do everything possible to assure the passage  of the National Defense Authorization Act and the Defense  Appropriations bill prior to the end of the fiscal year. That is key.   We have heard testimony about how money is wasted and uncertainty has  led us to where we are today. Without that, we must do everything we  can to assure passage of both of those bills.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Res. 998, which expresses  the sense of the House of Representatives that the United States Navy's  total readiness remains in a perilous state due to high operational  demands, increased deployment lengths, shortened training periods, and  deferred maintenance all while the Navy is asked to do more with less  as financial support for critical areas waned in the era of  sequestration and without consistent congressional funding.   We have heard that laid out. We agree on both sides that this has  created the uncertainty that creates the situation we found ourselves  in today.   I think it is important to define what the term ``Navy total  readiness'' truly means. The Navy conducted an independent Strategic  Readiness Review composed of retired Navy admirals, as well as current  senior civilian executives in the aftermath of the tragic USS  Fitzgerald and USS McCain collisions. This Strategic Readiness Review  identified institutional deficiencies that have developed over a long  period of time resulting in a weaker Navy.   Factors that contribute to total Navy readiness include: the total  number of assets--we know them as ships--manning and training, that is,  in particular, personnel, in how well they perform their jobs;  equipping and maintaining, that means providing sailors gear and  maintaining ships; command and control, which means establishing clear  lines of leadership and funding; and operations, which is the tempo at  which our men and women in uniform execute their missions.                                time  1445    If one or all of these total readiness factors are lacking, the Navy  will suffer. Unfortunately, that is the situation we find ourselves in  today.   But we didn't arrive here by accident. I believe we have a tendency  to respond to the crisis of the day rather than prepare for long-term  strategic problems with corresponding solutions.   Make no mistake about it, our adversaries are looking in the long  term. Don't think for a moment that China isn't watching what we are  doing and planning for where they will be not next week, not next  month, not next year, but 10 years down the road, 20 years down the  road, or a century down the road. The same with Russia, North Korea,  and Iran. We need to do the same.   After the Cold War and the Reagan administration came to an end, our  Navy rapidly decreased in size. In the next few decades, funding levels  became smaller and smaller. Tough cuts were made. The surface warfare  community decreased their level of training, weakening the skills of  their officers and reducing their capacity to effectively and safely  perform their jobs as ship drivers and warfighters. Ships retired  without replacements.   Then, a nationwide financial crisis brought upon a shortsighted  decision for sequestration, further crippling the Navy's ability to  take care of itself.   Meanwhile, threats to the United States and operational tempo have  not decreased. This created a situation where the Navy was overworked  with too few resources.   But our men and women in uniform never complain and never say they  can't accomplish their mission. They have the kind of resolve in doing  the things this Nation asks them to do that this Congress should have  in our commitment to providing them the resources necessary for them to  continue the great job that we ask of them.   But at a certain point, we all know we can't continue to operate this  way. Things begin to break down when they aren't given the resources  necessary. When their ships aren't properly maintained, when training  doesn't take place at scheduled intervals to make sure they maintain  that expertise that we need of them, sailors get stressed. When there  are simply too many jobs to do and not enough time for people to do  them, mistakes happen, costly mistakes.   We won't be able to reverse this trend immediately, but we can  continue to make targeted, strategic investments in assets, training,  and manpower to improve the Navy's readiness. I am proud of the work  that Congress has done in recent years, in particular, this year's  National Defense Authorization Act.   The House-passed NDAA adds a total of 13 battle force ships to the  Navy's inventory, makes critical investments in ship maintenance  accounts to take care of the ships we already have, and takes strong  action in regard to surface warfare officer training and command and  control structures within the Navy.   In consultation with our Senate counterparts, I am confident that we  will deliver a bill that supports the Navy's rebuilding efforts and the  drive and the objective of a 355-ship Navy.   We cannot be complacent. Yes, we have the best Navy in the world, but  we can be better. Our sailors and marines are the best on the face of  the Earth, and they do a spectacular job, folks. But until they can  walk on water,  [[Page H6291]]  which someday they may be able to do, until they can walk on water,  then we must continue to build them ships.   It is imperative that this Congress supports the United States Navy  financially and authoritatively in a manner that allows for reassuring  our allies, maintaining global presence, and defeating adversaries when  necessary. We must give our sailors and our marines the tools they need  to succeed in an atmosphere and an environment that is even more  challenging than it has ever been in the era of great power competition  where we know that our allies are committing to not just countering the  United States, but defeating the United States strategically.   We must do nothing less than fully support our Navy-Marine Corps  team, giving them what they need not just for today, not just for next  year, not just for within our purview of what this Congress has to do,  but for years to come, for decades to come, and for centuries to come.  For it is only with that, that we will be able to counter what our  adversaries are doing every second of every day, and that is finding  ways to defeat the United States strategically. We must do nothing less  than the same.    Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the gentlewoman from  Wyoming, again, for all of her efforts today to highlight this  important issue about the commitment this Nation has to make to our  military to make sure we rebuild this lost readiness, and H. Res.  998 is purely simply about that.    Are we willing to state our commitment to our sailors and Marines  about what we must do as a Nation to provide the resources that they  need to do the job that we ask them to do?  [[Page H6293]]    Are we willing to send a message to them that says, we are committed  to standing by them for everything that has to happen to provide  certainty to them so they know what their future holds?   Are we willing to send a message to our adversaries to say that this  Nation is committed to rebuild our Navy and Marine Corps team to make  sure that they are a force to be reckoned with anytime an adversary of  ours may think of acting badly around the world; that that Navy and  Marine Corps team will be there. That is what this resolution is about.   It is also sending a message to every one of our constituents; is  this Congress committed to the right policies to making the commitment  of resources to make sure that our Navy and Marine Corps team has what  they need? That is another important part of this message.   And will we, as a nation, assure that in the long-term we are  committed to countering what our adversaries are doing? And we see  that. We see that in scores. Whether it is something like submarines,  where we are on path, by 2029, to be down to 42 total attack  submarines, the most requested asset in the entire United States  inventory. We are down to 42 submarines in 2029.   China, by 2020, will have 70 submarines, total attack submarines and  ballistic missile submarines, building five to six per year, so that by  2029, when we are at 42 submarines, attack submarines, and on the way  to rebuilding Ohio-class submarines, the Chinese could be as high as  124 submarines. Now, quantity has a quality all of its own.   This resolution today says, are we going to make the commitment to  make sure that we can counter those adversaries? Are we going to be  able to tell our children and our grandchildren that when we had the  chance we made the commitment? We made the commitment to our sailors,  to our Marines, and as we will next week, to our soldiers and our  airmen, and subsequently our Coast Guardsmen, to make sure that they  have what they need, that this Nation makes the commitment to assure  that we have the future of our Nation's defense well in hand. That is  what today is about.   I ask my colleagues to join me to make sure that we are willing to  make this simple commitment. While it may be in words, those words will  speak volumes to our sailors, to our Marines, to our citizens, and to  our adversaries, that this Nation has an unshakable resolve to make  sure that we have what we need to counter the threats abroad, and to  counter anybody that thinks of threatening the United States, or our  friends, or our allies, or would want to act badly. Today's resolution  is all about that, not just for today, but for decades to come.
