 Mr. Speaker, due to inclement weather on June  19, 2018, my flight into Washington, DC, was delayed and caused my  absence during the vote series that began at 6:30 p.m. Had I been  present, I would have voted ``Yea'' on rollcall No. 269, ``Yea'' on  rollcall No. 270, and ``Yea'' on rollcall No. 271.                             personal explanation
