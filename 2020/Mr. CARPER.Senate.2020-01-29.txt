 Mr. Chief Justice, I send a question to the desk.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Senator Carper's question is for the House  managers:         Some have claimed that subpoenaing witnesses or documents       would unnecessarily prolong this trial. Isn't it true that       depositions of the three witnesses in the Clinton trial were       completed in only one day each? And, isn't it true that the       Chief Justice, as presiding officer in this trial, has the       authority to resolve any claims of privilege or other witness       issues, without any delay?    Mr. Manager JEFFRIES. Mr. Chief Justice, the answer is yes. What is  clear, based on the record that was compiled by the House of  Representatives, where up to five depositions per week were completed,  is that this can be done in an expeditious fashion.   It is important to note that the record that exists before you right  now contains strong and uncontroverted evidence that President Trump  pressured a foreign government to target an American citizen for  political and personal gain, as part of a scheme to cheat in the 2020  election and solicit foreign interference. That is evidence from  witnesses who came forward from the Trump administration, including  individuals like Ambassador Bill Taylor, a West Point graduate and a  Vietnam war hero; including individuals like Ambassador Sondland, who  gave $1 million to President Trump's inauguration; including respected  national security professionals like LTC Alexander Vindman, as well as  Dr. Fiona Hill--17 different witnesses, Trump administration employees,  troubled by the corrupt conduct that took place, as alleged and proven  by the House of Representatives.   But to the extent that there are ambiguities in your mind, this is a  trial. A trial involves witnesses. A trial involves documents. A trial  involves evidence. That is not a new phenomenon for this distinguished  body. The Senate, in its history, has had 15 different impeachment  trials. In every single trial there were witnesses--every single trial.  Why should this President be treated differently, held to a lower  standard, at this moment of Presidential accountability?   In fact, in many of those trials, there were witnesses who testified  in the Senate who had not testified in the House. That was the case  most recently in the Bill Clinton trial. It certainly was the case in  the trial of President Johnson. Thirty-seven out of the 40 witnesses  who testified in the Senate were new--37 out of 40.   Why can't we do it in this instance, when you have such highly  relevant witnesses like John Bolton, who had a direct conversation with  President Trump, indicating that President Trump was withholding the  aid because he wanted the phony investigations?   Counsel has said the greatest invention in the history of  jurisprudence for ascertaining the truth has been the vehicle of cross- examination. Let's call John Bolton. Let's call Mick Mulvaney. Let's  call other witnesses, subject them to cross-examination, and present  the truth to the American people.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you.   The Senator from Texas.
