 Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to the previous  question and, if defeated, I urge my colleagues to adopt H.R. 261 by my  friend and colleague, Representative Brian Mast.   This legislation places strict sanctions on individuals who knowingly  aid senior members or supporters of terrorist organizations. This  legislation, moving forward, is important in light of the terrorist  acts conducted by Hamas against the State of Israel.   These horrific scenes coming out of Jerusalem depict countless  rockets being launched from Gaza with the intent to massacre innocent  civilians. What we have seen from the Iron Dome's ability to intercept  this high volume of rockets is really truly remarkable, but it also  underscores Israel's security vulnerability.   We are reminded this past week of why the United States must continue  to be an ally of Israel and why our commitment to Israel's sovereignty  and independence is so crucial at a time of heightened regional  hostility. Each rocket launched into Israel was paid for by a certain  group or a certain individual, stemming from a vast network of  financiers, many from Iran, used by these terrorist organizations.   By punishing those who bankroll Hamas, Hezbollah, and other terrorist  organizations, we are taking an important step in providing Israel and  the Jewish people a bold signal of support for their self-defense and  their self-determination.                                time  1545    This legislation will help put an end to a critical financial  component of these terrorists by punishing those who facilitate  transactions and launder funds on behalf of those terrorist  organizations.   To my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, I call on you to  join our efforts to support our ally Israel. ``Never again'' is a  phrase we used to cement our determination to protect the Jewish people  around the world. At a time when terrorists are threatening the  existence of Israel, Democrats should be willing to join us at the  table for the reaffirmation of that commitment.
