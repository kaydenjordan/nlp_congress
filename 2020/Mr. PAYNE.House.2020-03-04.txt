 Madam Speaker, I rise today to commemorate March as  National Colorectal Cancer Awareness Month.   Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer deaths for  men and women in this country.   This year, almost 148,000 Americans will be diagnosed with this  dreaded disease, and 53,000 will die from it. Yet, if we catch it  early, 90 percent of patients could survive within 5 years.   The key is awareness and education. If we can educate more Americans  about colorectal cancer, we can limit the number of deaths from it. We  can remove the fears and stigmas that prevent people from getting  screenings.   I lost my father 8 years ago this weekend, Congressman Donald Payne,  Sr., to colorectal cancer. But if more people get screened, we have a  chance to keep more families from losing their fathers, brothers, and  sons to this disease.                            ____________________     Mr. Chairman, first, let me commend the chairman of the  Homeland Security Committee for this timely piece of legislation, this  long-time coming piece of legislation.   As has been stated, we fly home every week, and us being in Homeland  Security, we interact with the TSOs on a regular basis. I don't know  what is going on in the gentleman from Alabama's airports, but these  officers are really first responders who stand in the gap of whether we  fly or travel safely every single day.   They check thousands of bags for weapons that could be used to harm  people flying or the pilots or the staff on airplanes, and we can't  give them a dignified wage, a living wage?   I talk to them. Some of them have two jobs.   Why should someone with such an important duty to keep our airways  safe from terrorists and harm have to leave there and go work at Burger  King?   It is not right. I commend the gentleman from Mississippi once again  for this.   These people need to be given the dignity that they deserve. They  stand in the gap every single day, and not to pay them a commensurate  salary with their job is criminal.
