 Mr. Speaker, this week, the United Nations is hosting  its Climate Action Summit. Robust funding and sound policies are needed  to ensure we effectively combat climate change.   Threatened by increasingly more frequent and extreme changes in our  climate, territories like the U.S. Virgin Islands stand at the front  line of this quickly escalating climate crisis.   Within the past decade, my district has reduced fossil fuel use by 20  percent and has become a regional leader in clean energy. States and  territories have also passed regional and State-specific legislation to  combat climate change, but we need a comprehensive, forward-looking  national plan to address this threat to our children and our children's  children.   While we don't yet have all the tools to address rapid climate  change, we must create them through increased Federal investment in  research, development, and deployment of emerging technologies.   Across the Nation, climate change is threatening our economy and our  lives. Hurricanes like Irma and Maria collectively cost $140 billion,  according to NOAA, and, most importantly, they cost thousands of lives.   America must lead the charge to preserve our planet.                            ____________________
