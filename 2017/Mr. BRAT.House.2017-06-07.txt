 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the  concurrent resolution (H. Con. Res. 33) designating the George C.  Marshall Museum and George C. Marshall Research Library in Lexington,  Virginia, as the National George C. Marshall Museum and Library.   The Clerk read the title of the concurrent resolution.   The text of the concurrent resolution is as follows:                              H. Con. Res. 33         Whereas General George C. Marshall served as Army Chief of       Staff during World War II, Special Ambassador to China,       Secretary of State, and Secretary of Defense;        Whereas General George C. Marshall was promoted to General       of the Army in 1944, one of only five Army five-star generals       in the history of the United States;        Whereas General George C. Marshall was awarded the       Congressional Gold Medal in 1946 for his military strategy       and vital role during World War II;        Whereas General George C. Marshall was awarded the Nobel       Peace Prize in 1953 for developing the European economic       recovery strategy known as the Marshall Plan;  [[Page H4675]]         Whereas the George C. Marshall Foundation was established       in 1953 and is devoted to preserving the legacy of General       George C. Marshall through educational scholarship programs       and facilities;        Whereas the George C. Marshall Foundation opened the George       C. Marshall Museum and George C. Marshall Research Library in       1964 in Lexington, Virginia, on the post of the Virginia       Military Institute, which is the alma mater of General George       C. Marshall;        Whereas the George C. Marshall Museum educates the public       about the military and diplomatic contributions of General       George C. Marshall through extensive exhibits; and        Whereas the George C. Marshall Research Library maintains       the most comprehensive collection of records documenting the       life and leadership of General George C. Marshall: Now,       therefore, be it        Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate       concurring), That Congress designates the George C. Marshall       Museum and George C. Marshall Research Library in Lexington,       Virginia, as the National George C. Marshall Museum and       Library.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H. Con. Res. 33.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Con. Res. 33, a resolution  that designates the George C. Marshall Museum and George C. Marshall  Research Library in Lexington, Virginia, as the National George C.  Marshall Museum and Library.   George C. Marshall was one of America's most distinguished soldiers,  a dedicated statesman, and a genuine peacemaker. General Marshall  served as Army Chief of Staff during World War II, Special Ambassador  to China, and Secretaries of both the Departments of State and Defense.  He was promoted to General of the Army in 1944--one of only nine  individuals in our Nation's history to rise to the rank of a five-star  officer--and was also awarded the Congressional Gold Medal in 1946.   In addition, General Marshall was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in  1953 for developing the European economic recovery strategy known as  the Marshall Plan, which was essential to bringing peace to the postwar  European continent.   To honor the legacy of such an accomplished man, the George C.  Marshall Foundation was created in 1953, to pay tribute to General  Marshall's contributions to our Nation and the world during some of the  most perilous and tumultuous times of the 20th century. The Marshall  Foundation preserves this legacy through educational facilities and  scholarship programs.   The George C. Marshall Foundation opened the George C. Marshall  Museum and George C. Marshall Research Library in 1964, in Lexington,  Virginia, on the post of the Virginia Military Institute, the alma  mater of General Marshall. The library provides scholars with a  documented record of the life of General Marshall and his public  service, and the museum shares his inspiring story with visitors  through exhibitions, artifacts, and educational programs.   General Marshall's contributions to our Nation and our world cannot  be overstated, and I hope to see this resolution adopted to designate  the George C. Marshall Museum and George C. Marshall Research Library  as the National George C. Marshall Museum and Library.   Both institutions work tirelessly to highlight and share General  Marshall's work and service, and this is a fitting tribute to a man who  spent a lifetime faithfully and courageously serving his country at  home and abroad.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this resolution, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. Goodlatte).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased we are advancing a bipartisan proposal  today, one that means a great deal to the people in my home State of  Virginia, to designate the George C. Marshall Museum and Library as the  National George C. Marshall Museum and Library. We do this to honor a  great American hero and his enduring legacy.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this resolution, and I  yield back the balance of my time.
