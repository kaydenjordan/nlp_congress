 Mr. President, today, I honor a superb leader, liaison  and warrior. After 2 years of service as Director of the Navy Senate  Liaison Office, Chase Patrick is deservedly moving on and assuming the  responsibilities of a rear admiral, lower half. I believe it is fitting  to recognize Admiral Patrick's distinguished service and dedication to  fostering the relationship between the U.S. Navy and the Senate.   While I was just starting my time in the Senate in 1994, Admiral  Patrick was graduating from the University of Virginia that same year.  He showed his value quickly upon joining the Navy and has been  consistently relied upon for his exceptional leadership and  unparalleled work ethic. A surface warfare officer by designation,  Admiral Patrick has led our Nation's young men and women on shore and  at sea, most prominently in command of USS Chafee (DDG-90), where the  Navy selected him to receive the Vice Admiral Stockdale Award for  Inspirational Leadership and Commander Destroyer Squadron 50 and Task  Force 55.   Admiral Patrick has excelled in numerous other leadership positions  in the Navy, most recently as the director of the Navy Senate Liaison.  In Washington, DC, and around the globe, Admiral Patrick filled the  role that was initially created and held by the late Senator John  McCain after his return from Vietnam as a Navy Captain. Decades later,  Admiral Patrick had the job of leading the Navy Senate Liaison Office  through the COVID-19 pandemic, relentlessly coordinating congressional  delegations for our Members and our staffs during the most troubling of  times and ensuring continuity between this Chamber and the U.S. Navy.   Over the course of the last few years, Admiral Patrick led six  congressional delegations to 10 different countries. He escorted over  half of the Members of this Chamber on travel and became a trusted  adviser and friend to many of us. I have had the pleasure of traveling  with Admiral Patrick on several trips, including his first trip as  director of the Navy Senate Liaison Office. He distinguished himself by  going above and beyond the call of duty to facilitate and successfully  execute each and every congressional delegation, despite any number of  weather, aircraft, and diplomatic challenges.   This month, Admiral Patrick departs Washington for Naples, Italy, to  serve as the director of Maritime Headquarters, U.S. Naval Forces  Europe, Africa and Sixth Fleet. This Chamber will feel Admiral  Patrick's absence. I join many past and present Members of Congress in  my gratitude and appreciation to Admiral Patrick for his outstanding  leadership and unwavering support of the missions of the U.S. Navy. I  especially recognize his patient and supportive family, his wife Mrs.  Paurenia Patrick and his children, Sara, Chase, Jr., Harry, and Oliver.  I wish this Navy family ``fair winds and following seas.''                            ____________________     Mr. President, today, I want to recognize and  offer my sincere congratulations to Scott Robinson, director of the  Port of Muskogee, on his retirement after 31 years of service. I have  had the pleasure of working with Scott for a number of years, and we  have done a lot of good work together.   When I came to Congress, I set out with the notion to let the world  know that Oklahoma is navigable, and with Scott's help, we have been  able to do that. He has been a long-time advocate for Oklahoma's inland  waterways, serving on various waterways boards and commissions and  testifying before the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee.   Through his advocacy and leadership, Scott and I worked quickly to  help the Port of Muskogee recover after the historic 2019 floods that  decimated the Arkansas River Basin, including working to deliver  millions of dollars to ensure the port could rebuild for the future.  Under Scott's tenure, the port has grown tremendously as he oversaw the  port's expansion of property that has allowed industries to invest over  $2 billion into the port's facilities and create more than 2,500 jobs.  Because of Scott, the port is a true multimodal transportation hub for  the region.   As port director, Scott never missed an opportunity to highlight the  importance of the McClellan-Kerr Arkansas River Navigation System-- MKARNS--and its contribution to the long-term strength and security of  the U.S. economy, including supporting thousands of jobs, and providing  billions of dollars in sales impacts and transportation costs savings.  His tireless work throughout the years has ensured that the Port of  Muskogee and MKARNS system will continue to serve Oklahoma and our  Nation for decades to come. Oklahoma and the entire Nation have  benefited greatly from his leadership, and his legacy will not be soon  forgotten.   Congratulations again, Scott, on your well-deserved  retirement.                            ____________________
