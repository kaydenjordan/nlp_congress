 Madam Speaker, I was unavoidably detained. Had I  been present, I would have voted ``nay'' on rollcall No. 272.       MEMBERS RECORDED PURSUANT TO HOUSE RESOLUTION 8, 117TH CONGRESS       Cardenas (Gomez)      Carter (TX) (Calvert)      DeSaulnier (Matsui)      Frankel, Lois (Clark (MA))      Fulcher (Johnson (OH))      Gonzalez (OH)      (Reschenthaler)      Grijalva (Garcia (IL))      Kirkpatrick (Levin (CA))      Latta (Walberg)      Lawson (FL) (Evans)      McEachin (Wexton)      Meng (Jeffries)      Morelle (Tonko)      Napolitano (Correa)      Payne (Wasserman Schultz)      Rice (SC) (Wilson (SC))      Rush (Underwood)      Ryan (Kildee)      Stanton (Levin (CA))      Stefanik      (Reschenthaler)      Strickland (Torres (NY))      Swalwell (Veasey)      Wagner (Walorski)      Wilson (FL) (Hayes)      Young (Mast)                   Amendment No. 16 Offered by Ms. DeGette     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding,  and I thank my friend from California for the debate as well.   Mr. Speaker, we debate this often. We have made our points. We have  done this in committee for several months. I want to highlight a couple  of things here of what I believe is misinformation about this program,  specifically related to the cost and effectiveness of the current  Minuteman III.   The amendment sponsors will claim that the Congressional Budget  Office has concluded that Minuteman III life extension will cost $37  billion less than GBSD. The Office of the Secretary of Defense and the  U.S. Air Force have come to a different conclusion.   I recall conversations in a committee hearing with Secretary Roth, an  appointment of President Biden, talking about when you look at the  overall benefit of GBSD, if we continue to try to fix our old  carburetor or my old furnace, it is not going to be more effective for  what the long-term gain is.   The Democrat sponsors will claim that the Air Force has stated that  they can extend the Minuteman III. Admiral Richard told us that a life  extension is not possible. We simply don't have the parts. We have the  engineers at Hill Air Force Base that are looking on eBay, trying to  get actual parts for this.   Mr. Speaker, this is not possible. It is time to modernize.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to express my intense opposition to H.R. 3755,  the abortion on demand until birth act.   States have long had the right, even under Roe v. Wade, to pass laws  to protect life and women's health. But with this bill, House Democrats  would override the will of my constituents and the American people,  eliminating State and Federal pro-life laws across the country.   The bill is so extreme that it would throw out Utah laws that are  actually in line with Roe v. Wade. It would overturn a Utah law passed  in 2006, which requires minors to receive parental consent before  receiving an abortion; a Utah law passed in 2012, which requires those  seeking an abortion to wait 72 business hours before a face-to-face  informational visit and an abortion; and a Utah law amended in 2009,  which bans abortion at the point of viability.   This bill would legalize in Utah essentially all abortions up until  birth. The vast majority of my constituents in the First District,  including those on the right, those in the center, and those on the  left, support commonsense protections of third-trimester babies. The  bipartisan partial-birth abortion ban, which protects children from  painful--my wife is 6 months pregnant, sorry. It would also explicitly  preempt the Religious Freedom Restoration Act and eliminate conscience  rights for doctors and nurses who don't want to participate in  abortions.   Our focus in Congress should be oriented toward ensuring every child  has opportunities, no matter the circumstances of their conception or  birth, and that pregnant women and mothers have the resources they need  to support the families so they can make the right choice.   Democrats' radical attempt to federalize and expand abortion until  birth is unconscionable in every way for the First District of Utah and  for our Nation.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in adamant opposition to  H.R. 3755.
