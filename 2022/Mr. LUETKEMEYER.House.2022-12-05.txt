 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume and rise in support of H.R. 3462, the SBA Cyber Awareness Act,  as amended by the Senate.   Cyberattacks are too common in today's world. They cost the U.S.  economy billions of dollars each year and have the ability to harm and  shut down small businesses, which often operate on the thinnest of  margins.   Any cyber intrusion on a small business creates great pain and  uncertainty. H.R. 3462 takes important steps to enhance and support our  small businesses and the Federal Government from bad actors.   This bill strengthens cybersecurity operations at the Small Business  Administration by requiring the agency to issue a report to Congress  that assesses its ability to respond to cyber threats.   Additionally, H.R. 3462 requires the SBA to assess its own  cybersecurity framework and report on any incidents in a timely  fashion.   H.R. 3462 passed the House last year with a vote of 423-0, Mr.  Speaker, and was recently approved by the Senate with an amendment to  strengthen reporting requirements by focusing on supply chain and  foreign technology risk.   I thank the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Crow), the gentlewoman from  California (Mrs. Kim), and the gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. Flood) for  working together to protect small businesses, as well as our Senate  colleagues who worked on this bill. I also thank the chair for pushing  this bill forward.   I urge my colleagues to support the Senate amendment to H.R. 3462,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, the threat of a cyberattack on a small business is  constant. A cyber intrusion, no matter the magnitude, could have  devastating and consequential impacts for the Nation's smallest  businesses.   We must ensure the agency charged with helping the Nation's over 33  million small businesses is prepared. H.R. 3462 and the Senate's  corresponding amendment do just that.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support the legislation  before us today that will better protect the Federal Government and  America's small businesses from cyberattack, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 8844, the STEP Improvement  Act.   Small businesses are the drivers of innovation, leaders in job  creation, and beacons of American ingenuity across the globe.   The State Trade Expansion Program, or STEP, is a valuable tool for  small businesses looking to export and expand into global markets. This  program has made a real impact on small business owners who have used  the program to internationalize their websites and create relationships  on foreign market sales trips.   In my district, this program has helped a veteran-owned business  expand into 10 countries in Southeast Asia and helped a consulting  company transition from zero percent to 75 percent international sales.   The legislation will ensure small businesses can continue to benefit  from STEP by reauthorizing the program through 2026. Additionally, H.R.  8844 will improve the program by creating a standardized application  process.   Further, the legislation requires the SBA to report best practices,  lessons learned, and the program's performance metrics.   I applaud Representatives Kim, Flood, Evans, and Newman for their  bipartisan work on this legislation.   I also thank the chair for holding multiple hearings on the topic and  for moving this legislation forward.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan  legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to  the gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. Flood), one of our newest members on  the committee, but he is a staunch supporter and has worked tirelessly  for the small businesses in his community as well as those around the  country.     Mr. Speaker, in a growing global economy, we must  empower our small businesses to compete on the world stage.   This legislation will ensure that entrepreneurs have ample  opportunities to engage in international trade.   H.R. 8844 also ensures accountability, which is very important,  requiring an analysis of the performance metrics of the program to  ensure that it is effectively and efficiently supporting small  businesses.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support H.R. 8844, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the House Amendment to S. 1687, the  Small Business Cyber Training Act of 2022.   All businesses, regardless of size or available resources, are  susceptible to cyber threats. If large businesses can become victims of  cybercrimes, small businesses are even more vulnerable.   This bipartisan legislation directs Small Business Development  Centers, SBDCs, to provide training to thwart potential attacks and  educate small businesses on the most up-to-date cybersecurity  practices. With over 1,000 local centers nationwide, SBDCs are well- positioned to assist small businesses with their cybersecurity needs.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Garbarino for his leadership on this  issue and commitment to enhancing Missouri's economic competitiveness  and cyber resiliency.   I also thank my counterparts in the Senate for their work on this  legislation.   S. 1687 passed the Senate in September, and I urge my colleagues to  support the bill we have before us today that does not include unneeded  reimbursement provisions included in the final form.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1500     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   S. 1687, as amended, takes important steps to prepare small  businesses to combat cybersecurity threats.   This bipartisan bill to expand services at Small Business Development  [[Page H8741]]  Centers will ensure small businesses have the resources necessary to  create a cybersecurity plan and detect cyber risks.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 1617, the Disaster Assistance  for Rural Communities Act.   Whether it is a hurricane, tornado, fire, or flood, we are all too  familiar with a natural disaster's devastating impact on our  communities and constituents. Following a disaster, the SBA provides  valuable services and loans to businesses and homes affected.   Due to the rural areas being sparsely populated, they are often  outliers when it comes to disaster assistance. This important  legislation corrects this unintended consequence by creating a rural  category for SBA-declared disasters.   Additionally, the legislation requires the Government Accountability  Office, GAO, to report on how rural areas are specifically impacted by  disasters, and the legislation requires the SBA to annually report on  all rural disaster declarations.   Small businesses are the lifeblood of the economy in rural  communities, and we must ensure that they have the ability to receive  SBA assistance when a disaster strikes.   I thank my Senate colleagues for their support for rural communities  and their work on this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, S. 1617 will provide rural areas with enhanced  eligibility for SBA-disaster-declared loans. This bipartisan bill takes  an important step to aid rural communities and small businesses when a  disaster strikes.   Mr. Speaker, S. 1617 passed the Senate in September, and I urge my  colleagues to support this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
