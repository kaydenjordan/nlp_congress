 Mr. President, most servicemembers come from a  military family like MSgt Bob Ammons of Ozark, AL. Born on an Air Force  base to a career airman, Bob decided to follow in his dad's footsteps.  He enlisted in the U.S. Air Force as an air freight specialist.   Bob did 14 assignments in 32 different countries during his 24-year- career. His skills in developing safety strategies ensured many  American airmen returned home safely from their missions overseas. Bob  climbed the ranks to becoming a senior munitions inspector and missile  inspector, where he was in charge of ensuring all missile systems were  ready for combat.   After retiring from the military in 1998, Bob decided to make Alabama  his  [[Page S5398]]  home. Now, he uses his time volunteering across our State. He started  by volunteering as a volleyball, softball, and basketball coach in  Dora, AL. Now, he volunteers with veterans and faith groups in the  Wiregrass. Bob and his wife are actively involved in Post Oak Baptist  Church in Ozark. Bob helps fix donated appliances for the Dale County  Baptist Association's thrift store. He also serves as a service officer  for Chapter No. 94 of the Disabled American Veterans, where he helps  veterans with benefits and medical appointments.   Bob is also very involved with Friends of Army Aviation, helping  inspire future generations of aviators and supporting aviator veterans.  Friends of Army Aviation President Doc Holladay says that Bob ``works  tirelessly and consistently on any job that he is assigned. There is no  hill too high for a climber like Bob.''   Alabama is fortunate that Bob chose to use his talents to make our  State a better place to call home. I am proud to recognize Bob Ammons  as the November Veteran of the Month.                            ____________________
