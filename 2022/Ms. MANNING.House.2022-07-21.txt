 Madam Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of my bill, the Right to  Contraception Act. It seems unbelievable that in the year 2022, we  should have to explain that access to birth control is about equality.  It is critically important so that women can:   Decide whether and when to have a family.   Pursue an education.   Build an economically secure future; and   Protect their health.   Let's be honest about the facts. Almost all women will use birth  control at some point in their lives, and more than 96 percent of  voters support access to birth control. Yet, the right to birth control  is under attack by Republican lawmakers who are pushing disinformation  about how contraceptives work and attempting to ban methods like IUDs  and Plan B.   Justice Thomas has added fuel to that fire by stating in Dobbs that  the Court should reconsider the constitutional right to contraception.   This extremism is about one thing: control of women. We will not let  this happen. We will not play defense anymore. This time, we are  playing offense.   My bill creates a Federal statutory right for individuals to use  birth control and for healthcare professionals to provide it.                                time  0930    It protects a full range of contraceptive methods, including birth  control pills, IUDs, and emergency contraceptives.   It subjects any State or government official who restricts access to  contraceptive services to a civil action by the  [[Page H6930]]  attorney general, or an individual or healthcare provider whose rights  are violated.   Let's be clear, this bill is about allowing women the freedom to  choose the contraception that works best for them to allow them to  prevent unintended pregnancies.   American women--indeed all Americans--deserve the freedom to make  their own decisions about their bodies, their family planning, and  their lives.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to  vote ``yes'' on this well-crafted bill, the Right to Contraception Act,  because women and girls across this country are watching you. They want  to know:   Are you willing to stand up for them?   Are you willing to fight for them?   Madam Speaker, I certainly am.
