 Madam President, I rise to introduce the Ackerson Meadow  Land Exchange Act. This legislation will facilitate a simple land  exchange between the National Park Service and the U.S. Forest Service  in the Sierra Nevadas.   This bill would transfer 160 acres of Stanislaus National Forest land  to the National Park Service to be managed as part of Yosemite National  Park Service to be managed as part of the Yosemite National Park and  transfer 170 acres of National Park land to the Forest Service to  manage as part of Stanislaus National Forest. The land in the exchange  is known as Ackerson Meadow.   Ackerson Meadow is one of the largest midelevation meadows in the  Sierra Nevada. It is an ecologically and regionally critical wildlife  corridor, and the scenic meadow is an important habitat for the State  endangered great grey owl and little willow flycatcher, as well as a  suite of additional at-risk wildlife species. In 2016, a coalition of  conservation groups donated Ackerson Meadow to Yosemite National Park;  however, it is almost completely surrounded by Stanislaus National  Forest and only partially contiguous to the rest of Yosemite National  Park.   The current configuration of land management presents logistical  challenges to both NPS and Forest Service; therefore, both Agencies, as  well as local stakeholders, support this land exchange.   I look forward to working with my colleagues to pass this  straightforward legislation to better manage the land in and around  Ackerson Meadow.                                  ______                                         By Mr. PADILLA:   S. 3046. A bill to make permanent the authority to collect Shasta- Trinity National Forest marina fees; to the Committee on Energy and  Natural Resources.    Madam President, I rise to introduce the Shasta Trinity  Marina Fees Act to make permanent the existing authority for the U.S.  Forest Service to collect and retain marina fees within the Shasta- Trinity National Forest.   The ability to collect these fees has proved critical to the success  of the Shasta-Trinity National Recreation Area, and the funds are used  to enhance recreation, support public safety and service announcements,  improve lake access, and provide greater marina infrastructure for  boaters.   In 2008, Congress gave the Forest Service the ability to collect and  retain marina fees in the Shasta-Trinity National Forest in order to  fund the Shasta-Trinity National Recreation Area; however, that  authority expired in 2019, and Congress has granted the Forest Service  1-year reauthorizations since then.   This bipartisan bill would make this authority permanent, providing  certainty to the Forest Service and guaranteeing the ability to  maintain recreation infrastructure.   Trinity County is one of the poorest counties in the State of  California, with declining revenue sources to fund public services and  a strained economy. The Shasta-Trinity National Recreation Area is the  largest driver of tourism activity to the area, and visitors come to  the region to enjoy the Shasta and Trinity Lakes.   The ability to collect marina fees has allowed the Forest Service to  support 15 permanent and 9 seasonal employees who provide vital support  for recreation and has also paid for cleaning and maintenance of  infrastructure, fire prevention patrols, and accessible facilities to  provide greater access for people with disabilities.   We must provide certainty to ensure that this critical investment in  Shasta-Trinity National Forest won't be threatened congressional  inaction, government shutdowns, or gamesmanship.   I look forward to working with my colleagues to pass this legislation  to provide permanent, crucial investments for one of California's  meccas for outdoor recreation.                            ____________________     Madam President, I rise to introduce the Ackerson Meadow  Land Exchange Act.
