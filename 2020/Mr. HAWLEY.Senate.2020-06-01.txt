 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, it was 1 week ago today that George  Floyd died in the streets of Minneapolis at the hands of Minneapolis  police officers exercising and employing incredible, illegal,  unconstitutional violence ending in the loss of Mr. Floyd's life.   This afternoon, we have a medical report from examiners hired by Mr.  Floyd's family. The words are just shocking. The report concludes:         George Floyd was killed by asphyxia due to neck and back       compression and died at the scene.        Sustained pressure on the right side of Mr. Floyd's artery       impeded blood flow to the brain, and weight on his back       impeded his ability to breathe.    Then the report concludes:         The independent examiners found that weight on the back,       handcuffs and positioning were contributory factors because       they impaired Mr. Floyd's diaphragm to function. From all the       evidence, the doctors said it now appears Mr. Floyd died at       the scene.    Words cannot begin to describe the injustice that this report puts  into plain text: the violation of police procedures, the abuse of the  law, the appalling, illegal, homicidal misuse of government authority.  Words cannot begin to describe the injustice that this has done to Mr.  Floyd, to his family, to his community, and to millions of Americans  who feel caught up, who feel judged by, endangered by, imperiled by  these actions and too many others like them over too many years for too  long in this country.   I just want to say as the former attorney general of my State--a role  in which I had the great privilege to work day in and day out with law  enforcement across the State of Missouri, law enforcement who go to  work every day to prevent this kind of illegal violence, to prevent  this kind of illicit use of power--that the actions by the police  officer and officers here in this case cast an incredible aspersion on  those valiant and courageous and law-abiding police officers, Black and  White and of every color across our country, who go to do their job  every day to protect and uphold and defend the Constitution of the  United States and to protect men and women like George Floyd. The  actions of these officers in this case are an incredible betrayal of  those standards of those officers and of justice itself.   I understand why so many Americans have assembled peacefully to  witness to this abuse of power and to protest it and to demand that  justice be done. They are right to do so, and they are right to demand  that this pattern of violence exercised against African-Americans be  acknowledged and it be confronted and it be stopped.   This is urgent work for us as a nation and for this Congress as we go  forward.   I also believe that those who would turn this occasion into an  opportunity for rioting and for looting and for more violence and for  further attacks and for civil unrest do a great disservice to the  memory of Mr. Floyd, to his family, and to this cause of justice that  we Americans share together, for this is a cause that is ours together  as a nation. This is a cause given to us by our common Constitution.  This is a cause that should link us together, American with American,  and we must resist the efforts of those--all of those--who would set us  against ourselves as we seek to pursue that more perfect union, as we  seek to pursue justice in this case and in other cases and in the  future to come.   So I add my voice to those who call for an end now to the rioting and  to the looting, to those who would defame and dishonor and disfigure  the memory of Mr. Floyd and his cause. I hope all lawful steps will be  taken to protect innocent and law-abiding citizens in our cities and in  our communities so that the peaceful assembly and its righteous cause  can go forward.   I just want to say one more thing on this subject. We cannot ignore  that these peaceful protests are taking place amid a backdrop of the  20-percent unemployment in this Nation--perhaps higher in the urban  centers of our Nation. I think of a line by a former Senator, who once  said that ``to be unemployed is to have nothing to do, and that means  having nothing to do with the rest of us.''   I hope that as we as a nation and we as a body in the U.S. Senate  turn our attention to what we can do to seek that more perfect union,  what we can do to better secure the promise of our Constitution, what  we can better do to secure that dream we hold together as Americans, I  hope one thing we will discuss is the vitality, the necessity of work-- work that is meaningful and that is rewarding and that is available for  all Americans, from our urban core to our small towns.   I hope we will have a discussion about the policies that for too long  in this country, for too many decades, have sent too much work out of  our country, away from our cities--away from our small towns, for that  matter. I hope we can discuss what we will do to bring work back so  that those who grow up in our cities--young men who grow up in our  cities--will have a sense of a future, will have a sense of  possibility, will think that ``there is something for me here. I could  build a family here. I could start something here. And yes, I could  have a say and a share in our society here.'' For that, they have to  have work. They have to have meaningful work.   This is a task to which we must set ourselves. It is urgent now in  this present pandemic crisis that has seen these unemployment numbers  rocket to historic, unimaginable levels. It is vital we address the  crisis of work, but it is also vital for our future. It is vital for  our urban core. It is vital for the young men and women who struggle  there. It is vital for our rural towns and our small areas like the one  I am from. It is vital for every part of this country, for every member  of this Nation, and it is work I hope we will take up urgently together  to provide good-  [[Page S2627]]  paying, meaningful jobs that can support the social fabric that is the  foundation of our democracy.   There is much to do in the months and the years ahead. I just hope  that the loss of Mr. Floyd will serve as a fresh beginning, an  opportunity for a new start, for Americans from every corner of this  country, from every political background, from every race and  ethnicity, to stand together and to say: We commit ourselves anew to  this Constitution that we love, to this Nation that we call home, and  we are determined now more than ever to seek and to build a more  perfect union.   I yield the floor.
