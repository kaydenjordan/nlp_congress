 Mr. President, today, I wish to recognize and honor the  extraordinary public service of Janak ``Hodge'' Kanti Patel, who has  been my State director for the past 6 years in the U.S. Senate and my  district director for the prior 6 years in the U.S. House of  Representatives. Over 22 years in the House and Senate, Hodge has  served the people of Indiana with a high level of integrity and  professionalism, combined with a strong emphasis on constituent  services and community engagement.   A longtime resident of South Bend, IN, Hodge attended St. John the  Baptist Roman Catholic Church and School, St. Joseph's High School,  Holy Cross College, St. Mary's College, and the University Notre Dame.  While at Notre Dame, Hodge interned for then-Third Congressional  District U.S. Congressman Tim Roemer and was hired upon graduation as a  case manager, where he worked on military, veterans, and immigration  case work until he was promoted to the role of field representative in  that same office.   In 2001, Hodge joined the staff of U.S. Senator Evan Bayh as his  Northeast Indiana Regional Director, where he covered 21 counties and  two offices: Fort Wayne and South Bend. Upon my election in 2006 to the  U.S. House of Representatives, I invited Hodge to join my team as  district director. In his role, he helped establish three congressional  offices and hired a highly dedicated team of nine staff members to help  serve the more than 700,000 Hoosiers that I represented for three terms  in Congress. Together we worked to establish an expanded VA community  based outpatient clinic in downtown South Bend, a full service veterans  healthcare clinic for St. Joseph County, as well as organized job  fairs, job-seeker workshops, and access to capital events for small  businesses across the Second Congressional District. Hodge also helped  to organize more than 1 dozen constituent stakeholder advisory groups  and oversaw our office's military service academy nominations process.   In 2012, when I was elected to the U.S. Senate, I once again asked  Hodge to join me. As my State director, Hodge led my team in Indiana  and played a vital role in hiring 20 staff members to help serve  Hoosiers and established six Senate offices located in Evansville, Fort  Wayne, Hammond, Indianapolis, Jeffersonville, and in my hometown of  South Bend.   Over the last 6 years, Hodge oversaw our constituent services team  that managed 12,000 cases and recovered $12.6 million for Hoosiers. He  also played an important role in working with our grants director to  proactively seek out opportunities where we could enhance nonprofit  organizations and local communities in their efforts to serve the  public. Additionally, there were more than 100 projects around the  state that Hodge and the Indiana State staff team worked on to ensure a  favorable outcome. Finally, Hodge was also able to build coalitions and  gain a high level of respect among his counterparts in Indiana on both  sides of the aisle in both the House and Senate.   I am extremely proud to recognize Hodge Patel's 22 years of tireless  commitment to public service on behalf of Hoosiers. I wish Hodge and  his four children Harper, Dylan, Elliott and Quinn, as well as his  partner, Ali Oesch, the best in their future endeavors outside of  public service.                            ____________________
