 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember  Valerie Hortenstine Sheldon, a beloved community police officer who  tragically passed away at the age of 39 in a traffic accident last  week.   Valerie was the chief of police in Raymond, Illinois, a small, tight- knit community just a few miles from my hometown of Taylorville. She  served as a law enforcement officer in three neighboring communities  before coming to Raymond in 2007. She was named  [[Page H4152]]  police chief 9\1/2\ years ago by Raymond's mayor, who said she ``fit  the bill as the perfect small-town officer.''   Those who worked with her said she was always willing to do what she  could to help out the village. She oversaw the Neighborhood Watch  Program in Raymond, and she was a Montgomery County emergency  management volunteer as well as a member of the Montgomery County  search and rescue team.   There was nothing more important to Valerie than the safety of her  community. Like most law enforcement officers, Valerie loved every day  of her job, and she loved serving the people of Raymond. She made a  profound impact on so many, and I know she will be greatly missed.   My prayers are with her two sons, Jake and Isaac, her family, and the  entire town of Raymond during this difficult time.                            ____________________
