 Mr. Speaker, I rise on behalf of the mothers, fathers,  brothers, and daughters, the classmates and coworkers, the surviving  family and community members, all of whom have been robbed of loved  ones due to senseless acts of gun violence.   I rise on behalf of mothers with broken spirits and broken hearts.   I rise on behalf of fathers with deep wounds and invisible scars, a  lifetime of guilt because they couldn't keep their child out of harm's  way.                                time  1045    Mr. Speaker, I rise on behalf of young boys and girls, children  traumatized and sad because they have attended more funerals than  graduation parties.   I rise on behalf of survivors, community organizations, and advocates  who selflessly trigger their own trauma to stand on the front lines of  justice and movement building.   I rise on behalf of districts like mine, the Massachusetts Seventh,  that are weighed down by systemic inequities, generational poverty, and  cycles of violence.   Today, in partnership with organizers, advocates, and survivors, I am  calling for a National Survivors of Homicide Victims Awareness Month to  amplify the voices of families and communities severely and  disproportionately impacted by gun violence; to center their struggles,  their stories, their truths; to foster peace; and to seek justice.   Already this year, 16 families across the Massachusetts Seventh have  been robbed of their loved ones. I rise in remembrance of them and in  recognition of those they left behind:   Emmanuel Molin, 32, survived by his two sons, mother, father, and  five siblings;   Godfrey Jenkins Hall, 28, survived by his son, brother, and aunt;   Carl Reynolds, 28, survived by his mother, father, siblings, and  daughter;   Gary Brown, 34, survived by his son and sister;   Jeudy Romero, 29, survived by five children, fiance, father, and  siblings;   Juan Morales, 32, survived by his three children;   Kasim Kahrim, 36, survived by his sisters, aunts, and uncles;   Kendric Price, 32, survived by his mother, grandmother, brothers, and  godchildren;   Haki Sanders, 33, survived by his mother;   Eleanor Maloney, 74, survived by three daughters, a son, six  grandchildren, seven great-grandchildren, and four siblings;   Michael Dukes, 53, survived by his mother, father, five children, one  grandson, sister, and dear friends;   Kevin Boyd, 53, survived by his wife, two sons, grandchildren, and  brother;   Kevin Brewington, 33, survived by his mother, father, son, brothers,  and sisters;   Donell Davis, 24, survived by his mother, brothers, and sister;   Carl Brown, 43, survived by his child; and   Luckinson Oruma, 60, survived by his wife and five children.   Tomorrow will mark the anniversary of 49 souls lost, lives we were  robbed of 3 years ago at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, and the fear  and trauma of those who survived and the families and loved ones that  they left behind.   May we remember them. May we speak up for them. May we fight to  ensure that there is no one else like them.   Long gone are the days of thoughts and prayers. Now is the time for  outrage, equitable outrage, policy, and change. This is a public health  crisis, an epidemic.   Bullets do not discriminate. They don't care if we are a Member of  Congress, a World Series champion, a senior citizen, or a child.   It is up to Congress to demonstrate courage, to do what is right for  our children, for our communities, for all survivors impacted by gun  violence.   Enough is enough. These survivors deserve our respect. They deserve  our resources. They deserve healing. They deserve justice.   In districts like the Massachusetts Seventh, community-based  organizations are doing their job every day: Violence in Boston,  Operation LIPSTICK, We Are Better Together, the Louis D. Brown Peace  Institute, the Justice Resource Institute, the Women Survivors of  Homicide Movement, and the Bobby Mendes Peace Legacy project.   Our Suffolk County D.A., Rachael Rollins, is fighting every day to  improve our clearance rates to get these surviving family members the  justice they deserve.   It is time for Congress to do our job. Enough is enough.                            ____________________
