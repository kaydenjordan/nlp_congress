 Mr. President, I rise today, during Asian Pacific  American Heritage month, in remembrance of Representative Patsy  Takemoto Mink. Representative Mink was elected 55 years ago to  represent Hawaii's second congressional district. In 2006, I had the  privilege of filling the seat that my friend, Representative Mink,  honorably held for 24 years.   Patsy Mink was a trailblazer, whose career embodied a series of  firsts. She was the first woman of color, and first Asian American  woman elected to Congress in 1964. She became the first Asian American  woman to practice law in Hawaii and the first Asian American woman  elected to the Hawaii territorial legislature. No matter how many times  she was excluded from traditionally male spheres, Representative Mink  persevered and took risks. She overcame gender and racial  discrimination and pursued a career during which she fought the  injustice that she had endured. She devoted nearly 50 years of her life  to be a champion for those who had no one to stand up and speak for  them.   Representative Mink maintained a national focus on issues facing the  Asian Pacific American community. Twenty-five years ago, she helped  found the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus. She also worked  with members of Hawaii's congressional delegation to educate Americans  about the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II.   Representative Mink fought throughout her life for the principles of  equity, fairness, and integrity. She was a leader on women's rights,  social and economic justice, health care, child care,  [[Page S3114]]  and education. She introduced the first childcare bill in the House.  Patsy's name is forever linked with the passage of Title IX of the  Education Amendments of 1972, which she coauthored and fought for  relentlessly. This act is now named the Patsy T. Mink and Louise M.  Slaughter Gender Equity in Education Act. Title IX provides women and  girls equal access to higher education and protection from sexual  harassment, and prohibits gender discrimination in all educational  activities, notably in athletics. Representative Mink often said, ``It  is easy enough to vote right and be consistently with the majority. But  it is more often more important to be ahead of the majority.'' I know  our country can remain forward-thinking by ensuring that young women  and minorities are given equal opportunity.   Representative Mink was one of only eleven women to serve in the  House of Representatives in 1964, and she became one of the longest- serving women in Congress. She shattered the glass ceiling during a  time when women were not seen as leaders, especially not in Congress.  Representative Mink continues to be an inspiration to many, and her  legacy lives on in schools, universities, and here, in Congress. Last  year, a record number of women ran for public office and were elected.  With 102 women elected to serve in the House of Representatives and 25  women in the Senate, the 116th Congress is the most diverse yet. Patsy  would have been delighted.   In 2007, upon my election to the U.S. House, I was proud to cast my  first vote in support of Nancy Pelosi for speaker and did so in memory  of Patsy Mink. Earlier, Speaker Pelosi told me that Representative Mink  was the first person to tell her that ``one day, you're going to be  speaker.'' Patsy would have loved to have been there to see her words  come true for her friend, Nancy.   The last time I saw Patsy was when both of us were in the Kailua 4th  of July parade in 2002. She asked me to have lunch with her. I have a  picture of us from that day and it is a poignant reminder of my friend  Patsy and her attitude of never giving up and persevering because our  work is not done. She is a continuing inspiration to me.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
