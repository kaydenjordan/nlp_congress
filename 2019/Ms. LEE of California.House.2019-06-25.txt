 Mr. Chairman, first, let me thank Chairman  Quigley for his leadership and for yielding.   Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of the fiscal year 2020  Financial Services and General Governmen Appropriations bill.    This includes $1.4 billion in funding over fiscal year 2019 enacted  levels to support critical functions and services in the executive and  judicial branches, it ensures the integrity of our Federal elections,  as well as supporting critical programs that protect consumers.   I am pleased that the bill includes my language that would nullify  President Trump's proposed changes to the calculation of how we measure  poverty, which would have a devastating impact on families all across  the country.   This bill also includes $23 million for the Healthy Food Financing  Initiative, which provides critical financing to attract grocery  stores, food banks, and other fresh food businesses to underserved  areas. Thanks to HFFI, healthy food initiatives are available in all of  our congressional districts in urban and in rural communities, and also  in my congressional district at the Mandela MarketPlace in Oakland,  California.   As co-chair of the Pro-Choice Caucus, I thank Chairman Quigley for  lifting the ban on the use of local D.C. funds for abortion services.  This ban has unjustly prevented 55,000 D.C. women of reproductive age  from accessing the full range of reproductive healthcare, including  abortion. This has been targeted to low-income women, primarily women  of color, so I thank Chairman Quigley for this.   The bill also includes language prohibiting funds appropriated in  this bill from being used to penalize financial institutions from  providing financial services to an entity that participates in a  business or organized activity involving cannabis that is legal on the  State level.   With 33 States and the District of Columbia legalizing some form of  cannabis use, it is past time for Congress to ensure that the Federal  Government can't infringe on what State and local jurisdictions are  doing on cannabis reform. Whether you agree or not, States and local  jurisdictions have passed some form of legalization or medical  marijuana, so let's leave the States to their own business on this  issue.   I thank Chairman Quigley, also, for including $30 million for  community financial development institutions, which is an increase of  $50 million over fiscal year 2019 enacted levels. CDFIs are really a  lifeline across the country, especially underbanked communities, which  many of us represent.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support this bill.    Mr. Chair, I rise as the designee of the  gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee), and I have an amendment at  the desk.    Mr. Chair, I am grateful for the opportunity  to speak in support of the Jackson Lee amendment to Rules Committee  Print 116-20 which makes appropriations for fiscal year 2020, H.R.  3351, the Financial Services and General Government Appropriations Act,  2020.   I wish to commend Chairwoman Waters and Ranking Member McHenry for  their work in shepherding this legislation to the floor.   Mr. Chair, the Jackson Lee amendment is simple but provides an  important and necessary protection for grieving parents. The Jackson  Lee amendment ensures that the IRS Tax Advocate Service has adequate  resources to assist parents of a deceased child whose Social Security  number was stolen by tax cheats and used on a Federal tax return to  receive an Earned Income Tax Credit.   The Jackson Lee amendment is intended to be a compassionate use of  IRS funds to help grieving parents navigate the process of reclaiming  their child's identity from tax cheats. This amendment is necessary  when we consider the story of little Alexis Agin who was just 4 years  old when she died of a brain tumor in 2011.                                time  1630    Her parents grieved. Someone stole Alexis' identity to commit tax  fraud. Alexis' parents did not discover the crime until they filed  their taxes.   The sad fact is, Alexis' parents are not alone. They were one of at  least 14 other parents whose children died of cancer and learned that  their child's Social Security number had been stolen by tax thieves.   Nearly all of us understand the importance of safeguarding our Social  Security numbers, but, after someone dies, Social Security numbers are  published on a national online registry called the Master Death List.  The Master Death List registry exists to alert businesses and financial  institutions to not renew credit cards or create new credit in the  deceased person's name, but it also alerts thieves of opportunities to  steal identities and commit tax fraud.   As reported by the San Francisco Chronicle, identity thieves have  stolen the tax refunds of more than 490,000 dead persons since 2008.  The thieves typically claim that a dead person is their dependent when  they file their tax returns.   In fiscal year 2012, the IRS initiated approximately 900 identity  theft-related criminal investigations, triple the number of  investigations initiated in 2011. Direct investigative time applied to  identity theft-related investigations increased by 129 percent over the  same period.   On July 30, 2013, in St. Louis, Missouri, Tania Henderson was  convicted of theft of government funds and aggravated identity theft,  sentenced to 144 months in prison, and ordered to pay $835,883 in  restitution to the U.S. Treasury. According to her plea agreement and  other court documents, Henderson stole the identities of more than 400  individuals, many of whom were deceased, and filed fraudulent tax  returns using their names and Social Security account numbers.   The theft of identities of deceased children for the purpose of  committing tax fraud is a sad fact that too many parents have to face  when they are attempting to cope with the tragedy of losing their  child. The Jackson Lee amendment will help ensure that the IRS Tax  Advocate Service has the resources needed to assist these grieving  parents with the filing of the last return where their child's name  will be listed as being a member of their household.   I urge all Members to support the Jackson Lee amendment, which would  be a compassionate, mind you, use of IRS funds.   Mr. Chairman, I ask for an ``aye'' vote, and I yield back the balance  of my time
