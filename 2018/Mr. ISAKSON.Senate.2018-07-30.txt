 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be granted  enough time to complete my remarks before the vote.    Mr. President, I come briefly but quickly and proudly to  recommend Britt Grant to this body and to the United States of America  to be the next judge from the State of Georgia to be on the circuit  court of appeals.   Britt Grant is an outstanding jurist. She became a judge on the  Georgia Supreme Court at the age of 40. She went to Stanford University  Law School, and she went to Wake Forest University as an undergraduate.  After she left Stanford University, she came to clerk for Brett  Kavanaugh, who is now nominated for the U.S. Supreme Court.   Throughout her legal career, whether it was practicing as an  attorney, whether it was serving as a judge, or whatever she did, she  was always at the top of her class, at the top of her case, or at the  top of her ability. I don't remember ever having a judge come before  this body, since I have been in Congress, from my home State of Georgia  who had more people pulling for her, more people wanting her to win,  more people who think she is the right person at the right time for the  United States of America.   So I come to the floor as the senior Senator from Georgia to tell my  colleagues this: You have the chance to invoke cloture tonight with  your vote and to vote tomorrow for the confirmation of the Honorable  Britt Grant of the Georgia Supreme Court to be on the U.S. Circuit  Court for the Eleventh Circuit of the United States of America.   I urge my colleagues to vote yes for cloture and yes for Judge Grant  tomorrow.   I yield back the remainder of my time.
