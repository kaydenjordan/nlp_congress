 Madam Speaker, the people of Washington's Eighth  District sent me to Congress to fight for their families and make  thoughtful, evidence-based decisions.   I did not come to Congress to impeach a President, but evidence is  evidence, and a balance of power is fundamental to our democracy.   On my first day in office, like everybody else here, I took an oath  to uphold the Constitution and protect our country. History will judge  this moment. Given all of the facts before us, impeachment is the only  remedy.
