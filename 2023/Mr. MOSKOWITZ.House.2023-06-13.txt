 Mr. Speaker, last week, we saw this House floor, the  people's House, taken hostage by Republican Members from Republican  Members.   We were sent home early. Bills were canceled. Committees were  canceled because they couldn't pass the rule.   Why are we back here? Why are things functioning now? What was the  one thing that brought all the Republicans together based on some of  the public reports and statements that have come out? Guns.   We need to figure out in this country how we can solve this issue.  The idea of more guns, more gun accessories, that is the issue that  brought the Republican Conference together. That was the issue that  broke the logjam of letting the people's House function again: guns  potentially in the hands of people who are mentally ill, and gun  accessories in the hands of people who are a danger to themselves or a  danger to others. They are so lost on this issue.                            ____________________
