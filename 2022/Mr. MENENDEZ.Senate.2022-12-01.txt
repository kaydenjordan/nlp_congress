 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I come to the floor today to get this  body to act in the face of one of the most heinous forms of  exploitation on the planet, which is human trafficking.   The year is almost over; the Congress is coming to a close; we are  running out of time; and the Senate still has not passed the Menendez- Risch International Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act,  which was reported out of the Foreign Relations Committee by voice vote  over 5 months ago.   Therefore, as in legislative session, I ask unanimous consent that  the Senate proceed to the immediate consideration of calendar No. 407,  S. 4171.    Mr. President, I further ask that the committee- reported substitute amendment be agreed to and the bill, as amended, be  considered read a third time.    Mr. President, I ask that the motion to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or  debate.    I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, section 36(b) of the Arms Export  Control Act requires that Congress receive prior notification of  certain proposed arms sales as defined by that statute. Upon such  notification, the Congress has 30 calendar days during which the sale  may be reviewed. The provision stipulates that, in the Senate, the  notification of proposed sales shall be sent to the chairman of the  Senate Foreign Relations Committee.   In keeping with the committee's intention to see that relevant  information is available to the full Senate, I ask unanimous consent to  have printed in the Record the notifications which have been received.  If the cover letter references a classified annex, then such annex is  available to all Senators in the office of the Foreign Relations  Committee, room SD-423.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                    Defense Security                                              Cooperation Agency,                                                     Washington, DC.

This proposed sale will support the foreign policy and       national security of the United States by improving the       security of a trusted partner, which is an important force       for political stability and economic progress in Europe. It       is vital to the U.S. national interest to assist Finland in       developing and maintaining a strong and ready self-defense       capability.        The proposed sale will improve Finland's air-to-air and       air-to-surface weapons capabilities and will positively       impact U.S. relations with countries in the Nordic region.       Finland intends to use these defense articles and services       for its fighter aircraft fleet. Finland will have no       difficulty absorbing this equipment into its armed forces.        The proposed sale of this equipment and support will not       alter the basic military balance in the region.
