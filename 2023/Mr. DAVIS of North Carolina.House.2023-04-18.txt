 Mr. Speaker, I rise to discuss a topic  important to the people of North Carolina's First Congressional  District: addressing access to healthcare.   April is Medicaid Awareness Month, and I was honored to kick it off  with my fellow State Medicaid Expansion Caucus co-chairs and Protect  Our Care.   North Carolina has passed critical legislation that Governor Roy  Cooper has signed into law, creating a pathway to expanding Medicaid in  our State, showing the significance and power of bipartisanship.   Mr. Speaker, nearly 100,000 eastern North Carolinians would have  access to healthcare that would come as a result. There would be a  creation of roughly 3,000 jobs in one of the most economically  distressed parts of the State while saving our rural hospitals.   Mr. Speaker, nearly 2 million Americans remain trapped in a coverage  gap. Medicaid Awareness Month is the perfect time to make a bipartisan  appeal.  [[Page H1790]]  Let us work together to close that gap so that the greater good of  Americans will benefit.                            ____________________
