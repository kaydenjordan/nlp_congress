 Mr. Speaker, in December 1636, the first militia  regiments in North America were organized in Massachusetts and  recognized by Massachusetts Bay Colony's General Court. This date marks  the founding of State militias that collectively make up the National  Guard.   The men and women of the National Guard make great sacrifices to  protect our homeland and citizens from harm. Their duties encompass  more than just mitigating violence and civil unrest or being mobilized  overseas.   For example, just this year, in my home State of California, two  National Guard aircrews flew repeatedly into the raging Creek fire in  southern California to rescue nearly trapped campers, hikers, and  residents. Their heroic efforts saved nearly 400 lives.   This bravery is not uncommon to National Guardsmen, and for 384 years  they have always been, and always will be, there for us.

Christians believe the Bible is the divine and inherent Word of God.  I believe that. And we hear a lot of things in this society today that  would try to denigrate that, denigrate the faith, and, indeed, there is  nothing wrong with what the Bible says as a guidance for life.                                time  1830    The Ten Commandments: there is nothing wrong with living by those  even if you don't believe in the Bible.   It is indeed, we know, the best seller, the most quoted, a treasure  for all of us to go by.   So as I contemplate here what we are doing tonight, I just want to  leave you with this as a guidance for working in this town, in Proverbs  4:23-27:         Watch over your heart with all diligence, for from it flow       the springs of life.        Rid yourself of a deceitful mouth and keep devious speech       far from you.        Let your eyes look directly ahead and let your gaze be       fixed straight in front of you.        Keep straight paths of your feet, and all your ways will be       established.        Do not turn to the right or to the left; turn your foot       from evil.    Indeed, if we could do more of that around here, we would be much  better off.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding to me.
