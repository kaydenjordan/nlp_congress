 Mr. Speaker, people in my home State of Hawaii and all  across the country are in desperate need of serious healthcare reform  to bring down costs and increase access to quality care.   The legislation before us, though, is not the answer. It perpetuates  the problems. It is a handout to insurance and pharmaceutical companies  that literally pulls the rug out from those who are most needy and most  vulnerable in our communities.   While corporations rake in over $600 billion in tax breaks, many low- income Americans will see their coverage drop completely.   Medicaid, a program that one in five Americans depend on for basic  care, would be slashed by hundreds of billions of dollars, shifting  costs to already-strained State and local governments.   Our kupuna, our seniors, could see their premiums increase up to five  times more than young, healthy people under these new age rating rules  in this bill.   Simply put, we need a healthcare system that puts people before  profits. I urge my colleagues strongly to vote ``no'' against this  legislation.   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the CBO score for  the underlying bill and the first four manager's amendments. We just  got it last night, and it is already out-of-date given the fifth  manager's amendment that was just submitted late last night.                                                      U.S. Congress,                                     Congressional Budget Office,                                     Washington, DC, March 23, 2017.      Hon. Paul Ryan,      Speaker of the House, House of Representatives, Washington,           DC.        Dear Mr. Speaker: At your request, the Congressional Budget       Office and the staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT)       have prepared an estimate of the direct spending and revenue       effects of H.R. 1628, the American Health Care Act, as posted       on the website of the House Committee on Rules on March 22,       2017, incorporating manager's amendments 4, 5, 24, and 25.        As a result of those amendments, this estimate shows       smaller savings over the next 10 years than the estimate that       CBO issued on March 13 for the reconciliation recommendations       of the House Committee on Ways and Means and the House       Committee on Energy and Commerce. The estimated effects on       health insurance coverage and on premiums for health       insurance are similar to those estimated for the committees'       recommendations.                        Effects on the Federal Budget         CBO and JCT estimate that enacting H.R. 1628, with the       proposed amendments, would reduce federal deficits by $150       billion over the 2017-2026 period; that reduction is the net       result of a $1,150 billion reduction in direct spending,       partly offset by a reduction of $999 billion in revenues (see       Tables 1 and 2). The provisions dealing with health insurance       coverage would reduce deficits, on net, by $883 billion (see       Table 3); the noncoverage provisions would increase deficits       by $733 billion, mostly by reducing revenues.        Pay-as-you-go procedures apply because enacting the       legislation would affect direct spending and revenues. CBO       and JCT estimate that enacting the legislation would not       increase net direct spending or on-budget deficits in any of       the four consecutive 10-year periods beginning in 2027.                     Effects on Health Insurance Coverage         CBO and JCT estimate that, in 2018, 14 million more people       would be uninsured under the legislation than under current       law. The increase in the number of uninsured people relative       to the number under current law would reach 21 million in       2020 and 24 million in 2026 (see Table 4). In 2026, an       estimated 52 million people under age 65 would be uninsured,       compared with 28 million who would lack insurance that year       under current law.                             Effects on Premiums         H.R. 1628, with the proposed amendments, would tend to       increase average premiums in the nongroup market before 2020       and lower average premiums thereafter, relative to       projections under current law. In 2018 and 2019, according to       CBO and JCT's estimates, average premiums for single       policyholders in the nongroup market would be 15 percent to       20 percent higher under the legislation than under current       law. By 2026, average premiums for single policyholders in       the nongroup market would be roughly 10 percent lower than       under current law.                    Uncertainty Surrounding the Estimates         The ways in which federal agencies, states, insurers,       employers, individuals, doctors, hospitals, and other       affected parties would respond to the changes made by the       legislation are all difficult to predict, so the estimates in       this report are uncertain. But CBO and JCT have endeavored to       develop estimates that are in the middle of the distribution       of potential outcomes.                    Comparison With the Previous Estimate         On March, 13, 2017, CBO and JCT estimated that enacting the       reconciliation recommendations of the House Committee on Ways       and Means and the House Committee on Energy and Commerce       (which were combined into H.R. 1628) would yield a net       reduction in federal deficits of $337 billion over the 2017-      2026 period. CBO estimates that enacting H.R. 1628, with the       proposed amendments, would save $186 billion less over that       period. That reduction in savings stems primarily from       changes to H.R. 1628 that modify provisions affecting the       Internal Revenue Code and the Medicaid program.        Over the 2017-2026 period, modifications to provisions       affecting the Internal Revenue Code that are not directly       related to the law's insurance coverage provisions would       reduce JCT's estimate of revenues by $137 billion. Reducing       the threshold for determining the medical care deduction on       individuals' income tax returns from 7.5 percent of income to       5.8 percent would reduce revenues by about $90 billion. Other       changes include adjusting the effective dates and making       other modifications to the provisions that repeal or delay       many of the changes in the Affordable Care Act, which would       reduce revenues by $48 billion.        A number of changes to the Medicaid program would reduce       CBO's estimate of savings by $41 billion over the 2017-2026       period. The reduction would result from revising the formula       for calculating the per capita allotments in Medicaid to       allow for faster growth of the per capita cost of aged,       blind, and disabled enrollees. The effects of changing that       formula would be offset somewhat by the effects of three       other provisions that would increase savings: reducing the       per capita allotment in Medicaid for the state of New York in       proportion to any financing the state receives from county       governments; providing states the option to make eligibility       for Medicaid conditional on satisfying work requirements for       enrollees who are not single parents of children under age 6       or who are not pregnant or disabled; and allowing states to       receive a block grant for Medicaid coverage of children and       some adults instead of funding based on a per capita cap.        Other smaller changes resulting from the manager's       amendments would reduce savings by an estimated $8 billion       over the period.        Compared with the previous version of the legislation, H.R.       1628, with the proposed amendments, would have similar       effects on health insurance coverage: Estimates differ by no       more than half a million people in any category in any year       over the next decade. (Some differences may appear larger       because of rounding.) For example, the decline in Medicaid       coverage after 2020 would be smaller than in the previous       estimate, mainly because of states' responses to the faster       growth in the per capita allotments for aged, blind, and       disabled enrollees--but other changes in Medicaid would       offset some of those effects.        The legislation's impact on health insurance premiums would       be approximately the same as estimated for the previous       version.        If you wish further details on this estimate, we will be       pleased to provide them.            Sincerely,                                                        Keith Hall,                                                          Director.    Mr. McGOVERN. This analysis confirms that the Republicans will give a  trillion-dollar tax break to the wealthiest people in this country, and  they will kick 24 million Americans off their health insurance.   I will say that is why we are packed with speakers on this side, and  there is probably only a couple of people on the gentleman's side,  because we are standing with the American people who are outraged by  this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr.  Cicilline).
