 Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in favor of H.R. 1617, and I am proud to  cosponsor this bill with my friend, Mr. Krishnamoorthi.   The Keeping Russian Entrapments Minimal and Limiting Intelligence  Networks Act, also known as the KREMLIN Act, is a commonsense bill that  directs the intelligence community to conduct an assessment on the  leadership of the Russian Government's plans and intentions, as my  friend Raja has said, especially in regards to NATO.   Madam Speaker, with some questioning Washington's commitment to the  transatlantic alliance, this bill also serves as a reminder to our  allies of the U.S. Congress' commitment to NATO.                                time  1315    NATO is indispensable. As a former military officer, I know firsthand  how true that is. It is also as important today as it has ever been.  Understanding the threats that the Kremlin continues to challenge to  this important alliance is of utmost importance.   In particular, the bill seeks assessments in three areas:   First, any potential military action against NATO members;   Second, potential reaction to the expansion of NATO; and,   Third, potential weaknesses and areas of division against NATO  allies.   Learning the Russian Government's intentions in these areas will  better enable the United States Government to counter any attempts to  undermine this critical alliance that we call NATO.   I thank the Speaker, urge passage of H.R. 1617, and reserve the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, once again, very briefly, this is a  commonsense piece of legislation. It is a bipartisan piece of  legislation. Importantly, it improves our national security. It  improves the ability of our intelligence agencies to do the critical  work that they do.   I urge my colleagues to vote in favor, and I yield back the balance  of my time.
