 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Lee Center  Fire Chief Kenny Baker, who passed away recently after a long-fought  battle due to complications of a brain tumor.   Ken was known by all as a noble, caring, and loving man. He joined  the Lee Center Volunteer Fire Department at the age of 30 and served  for 48 years straight. For 28 of those years, Ken was the chief, the  longest tenure in the department's history.   Ken also served in the U.S. Navy and was the former president of the  Oneida County Fire Chiefs Association.   But most importantly, Ken was known for his tremendous family and his  love for his family, particularly his wife, Patti, who was his guiding  light. His son, Joseph Baker, succeeded him as the fire chief, and  Ken's granddaughter, Ashley, and grandson, Tyler, followed their  grandfather into the fire service with the Lee Center Fire Department.   I considered Ken a great friend. He was a courageous, principled, and  tenacious man. He was a hometown hero and a role model for many,  including me. And, boy, was he fun.   Ken, I just want to say thank you to you for your friendship and your  profound legacy of service to our community. May you rest in peace.   God bless his family.                            ____________________
