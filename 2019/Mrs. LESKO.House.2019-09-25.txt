 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Scanlon for yielding me the  customary 30 minutes.   Mr. Speaker, the bills we consider today highlight how far the  priorities of my colleagues across the aisle have diverged from the  priorities of the American people.   We consider two bills purportedly related to border security but  which do nothing to solve the humanitarian crisis at our border and,  like the rest of their previous so-called solutions, make the problem  even worse.   Instead of addressing the issues that impact American citizens and  legal residents, the Democrats continue to cave to radical, leftwing  activists, cater to illegal immigrants over U.S. citizens and legal  residents, and malign the President for his attempts to secure or  border.   Then, late yesterday afternoon, a mere 1 hour and 45 minutes before  the Rules Committee met, my Democratic colleagues added another item to  the schedule for this rule to further their witch hunt against  President Trump.   The Democrats ran on kitchen table issues like healthcare, but it is  becoming increasingly clear that their obsession with attacking this  President and prioritizing illegal immigrants over U.S. citizens has  impeded their ability to address the needs of our country.   The first bill, H.R. 2203, expands the government by creating another  Federal bureaucrat, an ombudsman, to investigate complaints against  Customs and Border Protection and Immigration and Customs Enforcement,  our law enforcement on the border.   This is a special ombudsman just for illegal immigrants to file  complaints against law enforcement, even though there are current  avenues to file complaints. It requires that bureaucrat to establish  even more bureaucrats in each U.S. Border Patrol sector. On top of  those bureaucrats, it creates even more to sit on a border oversight  panel. The icing on the cake: The legislation gives the ombudsman no  real authority to resolve any issues.   This bill does nothing to address the root causes of the current  humanitarian crisis on the southern border. In fact, I have introduced  six bills to get to the root of the problem. None of them have been  heard in the Judiciary Committee, but, instead, their bill is made up  of policy provisions that cater to illegal immigrants and undermine our  law enforcement at the border, thus, weakening our national security.   Put simply, my Democratic colleagues' answer to our border crisis is  to create a taxpayer-funded complaint  [[Page H7916]]  box for illegal immigrants, and it gives no power to the ombudsman.   The second bill, H.R. 3525, throws even more taxpayer money at  programs that will do nothing for the border security Americans demand.  It even jeopardizes our national security by requiring the Department  of Homeland Security to reprogram funding used for combating terrorist  and criminal organizations and for responding to manmade and national  disasters to an IT system to track illegal immigrant health records.   The bill states that this new electronic health records program has  to be completed in a record 90 days. Once again, my Democratic  colleagues are prioritizing illegal immigrants over U.S. citizens. Our  own veterans don't even have a system like this.   In fact, we in Congress have been trying to get an electronic health  record system in the VA for years, and we found that it would cost  multimillions of dollars. Yet there is no funding in this bill for this  electronic program, so we would have to divert money from our national  security priorities.   This bill does divert money from protecting American citizens to  enhancing the experience for illegal immigrants.   I have been to a border facility in Eloy, Arizona, a detention  center, and I have also been to an HHS facility in Virginia that houses  unaccompanied minors. I saw that both facilities were clean and the  occupants were treated well. I even ate with detainees, sat at the  table with them at the Eloy Detention Center, and the food was good.   Prioritizing where DHS should allocate its limited resources, my  firsthand experience leads me to believe that hurricane response and  thwarting terrorists are of greater concern than prioritizing illegal  immigrants.   Finally, the resolution, H. Res. 576, is an inappropriate rush to  judgment without gathering all of the facts.   First of all, the President released the call transcript text with  the President of Ukraine today. I read it. To me, it is a big nothing  burger, and, in fact, it demonstrates--I am glad the President released  it because it demonstrates how the media and some of my Democratic  colleagues were totally false in their allegations.   One of the accusations was that eight times the President talked  about this Biden issue with the Ukrainian President. That is totally  untrue.   Second, the Director of National Intelligence is testifying before  the House Intelligence Committee tomorrow, on Thursday, and Chairman  Schiff has already announced efforts to have a closed-door meeting with  the whistleblower this week.   Third, these things should occur before the House rushes into this  type of resolution. I understand, and we are told on the floor today by  my colleagues, that Democrats intend to amend the rule to match the  Senate-passed resolution on this matter, and I am glad. They are  removing the disparaging language against the President and other  people in his administration that was in the House version that we saw  last night in the Rules Committee.    In fact, as the Speaker knows, I brought this up last night in  committee, and we could have done this last night. However, I am still  concerned that this resolution, as amended, is still premature.   Even if the two border bills pass the Senate--and they won't--they  would not help our constituents.   Mr. Speaker, I urge opposition to the rule, and I reserve the balance  of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, if we defeat the previous question, I will offer an  amendment to the rule to allow for immediate consideration of S. 820,  the Debbie Smith Act of 2019, which reauthorizes funding to process the  rape kit backlogs.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately  prior to the vote on the previous question.    Mr. Speaker, this program was reauthorized with broad  bipartisan support in both 2008 and 2014. The Senate passed the Debbie  Smith Act by unanimous consent in May, over 4 months ago; yet the House  has yet to take up this important bill meant to end the rape kit  backlog, even though it expires in just 5 days.   As a survivor of domestic violence and co-chair of the bipartisan  Congressional Caucus for Women's Issues, I am deeply disturbed by  reports that some are using this program as leverage to get the Senate  to pass other things that have nothing to do with DNA testing of rape  kits.                                time  1245    My amendment makes the vote on the previous question simple. Vote  ``no'' if you believe survivors of rape and sexual assault deserve to  be one step closer to justice. Vote ``no'' so we can immediately  consider the Debbie Smith Act. Vote ``no'' on the previous question if  you stand with survivors of rape and sexual assault.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from North Dakota  (Mr. Armstrong), who is my good friend.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Reschenthaler), who is my friend.    I have three speakers at least, Mr. Speaker.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. Cline), who is my good friend.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from the  great State of Texas (Mr. Gohmert), who is my good friend.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Wisconsin (Mr. Grothman), my good friend.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, before my closing statements, I want to put on the  Record that the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Raskin) had said earlier  that, in Rules Committee last night, Republicans gushed over the Senate  resolution, and that is actually not accurate.   What we did is, after Mr. Schiff made some disparaging remarks about  House Republicans, if they didn't vote for the House resolution like  the Senate Republicans did, that we didn't care about the issue, then I  merely pointed out the differences between the Senate version and the  House version, and so that is how that came about.   Mr. Speaker, in closing, I will just summarize the bills before us  today:   One, creates government bureaucrats with no real authority;   Two, diverts money meant to protect Americans from terrorism, gangs,  and natural disasters;   Three, continues the obsession by my Democratic colleagues to bash  the President and others and is a political tool.   The Democrats ran on kitchen table issues. Instead, week after week,  they prioritized the demands of the radical leftwing activists over the  needs of the American people.   Mr. Speaker, I urge ``no'' on the previous question, ``no'' on the  underlying measure, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
