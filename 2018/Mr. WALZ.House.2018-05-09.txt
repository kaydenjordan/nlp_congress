 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and thank the thousands  of foreign national employees who work for United States Embassies  overseas supporting our Foreign Service and promoting democratic ideals  throughout the world.   Many Americans may not know exactly what the Foreign Service does  both at home and abroad, but I can assure you that our diplomats are  out every day promoting the interests of the United States, our  constituents, our businesses, and our values.   Last August, I invited Ambassador Barbara Stephenson, president of  the American Foreign Service Association, to Minnesota Farm Fest, a  trade and policy forum that brings together about 40,000 people out on  the rich soils near Redwood Falls, Minnesota. Her message was simple  yet important: the work our Foreign Service officers do throughout the  globe has a direct and substantial impact on the citizens of this great  Nation--in that case, promoting export markets and food safety  throughout the world so that the world's greatest producers of food and  fuel and fiber are able to find those markets and able to grow our  economies.   But what often goes unnoticed are the thousands of foreign national  employees who work at U.S. Embassies in support of our diplomats as  they build and strengthen democratic institutions, create and sustain  markets for American products, and promote democracy in some of the  most hostile, austere environments in the world.                                time  1030    These dedicated professionals are called LESes among the Foreign  Service, Locally Engaged Staff. And that is exactly what they are. They  are engaged locally in a way that is simply not possible, even for the  most expert of American diplomats. They are that engaged because they  are from the country they work in. And it is this understanding that  only people native to a country can have, which makes them critical to  the success of our diplomats and America's mission overseas.   I would like to tell you about one such unsung hero of the State  Department's mission in Havana, Cuba. Olexis Lugo was born in Havana,  Cuba, in 1966, and worked for the U.S. Interests Section, and later,  the U.S. Embassy in Havana for more than a decade. Lugo, as he was  known to diplomat colleagues, was a driver in the embassy's motor pool  and supported countless missions with U.S. diplomats.   More than a driver, Lugo aided diplomats in understanding the nuances  of Cuban culture, and provided critical insight that helped our  diplomats do their jobs effectively. And more than that, Lugo was a  friend and confidant to all of the U.S. diplomats posted in Havana, and  a friend to America.   This past year, Lugo suddenly passed away in Havana, but his legacy  will live on in the American lives he touched and the ideals of  democracy and freedom that he helped support. I hope when it comes time  to talk about our Foreign Affairs budget, we will remember our  diplomats and the folks from foreign countries, like Lugo, who are  working hard for the American people to keep this world safe for  democracy.                            ____________________
