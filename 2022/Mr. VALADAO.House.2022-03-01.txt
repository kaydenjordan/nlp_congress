 Mr. Speaker, last week, the Bureau of Reclamation  announced that farmers in the Central Valley would receive none of the  water contracted through the Federally managed Central Valley Project.   The lack of any allocation at all is alarming news to the communities  that have continued to suffer from issues like the ongoing supply chain  crisis. Once again, Central Valley farmers are being asked to do more  with less.   My constituents are the farmers who feed the world, and they are  resilient. But the fact remains that our farms will not survive without  a reliable water supply for south-of-Delta agriculture.   Meanwhile, the House majority refuses to consider my bill, the RENEW  WIIN Act, which would immediately bring water to these fields and save  these farms.   These water allocations must reflect the needs of the agriculture  community which is the backbone of the Central Valley economy.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to take up my legislation to  address California's drought.                            ____________________
