Mr. President, I want to say a few words about the  Federal Bureau of Investigation, the FBI--our Nation's premier law  enforcement agency--and to speak about the men and women who  distinguish it.   First, I want to refer to an opinion piece in the New York Times that  talks about the former Director of the FBI, James Comey. As the article  is entitled, ``The Tragedy of James Comey,'' the story has both  positive things to say about Mr. Comey--well deserved--but also some  criticism, which I would suggest is also well deserved. Perhaps all of  us exhibit both positive and negative attributes. All of us make  mistakes, and I don't mean to pick on Mr. Comey unnecessarily, but it  sort of lays the foundation for what I want to say.   In the April 8, 2018, New York Times article, the first line is,  ``James Comey is about to be ubiquitous.'' In other words, he is going  to be everywhere with his book, published next week. Of course, he will  be on an ``epic publicity tour, including interviews with Stephen  Colbert, David Remnick, Rachel Maddow, Mike Allen, George  Stephanopoulos, and `The View.''' So he will be everywhere.   Of course, we expect him to tell his story from his perspective. As a  preface for what I want to say about the rank-and-file men and women in  the FBI, let me just read a couple of paragraphs.   The writer says:         [Director Comey] was the F.B.I. director overseeing the       investigation into Hillary Clinton's private email server. He       and his team decided that she had not done anything that       warranted criminal charges. And [Director Comey] knew that       Republicans would blast him as a coward who was trying to       curry favor with the likely future president.        So he decided to go public with his explanation for not       charging Clinton and to criticize her harshly. He then       doubled down, releasing a public update on the investigation       11 days before the election, even as other Justice officials       urged him not to. Department policy dictates that       investigators aren't supposed to talk publicly about why they       are not bringing charges. They especially don't do so when       they could affect [the outcome of] an election.    That, as people will recall, is one of the primary reasons why Rod  Rosenstein, the current Deputy Attorney General of the United States,  recommended to the President that he dismiss Mr. Comey--for violating  Department of Justice guidelines when it comes to talking about an  investigation, which should remain confidential, particularly when  there is a decision not to charge the person being investigated, and  usurping the role of the prosecutor, recognizing that the role of the  FBI as a primary investigator is very different. When it comes to the  charging decision, that is left to the Department of Justice, not to  the FBI.   But, as the article goes on to say:         Comey, however, decided that he knew better than everyone       else. He was the righteous Jim Comey, after all. He was going       to speak truth to power. He was also, not incidentally, going       to protect his own fearless image. He developed a series of       rationales, suggesting that he really had no choice. They       remain unpersuasive. When doing the right thing meant staying       quiet and taking some lumps, Comey chose not to.    As I said, the article has a lot of complimentary material and also  some criticism, and I think it is a fair piece. I mention that because  so much of what we have heard about the FBI and the Department of  Justice recently has been caught up in the emotions and the drama here  in Washington, DC, and while appropriate criticism and investigation of  past actions at the Department of Justice should take place--former  Attorney General Loretta Lynch and why she made the decision not to  demand that Director Comey let the Department of Justice make the  ultimate charging decision--there is a lot of room for criticism, and I  suggest there will be additional information that will be forthcoming  and should be produced to Congress as part of our oversight  responsibilities. But I think the big mistake Mr. Comey made is  assuming that he was a law unto himself and that the rules applied to  everybody else but not to him and, as the article says, that he knew  better than anyone else.   But all of that I want to contrast with what I experienced recently,  back home in Austin where my wife and I live.   I was there during and after the series of five bombings that  detonated in packages across the city, killing two people and wounding  others. People were very much on edge. It reminds me of the sniper that  was on the loose here in Washington, DC, for a while, and people were  terrorized--not willing to go and put gasoline in their cars. There was  a similar sort of effect with what happened with the bombings in Texas  and in Austin.  [[Page S2091]]    While the suspect was still at large, I spoke to Austin police chief  Brian Manley, and he told me how thankful he was for the army of  Federal agents, including FBI agents, who had supported the  investigation. He told me that as many as 500 Federal agents, including  from the FBI and other agencies, were on the ground while the suspect  was on the loose. I am sure it was the agents' methodical investigative  work, combined with the work of their State and local partners, that  was the big reason why the alleged bomber didn't wreak even more havoc  in the Texas capital.   It is important to remember that the FBI's role during the Austin  bombings is important to acknowledge in our current political climate,  when the Bureau has come under criticism and become the target of so  much drama and politics. Of course, that was mainly about the past and  certainly not about the new leadership that has been installed at the  FBI under the leadership of FBI Director Christopher Wray.   Of course, the debate started during the tenure of Loretta Lynch and  Eric Holder at the Department of Justice, but it continued through  Director Comey's investigation, as I said, of Hillary Clinton, and it  has not gotten any better. But it is important to distinguish between  the rank-and-file professionals at the FBI and people who made mistakes  and overstepped their bounds and, unfortunately, gave the rest of the  organization--tainted their name.   So I want to take a moment to do what Director Wray has done in the  past, and that is to reintroduce people to the FBI. The American public  needs to be reminded of what the FBI actually does and how pivotal that  work is and how long it has been doing it. The FBI has been in  existence since 1908, and I think ``relentless'' is the best way to  describe it.   The Bureau's investigations have helped solve crimes like cold- blooded murder, which happened in my home State in 1983. Just last  year, the FBI added the suspect to its Ten Most Wanted list, and  shortly thereafter the man turned himself in to FBI agents. It took  more than three decades, but the FBI pursued all leads until, finally,  it got its man.   That is just one example of what happens every day at the FBI. Under  the effective leadership of Director Wray, the agency has remained  committed to doing things independently and by the book--which I think  is perhaps the most important characteristic--for as long as it takes  to close the cases.   It is absolutely critical that law enforcement agencies do things by  the book and follow the rules and the law. We have seen criticism  directed toward Director Comey and former Attorneys General Loretta  Lynch and Eric Holder because they did not appear to do things by the  book but appeared to be unduly swayed by other considerations and,  indeed, broke the rules in the book, so to speak.   Sometimes the fierce independence and tightlipped process by which  the FBI is supposed to operate can irk people. We are people with a  need for immediate gratification who want to know the answer right now  when, in fact, often law enforcement investigators have to do  painstaking, time-consuming work, indeed, over years and decades.   Critics say that investigations are taking too long or shouldn't be  going on at all. But that is how the agency is supposed to operate--on  its own, according to the standardized legal process, step by  painstaking step. As Director Wray has said in the past, the FBI's  means need to justify its ends, not the other way around. No rock  should go unturned in an investigation because that is how crimes are  solved and innocent people are exonerated.   For the rank-and-file men and women who work at the FBI, I think it  is important for us to send a clear and emphatic message here in the  U.S. Senate: We appreciate everything you do to protect the public  safety and secure the public trust.   I want to particularly acknowledge the service of the special agent  in charge of the FBI San Antonio Division, Christopher Combs, as well  as the other men and women under his command. These agents have  recently been working some pretty long days and nights, as we can  imagine, supporting our local law enforcement during the Austin  bombings and the tragic shooting at Sutherland Springs last fall.   These days, it is important that our appreciation for the Bureau not  get drowned out by the criticism, with people somehow mistakenly  assuming that because a few people have misbehaved, it somehow reflects  on the organization as a whole. It is important that we let the men and  women of the FBI know we stand behind their detail-oriented approach to  enforcing and upholding the law, that we support the FBI's doing the  right thing in the right way, pursuing the facts and the evidence  independently and objectively, wherever they lead.   More than 37,000 men and women work at the FBI. That is a staggering  number of diligent individuals, all of whom play some role in  investigating crimes, executing search warrants, conducting interviews,  and carrying out counterintelligence investigations across our country.   Today, the FBI helps track down fugitives, terrorists, kidnappers,  bank robbers, and more. It publishes its top Ten Most Wanted list, as I  alluded to earlier, and tracks down thousands of other leads at the  same time. It investigates terrorism, cybercrime, civil rights  violations, public corruption, elder fraud, and even weapons of mass  destruction.   The FBI provides crisis intervention teams--including mental health  professionals and even chaplains--after mass casualty events.   It recently launched Operation Disarray, part of a broader Department  of Justice initiative to disrupt the sale of opioids online. One  special agent said the point of this new initiative `` `is to put drug  traffickers on notice: Law enforcement is watching when people buy and  sell drugs online. For those who think the Darknet provides anonymity,'  [the special agent] explained, `you are mistaken.' ''   To that FBI agent, I say: Amen, sir. Nice work.   As his example shows, the very nature of crime itself is changing  with advances in technology, and the FBI is busy innovating and  adapting to the changed circumstances and ever-enterprising criminals.   Recently, the FBI helped us indict online sex traffickers who used  websites like backpage.com to coerce children into sexual servitude.  The FBI also provided critical information that led to the thwarting of  a terrorist plot to blow up part of the subway system in Manhattan.   Let's not forget these countless examples as we continue to sort out  issues related to Russian interference in our last election and what  happened during the Hillary Clinton email server debacle. Let's leave  politics to those who work in that realm and allow the men and women of  the FBI to do their work. Let's not forget that in 1935, when the FBI  adopted the official seal, the FBI was synonymous not only with the  agency's name but with three traits--fidelity, bravery, and integrity-- which appear on the seal to this day and describe what truly motivates  the overwhelming majority of FBI personnel.    So I wanted to come to the floor to say thank you to the men and  women at the FBI for all they do in protecting this country and  pursuing justice. We are indebted to them and stand behind them in this  unending quest.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.
