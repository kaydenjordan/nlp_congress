 Madam Speaker, I rise to stand in solidarity with the  people of Ukraine in the face of unprovoked Russian invasion.   Vladimir Putin's war has sent millions of Ukrainians fleeing, and he  is now targeting civilian populations, schools, and hospitals.   Economic sanctions have begun to cripple their economy. Private- sector companies have also isolated Russia from many aspects of the  21st century economy. But unfortunately, all economic leverage has not  been utilized. We must do more.   I do not support sending American troops into this conflict. However,  America can demonstrate leadership by cutting off our purchases of  Russian oil. But just like on many other aspects of this crisis,  President Biden is playing catch-up. He has yet to take the commonsense  step of stopping American financing of Russia's oil economy.   Now more than ever, we should be massively increasing domestic oil  production. But President Biden is more focused on pandering to his  far-left environmental base than making America energy independent from  an enemy.   We must stop financing Russia's war on Ukraine. President Biden must  act.                            ____________________
