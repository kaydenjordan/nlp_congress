 Madam Speaker, I rise today to address the House on the  importance of bipartisan engagement on infrastructure.   Yesterday afternoon, I had the privilege of sitting in the Oval  Office with President Biden as we, along with a small group of Senators  and Representatives, discussed the best way possible to move forward on  infrastructure.   Our commitment is clear: Republicans agree that we should put more  resources and key investments into the things that we consider the  traditional definition of infrastructure. This includes our roads and  highways, bridges, ports, and waterways. In order to maintain our  competitiveness in the world, strategic investments in things like  public transportation and improved air and rail mobility are also key.   We also need to continue fostering American entrepreneurship and  private investment in the area of automotive technology with numerous  auto companies making great gains in automotive vehicles running on  clean, safe, sustainable energy sources, as well as creating an  economic environment where they can continue to build out their own  electric charging station networks.    Republicans also understand the importance of the technology side of  infrastructure, such as the need to expand rural broadband, fortify our  cybersecurity to protect critical assets from foreign adversaries, and  improving our telecommunication networks across the country. These are  all key areas where Republicans and Democrats can come together and  work on infrastructure solutions in a broad, bipartisan way.   As it was made clear to the President, unfortunately, the current  proposal floating around goes well beyond that scope and includes  funding for projects that are not infrastructure. As much as some of  our Members on the other side of the aisle want to speak it into truth,  the expansion of social welfare programs is not infrastructure.   If my colleagues want to engage in a rigorous debate over the merits  of expanding Medicaid and providing elder care, or whatever else they  want to put into this infrastructure proposal, they ought to bring  separate bills onto the floor. I am sure my colleagues on this side of  the aisle will be happy to engage in that debate.   What we cannot allow is for these provisions to be snuck into a big  spending package under the guise of infrastructure.   I do have a small glimmer of hope that there is a bipartisan avenue  for moving an infrastructure package. In order to get it done, it is  going to take compromise between both sides. President Biden and my  colleagues on the other side of the aisle must engage in earnest  negotiations with Republicans. Let's put all of our cards on the table  and bring forward targeted legislation that actually supports American  infrastructure.                            ____________________
