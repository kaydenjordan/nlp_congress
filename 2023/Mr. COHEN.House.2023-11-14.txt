 Mr. Speaker, I just watched the 47-minute film provided by  the Israeli Government for our Members to watch the horrors of Hamas  and what they did on October 7. Everyone who saw that should never  forget it and should give notice to the world of the barbarity and the  horrific attack on the Israeli people.  [[Page H5735]]    The House has much to do. We need to keep this government open. We  need to support Israel in defending their citizens and in their efforts  to protect their democracy and their nation. We need to protect  Ukraine, as well.   Ukraine and Israel are two democratic friends of ours. They have been  savagely attacked. They need our help, and we need to help them with  arms and weapons.   Act now.   Never forget.                            ____________________
