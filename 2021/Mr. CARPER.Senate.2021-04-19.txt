 Mr. President, I want to share with my colleagues some  information regarding the Reconnecting Communities Act, a bill that I  have introduced today along with my colleagues Mr. Van Hollen, Mr.  Cardin, Mrs. Gillibrand, Mr. Padilla, Mr. Warnock, Mr. Schumer and Mr.  Coons. This legislation would address the legacy of highway  construction built through communities, especially through low-income  communities and communities of color, which divided neighborhoods and  erected barriers to mobility and opportunity. This legislation  implements a central piece of President Biden's American Jobs Plan,  which calls for new Federal funding to address the need to remove  infrastructure barriers in communities that have been historically  disadvantaged and disconnected.   The construction of our interstate highway system throughout the 20th  Century had many positive aspects. It facilitated commerce and travel  from coast to coast and connected our urban, suburban and rural areas.  However, the construction of highways through established neighborhoods  and cities also had a detrimental impact on the people who called those  places home.   Blocks of homes were torn down and vibrant commercial streets razed  to make way for new highway construction, often without any input from  the people who actually lived, worked, and owned businesses there. Many  of these neighborhoods never fully recovered, and the highways divided  cities, making it difficult to get from one side to the other. This  stifled economic development and opportunity for those who were left  behind.   In the 1950s and 60s, the construction of I-95 through Wilmington,  Delaware resulted in the demolition of homes, churches, and businesses,  and cut off neighbors from each other. The ability to easily walk to  the store or to church, or to have a sense of community that living in  a vibrant city brings, was destroyed for many people who lived near  that path of the interstate. And this is not unique to Wilmington. From  Baltimore to New Orleans, cities across the country are grappling with  what to do with aging interstates blighting their neighborhoods.   The Reconnecting Communities Act is designed to address this legacy  of our highway system by funding projects that would remove or  reimagine infrastructure barriers, including elevated highway  overpasses and highways that were built below grade. The bill would  authorize $15 billion over the next five years to establish a new  federal grant program at the Department of Transportation to help  States and local entities with planning, construction and local  capacity building. Specifically, it would do the following:   First, the bill would provide grants to local and Tribal governments,  Metropolitan Planning Organizations and non-profits, to help foster a  greater capacity for local communities to participate in the planning  and decision-making process for transportation and economic development  projects. This would help to ensure that new projects meet local needs.   Second, it would provide grants for planning and feasibility studies,  including studies to look at the effect of a project on traffic and  congestion, accessibility and equity.   Third, it would provide grants to carry out construction projects  that would either remove a highway infrastructure barrier, or re- envision or retrofit the existing structure to improve mobility across  it. This includes capping a highway like I-95 in Wilmington. or  transforming a highway into an at-grade roadway as has been envisioned  in other States.   As communities across the Nation are beginning to reimagine their  downtowns to provide more sustainable and equitable access, this bill  will support local efforts to reconnect and revitalize areas that were  harmed by the construction of the Interstate Highway System.   I would like to thank my colleagues who have joined me by  cosponsoring the Reconnecting Communities Act. In particular, I am  appreciative of the leadership of the junior senator from Maryland, Mr.  Van Hollen, who helped to bring this issue to the attention of the  Environment and Public Works Committee last Congress.   I hope that all of my colleagues will join us to advance this  important legislation, which I will be working to include in our  comprehensive surface transportation reauthorization bill this year.                                  ______                                         By Mr. THUNE (for himself, Mr. Crapo, and Mr. Cornyn):   S. 1206. A bill to limit the authority of the Secretary of Labor to  modify the pandemic unemployment assistance program, and for other  purposes; to the Committee on Finance.
