Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I  yield the customary 30 minutes to the gentlewoman from New Mexico (Ms.  Leger Fernandez), pending which I yield myself such time as I may  consume. During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is  for the purpose of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this rule and in support of the  underlying legislation.   House Resolution 891 provides for consideration of three measures:  H.R. 5283, H.R. 5961, and S.J. Res. 32.   The rule provides for consideration of H.R. 5283, the Protecting our  Communities from Failure to Secure the Border Act of 2023 under a  structured rule, with 1 hour of debate equally divided and controlled  by the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on Natural  Resources or their respective designees, and provides one motion to  recommit.   The rule makes in order two amendments.   Further, the rule provides for consideration of H.R. 5961, the No  Funds for Iranian Terrorism Act under a structured rule, with 1 hour of  debate equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority  member of the Committee on Foreign Affairs or their respective  designees, and provides one motion to recommit.   The rule makes in order 12 amendments.   Finally, the rule provides for consideration of S.J. Res. 32, a  resolution of Congressional disapproval related to a rule by the  Consumer Financial Protection Bureau on small business lending under a  closed rule, with 1 hour of debate equally divided and controlled by  the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on Financial  Services or their respective designees, and provides one motion to  recommit.   Mr. Speaker, since President Joe Biden took office, there have been  7.8 million illegal immigrant encounters, 1.7 million known got-aways,  and hundreds of individuals on the terrorist watch list have been  stopped at our southern border.   Instead of fixing this issue, the Biden administration and far-left  radical Democrats have placed illegal immigrants in our public schools,  in our airports, our police stations, and now our Federal lands.   In New York City, the Biden administration and far-left New York  Democrats are housing hundreds of illegal immigrants on National Park  Service land.   H.R. 5283 revokes New York City's lease and prevents all national  parks and Federal lands from becoming tent cities.   Additionally, H.R. 5861 blocks President Biden's $6 billion ransom  gift to the Iranian regime.   As an Iraq war veteran, I have seen firsthand Iran's death and  destruction in the Middle East. They are responsible for the deaths of  hundreds, if not thousands, of Americans in the Middle East.   Since Hamas' attack on October 7 against our number one ally, Israel,  Iranian-backed proxies have attacked U.S. forces over 70 times in Iraq  and Syria.   This is unthinkable. What is more unthinkable is that on the 22nd  anniversary of 9/11, the Biden administration announced $6 billion in  sanctions relief from the number one sponsor of terrorism, Iran.   These billions in sanctions relief will undoubtedly lead to more  terrorist attacks, more attacks on Americans, and more attacks on  innocent Israelis. That is why House Republicans will take action to  freeze the funding that the Biden administration wants to send to the  Ayatollah.   Lastly, the underlying legislation we will consider this week will  address the Biden administration's CFPB guidance that places burdensome  regulations on lenders and small business.  [[Page H5947]]    This new CFPB regulation will result in more compliance costs, it  will create privacy concerns for small businesses, and adds to the  bureaucratic regulatory environment that hinders hardworking Americans.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this rule, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, we are about to witness a real-time fact check here. My  colleague from New Mexico is talking about the amount of closed rules.  I would remind my friends across the aisle that in the 117th Congress-- and that is when they were deciding which rules were going to be run-- 58 of their rules out of 89 were closed rules; that is approximately 61  percent. Spare me the lecture on closed rules.   We also have one bill coming to the floor that has 12 separate  amendments. It is kind of rich hearing that criticism. What is even  richer is the criticism that we, as Republicans, have done nothing  about the border. Absolutely laughable.  [[Page H5948]]    As the Biden administration and far-left radical Democrats have  ignored the southern border crisis, we passed H.R. 2 twice. Twice we  passed it. I would invite any Democrat that actually wants to do  something about the southern border to just vote for this underlying  legislation that we are running.    Again, House Republicans have passed the Secure the Border Act of  2023. I will remind my friends across the aisle that act restarts  construction of the border wall. It deploys advanced technology to the  southern border. It increases Border Patrol agents and their pay. It  strengthens and protects those provisions for unaccompanied minor  children. It protects them from human trafficking, and it ends the  disastrous policy of catch and release. It ends the catch and release  policies of the far-left Democrats.   We have passed the FY24 Homeland Security Act as well that provides-- wait for it--over $2 billion for the border wall. It provides almost a  half million dollars for 22,000 Border Patrol agents and billions in  funding to remove dangerous criminals who have entered the United  States interior illegally.   Now, this week, House Republicans will block the Biden administration  and far-left radical Democrats from turning our Federal lands into the  illegal immigrant housing that the Biden administration and far-left  Democrats in our cities have turned them into.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to my good friend, the gentlewoman  from Texas (Ms. Van Duyne).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   It is time for another real-time fact check, Mr. Speaker. Homeland FY  2024 increased funding for border agents, $496 million for 22,000 new  Border Patrol agents. That is the highest ever funded.   It is rich when I hear my colleagues from across the aisle talk about  bills that are named one thing and do another. This is from a party  that hung their entire term on the Inflation Reduction Act, which  neither reduced inflation nor helped the economy. They later said that  it was about preventing global warming. Again, it is rich coming from a  party that often misnames their key legislation.   Let's talk about sanctuary cities because there is one thing that we  can do. We can end sanctuary city policies. For years, Democrats have  criticized House Republicans and President Trump for wanting to secure  our border and protect our communities. They criticize us when we say  that. When the crisis comes to their own backyard instead of a small  rural town on the southern border, when it comes to their sanctuary  cities, Democrats are the first ones to declare an emergency.   Look at Martha's Vineyard. When Ron DeSantis sent a few illegal  immigrants to Martha's Vineyard, it took those woke yuppies less than  12 hours to call the National Guard to remove the illegal immigrants. I  am willing to bet there were more ``Hate has no home here'' signs in  the pristine, well-manicured yards at Martha's Vineyard  [[Page H5949]]  than actual illegal immigrants, but they still called the National  Guard to remove those immigrants from Martha's Vineyard.   Don't just take my word for it. Take New York City Mayor Eric Adams'.  Over 110,000 migrants have reached New York City. Mayor Adams decried:  ``The national government has turned its back on New York City.''   When illegal migrants showed up in Massachusetts, Governor Maura  Healey declared a state of emergency and said the quiet part out loud:  ``Massachusetts has stepped up to address what sadly has been a Federal  crisis of inaction that is many years in the making.''    One thing is clear. Even Democrats now, in their sanctuary cities,  are realizing that Biden has created this border crisis.   Democrats have ignored it for years. Republicans, thankfully, are  finally stepping up and leading where they failed.   Any of my friends from across the aisle who want to help us, if they  want to end this crisis, can vote for the rule today and vote for the  underlying legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr.  Langworthy), my good friend.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I don't know if my colleague from Pennsylvania was  talking about the party as in 2003 or 2023 because the last time I  checked, the Republicans are the party that supports the guys that  shower after work not before.   The Chamber of Commerce has picked its side. It is with the  Democrats. The billionaires that my friend from Pittsburgh was talking  about--check how they are registered to vote. I am pretty sure--and I  am willing to bet--that they all registered as Democrats, and far-left,  extreme Democrats, by the way. All the Big Tech CEOs, Apple and Amazon,  you name it, they are all far-left Democrats.   So this nostalgia for the day when Republicans supported big business  and Democrats supported the little guy, it is just that, it is  nostalgia. It is 2023, and we need to realize the new political  realities.   When we are talking about numbers, I noticed that my friend from  Pennsylvania didn't talk about the numbers relating to the destruction  of Hamas during the over 3 minutes she had to address the Chamber.  Let's talk about those numbers.   Hamas has killed over 1,500 Israelis since October 7, 2023. They have  killed over 1,500 Israelis. They have injured over 6,900. Over 230  hostages were taken by Hamas in the Gaza Strip. Over 9,500 rockets have  been fired from Gaza toward Israel. There were 32 Americans killed and  several Americans are still missing.   While we are throwing out numbers, let's not forget to talk about the  destruction Hamas has brought.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, here is another real-time fact-check for you. Obama  under ObamaCare took $700 billion from Medicare. You tell me who is  trying to protect Medicare and Medicaid. It certainly wasn't the Obama  administration when they were taking billions of dollars from the fund.   It is amazing the amount of time that my colleagues across the aisle  talk about working families. Have they actually talked to working  families?   When I am in my district talking to working families, not the woke  yuppies  [[Page H5952]]  that my friends across the aisle represent, but actually working  Americans, they are talking about inflation. Let's look at the numbers.   When President Biden took office, President Trump had inflation where  it was just 1.4 percent. Since then, prices have risen by 17 percent.  By the way, real wages are going down, hurting working families and  working Americans.   Prices have risen 17 percent and real wages are down. Credit card,  auto loan, and consumer loan delinquencies are at the highest levels  since the Great Recession. Just this morning, CBS News--the  conservative news bash--reported that Americans need an extra $11,400  today just to afford the basics when compared to when President Trump  was in office.   You tell me who is looking out for the working American. Something  tells me it is not extreme, far-left Democrats that are looking out for  their woke, affluent suburbs. All the while, the President has been  misleading the American people.   Last week, our 81-year-old leader claimed Thanksgiving dinner was the  fourth cheapest ever on record. Of course, that was false. Maybe it is  his age showing, I don't know, but the truth is that it was the second  most expensive Thanksgiving dinner ever.   If you want to talk about an all-time high, last year's inflation  under the President's watch is an all-time high. It is clear,  Bidenomics is broken economics. Democrats do not care about working  Americans. Republicans do.   Let's talk about some more Bidenomics statistics. With the economy  adding just 1,500 jobs in October, coming in below expectations, this  is the second worst jobs report of the Biden Presidency.   The unemployment rate rose to 3.9 percent in October where the labor  force participation rate actually declined. The average middle-class  household has lost over $33,000 in real wealth in just this past year.  That hurts people that are driving to work, driving to construction  sites, and driving to work shifts at diners. It is not hurting the  woke, yuppie base that the Democrats represent sitting at home on Zoom  all day, having their EVs charging in their garage.   The average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage is now at the highest  level since 2000. This is bringing a disastrous effect to the housing  market. Homeownership has been deemed unaffordable in 99 percent of the  country. There are 73 percent of Americans that believe the economy is  in bad shape, and more voters trust Republicans over Democrats to  handle inflation, according to a recent AP-NORC poll.   Mr. Speaker, 58 percent of the Americans believe the economy is  getting worse, and 69 percent believe the country is on the wrong  track, according to an Economist/YouGov poll. That is not exactly a  far-right polling outfit.    Half of Americans say their financial situation is worsening,  according to a recent Harvard CAPS/Harris Poll. Biden's approval rating  on the economy is at just 32 percent, the lowest of his Presidency,  according to CNBC's All-American Economic Survey.   It is very clear that the American people know that Biden and far- left Democrats are hurting not only their job prospects, not only their  ability to afford a home, but the entire economy and their ability just  to afford the basics.   Mr. Speaker, I question any time a Democrat tells me they are  watching out for the working American.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, it is time for another real-time fact check. By the way,  let's not conflate interest rates with inflation. They are two totally  separate things.   Let's talk about inflation. My friend from New Mexico said that  inflation started during COVID. We know that when President Trump left  office, inflation was at 1.4 percent. In June 2022, when Biden was in  office, it was 9.1 percent. That is almost a record high. Yes,  inflation is slightly less than it was, coming down from the all-time  high.   Nevertheless, Mr. Speaker, facts don't care about your feelings, and  they don't care about your political persuasion. Try arguing the  difference between 9.1 percent inflation and 1.4 percent inflation.  Good luck with that.   We all know who is to blame: Biden and far-left, radical Democrats.   Also, to talk about how great the economy is and unemployment, the  unemployment rate actually rose in October to 3.9 percent while the  labor force participation rate declined. It is actually worse than 3.9  percent if you are reading into that statistic, Mr. Speaker.   Again, this is quite amazing. Not only has President Biden totally  botched the economy and Bidenomics, but he has repeatedly botched  foreign affairs. Obama's own Defense Secretary, Robert Gates, once said  that Joe Biden has managed to get every single foreign policy decision  wrong in his entire career.   One of the big mistakes that Biden made, when we talk about foreign  affairs, was when he decided to delist the Houthis as a terrorist  organization. Here is a quick history lesson. In 2021, due to pressure  from the Iranian regime, and for whatever reason the Biden  administration is fixated on appeasing the Iranian regime, the Iranian  regime was putting pressure on the Biden administration to delist the  Houthis as a foreign terrorist organization. For those who don't know,  the Houthis are an Iranian-backed proxy group that wreaks havoc across  the Middle East.   In recent weeks, the Houthis have carried out drone and missile  attacks against Israel. They have attacked and seized commercial  vessels in the Red Sea. They have fired rockets at the U.S. Navy,  including the USS Mason, the USS Thomas Hudner, and the USS Kearny.   It is past time for the Biden administration to get tough with Iran  and designate the Houthis as the foreign terrorist organization that  they are.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time, and I am prepared to  close.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my  time.   Mr. Speaker, I can't believe that, once again, I am here on the House  floor explaining to my friends across the aisle that there is a  difference between interest rates and inflation. They are two separate  things. They shouldn't be conflated. I am shocked that I have to  explain this to Members who are elected to Congress. It is quite  amazing.   It is very clear, the difference between inflation and interest  rates.   There is another thing that is very clear that Democrats don't seem  to understand, and that is that President Biden's foreign policy agenda  benefits our foreign adversaries and not the American people. From the  failed withdrawal from Afghanistan to the $6 billion in sanctions  relief to Iran, to the draining of our Strategic Petroleum Reserve and  also the fast-tracking of Putin's Nord Stream 2 project, it has been  disastrous.   Mr. Speaker, look at the invasion of Ukraine, a terrorist safe haven  in Afghanistan, an emboldened China, and a destabilized Middle East.  This legislation before us will protect our servicemembers in the  Middle East. It will place additional pressure on the Iranian regime.   Additionally, we have another Biden-fueled disaster right here at  home at our southern border. The White House now wants to exacerbate  this crisis further by placing tent cities on Federal lands.   In Pennsylvania, our Commonwealth is home to several national parks,  including the Flight 93 National Memorial, Fort Necessity National  Battlefield, and Friendship Hill National Historic Site, all of which  are in my congressional district. These are places for Americans and  their families, not camps for those who broke our laws and are here  illegally.   The underlying legislation will protect our national parks from the  Biden administration's and the Democrats' radical, far-left immigration  policies.   Finally, the Biden administration's attempt to burden our local  lenders with extra costs would do irreparable harm to our Nation's 33  million small businesses. During a time when Bidenomics is failing the  American people, it is critical we support efforts to make the American  Dream more achievable, not insert partisan politics into small business  lending. That is why the House will nullify this far-left, radical  rulemaking by the Biden administration and Democrats.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on the previous  question and ``yes'' on the rule.   The material previously referred to by Ms. Leger Fernandez is as  follows:     An Amendment to H. Res. 891 Offered by Ms. Leger Fernandez of New                                   Mexico         At the end of the resolution, add the following:        Sec. 4. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution, the       House shall proceed to the consideration in the House of the       resolution (H. Res. 178) affirming the House of       Representatives' commitment to protect and strengthen Social       Security and Medicare. The resolution shall be considered as       read. The previous question shall be considered as ordered on       the resolution and preamble to adoption without intervening       motion or demand for division of the question except one hour       of debate equally divided and controlled by the chair and       ranking minority member of the Committee on Ways and Means or       their respective designees.        Sec. 5. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H. Res. 178.     Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time,  and I move the previous question on the resolution.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
