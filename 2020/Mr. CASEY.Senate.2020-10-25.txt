 Mr. President, I rise to speak about the nomination of  Judge Amy Coney Barrett to be an Associate Justice on the U.S. Supreme  Court. That has been the subject of, I know, a number of floor remarks  tonight and this morning.   We know that in terms of the history of the nomination at this time  before an election, no person has ever been confirmed this close--just  days away from a Presidential election--and no election, of course, has  had so many votes cast this early. Fifty-nine million is the last  number I saw a couple of hours ago. And this is all happening--this  rushed confirmation process--while people are voting, all while  Republicans here in the Senate are ramming a nomination through and not  voting on a COVID-19 relief bill, which should be the subject of our  work at this time, in my judgment, because of the nature of the  pandemic, the threat that it still poses, and the relief that is needed  all across the country.   But as much as we focus, in this Supreme Court Justice nomination  debate, on this judge from the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals,  ultimately, it is really, in the end, not about her nomination; in the  end, it is about real people's lives, especially as to how the Supreme  Court will impact those lives, those families, when it comes to the  Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. That will be the focus of  my remarks this morning.   This is a debate about people, and I will talk about a few people  from Pennsylvania in my time here on the floor, people like Erin  Gabriel, who is from Beaver County, PA, right on the Ohio border, way  out in the western part of our State. It is about Erin and her 11-year- old daughter Abby, as well as Shannon Striner. Shannon is from  Pittsburgh, just a little south of where Erin is from.   I will be talking about Shannon and her 4-year-old daughter, but I  will start with Erin Gabriel's daughter Abby. I will use this  photograph to tell everyone who Abby is. Abby is this child in the  middle. She is in this picture with her brother and sister.  [[Page S6511]]    Here is what Erin Gabriel said about her daughter. She said:         My youngest daughter Abby just celebrated her 11th birthday       last Saturday.    This is just in the month of October, this month.         That was something that was never promised to us. Abby is       growing up in her community with her family and friends.       Normally, she enjoys shopping, going to the movies, Disney on       Ice. She travels. She swims at a local lake, and she snuggles       with her dog at home, and she rides all the rides at       Idlewild--    Which is a local amusement park--         Abby is autistic, deaf, blind, nonverbal, and has a rare       progressive neurological syndrome affecting multiple organ       systems, with a long list of life-threatening symptoms that       we are all still trying to learn more about.        Medically, Abby has to go through a lot. She sees multiple       specialists in Pittsburgh, Cleveland, and Boston. She is       undergoing blood work to monitor her anemia and to watch for       signs of leukemia. She has regular EEGs and MRIs to monitor       the progress of her seizures. She uses hearing aids and       glasses and a wheelchair and a speech-generating device. She       relies on protections for people with preexisting conditions,       and she relies on the ban on lifetime caps to access this       care. Without the Affordable Care Act, Abby would be       uninsurable.    Then Erin goes on to talk about the benefit of living in Pennsylvania  because of some extra protections that Abby has. Then she continues:         Because she receives this care, Abby is right now healthy,       happy, and thriving. As you might expect, Abby is considered       very high risk should she contract COVID-19. Abby has not       been inside any building that is not our home or a hospital       since March 10 of this year. Summer vacations, play dates,       outings, travel plans to visit grandparents--they have all       been canceled. This fall, we pulled Abby out of her school--a       place that had become community to her over the last 8       years--to homeschool her.        She, like many children with disabilities, simply cannot       access a virtual education, and it is not safe to send her       back into a school building while this virus is spreading.       But Abby misses her school and her friends.        Normally, ongoing speech, occupational, and physical       therapy help Abby to keep the progress she has made learning       to walk, to eat, swallow, and to communicate. But with COVID-      19, they have all come to a halt.        It is just not safe, and it has also provided us a window       into what her world looks like without access to these       therapies.    So that is just part of Abby's story, as told to us by her mom. As I  made reference to in the statement of her mom, Erin wrote that Abby  would be ``uninsurable'' without the ACA.   I have to ask: Are we really going to say, again, that children like  Abby are uninsurable? Are we going to allow that to happen in America?  Is that the intent of this whole exercise, the exercise that has played  out over years now--years--of repeal efforts?   All of them so far have failed, so the second strategy was to run  cases up through the judicial system, to get to the Supreme Court, and  then, ultimately, to stack the Court with rightwing justices who could  then strike down the Affordable Care Act. That is what we are heading  toward right now.   Is that America? Is that the America we want--where we advance  healthcare to make sure families like Erin's and her daughter Abby have  all the protection, all the coverage that she needs--after all the  progress that has been made, instead of coming together and saying that  we are going to make improvements to our healthcare system but we are  going to grow the number of people who are covered and we are going to  ensure that any child like Abby has the protections that she needs,  that her family should have a right to expect in the United States of  America, the most powerful, the wealthiest country in the history of  the world?   Erin went on to say that, because she receives this care, the care  she is getting now--largely because of the Affordable Care Act, not to  mention Medicaid: ``Largely because she receives this care, Abby is  healthy, happy, and thriving.''   So I have to ask: What does justice demand here? St. Augustine said  hundreds of years ago: ``Without justice, what are kingdoms but great  bands of robbers.''   So any government--certainly our government--that makes it possible  for a child to have those protections, those programs, those services,  the therapies--and I could go on--and then takes an action that could  result--and if this law is struck down by the Supreme Court will  result--in those benefits and protections either to have been taken  away or to be threatened or undermined or compromised or limited--any  government which does that is robbing that family of justice.   I mentioned earlier that Shannon's daughter Sienna is another example  of what we are talking about here. Here is what Shannon says about  Sienna, her 4-year-old daughter with Down syndrome. She says:         Sienna is a remarkable little girl that loves life. She is       a smiley, energetic, empathetic ray of sunshine. Her favorite       activity is spending time with her big sister, whom she       adores. If we let her, she would watch Sesame Street all day.       Elmo is a way of life in our house. She loves music, books,       therapy, and playing outside. She is mischievous, funny, and       beautiful. She has the ability to bring smiles to our family       on the worst of days. We wouldn't change one thing about her.        Sienna happens to have an extra copy of her 21st       chromosome, also known as trisomy 21 or Down syndrome.       Sienna's diagnosis came as a surprise to us. After enduring       four miscarriages, she was our miracle baby. Our miracle baby       surprised us on the day of her birth with her diagnosis and a       heart condition.        We were completely unprepared to raise a child with a       disability. After I delivered her, a kind nurse explained to       me how lucky we were to have Sienna here in Pennsylvania       after passage of the Affordable Care Act.    Then she went on to talk about how Pennsylvania had some benefits in  Medicaid. And then Shannon continues:         As I entered this new world of early intervention,       therapies, and medical needs, I began to realize just how       much of a financial toll this would take on all of us if it       weren't for the protections of the ACA and Medicaid: custom       orthotics, outpatient weekly therapies, overnight hospital       stays, adaptive strollers, walkers, safety sleepers,       echocardiograms, communication devices, blood work. The list       goes on.        Sienna receives seven weekly therapies. The cost of those       alone are $3,400 per week. Without the ACA, her therapies and       medical care would have quickly exceeded the lifetime cap,       and Sienna would be uninsurable for the rest of her life and       left without access to lifesaving care.    Shannon goes on:         I am proud to be Sienna's mom. The journey is full of       wonder, joy, and unimaginable love. It changes life's most       ordinary moments into the extraordinary. But with constant       attacks on our healthcare, it is also agonizing work, hard       decisions, and constant advocacy. It gets exhausting fighting       for your child, having to prove their value to the world.    Then she goes on at the very end:         Once again, we as parents are forced to suit up for battle       and prove that our children are worthy of healthcare.    Her last line of this statement is:         Everyone loses if our children are unable to reach their       fullest potential.    So that is Shannon talking about Sienna, her daughter. She used that  same word that Erin used. Different stories, similar burdens, but she  used that same word that Erin used--``uninsurable''--uninsurable if the  Affordable Care Act is taken away.   She talks about life with the Affordable Care Act and without it.  That is what a lot of parents do when they write to us. They tell us  what their life was like before the Affordable Care Act and what their  life is like now--and what their life would return to, those dark days  when an insurance company could make a determination about a child's  insurance, their coverage, their treatment--frankly, their life   Then, toward the end, she talks about what she and other parents feel  under these constant attacks, having to prove their value, the value of  their child: We as parents are forced to suit up for battle--suit up  for battle--and prove that our children are worthy of healthcare.   I am going to ask the same question again: In America? In America,  that is what we want to do--have this constant battle? Parents have to  come here, to the U.S. Senate and to the House?   The organization that this mom is a part of is called Little  Lobbyists. This is a group for and because of the battles on  healthcare. Why the hell is this going on in America?   Why should we be fighting about progress that has been made? Why  aren't we talking about improvements, getting the cost of healthcare  down, getting the cost of prescription drugs down? Let's make  improvements.   Why do these parents have to continually battle to ensure that their  children have this kind of protection? Should mothers really have to  suit up for battle in the United States of  [[Page S6512]]  America, where the powerful get their way all the time in this place?   They are different kinds of lobbyists that come in. They are not  Little Lobbyists. They are not mothers and their sons and daughters.  They are a different kind of lobbyist. Corporations did really well in  the tax bill of 2017, a bill that was rammed through between  Thanksgiving and Christmas.   What did they get? Well, they got about a 14-point reduction in their  corporate tax rate--permanent tax relief, jacked up the debt to do it-- because they have power.   I thought that was--when you compare that action that the Senate took  at the time to what some in the Senate want to do on healthcare, to  roll back the protections, to rip away protections for these children-- and I am not even talking tonight about the adults who are impacted.  But when you compare those two actions, it is really perverse and  disgusting that the powerful get to come in here and get permanent tax  relief and get a bonanza the likes of which we haven't seen in modern  American history.   And all these parents are asking us to do is preserve what we have.  They are not asking for anything more. They are just saying: Please  make sure my child doesn't lose their coverage. Please make sure that  they have the therapies they need when they have these complex medical  needs, multiple disabilities--not one, in many cases, but multiple.  That is all they are asking us to do.   That is why it is such an important matter in the Supreme Court fight  because you have to ask: Why the rush to get this nominee through by  election day? That has never happened before this close to an election.   Well, I will tell you why. This nominee is being fast-tracked, first  of all, because this nominee has been vetted by the two groups that  matter--the Federalist Society and the Heritage Foundation--both groups  totally committed to undoing, striking down the Affordable Care Act. So  she has already passed that test, and she apparently passed with flying  colors, as she moves very quickly to a likely confirmation.   But why the fast-track to get there in a matter of days? What is  coming up? Is it election day? No. There is a date after the election;  it is November 10. That is the argument date. They know that, if she is  not on the Supreme Court, if she is not confirmed as a member of the  Court by the argument, November 10, she can't participate in the  decision.   What is the decision? The decision to strike down the Affordable Care  Act. That is what it is--the decision that really is the proxy for what  did not happen on the floor of the U.S. Senate in July of 2017. When  the repeal effort failed and when it failed multiple times in the House  over many years, this is the proxy for it. Litigate it, fund it, and  run that case right up the chain to the Supreme Court.   So that is what this is about. They want to make sure that she is on  the Court and at the argument so she can be the deciding vote on the  Affordable Care Act. That is why we are rushing.   How about another healthcare issue? How about Medicare? I mentioned  Medicaid. How about Medicare, the program that used to have bipartisan  support all across the board?   Now, Judge Barrett was asked a direct question about Medicare, and  she didn't want to give an opinion on Medicare. She was asked it in the  context of the constitutionality of Medicare. And a member of the  Judiciary Committee, Senator Feinstein, asked her because she  referenced a law review article questioning the constitutionality of  Medicare.   I think that is a loopy theory. I think that is a theory that most  Americans--probably 90 percent of Americans--don't agree with,  questioning the constitutionality of Medicare, passed more than 50  years ago. It has benefited tens and tens and tens of millions of  Americans and still today benefits numbers like that--45 million,  roughly, I think it is.   I understand why the judge doesn't want to say: Well, in this case  that is before the Court or this case that is unsettled, I might have  a--I can't give you a determination. But on Medicare couldn't she have  at least said--instead of mentioning, as she did in her answer, the law  professor's name twice who has this loopy theory on Medicare  constitutionality, couldn't she have said simply: Well, I can't tell  you how I am going to rule on a Medicare case, but I can tell you that,  just like Brown v. Board of Education is a superprecedent in a judicial  sense, I think most people would agree that Medicare is a  superprecedent in a legislative sense.   She wouldn't have violated any principle of not telling how you are  going to come down in a case. She could just tell us or relate to us  the reality that most Americans believe about Medicare.   Now, I know there has been some commentary about her law review  article that--or I should say her writings about the 2012 Supreme Court  case. We know that the case she was referring to was a 2012 case. So,  in 2017, Judge Barrett wrote an article about what Chief Justice  Roberts ruled in the case. She wrote: ``Chief Justice Roberts pushed  the Affordable Care Act beyond its plausible meaning to save the  statute.''   In light of her frequent criticism of the act, the Affordable Care  Act, Senator Leahy of Vermont asked her during her confirmation hearing  whether she had ever written or spoken in favor of the law. She has  not. So that is what she was writing in 2017.   I have to ask: If she felt so strongly about the 2012 decision by the  Court and the position of Justice Roberts, she didn't seem to write  much about it for a couple years--until 2017, when you had a new  President. And what followed a few months later was she was nominated  in the circuit court of appeals. So that is curious.   But what we know is that the President who nominated her, President  Trump, certainly wants to strike down the Affordable Care Act. In fact,  in May he said he wanted to ``terminate healthcare'' under the  Affordable Care Act.   We know the impact of that. That destruction, the act of striking  down the Affordable Care Act, would harm tens of millions of Americans.  In Pennsylvania, 5\1/2\ million people with a preexisting condition  would be affected. Over 840,000 Pennsylvanians who are enrolled in  Medicaid expansion would be, of course, adversely impacted. So that is  the reality of what we are talking about with regard to this  nomination.   I will make reference to one more family before I conclude my  remarks. It is the Kovacs family from--also from Western Pennsylvania,  Plum Borough, PA, in Allegheny County, not too far from Pittsburgh. The  Kovacs' 11-year-old son Thomas is blind and has multiple disabilities.  He has epilepsy, microencephaly, and intellectual disabilities.   His mom, Jessica, says the Affordable Care Act has made all of their  lives better: ``The ACA has made it possible for Thomas to receive  therapy services at his school, Center Elementary School in Plum  Borough.''   The ACA has given his parents the option to change jobs and advance  in their careers without fear of not being able to obtain health  coverage for him because of his preexisting conditions. And they don't  need to worry about busting through lifetime expense caps and losing  coverage for Thomas. The ACA has brought peace of mind and comfort to  their family because they know that he is protected by the essential  healthcare benefits the law provides.   Striking down the ACA isn't only about the essential health benefits.  It is about a lot more than that.   There is so much more that I could talk about tonight, so many more  examples, but I will conclude with that and just make one final  comment. When I think about what could happen and what is likely to  happen if Judge Barrett is confirmed and becomes a member of the Court,  participates in the argument on November 10, and then because of that  participation is allowed to, as a member of the Court, to rule on this  ACA case, it is highly likely that the Affordable Care Act will be  wiped out.   I have to ask about the fate of Abby and Sienna and so many other  children like them all across our Commonwealth and all across the  country. I think often in government we must ask, here in the U.S.  Senate or in the House or in the other branch of government--the  judicial branch or in any branch of government, the executive,  legislative, or judicial branches--we should all ask ourselves, Is this  action  [[Page S6513]]  I am taking or is this policy or program advancing the cause of justice  or not?   I would submit that striking down the Patient Protection and  Affordable Care Act by virtue of a Supreme Court decision is not only  the wrong policy, it is a giant step backwards in the interests of  justice. Justice demands that these children have these protections;  that these protections are not undermined, they are not compromised,  and they are not taken away by judicial fiat.   This nomination threatens the healthcare of children like Abby and  Sienna right now--right now in the United States of America, where we  advanced into the light of protection for those children. When you  consider what is at stake right now, it is that case. I think it is  potentially the most important case the Court will decide in the next  quarter century. That is the impact of it.   Very few Americans are not directly affected by this case, either  because they are affected by way of loss of coverage or they are  affected because of the scope of the protections that were brought  about by the passage of the Affordable Care Act, the enactment of it.   A lot is at stake, not to mention so many other issues and so many  other matters that will come before the Court. For that reason and  several others, I will be voting against the nomination of Judge  Barrett to be on the Supreme Court.   If I have an opportunity between now and the vote, I will outline  some other reasons why. But for purposes of tonight, this morning, I  wanted to talk about children like Abby and Sienna and their moms. The  moms, Erin and Shannon, should have the peace of mind that has come  with the protections of the Affordable Care Act.   With that, I will yield the floor.
