 Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to  defeat this previous question so that we can immediately take up Mr.  Nadler's legislation that would protect Bob Mueller's special counsel  investigation.   The rule of law right now is under attack by a wrecking-ball  President who does not respect it, who has fired his investigator and,  as we speak, seeks to hire a judge who would protect him.   But Bob Mueller, despite the attacks that I hear in this Chamber, is  making progress. His investigation started in May 2017. Since May 2017,  he has obtained a lot of guilty pleas and indictments.   October 5, 2017: a guilty plea against General Michael Flynn,  campaign adviser and national security adviser to Donald Trump;   December 1, 2017: the statement of offense from Michael Flynn  detailing what he had done;   October 5, 2017: statement of offense and guilty plea from George  Papadopoulos, senior adviser to candidate Trump;   February 2, 2018: indictment against Richard Gates, adviser to the  President;   February 23, 2018: guilty plea from Richard Gates;   February 12, 2018: guilty plea from Richard Pinedo;   February 16, 2018: guilty plea from Alex van der Zwaan;   Indictment, February 16, 2018, against 16 Russians for weaponizing  social media to help the Trump campaign, including the Internet  Research Association, directly tied to Vladimir Putin;   February 22, 2018: superseding indictment against Paul Manafort,  campaign chairman for Donald Trump and Richard Gates;   February 23, 2018: guilty plea from Richard Gates;   June 6, 2018: superseding indictment against Paul Manafort, chairman  to Donald Trump, and Konstantin Kilimnik, associated with the Russian  intelligence services;   September 14, 2018: guilty plea, campaign chairman Paul Manafort,  just about 1 month after he was found guilty on a number of counts by a  jury of his peers;   And, finally, July 13, 2018: 12 Russians indicted for the hacking and  stealing of Donald Trump's opponent's emails.    Mr. Speaker, the special counsel is  making progress. The best thing we can do to uphold the rule of law in  this country, to allow him to continue to investigate who attacked us,  who worked with the Russians, and to make sure we know all we can do to  protect this great democracy is to protect that investigation, to not  allow the President to threaten it, and to do our job: protect our  great democracy.
