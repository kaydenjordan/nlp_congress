 DOYLE of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission  to address the House for 1 minute.)    DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, more than 500  Pennsylvanians are murdered with guns each year, causing untold  suffering and tearing our communities apart. Pennsylvanians are crying  out for commonsense legislation to stop the bloodshed, legislation like  H.R. 8, the bill before us today.   Now, nobody thinks that universal background checks would eliminate  gun violence, but the facts suggest that they would reduce it.   In 2017, the Pennsylvania State Police ran over a million background  checks on would-be gun purchasers. The vast majority of purchases were  approved within a few minutes. But 13,000 were stopped, and the  background checks led to the arrest of 150 wanted fugitives and the  arrest and conviction of 500 other individuals for illegally attempting  to obtain a firearm. Those background checks put some bad guys in jail,  and they probably saved some lives as well.   Let's help our police enforce the laws that keep guns out of  dangerous hands. Vote for the Bipartisan Background Checks Act of 2019.                            ____________________
