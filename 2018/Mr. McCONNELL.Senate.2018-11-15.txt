 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  order for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that  notwithstanding adoption of the motion to concur in the House amendment  to S. 140 with further amendment No. 4054, as modified, that amendment  No. 4054, as modified, be further modified with the changes at the  desk.    So for the information of the Senate, the modification  that occurred was necessary to fix a technical error that omitted a  number of important charts and tables from the bill.                            ____________________     Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Senate proceed to the immediate consideration of S. Con. Res. 51.    I ask unanimous consent that the concurrent resolution  be agreed to and the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid  upon the table with no intervening action or debate.    Madam President, the Senate's final order of business  this week will be to confirm Michelle Bowman, the President's choice to  serve on the Federal Reserve Board.   As I highlighted in recent days, we have before us a nominee whose  skills and background are tailor-made for the responsibilities of the  office. Ms. Bowman has extensive experience in community banking, and  the seat to be filled is intended for an expert in that very field.   My colleagues hardly need me to illustrate any further the role that  small community banks play in the lives of family farms, small  businesses, and communities all across our country. It is time to take  an important step for them and confirm this well-qualified nominee.   Yesterday, we passed legislation to reauthorize the Coast Guard by an  overwhelming bipartisan majority. The Senate took action to reaffirm  the critical security, interdiction, and rescue missions that keep  America safe and to streamline duplicative regulations at the same  time.  [[Page S7020]]    The provision to clarify the regulation of vessel incidental  discharge delivered a much needed victory for the communities and small  maritime businesses, including so many in my State of Kentucky, that  rely on America's inland waterways for their livelihood. The  reauthorization delivered some well-earned certainty to the brave men  and women of the U.S. Coast Guard, whose commitment to service should  make all of us proud.   Of course, the Coast Guard legislation was just the very latest  installment in a long list of bipartisan successes passed by this  Senate in this Congress on behalf of the American people.   The big battles may be what captivate the press, and Republicans are  certainly proud of our signature accomplishments, like historic tax  reform and confirming Justice Gorsuch and Justice Kavanaugh, but at the  same time, it is frequently overlooked how many of this Congress's  achievements have been thoroughly bipartisan.   Republicans and Democrats together passed landmark legislation that  marshaled more resources to the frontlines of communities fighting  against opioids, more specialized training and resources for first  responders, greater access to grant support for State and local  authorities, and more support for treatment, recovery, and workforce  reentry programs to heal the wounds of this devastating epidemic.   Together we reformed some of the excesses of Dodd-Frank and lightened  the load on local lenders.   Together we ended the cycle of chronic continuing resolutions for  defense funding that denied certainty to our Armed Forces and eroded  our readiness. We rebuilt a regular appropriations process. It featured  the largest year-on-year defense funding increase in 15 years and the  biggest pay raise for servicemembers in nearly a decade.   Together we made new investments to start rebuilding our Nation's  infrastructure.   Together, we brought new resources and new reforms to the systems  that serve our veterans. Together, we improved comprehensive sanctions  to target maligned behavior throughout the international system. We  passed major bills to combat sex trafficking, improve school safety,  expand opportunities for vocational and technical training, and extend  the right to try new medical treatments to those with terminal  illnesses.   This isn't even an exhaustive list. Clearly, the Senate has proved to  be fertile soil for bipartisan work. It has made life better for the  American people in tangible ways. We should all take pride in this, and  we need to keep up this momentum for the remainder of this year as we  consider more legislation and confirm more nominees. We will need it  throughout the next Congress. We will need to work across the aisle  within this body, and this Republican Senate and Democratic House will  need to learn to collaborate as well. This long list of accomplishments  offers just the blueprint we will need.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
