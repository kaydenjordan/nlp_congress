 Madam President, I have come to the floor this  afternoon to speak about a measure that I will be introducing this week  with my colleague from California, Senator Feinstein. We have entitled  this bill Bruce's Law in memory of a young Alaskan, Robert ``Bruce''  Snodgrass, who passed away in Anchorage last October.   Bruce is the son of Sandy Snodgrass. Sandy is with us here today in  the Senate Gallery.   Bruce and Sandy lived in California when Bruce was younger before  moving back to Alaska. Sandy likes to describe Alaska as Bruce's true  home.   Bruce was a good kid. He was a good kid, but, like many good kids, he  struggled with alcoholism, he struggled with drug addiction, and he and  his family were far too familiar with this, as his grandfather and his  father died of the same addictions. And despite all of this, Bruce  started using drugs as a teenager, and it really sent his life into a  downward spiral. But Sandy was always there. Mom was always there  providing a safe and a comfortable home, and yet he was arrested  repeatedly and ultimately wound up homeless.   But then, last summer--last summer, things turned around. Bruce made  the choice to get clean. He wanted to get his life on track, and Sandy  was right there, ready to help, as any good mom would be. She got Bruce  to a detox facility and then into a local inpatient program for  treatment. He graduated from it, and he moved back home. He was able to  spend his time at outpatient meetings. He was in counseling. He liked  to ride his mountain bike. He received this after he had completed the  treatment program.   But then, one day last October, Bruce went out for a bike ride, and  Sandy remembers telling him before he went, she said, ``Be careful out  there.'' But Bruce never came back. He never came home.   On October 20, Bruce's body was found in a grocery store parking lot,  and just like that--just like that--suddenly, heart-wrenchingly, and  after trying so hard to overcome his demons, he was gone--just gone  forever.   And so we grieve with Sandy, who lost her only son that day. No  parent--  [[Page S2803]]  no parent--should have to bear what she is going through.   But the details of Bruce's death are especially tragic because Bruce  died from an accidental overdose of fentanyl. Fentanyl is a synthetic  opioid that is 50 times more powerful than heroin, 100 times stronger  than morphine, and it is relatively cheap, easy to make. It makes it  attractive for drug dealers, but it is also just incredibly, incredibly  dangerous for those who come into contact with it.   Just 2 milligrams, which would fit on the end of a pencil, can cause  a fatal overdose. This is how the Justice Department describes it:         Fentanyl powder has the power to kill with the ingestion,       inhalation, or skin absorption of just two milligrams. By       comparison, a sweetener packet found on a restaurant tabletop       generally contains 1,000 milligrams per packet.    So just to give you an idea of how small a deadly amount can be, a  single pill, with just trace amounts of fentanyl, can be fatal to the  average person, which has prompted the Drug Enforcement Administration  to start a campaign that they call a ``One Pill Can Kill.'' This  campaign is designed to raise public awareness here.   Now, there is a form of fentanyl that is carefully and precisely  manufactured. It is prescribed for medical patients who may be in  extreme pain, like those who are suffering from late-stage cancer. And  doctors know--they know that they have to be exceedingly judicious with  their prescription of this pharmaceutical fentanyl. But it is this  other form--the illegal fentanyl--that is being made in underground  labs and sold on the streets.   Illegal fentanyl is often laced into counterfeit pills that are made  to look like Oxycodone or other frequently used and abused opioids. The  fake pills are difficult to distinguish from the real thing without  specialized tests because they are deliberately made to look like them.    According to law enforcement authorities, about 40 percent of those  pills--of these counterfeit pills--contain a potentially lethal amount  of fentanyl.   So you buy a pill, you think it is a frequently abused opioid that  you have taken before, but over 40 percent--about 40 percent of these  counterfeit pills can contain a potentially lethal amount of fentanyl.   Some drug traffickers are also adding fentanyl into heroin, into  meth, into cocaine; and it makes these drugs even more deadly, since  fentanyl is indistinguishable in its powder form. If you look at a  picture of heroin and fentanyl, you cannot tell the difference. But  fentanyl's presence might be the difference between life and death.   It was an official from New Hampshire who said, a couple years ago:  You don't know what you are taking. You are injecting yourself with a  loaded gun.   Now, most people would avoid fentanyl if they knew what it was  capable of doing to them, but oftentimes they don't even know. They  don't know. They have never heard of it or they don't know enough about  it or, again, they think that they are buying a name-brand prescription  pill, not some deadly knock off.   It is now fueling a nationwide crisis with terrible, terrible impacts  in every State in the country.   A few weeks ago, the Wall Street Journal reported that drug overdose  deaths likely reached more than 107,000 in America last year, an all- time high and an increase of 15 percent from just 2020. Roughly two- thirds of those deaths were attributable to synthetic opioids, led by  fentanyl, with an increase of 23 percent year over year. So we are just  seeing this skyrocket.   An official with the CDC is quoted in that Wall Street Journal story  as saying, ``We've never seen anything like this.'' ``We've never seen  anything like this.'' And he is right; we haven't. Nor are we ready to  fight it. Fentanyl is flowing into America largely from China and  Mexico, and it is coming in at an unprecedented rate--so much so that  it recently became the leading cause of death for Americans aged 18 to  45, and this was in the midst of the pandemic, when we were seeing  deaths in other areas, but it became the leading cause of death for  young Americans.   And no one--no one--has been spared by this growing epidemic. I wish  that I could say in Alaska, we are far enough away, we are remote; but,  no. I have shared Bruce's story with you, but he is not the only one.  Opioid-related deaths in Alaska, mostly from fentanyl, rose by 71  percent between 2020 and 2021. In my State of Alaska, it rose by 71  percent. It now accounts for about 60 percent of the drug overdose  deaths in Alaska.   Our law enforcement authorities routinely are intercepting packages  with fentanyl. They are finding it in Anchorage, they are finding it in  Ketchikan, in other places in the State.   In April, the Alaska High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area  Initiative--this is what we call the HIDTA initiative--had its largest- ever seizure, worth an estimated $356,000. Our Governor's office has  estimated that the 1,244 grams of fentanyl seized in January, February,  March of this year, 2022, could kill 622,000 Alaskans--622,000  Alaskans. That is about 84 percent of our State's population. Think  about that. In 3 months--in 3 months--the amount of fentanyl seized  could kill 622,000 Alaskans or about 84 percent of our State's  population. This is awful. This is a tragedy at every level.   This is also an epidemic of the young, and I am looking to the young  people on this floor because I want you to hear how frightening, how  deadly, fentanyl is. According to the Alaska Department of Health and  Human Services, drug overdose deaths rose by 25 percent among Alaskans  aged 15 to 24 last year--so, basically, your age category--and by a  staggering 200 percent in young Alaskans between the ages of 25 and 34.  It is devastating because behind those numbers are real people, like  Sandy's son, like Bruce Snodgrass, who should have celebrated his 23rd  birthday just last week. We had beautiful, beautiful weather in  Anchorage. I saw Sandy. She reminded me of Bruce's birthday. And you  look around and you think about that young man lost, gone--gone.   At least six individuals in the Mat-Su Valley who were killed by  fentanyl-laced heroin in March made news in the paper--all just in one  story. So, so many others killed, gone--gone.   In the wake of Bruce's death, Sandy has said that she was in shock  for several months, which is entirely understandable. But since then-- since then--she has decided to tell her story, share her heartache, in  hopes that other moms won't lose their sons, and so she is an advocate.  She is an advocate with every ounce of her being, and it is thanks to  her that we are introducing Bruce's law.   Bruce's Law starts with education and awareness, requiring the  Federal Government to create a nationwide campaign against fentanyl for  school-aged children, young adults, parents, first responders, and care  providers. The campaign will help illustrate the extreme dangers of  pills and street drugs that could be laced with fentanyl; help prevent  drug abuse, including through the safe disposal of prescription  medications; and help identify the early-warning signs of addiction.   Bruce's Law also authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human  Services to form an interagency working group on fentanyl contamination  of illegal drugs. This group would consist of Federal Agencies, State- level HIDTA directors, parents who have lost loved ones to fentanyl  overdose deaths, and those with lived experience and recovery. It would  consult with experts at all levels to identify strategies, resources,  and supports to address the incidence of drug overdoses with fentanyl- contaminated drugs. It will review current Federal strategies to seek  improvements to them, particularly when it comes to educating middle  and high school students about the profound danger of these drugs.   The final part of Bruce's Law authorizes new community-based  coalition enhancement grants to help educate young people about the  risks of street drugs laced with fentanyl. This would allow the Drug- Free Communities Coalitions to access new funding focused specifically  on fentanyl and to try to curb or eradicate its use.   This is a starting point. It is a starting point. And we have to  start because we have such a serious problem on our hands. We know we  have it in Anchorage, where Bruce Snodgrass likely never knew that he  was taking a drug  [[Page S2804]]  laced with fentanyl; where the officer who met Sandy after Bruce's body  was found had just come--he had just come from notifying another family  of another death caused by another overdose.   We also know that we are not alone. This is a national crisis. We  know we must do more--more to prevent fentanyl from coming across our  borders; more to prevent fentanyl-laced drugs from being sold on the  street; more to educate Americans, especially--especially--young  adults, especially youth, about its acute danger; and more to address  addiction and to provide support for recovery.   As I close, I want to thank Senator Feinstein for being the lead  Democratic sponsor of Bruce's Law, as well as Senator Sullivan and  Senator Hassan for agreeing to cosponsor it with us. I would encourage  every Member of the Senate to sign on to this legislation.   We acknowledge in Alaska this is a problem in our State, and we have  to acknowledge it in all of our 50 States. I urge others to join us in  this effort. Send us your input on how we might be able to strengthen  this legislation.   Again, I want to thank Sandy. I want to thank Sandy Snodgrass, who is  with us today. Joining her are Kim Kovol from the Office of the  Governor, as well as Mike Troster, who is the State of Alaska's HIDTA  director. Each of them--each of them--they are such important  advocates.   We recognize that it is going to take all of us doing a lot more than  we are doing now to raise awareness of fentanyl and turn back this  deadly tide, but we have to. We have to for our communities, for our  kids, and for Bruce.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that privileges  of the floor be granted to my first session summer interns for the  month of June; that is Harold Monroe, Gracelyn Gohr, Charlee Korthuis,  Dustin Lozano,  [[Page S2839]]  Calvin Ureda, Jenna Walker, and Braxton Zink.
