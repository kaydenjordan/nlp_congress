 Mr. Speaker, I rise to remind my colleagues of both  parties that the legislation before us could do irreparable harm to our  Nation's veterans.   This bill would force a 22 percent cut to nondefense spending. That  would slash $30 billion from veterans' services. That means 30 million  veterans will have fewer healthcare visits, fewer staff, an increased  claims backlog, and longer wait times for benefits. That is the  uncertainty that awaits veterans should this bill succeed.   Just last month, during a committee hearing, my Republican colleagues  assured us they didn't want to reduce benefits for veterans. I heard it  firsthand, so I was troubled to learn that this bill completely fails  to protect veterans from its cuts.   Yesterday, 24 veteran and military service organizations sent a  letter urging Congress not to pass this legislation.  [[Page H2022]]    I am dismayed that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are  prepared to force a default and devastate our economy if we don't go  along with it. Please don't do this. Don't hold our Nation's veterans  hostage.
