 Mr. Speaker, today I will introduce legislation, along  with 100 other Members, to recognize the centennial anniversary of the  Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in Arlington Cemetery.   This Sunday, October 24, 2021, marks the 100-year anniversary since  the body of one unidentified member of the Armed Forces who died during  World War I was selected as the first Unknown Soldier.   Since that date, an unidentified member of the Armed Forces from  World War II, the Korean war, and the Vietnam war have been interred  into the tomb.   This resolution recognizes the ultimate sacrifice of the unknown  soldiers interred at Arlington Cemetery and shows our gratitude and  appreciation for all the members of the Armed Forces.   Since the creation of the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, members of the  3rd U.S. Infantry Regiment, known as ``The Old Guard,'' have protected  this sacred site 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.   100 years after the burial of the Unknown Soldier from World War I,  the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier continues to be a powerful symbol of  service and sacrifice, mourning, and memory.   I am proud to introduce a resolution that pays respect to our Armed  Forces and honors the 100-year anniversary of the Tomb of the Unknown  Soldier.                            ____________________
