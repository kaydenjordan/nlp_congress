 Mr. Speaker, this week is National Police Week.  Yesterday was National Peace Officers Memorial Day, a day that we stop  and pause  [[Page H4008]]  and honor the fallen officers across this Nation who have given their  lives to protect our families and communities across this great Nation.   Some of you, last year, experienced this bravery and courage  firsthand. All of us were affected by the friends who were present when  they were in danger and our Capitol Police came to their rescue.   As some of you know, I had a 33-year law enforcement career before  coming to Congress. I lost two of my best friends. One was shot and one  was stabbed.   These are brave, courageous people, but they are not only that. They  have been blessed with the heart of a servant. They have been blessed  with that gift to put other's lives before theirs, and that is what you  saw last year, those of you on the baseball field. There was no  hesitation. They were there for you, as were my friends for the  citizens that lived in their patrol district.   Mr. Speaker, I have embraced the families, the friends, the partners,  the children, and the spouses, and there are no words in that moment  when the world is spinning out of control. There are no words when the  world comes crashing down. There are no words. There is only silence  and tears.   Mr. Speaker, this is my last year in Congress. This is my last time  that I will ask you all to join with me in a moment of silence and  tears with the families who have lost their loved ones in the line of  duty.
