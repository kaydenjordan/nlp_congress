 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   I know Mr. Obernolte is a new member of the committee; he might even  be brand new to the House. But he said he couldn't find a single thing  in this package that related to COVID?   Oh, well there is $110 billion for vaccines, for testing, which has  been pathetic under the Trump administration with no help. Oh, and  personal protective equipment, but I guess those things don't have  anything to do with COVID and the pandemic.    Now, let's get real here. The first gentleman spoke and said, We want  to help schools, and this bill doesn't help schools.   Well, actually, yesterday they tried to cut our funding for schools.  We are putting in $170 billion to reopen the schools. It is going to be  very expensive, new HVAC systems, a whole bunch of new furniture, all  sorts of stuff to get kids safely to school for this and future  pandemics, to be ready, to prepare. And they wanted to cut our 170 to  $54 billion. But they are for schools and we are not.   Oh, by the way, they didn't do anything for childcare assistance  which is a huge problem for people during this pandemic.   Now, let's talk about a few things that are in here: Cash payments  promised by President Biden and the two people who helped us flip the  Senate, they are in here.   Extended unemployment, if we don't do that--you don't want to do it-- 20 million Americans will have no income and no job on March 14;  100,000 people in my State.   Assistance for small businesses. Food, well, I think that is pretty  critical stuff on a day-to-day basis.   Rental assistance, and that is something else the Trump political  hack running OSHA wouldn't do.   We are going to have standards for protection of workers. We have had  huge outbreaks in meatpacking plants and in transportation--people have  died--and everywhere else because there are no Federal standards to  protect workers. We are taking care of that in this bill and with some  funding.   And they say this is unprecedented. You used reconciliation for $3  trillion of tax cuts for the wealthiest among us and the biggest  corporations in the world, to drill for oil in the Alaska National  Wildlife Refuges, and then you used it again to try and take away  healthcare from tens of millions of Americans and their protection for  preexisting conditions and other things. Yeah, unprecedented. Malarkey.  Let's talk about the issues and cut the BS.                                time  1345
