 Mr. President, I rise today in support of a piece of  legislation with a very long name: the Sergeant First Class Heath  Robinson Honoring Our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics Act of  2022, also known as the PACT Act--P-A-C-T, PACT Act.   This historic legislation will improve and expand access to VA  healthcare to our Nation's veterans, including upwards of 3\1/2\  million post-9/11 veterans. It is going to save lives.   Let me say that again. It is going to save lives and, hopefully, a  lot of them. It is going to better ensure that our Nation lives up to  the promise from President Lincoln's second inaugural address. You  recall, he said ``to care for those who have borne the battle''--to  care for those who have borne the battle.   During his first State of the Union earlier this year, President  Biden called on Congress to prioritize taking care of our veterans who  were exposed to burn pits and other toxic materials while serving  overseas in a number of theaters, Iraq and Afghanistan among them.   Today, I am proud to say that Congress has answered that call, as  well as the call of our Nation's veterans service organizations,  affectionately known as our VSOs. Those VSOs, veterans' advocates, and  military families, many of whom have lost their loved ones, have  organized and fought for this bill for years.   President Biden likes to say ``all politics is personal.'' He also  says that all diplomacy is personal. I think he is right on both  accounts.   This issue is personal for our President, and it is personal for me  as well as it is for hundreds of thousands of other American families.  MAJ Beau Biden, Delaware's former attorney general, served in the  Delaware National Guard for more than a decade, including a yearlong  deployment to Iraq on Active Duty.   I was privileged to have served as the commander-in-chief of the  Delaware National Guard for 8 years during my time as Governor, and I  have enormous respect for the men and women who serve today and have  served in the Delaware National Guard.   Over the past two decades, I have attended countless deployment  ceremonies in New Castle County, and Dover as well, for our soldiers,  airmen, and their families and also assemblies when we welcomed them  home, safe and sound.   Like many military parents at these sendoffs and welcome-home  ceremonies, the Bidens did not know when their son would return. They  didn't know for sure if he was going to make it back when our Nation  sent him off to Iraq. I believe it was in late 2008. And they did not  know, even if their son did make it back, whether he would carry with  him the physical and emotional wounds of war that we sometimes can  sustain.    As it turned out, Beau Biden, a young man I had known ever since he  was a little kid, appeared to make it home back to Delaware healthy and  whole at the completion of his tour in 2009.   I didn't know it at the time, but Beau and his unit spent several  months at a place called Camp Victory and Joint Base Balad in the  shadows of toxic burn pits that operated for 24 hours a day.   Several years later, in 2015, at the age of 46, Beau Biden would pass  away after battling aggressive brain cancer. We couldn't prove it then,  and to be totally honest, we can't prove it absolutely today; but the  sudden onset of terminal cancer may well have been the result of toxic  exposure while he was serving overseas.   This story is all too common amongst veterans of the post-9/11  generation, including SFC Heath Robinson, for whom this bill is named.  A member of the Ohio Army National Guard, Sergeant First Class Robinson  was deployed to Kosovo, where he experienced prolonged exposure to burn  pits.   Before I go any further, let me just take a moment to describe what a  burn pit is. Burn pits are large areas of land--oftentimes bigger than  a football field--that are used to burn a number of things including  trash and other waste products at military installations overseas. The  waste is oftentimes soaked in jet fuel and then set ablaze in open-air  burn pits, releasing toxins into the air in the surrounding area.   Waste burned in these pits includes chemicals, includes paint,  includes medical and human waste, includes metal and aluminum cans,  plastic, rubber, ammunition, just to name a few of the things. Exposure  to the smoke that resulted from these burn pits often caused  servicemembers to experience burning of their eyes or throat, as well  as difficulty in breathing, and rashes, too. The toxic smoke could be  contaminated with lead; it could be contaminated with mercury and  irritant gases that could negatively impact an individual's lungs,  liver, and stomach.   As many as 3\1/2\ million servicemembers, including Sergeant First  Class Robinson, were exposed to toxic burn pits while serving in Iraq  or Afghanistan or some other country.   After his service, Sergeant First Class Robinson was diagnosed with a  rare autoimmune disorder and stage IV--stage IV--lung cancer. His  oncologist said that the rare stage IV cancer that he had been  diagnosed with could only have been caused by prolonged toxic exposure.  And yet, for years, healthy, young veterans like Sergeant First Class  Robinson have continued to contract rare cancers and diseases. They  then come home, only to fight a new battle: a battle that involves  endless paperwork and claims, all to prove a service connection that  almost certainly did exist or does exist.   Sergeant First Class Robinson died last year. He left behind a wife,  Danielle, and a daughter who at the time was 6 years old. Her name is  Brielle.   Brielle actually wrote a note to me, not in cursive but printed, and  it looks like it was printed with a crayon. Here is what the note  essentially says: ``Vote yes to my Dad's bill''--or vote yes for my  Dad's bill.   Well, Brielle, if you are at home and watching this today, I want you  to know that I am going to take your advice, and I have taken your  advice. And I hope one day to meet you and your mom. And thank you for  being involved in a very good cause and for sharing your Dad with all  of us.   Please know that your dad's service was a gift to our country and  that the bill--the piece of legislation that bears your father's name-- is going to make a positive difference not for a few people, not for a  few military families, but literally for millions of military families.   My own generation of Vietnam veterans had a similar experience to  toxic exposures as the post 9/11-generation of veterans. I have been  privileged to serve our country in my State in many different roles,  but there is no greater privilege than serving in the U.S. Navy and  Naval Reserve for a total of 23 years after the Reserve duty.   After graduating from Ohio State right at the height of the Vietnam  war in 1968 on a Navy ROTC scholarship, I would later serve three tours  on Active Duty in Southeast Asia during the Vietnam war as a Naval  flight officer. My squadron, a unit of the Seventh Fleet, flew a wide  variety of missions, including low-level surveillance operations off  the coast of Vietnam and Cambodia, searching for, among other things,  infiltrator trawlers disguised as fishing boats attempting to resupply  the Viet Cong in their efforts to overthrow our ally, the government of  South Vietnam.   Following my time on Active Duty, I spent another 18 years as a Navy  P-3 Aircraft mission commander in the Naval Reserves. Barely a month  after flying my last P-3 mission in the summer of 1991 and retiring as  a Navy captain, I led, at the behest of then-President George Herbert  Walker Bush, I led--I was privileged to lead--a bipartisan, six-Member  congressional delegation of Vietnam veterans back to Southeast Asia.    Among our six Members was Congressman Pete Peterson, a former Air  [[Page S3000]]  Force pilot who was shot down over North Vietnam and spent years as a  POW in the ``Hanoi Hilton.'' He later would become the U.S. Ambassador  to a united Vietnam.   The six of us went to Vietnam because veterans service organizations  were convinced--because they were convinced that hundreds, maybe  thousands, of MIAs, missing in action, from the Vietnam war were being  held in captivity in that part of the world. We believed that their  families deserved to know for sure, with certainty, to have closure in  finding out what happened to their loved ones whose bodies were never  recovered.   Like many of my colleagues, I come from a military family. My family  knows what it is like to lose a loved one to war. My mother's youngest  brother, my Uncle Bob, Robert Kidd Patton, died in 1944 at the age of  19 during a kamikaze attack on his aircraft carrier in the western  Pacific.   My grandmother is a Gold Star mother. My Uncle Bob's body was never  recovered or returned home to the country he served. My family never  knew what it meant to have, really, a sense of closure or finality.  They never gave up. My grandma never gave up on him coming home  someday. He never did.   So it means something to families like mine for our government to  heed that moral obligation and stand up for military families still  waiting to see their son or daughter brought home and brought home  safely. It is that moral obligation to our MIAs and their families who  led us to travel back to Vietnam in 1991, when we brought with us--and  actually presented to the new leader of united Vietnam--we brought with  us a road map from President George Herbert Walker Bush to normalize  relations with Vietnam.   Among other things, the road map first called on the Vietnamese, who  were meticulous recordkeepers--meticulous recordkeepers--to provide  access to Vietnam's war museum records as well as to its archives so  that our investigators might be able to search for clues to help  resolve the mysteries of our MIAs' disappearance.   With the strong encouragement of our six-Member delegation and the  tireless efforts of two Members of this body, Senator John McCain and  Senator John Kerry, the Vietnamese decided to take this step, and  telecommunications were restored between our two countries--and, later,  a full diplomatic relations.   That same moral obligation that led us to make progress in Vietnam  leads us here today. Our moral obligation extends beyond providing  closure to families of the fallen. It extends to the veterans and  families who need healthcare, who are still dealing with the wounds of  war--both visible and invisible--long after they leave the battlefield.   The same year we traveled to Vietnam, Congress came together and  passed the Agent Orange Act to care for the hundreds of thousands of  Vietnam veterans who were exposed to that toxic herbicide in Southeast  Asia during the Vietnam war.   I believe that many of us would agree it took too long--far too  long--for that bill to be enacted. Finally, after too many heart and  nervous system complications, deadly cancer diagnoses, and even birth  defects in the children of Vietnam veterans, Congress did the right  thing.   The bill before us today also took too long to be enacted. Today,  Congress has once again done the right thing. As I mentioned earlier,  over the last two decades, throughout Iraq and Afghanistan, too many of  our veterans lived and worked alongside these massive toxic burn pits  that I talked about earlier.   Hundreds of thousands of square feet of open-air disposal sites where  plastics and jet fuel, chemicals and human waste, were burned daily  producing toxic black plumes and bringing harmful chemicals into the  lungs of unsuspecting servicemembers. The time has come to take care of  these veterans--those who have borne the battle.    This legislation, the PACT Act, will enhance and expand VA healthcare  and benefits for toxic-exposed veterans. Specifically, this bill will  provide VA healthcare to the estimated 3\1/2\ million post-9/11  veterans who have experienced toxic exposures.   This bill establishes a presumption of service connection for 23  conditions that are related to toxic exposures and improves the process  by which the VA may add presumptions in the future. Additionally, the  bill will expand VA research on toxic exposure. It will provide toxic  exposure screenings at appointments, and it will provide additional  training to VA healthcare workers and benefits personnel.   I have spent a considerable amount of time discussing the importance  of this bill. Others have been here today before me and earlier this  week. I am proud to have supported it. I know my colleagues feel the  same way. Having said that, I also believe that we may have missed an  opportunity to consider some amendments that would have improved the  bill and, importantly, would have paid for its considerable pricetag.   In addition to being a recovering Governor--my colleagues have  different names to describe me; a lot of them call me a recovering  Governor, and I am a recovering Governor--I am also a recovering State  treasurer of Florida. I have long believed that, if something is worth  doing, then it is worth paying for. I will say that again. If things  are worth doing, they are worth paying for. I understand that taking  care of our veterans is a cost of war, but these costs should be paid  for.   That is why I filed an amendment to have the Department of Defense  identify savings to pay for the cost of this bill.   I also filed amendments that address Albert Einstein's definition of  ``insanity.'' Einstein is famous for saying many things, but one of  those is with regard to insanity. He describes insanity as ``doing the  same thing over and over again and expecting a different result.''   What does that mean?   In this instance, it means that, if servicemembers are repeatedly  being exposed to toxic chemicals across new generations, we have to do  something on the front end to reduce toxic exposures instead of always  playing catchup decades later as we are doing now.   That is why we should be giving the Department of Defense the tools  it needs to track toxic exposures more closely. Our servicemembers  deserve the ability to report toxic exposures in realtime and to be  protected from them. I believe these commonsense ideas may actually  provide long-term savings for the taxpayer and will lead to healthier  outcomes for our veterans.   Finally, while we are not offsetting the cost of this legislation  today, it does not mean that we shouldn't provide vigorous oversight of  this new funding. That is why I filed another amendment to enhance the  requirement that the Secretary of Veterans Affairs provide annual  spending plans to Congress as well as to require both the VA inspector  general and the Government Accountability Office to report to Congress  on implementation--an important step.   My hope is that one or maybe all of these ideas could be included in  future legislation later this year, and I look forward to working with  our colleagues on improving this important bill as we move forward.   In having said that, let me close by just reiterating what I said at  the beginning. This is a historic bill for our Nation's veterans. It  does right by an entire generation of veterans who have defended our  Nation over the past two decades. It is going to bring millions of new  veterans into the VA for their healthcare, including mental health  care. These new benefits, which our veterans earned through their  service to our Nation, are going to make a real difference for our  veterans and their families.   As the last serving Vietnam veteran now serving in the U.S. Senate, I  am proud to have supported this bill.   I want to thank and commend our colleagues who lead the Senate's  Veterans' Affairs Committee--Senator Tester and Senator Moran--and  their staffs and others for working together to shepherd this  bipartisan bill through the legislative process.   I want to thank our veterans service organizations--those VSOs I  mentioned earlier--and the countless advocates who helped to make this  legislation possible.   I want to thank the young lady who wrote this note. She was kind  enough to send it to me and to encourage me to support this legislation  named after her father.  [[Page S3001]]    With that, I look forward to the President of the United States  signing the PACT Act into law very soon.   I yield the floor.
