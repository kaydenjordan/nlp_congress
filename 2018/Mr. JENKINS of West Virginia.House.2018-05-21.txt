 Thank you so much, Mr. Chairman, for  yielding.   Today, we are voting on H.R. 3663, which would rename the Huntington  VA Medical Center in honor of Corporal Hershel ``Woody'' Williams.    I first met Woody more than 20 years ago when I was elected to the  State legislature. Over the more than two decades I have known him,  Woody has never stopped fighting for his fellow veterans. I am honored  to call him a constituent and a friend.   At 94 years young, Woody is still a vocal advocate for our veterans  and their families. Whether it be at countless legislative committee  hearings, veterans recognition and appreciation events, or Veterans Day  and Memorial Day commemorations, Woody is there fighting for our  veterans.   Woody is an unbelievably brave and kind man. Not only did he  demonstrate extraordinary heroism at Iwo Jima, but he has dedicated his  life to serving veterans and our community. Each year our local Boy  Scouts--our local Scout council--gets all newly elected Eagle Scouts  together and Woody is invited to come and spend time with the boys to  share a few thoughts.   When my two sons became Eagles, Woody shook their hands. He looked  them in the eye and challenged them to conduct their life according to  the Scout oath and motto, to do their duty to God and country, which is  exactly how he has lived his life.   Throughout West Virginia and the Nation, Woody is best known for his  brave efforts in the Pacific Theater during World War II.                                time  1630    Corporal Williams was a demolition sergeant serving with the 21st  Marines, 3rd Marine Division when American troops landed on Iwo Jima.   I would like to read now from Corporal Williams' Medal of Honor  citation: ``Quick to volunteer his services when our tanks were  maneuvering vainly to open a lane for the infantry through the network  of reinforced concrete pillboxes, buried mines, and black volcanic  sands, Corporal Williams daringly went forward alone to attempt the  reduction of devastating machine gun fire from the unyielding  positions.   ``Covered only by four riflemen, he fought desperately for 4 hours  under terrific enemy small arms fire and repeatedly returned to his own  lines to prepare demolition charges and obtain serviced flamethrowers,  struggling back frequently to the rear of hostile encampments to wipe  out one position after another.   ``Corporal Williams' aggressive fighting spirit and valiant devotion  to duty throughout this fiercely contested action sustain and enhance  the highest traditions of the U.S. Naval Service.''   Woody Williams believed in something greater than himself. His  country asked, and he answered. Corporal Williams was there, in that  place, at that time, when his country needed him the most.   Following his military service, Woody continued to serve our Nation  as a veterans service representative for the Department of Veterans  Affairs. He also founded the Hershel Woody Williams Medal of Honor  Foundation to recognize the sacrifices of our Nation's Gold Star  families.   Woody is an example of the best that West Virginia and our Nation  have to offer, and he is, quite simply, an American hero. Renaming the  Huntington VA Medical Center to honor his service would be a fitting  tribute for all he has done for our veterans and their families.   Mr. Speaker, I am grateful for this opportunity.
