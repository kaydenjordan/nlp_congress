 Mr. Speaker, the impeachment hearings are continuing, in  spite of the following factors existing.   Number one, this is a very unfair process. If Democratic leadership  was truly interested in determining guilt or innocence, why not  establish bipartisan rules and procedures allowing the President due  process?  [[Page H8838]]    Number two, the leading Democratic players have maintained  predetermined presumptions of guilt for well over a year now and have  repeatedly been untruthful about contact with the whistleblower. The  whistleblower's attorney even called for a Presidential coup more than  2 years ago.   Number three, Democratic leadership does not have any facts that  constitute an impeachable offense. There has been no evidence  whatsoever of quid pro quo. There was no ``this for that.''   This inquiry is called a sham by many for these reasons.   This has also been a great opportunity lost at a high opportunity  cost to our country. Because of this politically motivated impeachment  proceeding, there has been no USMCA, no illegal immigration reform, no  lowering of prescription drug costs, no infrastructure bill, nothing  except investigations to nowhere.                            ____________________
