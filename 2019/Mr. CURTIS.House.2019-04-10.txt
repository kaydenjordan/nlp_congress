 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to introduce the Protecting  United States Businesses Abroad Act. This legislation will provide  critical protection against corruption by authorizing the President,  through the advice of Congress or the State Department, to revoke the  visas of those engaging in corruption targeting Americans doing  business in emerging markets around the world. This includes,  soliciting bribes, extorting payments or assets, manipulating law  enforcement, and more.   Many businesses, and especially small businesses, do not have the  resources to combat this type of corruption overseas. This bill will  provide a critical tool for small businesses to invest safely,  benefiting our economy and developing markets around the world.   I would like to give special thanks to Ranking Member McCaul of the  House Foreign Affairs Committee, the Salt Lake Chamber of Commerce, and  Rendeavour, a company that has been directly impacted by this type of  corruption overseas.                            ____________________
