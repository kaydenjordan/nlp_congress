 I thank Senator Wyden.   Mr. President, 53 years ago on July 30, 1965, President Lyndon B.  Johnson signed landmark legislation to establish Medicare and  Medicaid--two essential programs that provide healthcare to over 120  million Americans and over 1 million Nevadans.   When President Johnson signed this historic bill, he said:         No longer will older Americans be denied the healing       miracle of modern medicine. No longer will illness crush and       destroy the savings that they have so carefully put away over       a lifetime so that they might enjoy dignity in their later       years. No longer will young families see their own incomes,       and their own hopes, eaten away simply because they are       carrying out their deep moral obligations to their parents,       and to their uncles, and their aunts. And no longer will this       Nation refuse the hand of justice to those who have given a       lifetime of service and wisdom and labor to the progress of       this progressive country.    On that day, LBJ declared an end to an era in which healthcare was  denied to the most vulnerable members of our communities.   So I rise to celebrate the incredible progress we have made since  President Johnson created Medicare and Medicaid. We lifted hundreds of  millions of Americans out of abject poverty and provided hundreds of  millions more with dignity, security, and peace of mind. Then, in 2010,  we passed the Affordable Care Act, which was built on the foundation  that President Johnson laid, and gave 20 million additional Americans,  including hundreds of thousands of Nevadans, access to affordable  healthcare coverage.   Yet today is not just for celebration, because our work is not yet  done. Prescription drug prices, premiums, and copays are still too  high. Too many Americans can't afford the medicine they need in order  to live. Too many Americans can't find a doctor whose office is less  than a day's drive away. Too many Americans are still struggling to get  healthcare that meets their basic needs.   Instead of trying to expand access to healthcare, some of my  Republican colleagues here in Congress are working every single day to  attack the Affordable Care Act and strip healthcare coverage away from  tens of millions of Americans. Some Republican leaders are now  threatening to cut Medicare and Medicaid in order to pay for President  Trump's massive tax cut to corporations and special interest groups.  The Republican tax bill exploded our deficit by $1.5 trillion, and now  Republicans are demanding cuts to critical healthcare programs to pay  for their lavish corporate CEO giveaway. So it is not enough to  celebrate our progress.   When President Johnson signed the Social Security Amendments Act, he  landed an historic blow in the fight against poverty, injustice, and  inequality. Today, we have to rededicate ourselves to that fight.   We have to protect, strengthen, and improve the Affordable Care Act.  We have to lower the cost of prescription drugs and invest in the  health of every community. We have to create an affordable public  health insurance option that would be available to everyone in the  United States regardless of one's income level. We also have to fight  back against cuts to Medicare and Medicaid, because the fight to  protect our healthcare is a fight to protect our dignity, our security,  and our basic rights.   I yield the floor.
