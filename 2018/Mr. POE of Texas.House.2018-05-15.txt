 Mr. Speaker, for over 3,000 years, the official  capital of Israel has been Jerusalem, no matter what the Palestinians  say.   Yesterday, the United States officially moved its embassy to  Jerusalem, but the terrorist group Hamas and Iran object to Jerusalem  being designated as the capital of Israel. So do the arrogant French  and a few other European and Middle Eastern countries.   But every nation decides for themselves where their capital should  be, and wouldn't France be indignant if the world community demanded  that Versailles be the capital of France rather than Paris?   The anti-Semitic capital uproar is just another example of how these  nations do not believe Israel has the right to exist. Israel's  government is located in Jerusalem. Our new embassy recognizes that  fact.   Thanks to President Trump's bold leadership, the United States will  no longer deny Israel's self-determined right to have Jerusalem as its  political, cultural, and spiritual center of the Jewish state--whether  the rest of the world likes it or not.   And that is just the way it is.                            ____________________
