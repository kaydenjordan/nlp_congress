 Madam Speaker, with news that Damar Hamlin has finally  been released from the hospital, I am honored to join my fellow NFL  alumni, Congressman Owens, and my colleagues here today to lead a  moment recognizing Damar Hamlin's inspiring story on the floor of the  people's House.   Football has some downsides, but it also has the power to bring us  together, to remind us of what really matters. Damar's perseverance has  inspired millions and, once again, highlighted the generosity and  fundamental goodness of the American people.   Damar, congratulations on your recovery. We are all with you.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Utah (Mr. Owens).
