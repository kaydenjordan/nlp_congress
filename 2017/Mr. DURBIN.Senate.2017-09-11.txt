 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in  morning business.    Mr. President, when we finish this period of morning  business, which is open to speeches and statements on many different  topics, we will then go to the Defense authorization bill. Our process  in the Senate is to authorize spending and then to appropriate the  money for the actual spending. Occasionally, those two things are in  sync, but many times they are not. I am afraid that what we face today  is uncertainty.   Senator McCain, who is the chairman of the defense authorization  committee, will bring his proposal to the floor, but it is at a  spending level that is not allowed by current law. The Budget Control  Act will not allow Senator McCain or the Senate to spend at  [[Page S5087]]  the level at which he wants to spend. I can make a good argument that  the statutory level we are required to hold to is inadequate to our  national defense. If we are honest about taking care of the problem, we  not only have to pass this authorization bill, but we have to change  the Budget Control Act so that we can put more money into our national  defense. That debate will get started this week. It is near and dear to  Senator McCain's heart. He works hard on it each year with Senator Jack  Reed, a Democrat from Rhode Island.   There will be many amendments considered, I am sure, during the  course of this week on Defense authorization.                                     DACA    Mr. President, what I come to the floor to speak to as in morning  business is not that issue; it is the issue of DACA and the Dreamers.  It was just 6 days ago that the announcement was made by Attorney  General Jeff Sessions that he was going to rescind the DACA Program.   A quick history. Sixteen years ago, I introduced a bill called the  DREAM Act. The DREAM Act was written to take care of young people who,  by their parents, were brought to the United States as infants and  toddlers and young boys and girls and who grew up in this country. They  did not get into trouble with the law. They finished school and always  thought that they were going to be Americans and that they would use  their education and their skills to build lives in this country.  However, because their parents either came here undocumented or did not  file the appropriate papers, these young people are literally without a  country. The country they grew up in does not accept them under the  law. So 16 years ago I introduced the DREAM Act and said: Let's take  care of this problem. These young people, as it was through no fault of  their own, should be given a chance to stay in this country and be part  of its future.   I passed it in the Senate, and I have seen it passed in the House. We  have never quite been able to bring it together in any one year and  have it pass both Chambers, so it is not the law of the land. Sixteen  years ago, I introduced it, and it is still not the law of the land.   In the meantime, Senator Obama, my colleague in the Senate,  cosponsored the DREAM Act and then got a promotion. As President of the  United States, I asked him: Can you do something to protect these young  people from being deported?   He said that he would, so by Executive order, he created something  known as DACA, the DACA Program, by which young people come forward,  turn themselves in, register with the United States, pay a filing fee  to cover all of the costs of the process, and go through a criminal  background check. If they are approved and cleared, for 2 years, they  can stay in the United States without having the fear of being  deported, and they are allowed to work. Then, 2 years later, it is  renewable. Over the years President Obama had done that, 780,000 young  people signed up, went through the background check, and were approved  under DACA.   Last week, President Trump, through his Attorney General, announced  that he was going to rescind the DACA Program. So the 780,000 young  people have their futures in doubt. They do not know which way they are  going to turn. This creates serious problems, as you might imagine. The  young people who are affected by it are affected emotionally--I would  be, too--because they do not know what is going to happen next. They do  not know whether they are going to be allowed to stay in this country,  whether they will be deported from this country, or whether they will  be able to work legally. They are waiting for Congress to give the  answer, and the President says he is waiting for Congress to give the  answer.   Last Friday, I went back to Chicago, which I am honored to represent  in the Senate, and I visited Loyola University's School of Medicine. It  is known as the Stritch School of Medicine.   At the outset, let me say how proud I am to represent the city and  especially to represent Loyola University.   Here is what they did in their medical school when President Obama  created DACA. They said: We will open up competition for our medical  school to include those who are protected by DACA. We will not give  them special slots, and we will not give them a quota. They can compete  with everybody else who wants to go to our medical school.   Do you know what happened? At the end of the day, 32 of those DACA  applicants scored so high that they were accepted at Loyola's Stritch  School of Medicine. They are now in 2 or 3 different years of classes.  It is amazing. Many of them, from all over the United States, grew up  without having legal citizenship status and always dreamed of being  doctors, but it was impossible. They knew that no medical school would  accept them. And Loyola said: We will accept you, and they got their  chance--32 of them.   There is more to the story, as these young people do not qualify for  any government assistance from the Federal Government. Because they are  undocumented, they do not qualify for Pell grants, and they do not  qualify for Federal Government loans. Medical school is expensive. How  are they going to do it? They worked their way through college, paying  out of their own pockets. How are they going to pay for medical school?  Our State, the State of Illinois, under Governor Pat Quinn and renewed  under Governor Rauner, created a loan program for them from which they  could borrow money from the State. But there was a catch: For every  year they borrowed money to go to medical school at Loyola, they had to  pledge that they would give 1 year of service, of their lives, as  doctors in underserved communities in our State. They did it. Thirty- two of them signed up for it. I am very proud to say that the program  has been a terrific success in our State. They are just extraordinary,  along with the other students at the medical school.   They are special people. They come from all over the world, and they  are all in this similar predicament, but until last week, they were  protected by DACA. What happens when you take away the DACA Executive  order, which President Trump said he will do over the next 6 months?  There is a special challenge here. After they finish 4 years of medical  school, these students apply for residencies, whereby they pursue their  specialties, whatever they might be. A residency is work experience for  all of these medical students. Through some university, they will be  working as residents at hospitals, working long hours while pursuing  their dreams of being doctors and specialists.   Here is the problem: With DACA's being gone, they no longer have the  legal right to work in the United States. What does that mean? They  cannot apply for residencies. This is the end of it, the end of their  medical education. It stops right there. Whatever their ambitions might  be, whether it is surgery or psychiatry, they cannot go forward without  DACA.   It really puts a burden on us in Congress to decide what we are going  to do, doesn't it? Are we going to pass a law that finally, once and  for all, defines the legal status of these young people--not just for  these medical students but for hundreds of thousands of others who are  working? They are engineers. They are teachers. They are working in so  many different areas, and they want to continue being part of this  country.   I am encouraged that we have a bipartisan response. My colleague  Senator Lindsey Graham, a Republican from South Carolina, is my lead  cosponsor on this year's version of the Dream Act. We currently have  three other Republican Senators who have joined as cosponsors from  across the United States--Senator Murkowski from Alaska, Senator Flake  from Arizona, and Senator Gardner from Colorado. We hope others will  join them. If we get the critical 60 votes in the Senate--60 sponsors  or 60 who will pledge to vote for it--we can pass the Dream Act once  and for all and take care of the concerns of the medical students I  mentioned and so many others across this country.   I have come to the floor over the last few years and told the stories  of the Dreamers. I think these stories have created good impressions in  people's minds about who these young people are and what they can do  for the future of the United States. I would like to do that again  today.   This is Harminder Saini. Harminder was 6 years old when his family  moved  [[Page S5088]]  to the United States from India. He grew up in Queens in New York City.  He was a typical American kid--played sports and went to the park every  day. Harminder's dream was to serve his country as a soldier in the  U.S. Army. In his words, he simply wanted to give back.   Harminder was a born leader, and in high school, he was active in  student government and was ultimately elected class president. He first  learned that he did not have legal immigration status when he was in  high school and he could not get a driver's license. They explained to  him that he did not have the necessary legal documentation to be in  this country. He was brought here as a kid and is growing up. He is now  a student at Hunter College at the City University of New York and is  working toward his bachelor's degree in history.   Thanks to DACA, he is fulfilling his dream. Last year, he was able to  enlist in the Army through the Military Accessions Vital to National  Interest Program, known as MAVNI. This photo is from his enlistment  ceremony.   The MAVNI Program allows immigrants with skills that are vital to our  national interests to enlist in the Armed Forces. More than 800 DACA  recipients with these skills--the people whom I described earlier--have  joined America's military. They really want to be part of our country.   Now, some Trump administration officials claim that DACA recipients  are taking away jobs from Americans. But Harminder and hundreds just  like him have skills that our military couldn't find in the general  population they were recruiting from. Harminder, along with many other  Dreamers, is now waiting to ship out for basic training. He continues  his undergraduate studies and is working full time while waiting for a  chance to volunteer to serve America in the military.   Harminder said:         All I want to do is serve. I want to do my part to give       back to this country because it allowed me to serve.    Harminder and other Dreamers have so much to give to America, but  without DACA--without the Dream Act--Harminder and hundreds of other  immigrants with skills that are really important to our national  interests will have to leave the Army. They want nothing more than to  serve our country. They are prepared to die for our country. What more  can we ask?   But, instead, there are those who would say that they should leave,  that they should be deported. One of the President's former staff  advisers, in a ``60 Minutes'' show last night, said those exact words:  They should just leave.   I don't think America would be a stronger country if Harminder left.  I don't think our military would be stronger without his contribution  and service to our country. He should be part of America, and we can do  something about it.   A friend of mine recently went to the University of Notre Dame to  visit with the administration there--represented by the Presiding  Officer--in the State of Indiana. It is my understanding that they have  some 68 DACA recipients at Notre Dame University. There is hardly a  university in this country that doesn't have DACA-eligible young people  who are going to school there. Remember, they don't qualify for any  Federal assistance for education, at all, because they are in an  undocumented status, but they are working their way through. They are  borrowing the money. They are working jobs to make sure that they reach  a point where they have a future.   Now it is up to us. We have to decide what we are going to do.  Senator Graham, my cosponsor of the Dream Act, said a week or so ago,  when we introduced the bill, that the moment of reckoning is coming.  That moment is not only coming. It arrived last Tuesday.   We need Republican leaders to join us to help make the Dream Act the  law of the land. Otherwise, what will happen to these young people?   As for this Senator, I have made this a major part of my public  career. I feel a special kinship with these young people. Yesterday was  Mexican Independence Day in Chicago. What a parade there was. It must  have gone on for 2 miles. It felt like it. There were more people than  you could imagine coming out with their families--people of Mexican  heritage who are now part of Chicago, part of Illinois, and part of the  United States. As I was marching down the street, there was a young  lady and a couple of her friends walking next to me wearing princess  crowns, and I started talking to them. It turned out that two of the  young girls were born in the United States. The third was born in  Mexico, and she is a DACA recipient. She is going to school. She  thanked me for the DACA Program and said: I hope you can make it a  reality again.   We have that obligation. We have that responsibility. We need to step  up with this broken immigration system and make certain that, at the  end of the day, we have done everything in our power to give these  young people like Harminder and hundreds of thousands just like him a  chance to be part of America's future.                           Remembering September 11    Mr. President, let me just close with a brief statement. I listened  to my colleague and friend Senator Schumer speak in very touching terms  about this anniversary which we observe today--the 16th anniversary of  9/11. I can recount where I was and what I remember, as I have before  on the floor, but I will not. I will just say that it changed America  in so many different ways.   As I went through airport security this morning at O'Hare, which I do  every single week. I thought to myself that 16 years ago it would have  been unthinkable that we would put passengers--every single one of  them--through this kind of security process. But that is the reality of  life in a world that is dangerous, life in a world where we want to  protect innocent people from the 9/11s of the future that are being  plotted and planned by our enemies around the world.   I think of those whose lives were lost on 9/11. I think of those who  risked their lives. I think of those whose lives will never be the same  because of that day.   It is a reminder to all of us to thank God that we live in this great  country, to remember our history well, to honor the men and women in  the military, and the men and women in law enforcement and in medicine,  who stepped up that day in a heroic way, and to make sure that we do  everything in our generation so that no future generation has a similar  experience.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    I announce that the Senator from New Jersey (Mr.  Menendez) and the Senator from Florida (Mr. Nelson) are necessarily  absent.
