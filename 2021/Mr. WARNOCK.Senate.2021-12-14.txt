 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I come to the floor today after a long  week of wrestling with my conscience. Before we left Washington last  week, we in this Chamber made a change in the Senate's rules in order  to push forward something that all of us think is important. We set the  stage to raise the Nation's debt ceiling.   Yet as we cast that vote to begin addressing the debt ceiling, this  same Chamber is allowing the ceiling of our democracy to crash in  around us. The American people have been pushing for leaders in  Washington to address voting rights.   Everywhere I turn, I have been hearing from my constituents in  Georgia. They are deeply worried. I heard it all weekend. I have been  hearing it over the last several months.   And I submit that they are worried for good reason. They know their  history. They are witnessing what is happening to our democracy in real  time, and they see the handwriting on the wall. They see the sweeping  voter suppression proposals in 49 States and the dozens of new laws  that have now popped up across the Nation, fueled by the Big Lie that  seeks to delegitimize the voices of millions of Georgians and Americans  who made their voices heard, made history, and, more importantly, made  a difference last November and last January.   The American people see what is happening in Arizona and in Texas and  in Florida and in Wisconsin and in Iowa. They see what is happening in  Georgia, my home State, where a new law, SB 202--passed right after I  won--will make it harder for some voters to access their ballots by  making it more difficult to vote by mail, allowing far fewer drop  boxes, and only allowing for the use of those boxes--listen--during  business hours. You can use the drop boxes during business hours, which  sort of defeats the purpose of having a drop box. In fact, back home,  the second most senior Republican in the Georgia State Senate announced  recently that he wants to do away with election drop boxes altogether-- literal boxes where registered, eligible voters simply can drop off  their ballots on their way to the night shift or on their way back  home. It seems to me that they want fewer voters and more dark money in  our elections, and that is the sad place we are in right now.   But what is even more disconcerting is that these politicians in the  State legislature have already laid the tracks to take over local  boards of elections, for almost any frivolous reason, to undermine the  voices of local voters and local election administrators, control the  count, muddy the waters, question or determine the outcome.   In the face of this crisis, the question is this: Has this Chamber  risen to the occasion to take on the issue of voting rights, which I  submit is the central moral issue confronting this Congress in this  moment? What have we done to strengthen access to the ballot as bedrock  voting rights protections have been shredded by our courts or to  protect the sacred right to vote as partisan State legislatures have  passed laws to dilute that right for so many people?   Well, some of us have acted. Democrats in this body have tried not  once, not twice, but we have tried this Congress on three occasions to  consider legislation to protect and expand voting rights so that more  eligible Americans can make their voices heard and help shape the  direction of our country. Each time--whether it was the For the People  Act or the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act or the Freedom to  Vote Act--with just one lone exception, all of our friends across the  aisle have refused to engage with us in any way to address the growing  barriers to what is basic to American democracy: the ballot box.   Here is what we have said. We have said to our Republican friends: If  you don't like this provision or that provision, let's talk about it.  Offer some amendments. Come, let us reason together. Let us have a  debate out in the open so that the American people can hear it.   Everybody talks about the divisions in America right now. Here is  what folks on the left and the right agree on: There is something awry  in our democracy. In this moment in which there is this debate  happening on the outside, how is it that we refuse to even have a  debate in the Senate? They don't even want to have a debate.   So here we are. Months have passed. No, that is not true--years have  passed. Democrats have tried again and again to engage our Republican  friends in a discussion on this issue--one that lies at the foundation  of our democracy--and time and time again, because of a lack of good- faith engagement, the rules of the Senate have prevented us from moving  that conversation forward.   We could not imagine changing the rules--that is, until last week,  because last week, we did exactly that. Be very clear. Last week, we  changed the rules of the Senate to address another important issue: the  economy. This is a step--a change in the Senate rules--we haven't been  willing to take to save our broken democracy but one that a bipartisan  majority of this Chamber thought was necessary in order to keep our  economy strong. We changed the rules to protect the full faith and  credit of the U.S. Government. We have decided we must do it for the  economy but not for the democracy.   I will be honest. This has been a difficult week for me as I pondered  how am I going to vote on this debt ceiling question we are about to  take. I feel like I am being asked to take a road that is a point of  moral dissonance for me because while I deeply believe that both our  democracy and our economy are important, I believe that it is misplaced  to change the Senate rules only for the benefit of the economy when the  warning lights on our democracy are flashing at the same time.   I happen to believe that our democracy is at least as important as  the economy. Ours is a great nation built upon both free enterprise and  free exercise of basic democratic rights. You cannot have good  capitalism without freedom. Each is strengthened by the other, and  together they make for a nation that is both prosperous and free, a  nation where everybody can breathe and every child has a chance to live  up to her highest potential.    So I stand here because of my children. I have two precious children,  and I think every day what kind of country I want them to grow up in. I  stand here today because we are in a place where we are dealing with  the consequence of misaligned values and misplaced priorities, and that  is, for me, a serious problem because I lead Ebenezer Baptist Church,  where John Lewis worshipped and where Dr. King preached. I asked myself  all weekend as I wrestled with how I would vote--I asked myself, what  would Dr. King do?   I thought this week about Dr. King's speech in front of the Lincoln  Memorial--no, not the 1963 ``I Have a Dream'' speech but the one he  gave the first time he spoke in front of the Lincoln Memorial in 1957,  where he addressed  [[Page S9138]]  what he called ``all types of conniving methods'' that were getting in  the way of the free exercise of the constitutional right to vote. His  rallying cry that day in 1957 was ``Give Us the Ballot.''   In light of the conniving methods of voter suppression we have seen  enacted into law since the January 6 attack on the Capitol, I come to  the floor today to share with the people of Georgia and the American  people the message that I shared with my colleagues over the weekend  and earlier today during our caucus meeting.   I said to my Democratic colleagues over the last several days--No.  1--unfortunately, the vast majority of our Republican friends have made  it clear that they have no intention of trying to work with us to  address voter suppression or to protect voting rights. They have  embodied by their actions the sentiments of conservative strategist  Paul Weyrich, who dared say in 1981: ``I don't want everybody to  vote.'' That is what he said. ``Elections are not won by a majority of  the people. They never have been from the beginning of our country and  they are not now. As a matter of fact,'' he went on to say, ``our  leverage in the elections quite candidly goes up as the voting populace  goes down.''   The second thing I said to my Democratic colleagues today is that  while we cannot let our Republican friends off the hook for not being  equitable governing partners, if we are serious about protecting the  right to vote that is under assault right now, here is the truth: It  will fall to Democrats to do it. If Democrats alone must raise the debt  ceiling, then Democrats alone must raise and repair the ceiling of our  democracy. How do we in good conscience justify doing one and not the  other?   Some of my Democratic colleagues are saying: But what about  bipartisanship? Isn't that important?   I say: Of course it is, but here is the thing we must remember.  Slavery was bipartisan. Jim Crow's segregation was bipartisan. The  refusal of women's suffrage was bipartisan. The denial of the basic  dignity of members of the LGBTQ community has long been bipartisan. The  Three-fifths Compromise was the creation of a putative national unity  at the expense of Black people's basic humanity.   So when colleagues in this Chamber talk to me about bipartisanship,  which I believe in, I just have to ask, at whose expense? Who is being  asked to foot the bill for this bipartisanship, and is liberty itself  the cost? I submit that is a price too high and a bridge too far.   So I struggled this weekend. I talked to folk I believe in. Among  them, I spoke with Reverend Ambassador Andrew Young, who was with Dr.  King until the very end, about this vote. I talked to Ambassador Young,  and I asked him: What do you think?   He said: I try not to worry, but I am worried about our country.   Then this 89-year-old, battle-worn soldier in the nonviolent army of  the Lord drew silent on the phone, and then he said to me: Tell your  colleagues that among your constituent are people who literally laid  their lives on the line for the basic right to vote. They lost friends.  They lost so much.   And so this is a real moral quandary for me, and it makes it  difficult for me to cast this vote today. But after many conversations  with colleagues, with Georgians, with experts who know the economy,  with voting rights advocates, and civil rights leaders, I will, indeed,  vote today with anguish. I will vote to raise the debt ceiling.   I am voting yes because I am thinking about the kids in the Kayton  Homes Housing Projects where I grew up in Savannah, GA. I am thinking  about the hard-working families pushing to recover from the pressures  of this pandemic, those on the margins and those who are least  resilient, for whom a collapse of the economy would be catastrophic.  Ironically, many of these are the same people who are also being  targeted by the voter suppression efforts I mentioned earlier. I am  thinking of them and the people of Georgia as I cast my vote today to  raise the debt ceiling.   But I am also thinking about what we need to do to keep our democracy  and our economy strong today and for the next generation. Once we  handle the debt ceiling, the Senate needs to make voting rights the  very next issue we take up. We must do voting rights, and we must deal  with this issue now.   Let me be clear. I am so proud of what we did with the bipartisan  infrastructure bill and the major economic investments we are putting  the finishing touches on that will close the Medicaid coverage gap and  deliver historic relief for Georgia farmers and expand broadband access  and so much more.   I have to tell you that the most important thing that we can do in  this Congress is to get voting rights done. Voting rights are  preservative of all other rights. They lay the ground for all of the  other debates.   So to my Democratic colleagues, I say, while it is deeply  unfortunate, it is more than apparent that it has been left to us to  handle alone the task of safeguarding our democracy. Sadly, many of our  Republican friends have already cast their vote with voter suppression.   So the judgment of history is upon us. Future generations will ask  when the democracy was in a 9-1-1 state of emergency, what did you do  to put the fire out? Did we rise to the moment or did we hide behind  procedural rules? I believe that we Democrats can figure out how to get  this done, even if that requires a change in the rules, which we  established just last week that we can do when the issue is important  enough.   Well, the people of Georgia and across the country are saying that  voting rights are important enough. I think that voting rights are  important enough so we cannot delay. We must continue to urge the party  of Lincoln not to give into the very forces of voter suppression that  Dr. King described in that 1957 speech while standing in the shadow of  Lincoln. But even as we do that, we cannot wait. We cannot wait on  them. With uncanny and eerie relevance, Dr. King's words summon us to  this very moment. He said:         The hour is late. The clock of destiny is ticking out. We       must act now before it is too late.    I yield the floor.
