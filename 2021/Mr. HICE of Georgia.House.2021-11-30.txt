 Madam Speaker, I thank Mr. Lamborn for  organizing this Special Order. The Scripture tells us in Psalm 100 that  God is good, that His mercies are everlasting, that His truth endures  to all generations, and that truth is revealed to us in God's Word.   This week we will see communities and churches and leaders all across  the country celebrating National Bible Week for its importance in the  role and life of our country and us as individuals.   I believe that we, as political leaders, have the responsibility to  remind America and our citizens of the significance of the Bible in our  history, our life, and our culture. It is impossible to accurately  describe the history of America without including the history of the  Bible and its impact on our Founders and the impact it can have on us  today.   I think of all the magnificent truths of God's Word, which I begin  every day in, all the incredible things, the wisdom, the splendor of it  all, but I think the most important thing ever that has transformed my  life is how God took my sins away.   The Scripture describes for us in Isaiah 53 that all of us, like  sheep, had gone astray, that all of us had sin, heaped upon sin, but  that God laid on Jesus the iniquity of us all. That is the story of the  great love and the mercy of God, where He who was sinless took upon  Himself our sins and made the pathway for us to have forgiveness and  peace with God, both now and forever more.   I urge my colleagues to be open and receptive to the love of God, to  the forgiveness of God. I urge our country to be receptive to the Word  of God, the truth of God. The blessings of God await us as a Nation as  we return to the truths of His Word.
