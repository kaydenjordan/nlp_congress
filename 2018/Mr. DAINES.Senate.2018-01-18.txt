 Mr. President, I thank Senator Lankford for leading this  very important conversation. I thank Senator Blunt, Senator Ernst, and  Senator Sasse for joining us today as well in this discussion.   Mr. President, 28 years ago, I became a first-time dad. By the grace  of God, we got to see three more children born after our first child  David was born. I can tell you, my wife Cindy and I were excited and a  little bit terrified when we welcomed David into the world.   As a parent, one of the toughest things is to see your child in pain.  I remember when David cried, I would have given an arm and a leg to  stop that pain. I remember when he was just a little baby taking David  to the pediatrician to get that shot and so forth, and the pain David  felt and the screams and the crying I think were much harder on the  parents than on the baby.   I think we all recognize the pain a child feels after they are born.  As I have gone on and researched this issue of pain and babies and so  forth, science tells us that a baby feels pain before they are born.  Senator Sasse mentioned earlier that we are one of four nations that  allows elective abortion at any time during a pregnancy. The question  is, if we were 1 hour before delivery--the baby is 1 hour from being  delivered--as a nation, can we at least agree that we should have a law  that says abortions should not be allowed because it is pretty clear  that the baby is going to feel pain? The question is, at what point do  we know they feel pain during the pregnancy?   It is shocking to think our Nation loses 13,000 children a year to  late-term abortions. We can have the debate about all abortions, but  today we are focused on late-term abortions. Thirteen thousand children  a year die from late-term abortions. At 20 weeks, these babies can suck  their thumb, they can yawn, they can stretch, they can make faces, and  science shows these babies are also capable of feeling pain.   Our ears may be deaf to their cries, but we don't have to live in  ignorance, not when research and even common sense tells us these  unborn children feel pain. In fact, there is a reason unborn babies are  oftentimes given anesthesia during fetal surgery. That is why we must  pass the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act. It is unconscionable  that we are allowing unborn children as old as 20 weeks--that is 5  months--to be killed when they can feel pain. In fact, do a Google  search. If you have a smartphone, are sitting in front of a computer,  type in ``20 weeks.'' You don't even have to type in ``baby.'' Just  type in ``20 weeks.'' Then, take a look at the pictures, the images  that come up after you complete that search. This is one of them. In  fact, I had my smartphone last night. I said to my staff: I typed in  ``20 weeks'' in the Google search, and this is the image that comes up.   How can we say that is not a baby? While much of the media turned a  blind eye to the atrocious acts of Kermit Gosnell, and they didn't  watch the horrific videos taken undercover at Planned Parenthood  clinics, many of us did. We did watch, and we cannot sit in silence.  Most of us would not wish that treatment on even our most hated of  enemies, let alone a child of any age.   The United States is just one of seven countries that allows elective  abortions after 20 weeks. It is not a good list to be on. It is the  same list we share that has China and North Korea on it. As an American  citizen, I believe in our founding principle that all men and women are  endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, and among  these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.   As a person of faith, I am called--we are called--to help the most  vulnerable in our society. As a U.S. Senator, it is my honor to support  this legislation, the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, and I  urge its swift passage.    Mr. President, access to healthcare is on the line today  for 24,000 Montana children. The House of Representatives is working to  pass legislation that will reauthorize a program called the Children's  Health Insurance Program, better known as CHIP, for 6 years and will  keep the government open. If passed, it will then come to us for a  vote.   Why don't we take the opportunity before us to come together on  issues we agree on instead of always fighting on what divides us? I  think we can all agree on keeping Montana kids healthy.   Let me tell you a story about a family from Helena, MT, the A-Gee  family.   Jaxon was a normal baby--a happy, healthy baby--until October of  2016, when he was just 8 months old. That is when he was first flown  from Helena to Missoula's Community Medical Center's Pediatric  Intensive Care Unit. He was deathly ill with a respiratory infection.   At that time, it was not clear why Jaxon had gotten so sick, but his  parents soon learned that he had Leigh syndrome, a disease in which the  body is not able to process energy properly, which leads to muscle  weakness, swallowing problems, and severe illnesses with just a simple  or a common cold. His parents quickly learned to manage his new feeding  tube, to suction his mouth and his throat, and to put him on oxygen  monitors at night.   Unfortunately, Jaxon has had five more serious infections. Each time,  he has become ill. It has happened so quickly that he has had to be  flown to Missoula even though he has a team of pediatricians, nurses,  dietitians, speech therapists, and physical therapists who are trying  to help keep him from getting ill.   As Jaxon's mom would say, when Jaxon gets ill, the only way to keep  him from having to be flown to Missoula is to get him seen by his  pediatrician as soon as possible so that if he does get sick, it is  relatively minor.   I can tell you that this family in Montana is grateful for Healthy  Montana Kids, which is Montana's CHIP program. They are thankful for  its providing Jaxon's insurance and the copay for his care and his  medical supplies. His mom says that the insurance is what makes it  possible to manage Jaxon's condition and possible to afford well-baby  checks instead of their just going to the doctor's on an emergency  basis.   To add more background to the story, Jaxon's dad was disabled in a  workplace accident, so he is home, caring for Jaxon and the family's  other two children. Jaxon's mom works, and her employer has been  phenomenal to her--those are her words--as they have faced Jaxon's  hospitalizations, but the family of five couldn't afford Jaxon's care  without Healthy Montana Kids. A helicopter bill for the ride from  Helena to Missoula alone can be as much as $34,000, and Jaxon has taken  that flight six times.   This family doesn't know what it will do if the funding for CHIP runs  out, but the family is committed to caring for its son no matter what.  That is why I support a 6-year reauthorization of CHIP.   Let me provide another reason.   This is Danielle. She is 9 years old, and she lives in Deer Lodge,  MT. When she was just 18 months old, she suddenly lost the ability to  walk.   Cindy and I are the parents of four children. I cannot imagine a more  frightening moment as a parent if one has an 18-month-old child, and he  suddenly loses his ability to walk.   Danielle was diagnosed with a form of juvenile arthritis. You don't  think about arthritis affecting an 18-month-old child. This is a  disease that causes pain, swelling, a stiffness of joints, as well as  vision problems.   Thankfully, Danielle was started on a medication--a twice-a-month  injection that controls the swelling and inflammation. Because of that,  she can walk and even run again. Yet these injections are expensive. To  pay outright for just 1 month, it costs over $6,000. Last summer, for 3  months, Danielle was unable to get the injections. She stopped walking,  and she no longer could go to school. Her mom had to carry her through  the house.   When Danielle was approved for Montana's CHIP program, she was able  to go to the doctor's and get on another medication--an infusion this  time. She is now back at school and running around--to quote Mom-- ``like a kid who doesn't have any problems.'' Danielle loves to study  math and science, and when she grows up, of all things, her dream is to  be a doctor for kids. Without CHIP, Danielle's family would be unable  to afford the medication she needs. Without CHIP, Danielle wouldn't be  walking.   Danielle and Jaxon and the thousands of other Montana kids and their  families need us to work for them. So I am saddened that partisan  politics would get in the way of access to healthcare for these  children. We have the opportunity today to reauthorize CHIP for 6 years  and avert a government shutdown at the same time.   I urge my colleagues to do the right thing here, to do the right  thing for the 24,000 Montana kids who use this important program. I  urge them to support a 6-year reauthorization of CHIP and to keep the  government open.   I yield the floor.    Madam President, today I have the distinct honor  of recognizing Curtis and Marlys Schwaderer for their many years of  service to the community of Superior, MT, as owners of Mineral  Pharmacy. For decades, Mineral Pharmacy has been a cornerstone business  in the community, providing vital services for its people.   A graduate of the pharmacy school at the University of Montana,  Curtis purchased the pharmacy 27 years ago. Together, he and his wife,  Marlys, ran the business and raised two sons in the community. As  Superior has struggled with the decline of the timber industry with  rising unemployment and falling incomes, the Schwaderers and their  business have been a constant and stabilizing presence, a beacon of  certainty in uncertain times.   In November, after 43 years as pharmacist and 27 years at Mineral  Pharmacy, Curtis retired, and he and Marlys announced they were selling  the business. Under new ownership, the pharmacy continues to serve the  community of Superior, and the Schwaderers themselves remain members of  the community. The Schwaderers and Mineral Pharmacy are an excellent  example of what committed community members and a business can mean to  a small town. Every day, in small towns across Montana, you will find  hard-working people like the Schwaderers and small businesses like  Mineral Pharmacy working hard to keep our communities strong. They are  truly the lifeblood of our State.   Thank you, Curtis and Marlys, for your many years of hard work and  service to your community. I wish you all the best in your next  chapter.                            ____________________
