 Mr. President, first, a little housekeeping: I  understand that there are two bills at the desk due for a second  reading en bloc.    In order to place the bills on the Calendar under the  provisions of rule XIV, I would object to further proceedings, en bloc.    Mr. President, now, yesterday, Treasury Secretary Janet  Yellen released a letter warning that the U.S. government will likely  default on its obligations as soon as June 1, only 30 days away.   Rather than listen to reason, Speaker McCarthy has caved to  extremists. By passing the ``Default on America Act,'' he has handed  the keys over to the House Freedom Caucus, many of whom are more than  happy to let the United States default if they don't get every last cut  and every last unrelated, hard-right policy that had been added to this  bill chockablock. Every one of them they want. As one House Freedom  Caucus Member said plainly, Speaker McCarthy ``cannot get to 218 with  changes to this deal.''   Let me read that again so everyone hears it. This is where we are at.  A House Freedom Caucus Member--each of whom, as we know, has great  power in the House because they didn't change their rules--as one  Freedom Caucus Member has said, plainly, Speaker McCarthy ``cannot get  to 218 with changes to this deal.''   But, as is obvious to just about anyone who looks at this, the  ``Default on America Act'' has no future in the Senate. Consequently,  Speaker McCarthy has created a situation where he knowingly passed an  extreme bill, has been boxed by his Republican colleagues into a  corner, and now has little room to maneuver, lest he provoke the ire of  the House Freedom Caucus.   McCarthy is giving us two terrible options: Either default on the  debt or default on our country, with steep, severe, devastating cuts to  things like law enforcement, veterans, families, teachers, kids, even  cancer research. The only real option that does not hurt the American  people is a clean, bipartisan bill to avert default.   As Americans look at the ``Default on America Act,'' which the House  just passed, they will discover that it reads less like a plan for  averting default and more like a House Freedom Caucus manifesto.  [[Page S1446]]    The ``Default on America Act'' would tear at the fabric of American  society, imposing dramatic cuts to our public security, cutting law  enforcement dramatically at a time when we need help from them; the  cruel abandonment of veterans when we should be defending our veterans;  terrible job losses at a time when this last Congress, under Democratic  control, started bringing jobs back from overseas to America, on chip  fab, on manufacturing, on batteries, and so many other things; blocking  access to affordable healthcare--over 21 million Americans could lose  the healthcare gains that we have made over the last while--and brutal  attacks on working families across the board.   In fact, nothing about the ``Default on America Act'' has been on the  level.   Let me quote something that Speaker McCarthy said right after  becoming Speaker. This is a quote from Kevin McCarthy:         I want to give all Americans a personal invitation, you are       welcome to see this body at work. No longer will the doors be       closed, but the debates will be open . . . from the       committee rooms to this floor, we commit to pursue the       truth passionately and embrace debate.    Well, let's go over that one. No more closed doors? Give me a break.  The ``Default on America'' bill was written entirely behind closed  doors, without a shred of transparency. This bill, which so  dramatically and deeply and harmfully hurts America, was done entirely  behind closed doors.   Debates will be in the open? How many committee debates did the House  GOP hold on their ``Default on America Act''? How many expert witnesses  were invited? How many amendments from the Democratic side were allowed  to be presented?   Again, the truth is, ``Default on America'' is an extremist bill that  would never have a shot at passing muster with the American public on  its own. As such, everything about this bill was rushed, was secret,  was the antithesis of open and transparent. McCarthy's words ring  hollow. The American people deserve better.   Now, if Republicans refuse to level with the American people about  their bill, Senate Democrats are more than happy to do it. We will show  the American people how the ``Default on America Act'' will decimate  Federal law enforcement in this country, erasing nearly 30,000 law  enforcement jobs and leaving border security hanging out to dry. We  will show how the ``Default on America Act'' is a direct assault on  families. It slashes childcare, cuts Pell Grant funding, and even takes  aim at programs as popular and beneficial as Meals on Wheels.   I mean, do Republicans seriously think that is the way to avoid  default, by depriving our country from the critical resources to feed  hungry Americans?   And we will show the American people how the ``Default on America''  is chock-full of totally irrelevant, hard-right goodies that would  deregulate fossil fuels, empower the biggest corporations, give tax  giveaways to the ultrarich, and impose cruel and unpopular attacks on  working families.   We will take the first step to expose these atrocities on Thursday,  when the Senate Budget Committee holds hearings on how the ``Default on  America Act'' will weaken our economy and slash hundreds of thousands  of jobs. It will be the very first legislative hearing in either House  that looks at what ``Default on America'' does, and there will be more  hearings to follow.   If Republicans want to sell their awful agenda to the American  people, they are welcome to do so in debates about the budget and the  appropriations process. That is where these debates have always  happened, not in the middle of a default crisis that now stares us in  the face.   As Democrats expose the ``Default on America'' bill for what it is,  our position remains the same, both parties should do what we have done  in the past, the last three times default faced us: Both parties should  pass a clean, bipartisan bill to avoid default together, before-- before--we hit the critical June 1 deadline.                            ____________________     Mr. President, now, on Senate business, today will be  another busy day on the Senate floor, as we continue confirming more  highly qualified judicial nominees to serve on the Federal bench.   Yesterday, we confirmed an outstanding circuit judge to a lifetime  appointment for the Ninth Circuit. Today, we will continue to build on  our efforts to restore balance to the Federal bench by holding votes on  three more outstanding nominees.   The Senate will hold two votes this morning to advance two district  court judges, and, later this afternoon, we will have three votes on  President Biden's highly qualified judicial nominees.   And members should be aware that I filed cloture last night on two  additional judges, and that moving their nominations forward will be a  top priority for the Senate this week.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to legislative session and be in a period of morning business,  with Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.
