 Madam Speaker, before I came to Congress, I spent 33  years as a cop. Today is National Law Enforcement Appreciation Day, a  day to honor our dedicated law enforcement officers who selflessly put  their lives on the line each and every day to protect our families. We  not only honor those who protect and serve us today, but we also  remember those who paid the ultimate sacrifice.   Sadly, yesterday, in my community, we experienced the death, the  murder, of another police officer. His name was Deputy Daniel McCartney  of the Pierce County Sheriff's Department, shot and killed while  responding to a burglary call. This brave man was also a Navy veteran  and leaves behind a wife and three sons--4 years old, 6 years old, and  9 years old--without a father.   I ask you to join me today in praying for his family and for his  colleagues in the Pierce County Sheriff's Department.   Every day, law enforcement officers are asked to stand tall in the  face of danger. I know.   To paraphrase a quote from Sheriff Pastor yesterday after the death  of his fallen officer, he said: Deputy McCartney ran toward trouble,  ran to protect. He is a man who served with the heart of a servant,  with spirit, with strength and compassion.   Please join me today in thanking our law enforcement officers across  this Nation for their dedicated service.                            ____________________
