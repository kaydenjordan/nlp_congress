 Mr. Speaker, 3 weeks ago, the remnants of Hurricane  Ida slammed into New Jersey claiming 30 lives and devastating my  district.   President Biden's major disaster declaration unlocked the financial  help that we need, and today Congress is heeding our call to fund that  assistance with billions of dollars to help homeowners and small  businesses rebuild and to support the flood control projects that we  desperately need the Army Corps to complete to prevent the next  disaster.   While we need the help--and I am proud to have played my part in  securing it--we also know that the solution to these increasingly  catastrophic storms can't simply be that we apply to FEMA to help fix  our homes every 5 years or that we keep building ever higher and higher  flood walls. We have got to recognize that climate change is 4 feet of  water in your basement, Mr. Speaker, and the cost of not dealing with  it is far greater than the cost of transitioning away from fossil  fuels.   We can resign ourselves to half a country on fire and half the  country under water, or we can lead the world to clean energy. I prefer  to do that.
