 Mr. Chair, this year marks 50 years since our country  stopped drafting citizens into service and began instituting an all- volunteer force. Unfortunately, today's military is facing significant  recruitment challenges. That can be detrimental to the security of our  great Nation.   Seeking to limit the reproductive rights and freedom of America's  servicewomen only exacerbates the issue. Why would a woman who takes an  oath to defend our Nation do so when House Republicans stand in this  Chamber attacking their bodily autonomy?   Today, women make up about 20 percent of our Armed Forces, and our  military is stronger because of their contribution. It is important to  note that servicewomen experience higher unintended pregnancy rates  than their civilian counterparts, largely due to limited access to  contraceptive services and the inexcusable high degree of sexual  assault.                                time  1900    It is an appalling reality that nearly one in four female  servicemembers have reported sexual harassment during their careers.  That my Republican colleagues would force a woman raped by her superior  to pay for her own travel to access abortion care is beyond appalling.   This amendment is a shameful politicization of our military, and it  is using our servicemembers as pawns in an ideological debate.
