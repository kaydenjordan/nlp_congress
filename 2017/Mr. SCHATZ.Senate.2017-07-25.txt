 Four-and-a-half years.    Four-and-a-half years.    Four-and-a-half years.    Mr. President, how much time remains?   The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 5\1/2\ minutes.    Mr. President, we just took one of the most reckless  legislative actions in this body's history. We are blowing up the  American healthcare system, and we don't even know what comes next.   I want to be clear. The Senate has never before voted on major  legislation that would reorder about one-sixth or one-fifth of the  American economy and impact millions of lives without actually knowing  what the bill would even do.   There has been no bipartisanship. There has been talk of it, but  there have been no real discussions. There have been no public  hearings. Let me say something about hearings. This is not a technical  point. This is the way a legislative body does its work. This is the  way we figure out whether our bill is any good or not.   This is the way the Senate has always worked. We don't do major  legislation without hearings. But that is what we are doing today, and  that is because people don't want to disclose what is in this bill.   It is true that we don't know exactly what is in the bill, but we can  be sure of a few things. First, whatever problems there are with the  ACA, this bill doesn't even bother to take a swing at them. To the  extent people are worried about high deductibles, it will increase the  deductibles. To the degree people are worried about the choices on the  exchanges, it doesn't even try to solve that problem.   We don't know exactly how much Medicaid will be cut, whether it is  just rolling back the Medicaid expansion or making these radical  structural reforms, but we know there will be deep cuts to Medicaid.  This will hurt people. It will hurt people in nursing homes. It will  hurt people with drug addiction. Medicaid is a program that works for  tens of millions of Americans, and it will be slashed massively.   We don't know whether they are going to get rid of the capital gains  tax or just other revenue, but we know they are going to reduce many of  the taxes in the original Affordable Care Act, and they are going to  pay for it by cutting Medicaid.   So under the guise of fixing the ACA, they are actually doing nothing  about ACA. What they are doing is cutting taxes and cutting Medicaid.  We don't know exactly what is in the bill, but we do know that.   People are going to be hurt--people with preexisting conditions,  families with loved ones struggling with opioid abuse, people in  nursing homes, people who rely on Planned Parenthood, and the tens of  millions of people who will lose their insurance almost instantly. That  is why every group--from the American Medical Association to the  nurses, to the American Cancer Society, to the March of Dimes, to the  National Physicians Alliance, and the AARP--opposes this bill. There  are 14 different versions of this bill, but, actually, these  organizations oppose them all.   There are some core elements of the vote we took that are going to be  true no matter what. It will cut Medicaid and cut taxes. It will reduce  patient protections. It will reduce the number of people who have  insurance.   It was all done with no hearings, with no Democrats, with no experts  on healthcare. This thing is going to be dropped on us without enough  time to review it and without enough time to interact with our home  State and figure out the impact.   Make no mistake, the reason they will not tell you what is going to  be in the final bill is because the moment they do, this thing will  come crashing down. What the American people have to do is to make sure  that this thing comes crashing down anyway. We have to do it for the  tens of millions of Americans who depend on Medicaid and the ACA. We  have to do it for our rural hospitals. We have to do it for the people  with preexisting conditions. We have to do it for the people without  power, without money, without the ability to walk 200 yards from this  gilded Chamber and get the best healthcare in the world.   I will be fine. All the Members of this Chamber will be fine. But our  job is not to take care of ourselves. Our job is to represent our  constituents, and this bill has earned the title of most unpopular  major bill in American history, most unpopular major legislation in  American history.   There is still time to walk back from the brink.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.   Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays with  respect to amendment No. 267.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?   There appears to be a sufficient second.   The yeas and nays were ordered.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.                    Amendment No. 270 to Amendment No. 267         (Purpose: Of a perfecting nature.)    Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 270.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.   The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows:         The Senator from Kentucky [Mr. McConnell] proposes an       amendment numbered 270 to amendment No. 267.    Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  reading of the amendment be dispensed with.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?
