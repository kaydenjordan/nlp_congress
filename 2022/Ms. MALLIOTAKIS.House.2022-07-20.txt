 Madam Speaker, I rise today to bring attention to  the fact that the World Trade Center Health Program is facing a looming  deficit of $3 billion. In a few weeks we are going to be commemorating  the 21-year anniversary of 9/11, the horrific terrorist attacks, where  we told firefighters, police officers, families who lost loved ones,  and those who today are battling cancers and illnesses, that we would  never forget, and that we would stand by them and give them what they  needed on their journey in this great country.   They gave so selflessly. They put their lives on the line, and so  many lost their life on that dreadful day. But to this day, we still  have heroes who are battling these illnesses, and we should not be  leaving this session, we should not be leaving next week without  passing this incredibly important bill, H.R. 4965, the 9/11 Responder  and Survivor Health Funding Correction Act.   This bill has bipartisan support. I am proud to be a prime sponsor of  this bill, but we must call on the Speaker of the House to bring this  to the floor before we leave next week. We owe it to those who put  their life on the line for our city and our great country.                            ____________________     Mr. Chair, I understand the plight of the Cuban  people, I would say, more than most in this Chamber simply because I  still have family who resides there. It is true that these people are  starving, and they are struggling, but the reality is that it is  because of their own government.   Whatever you do, Mr. Chair, any business that you conduct with Cuba  will go to the regime. It never gets to the actual people. We know this  because that is the way they have acted in the course of history, doing  business with every other country in the world and then taking it all  for themselves while the people suffer.   The people who want the Fight for $15 on the other side of the aisle  know that the people of Cuba make $15 per day, that they are being  treated inhumanly, and that young children are put in jail.   If you want to help the Cuban people, Mr. Chair, side with them in  their quest for freedom. Side with them when they say they want to be  liberated. They want what we have in the United States.   Stop appeasing the regime; stop empowering the regime; and stand on  the side of freedom.   Let's try to change this form of government for the better so those  people can have true human rights and freedoms that they deserve and  that they are not put in political prisons simply for peacefully  protesting like we are so privileged to do here in the United States.
