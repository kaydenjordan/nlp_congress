 Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to take from the  Speaker's table the bill (H.R. 711) An Act to amend the West Los  Angeles Leasing Act of 2016 to authorize the use of certain funds  received pursuant to leases entered into under such Act, and for other  purposes, with the Senate amendment thereto, and concur in the Senate  amendment.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 2093) to direct the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to make  all fact sheets of the Department of Veterans Affairs available in  English, Spanish, and Tagalog, and other commonly spoken languages, and  for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2093         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Veterans and Family       Information Act''.       SEC. 2. FACT SHEETS.         (a) Languages.--The Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall       make available versions of all fact sheets of the Department       of Veterans Affairs in--        (1) English;        (2) Spanish;        (3) Tagalog; and        (4) each of the 10 most commonly spoken languages, other       than English, in the United States that are not otherwise       covered by paragraphs (2) and (3).        (b) Website.--The Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall       establish and maintain a publicly available website of the       Department of Veterans Affairs that contains links to all       fact sheets of the Veterans Benefits Administration, Veterans       Health Administration, and of the National Cemetery       Administration. The website shall be accessible by a clearly       labeled hyperlink on the homepage of the Department.        (c) Report.--Not later than 180 days after the date of the       enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs       shall submit a report to Congress regarding fact sheets       described in subsection (a) and details of the Language       Access Plan of the Department of Veteran Affairs. The report       shall include the following:        (1) What the Secretary determines constitutes a fact sheet       of the Department for purposes of this Act.        (2) How such fact sheets are utilized and distributed other       than on and through the website of the Department.        (3) How such Language Access Plan is communicated to       veterans, family members of veterans, and caregivers.        (4) The roles and responsibilities of patient advocates in       the coordination of care for veterans with limited English       proficiency, family members of such veterans, and caregivers.        (5) Other demographic information that the Secretary       determines appropriate regarding veterans with limited       English proficiency.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and to insert extraneous material on H.R. 2093.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, since 2001 the foreign-born share of the veteran  population has steadily risen. Immigrants have served in the Armed  Forces since the very beginning of our Nation, and they today make up  600,000 veterans. 1.9 million veterans are the U.S.-born children of  immigrants. Together, the 2.5 million veterans of immigrant origin, by  birth or parentage, account for 13 percent of all veterans living  today.   Certain nationals of countries in free association with the United  States--the Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, and  Palau--are eligible to serve the United States, and they do in numbers  much larger than their counterparts stateside.   Half a million veterans live in Puerto Rico. There are 6,000 regular  Philippine Scouts still alive and 15,000 U.S. veterans who live in the  Philippines, half of whom rely on the VA clinic in Manila for their  service-connected care.   Two-thirds of the veteran cohorts I just mentioned do not speak  English at home. Many of them are aging and have to rely more and more  on their families for care and to manage health decisions.   VA has scarce availability of veteran-facing materials in other  languages, both online and in paper. Facilities are, for the most part,  on their own to translate material that best serves their patients.   This extra burden was made clear to me during committee trips to  Puerto Rico, where we heard from staff about the arduous work it took  to have to translate everything from administrative staff training  materials to hurricane brochures. Everything sent from VA Central  Office in Washington, D.C., to Puerto Rico had to be redone so it could  be usable and accessible to veterans and the staff who serve them.   The VA should be fully accessible to all veterans who need it, and  that includes language accessibility. Mr. Jeffries' bill, H.R. 2093,  the Veterans and Family Information Act, would require VA to do what it  should have been doing for years, make its veteran-facing fact sheets  and websites available in languages veterans and their families speak;  specifically, the languages of Spanish, Tagalog, and the other top 10  spoken languages in the United States. It would also require VA to  create a language access plan for the VA enterprise.   Now, this is a long overdue correction of VA's posture. If this  pandemic has taught us anything, it is that clearly communicated public  health information from our healthcare institutions is essential. VA  must ensure that language proficiency is never a barrier to a veteran's  care.   I therefore ask my colleagues to join me in supporting the Veterans  and Family Information Act.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  New York (Mr. Jeffries), my good friend, the chairman of the Democratic  Caucus and author of H.R. 2093.    Madam Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I am  prepared to close. I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I am very, very pleased to recommend to  all of my colleagues to vote ``yes.'' This issue affects my own  constituency where I know that we have veterans that have caregivers  that may only speak, say, the language of Spanish, and so I am very  convinced that this legislation will benefit all of our country, but  especially my own district.   It is with that spirit that I recommend that we pass this important  piece of legislation. I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 239) to amend title 38, United States Code, to provide for  limitations on copayments for contraception furnished by the Department  of Veterans Affairs, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 239         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Equal Access to       Contraception for Veterans Act''.       SEC. 2. LIMITATION ON COPAYMENTS FOR CONTRACEPTION.         Section 1722A(a)(2) of title 38, United States Code, is       amended--        (1) by striking ``to pay'' and all that follows through the       period and inserting ``to pay--''; and        (2) by adding at the end the following new subparagraphs:        ``(A) an amount in excess of the cost to the Secretary for       medication described in paragraph (1); or        ``(B) an amount for any contraceptive item for which       coverage under health insurance coverage is required without       the imposition of any cost-sharing requirement pursuant to       section 2713(a)(4) of the Public Health Service Act (42       U.S.C. 300gg-13(a)(4)).''.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and to insert extraneous material on H.R. 239.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, contraception access is a crucial element of  preventative healthcare and reduces the likelihood that a woman will  live in poverty. Copay-free access to contraception is covered under  every insurance program in this country, except at the Department of  Veterans Affairs.   H.R. 239, the Equal Access to Contraception for Veterans Act, would  eliminate copays on contraceptive items at the Department of Veterans  Affairs. I thank Congresswoman Brownley for introducing this bill and  for her efforts as chair of the Subcommittee on Health and the Women  Veterans Task Force.   Contraception is already widely available at VA, and veterans  enrolled at VA can obtain oral contraceptions, shots, skin patches,  vaginal rings, and long-acting reversible contraceptives, such as  implants or intrauterine devices. In addition, the VA pharmacy  dispenses over-the-counter contraceptives, including condoms and  emergency contraception.   Even a small copay can be insurmountable for a veteran struggling to  make ends meet. Eliminating copays ensures parity with both Federal  insurers and private insurers, as mandated under the Affordable Care  Act. Most of all, it eliminates an unnecessary financial burden on our  veterans.   Furthermore, we know also that every tax dollar spent on family  planning, such as contraception, ultimately saves seven times that  amount.   Passing this bill is an essential element of both meeting the health  and economic well-being of our Nation's veterans.   This legislation has the support of the VA, broad VSO support, and  passed on suspension last Congress.   Again, I thank Chairwoman Julia Brownley for her leadership on this  issue, and I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 239.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Brownley), my good friend, the chairwoman of the  Subcommittee on Health, and also the author of this important  legislation.    Madam Speaker, I want to thank Ranking Member Bost for  pointing out that the previous ranking member and previous chairman of  this committee, an OB/GYN, Representative Roe, stood in firm support of  this legislation. I know him to also be someone of very firm pro-life  convictions. I am very proud of the bipartisan support that has  gathered around Ms. Brownley's legislation.   Madam Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to support this bill, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 1257) to direct the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to conduct  a study on the effect of financial and credit counseling for homeless  veterans and veterans experiencing housing instability, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1257         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Homeless Veterans Credit       Repair, Enhancement, and Debt Improvement for Tomorrow Act''       or the ``Homeless Veterans CREDIT Act''.       SEC. 2. STUDY ON FINANCIAL AND CREDIT COUNSELING.         (a) Study Required.--The Secretary of Veterans Affairs       shall conduct a comprehensive study on--        (1) the use of and variation of financial and credit       counseling services available for homeless veterans and       veterans experiencing housing instability;        (2) barriers to accessing financial and credit counseling       for such veterans; and        (3) the ability to evaluate and assess the potential       effects of financial and credit counseling for such veterans       with respect to housing, employment, income, and other       outcomes the Secretary determines appropriate.

(d) Barriers to Counseling.--In conducting the study under       subsection (a)(2), the Secretary shall conduct research on       the effects of the following perceived barriers to financial       and credit counseling for homeless veterans and veterans       experiencing housing instability surveyed in the study:        (1) The cost of financial and credit counseling services.        (2) The perceived stigma associated with seeking financial       and credit counseling assistance.

Roe, M.D. Veterans Health       Care and Benefits Improvement Act of 2020.--The Johnny       Isakson and David P. Roe, M.D. Veterans Health Care and       Benefits Improvement Act of 2020 (Public Law 116-315) is       amended as follows:        (1) In section 3010--        (A) in subsection (a), by striking ``The Secretary'' and       inserting ``Subject to the availability of appropriations for       such purpose, the Secretary''; and        (B) by striking subsection (h).

Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and to insert extraneous material on H.R. 1257, as amended.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, credit and financial counseling services remain a top  10 unmet need for veterans experiencing or who are at risk of  homelessness.   This bill directs the VA to study the efficacy and barriers to credit  and financial counseling for homeless and unstably housed veterans, and  to provide recommendations for improvements to these services.   Under the Homeless Veterans CREDIT Act, the Secretary will work with  outside organizations to review these barriers, and submit to Congress  concrete steps we can take to expand credit access to veterans in need.   H.R. 1257, as amended, has the support of VA and key veteran service  organizations, like the VFW, Paralyzed Veterans of America, and the  IAVA.   Also included in this legislation are various oversight improvements  to existing law that our committee has worked on with the House  Appropriations Committee, and I thank my colleagues on the  Appropriations Committee for their hard work. I therefore, ask my  colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 1257, as amended.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  New Jersey (Mr. Pallone), my good friend, the author of this critical  piece of legislation, and also the chairman of the Energy and Commerce  Committee.    Madam Speaker, we know that preventing homelessness is  especially critical as we try to emerge out of this pandemic.   Madam Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to support Chairman Pallone's  bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 2429) to amend title 38, United States Code, to improve the  staffing, transparency, and accountability of the law enforcement  operations of the Department of Veterans Affairs, and for other  purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2429         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``VA Police Improvement and       Accountability Act''.       SEC. 2.

(e) Report on Implementation.--Not later than one year       after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary       shall submit to the Committees on Veterans' Affairs of the       House of Representatives and the Senate a report on the       implementation of this section and the amendments made by       this section. The report shall include the following:  [[Page H2778]]         (1) With respect to the staffing needs of the Department       police force--        (A) identification of the amount of turnover among       Department police officers;        (B) how the compensation for Department police officers       affects such turnover;        (C) a comparison of such compensation with the compensation       provided to specialty police units, such as police units at       medical facilities and other police units in the same       locality pay area; and        (D) the plan developed under subsection (d), including--        (i) estimates on the costs to carry out the plan; and        (ii) any recommendations for legislative actions required       to carry out the plan.

(f) Definitions.--In this section:        (1) The term ``body worn camera'' means a camera worn on an       individual police officer's person that records and stores       audio and video.        (2) The term ``Department police officer'' means an       employee of the Department of Veterans Affairs described in       section 902(a) of title 38, United States Code.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to  insert extraneous material on H.R. 2429.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I am pleased to support H.R. 2429, the VA Police  Improvement and Accountability Act, introduced by former Committee on  Veterans' Affairs member Representative Rice from New York.   This bipartisan legislation cosponsored by Representative Radewagen  would improve the transparency and accountability of the VA police.  Specifically, the legislation would require the VA police to publish  online information about arrests and use of force, as well as establish  a consistent way for the public to obtain more detailed information  about those incidents.   Importantly, this bill would also require VA to have its police use  body-worn cameras, publish guidance on the use of such cameras, improve  tracking and analysis of arrests and other police actions, and develop  a staffing plan that adequately supports every VA facility's needs.  Together, these improvements will build accountability and trust  between the VA police and anyone who walks through VA facility doors  across the country.   H.R. 2429 was reported favorably by the committee, and I ask my  colleagues to join me in supporting the VA Police Improvement and  Accountability Act.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  New York (Miss Rice), my good friend, a former member of the Veterans'  Affairs Committee, and the lead Democratic cosponsor.   Miss RICE of New York. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of my  bipartisan bill, the VA Police Improvement and Accountability Act, H.R.  2429. This bill takes important steps to strengthen oversight and  accountability for VA police and law enforcement operations.   A number of shortcomings with VA's law enforcement operations were  identified in a hearing held by the House Committee on Veterans'  Affairs last Congress. Inadequate policing procedures and a lack of  true oversight for the Department's police force were two of the  pressing issues raised at the hearing.   Challenges with management and oversight of VA police were also  revealed in subsequent reports issued by the VA Office of Inspector  General and the Government Accountability Office. These challenges  include insufficient officer staffing, inappropriate conduct, and other  concerning issues at VA facilities across the country.   On Long Island, I have worked with one of my constituents who was  horribly mistreated by the Northport VA police. Our veterans deserve  much better from an agency that is always supposed to be on their side.   My bill aims to address these pressing issues with the VA police by  requiring the VA police to implement the use of body cameras, improve  data collection and reporting on police incidents at VA facilities, and  enact other important measures to strengthen oversight and transparency  for VA's police program.   Madam Speaker, I thank my Republican co-lead, Representative  Radewagen, for joining me on this bill. I also thank Chairman Takano  and Ranking Member Bost for helping to bring H.R. 2429 to the floor  today.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan  legislation to help us better serve and protect our Nation's veterans.    Madam Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to support the  bill of the gentlewoman from New York (Miss Rice).   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 2726) to direct the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to  establish a plan to reduce the backlog of requests for information made  to the Department of Veterans Affairs pursuant to section 552 of title  5, United States Code, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2726         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``VA FOIA Reform Act of       2021''.       SEC. 2. PLAN FOR REDUCTION OF BACKLOG OF FOIA REQUESTS.         (a) Plan.--The Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall       establish and carry out a plan for the Secretary to meet, by       not later than five years after the date of the enactment of       this Act, the requirements of section 552 of title 5, United       States Code, with respect to providing documents and       information under such section within the timeframes required       by such section. The plan shall include the following:        (1) Improving and acquiring technology, including with       respect to searching email and other electronic information,       and the timelines for such improvement, to ensure that the       information technology of the Department of Veterans Affairs       is capable of carrying out the plan.        (2) Identification of efficient procedures, policies, and       systems of the Department that could be developed to allow       employees of the Department responsible for replying to       requests under such section 552 to search and review       documents rather than other employees of the Department.        (3) A schedule for carrying out the plan, including key       milestones and metrics.  [[Page H2779]]         (b) Compliance Assessment.--The Secretary shall request the       Director of the Office of Government Information Services of       the National Archives and Records Administration to conduct       an assessment of the compliance by the Department of Veterans       Affairs with section 552 of title 5, United States Code.        (c) Reports.--        (1) Initial report.--Not later than 180 days after the date       of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall submit to       the Committees on Veterans' Affairs of the House of       Representatives and the Senate a report on implementing       subsections (a) and (b). The report shall include the       following:        (A) The plan established under subsection (a).        (B) An analysis of the root causes of the backlog of FOIA       requests.        (C) Recommendations with respect to any additional       resources or legislative action the Secretary determines       necessary for such implementation.        (2) Annual reports.--During the five-year period following       the date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall       submit to the Committees on Veterans' Affairs of the House of       Representatives and the Senate annual reports on--        (A) carrying out the plan under subsection (a), including       any updates or changes made to the plan; and        (B) the compliance by the Department as described in       subsection (b).        (3) Publication.--The Secretary shall make publicly       available on the internet website of the Department the       reports under paragraphs (1) and (2) by not later than 30       days after the date on which the Secretary submits the       reports to the Committees on Veterans' Affairs of the House       of Representatives and the Senate.        (d) Backlog of FOIA Requests Defined.--In this section, the       term ``backlog of FOIA requests'' means the number of       requests, as reported by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to       the Attorney General in the Annual FOIA Report, made by       individuals to the Secretary pursuant to section 552 of title       5, United States Code, for documents or information that the       Secretary has not fulfilled or provided a response to the       individual.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and to insert extraneous material on H.R. 2726.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I am pleased to support H.R. 2726, the VA FOIA Reform  Act of 2021, introduced by Representative Gallego, a member of the  House Committee on Veterans' Affairs.   This bipartisan legislation is cosponsored by Representative Murphy  from North Carolina and would modernize the Department of Veterans  Affairs' Freedom of Information Act, or FOIA, process to help VA meet  statutory requirements and improve efficiency.   The FOIA process is essential for ensuring a transparent and  accountable VA by allowing the public insight into the workings of a  Department that serves millions of veterans each year. However, an  enduring backlog of open requests and out-of-date technology have made  it difficult for the Department to provide timely access to requested  information.   Madam Speaker, this bill would require VA to establish a plan in  order to meet all statutory FOIA requirements, identify its technology  needs, and carry out this plan within 5 years.   Veterans and their families, employees, and the public who have made  FOIA requests at VA have been kept waiting for too long. I hope this  bill puts VA on a path to providing FOIA information in a timely  manner.   Madam Speaker, H.R. 2726 was reported favorably by the committee, and  I ask my colleagues to support the bill.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Arizona (Mr. Gallego), my good friend, author of H.R. 2726, and a  member of the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs.    Madam Speaker, I would like to close by saying I urge all  of my colleagues to support the VA FOIA Reform Act of 2021. We need to  make sure that our veterans and their families get information that  they have requested from the VA in a timely manner.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 2545) to amend title 38, United States Code, to clarify the  role of doctors of podiatric medicine in the Department of Veterans  Affairs, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2545         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,  [[Page H2780]]            SECTION 1. ROLE OF DOCTORS OF PODIATRIC MEDICINE IN                     DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS.         (a) Clarification of Role.--Section 7306 of title 38,       United States Code, is amended--        (1) in subsection (a)--        (A) in paragraph (6), by striking ``a Director of Podiatric       Service,'';        (B) by redesignating paragraph (10) as paragraph (11); and        (C) by inserting after paragraph (9) the following new       paragraph:        ``(10) A Podiatric Medical Director, who shall be a       qualified doctor of podiatric medicine and who shall be       responsible to the Under Secretary for Health for the       operation of the Podiatric Service.'';        (2) in subsection (b)(1), by inserting ``podiatric       medicine,'' after ``doctors of medicine,''; and        (3) in subsection (c), by striking ``and (8)'' and       inserting ``(8), and (10)''.        (b) Clarification of Pay Grade.--Section 7404 of title 38,       United States Code, is amended--        (1) in subsection (a)(2), by inserting ``, podiatrists,''       after ``physicians'' ; and        (2) in subsection (b), in the first heading of the list       following the colon, by striking ``PODIATRIST'' and inserting       ``PODIATRIST (DPM)''.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H.R. 2545.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I am pleased to support H.R. 2545 to amend title 38,  United States Code, to clarify the role of doctors of podiatric  medicine in the Department of Veterans Affairs, and for other purposes.   H.R. 2545 is offered by former Veterans' Affairs Committee member,  Dr. Brad Wenstrup. This legislation seeks to clarify a technical error  affecting the Director of Podiatric Services which developed following  the inclusion of Dr. Wenstrup's VA Provider Equity Act in the MISSION  Act.   The renaming of the position to Podiatric Medical Director will  create equity by allowing this position holder to be paid on par with  their peers rather than below, which is currently the case.   If VA is to recruit top talent, we must ensure VA is able to offer  competitive salaries whenever possible, that is why I support this  legislation and I hope my colleagues will too.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I have no further speakers and I am  prepared to close.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to support the  legislation and join me in passing H.R. 2545, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 293) to direct the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to  establish qualifications for the human resources positions within the  Veterans Health Administration of the Department of Veterans Affairs,  and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 293         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``VA Hospitals Establishing       Leadership Performance Act''.       SEC. 2. QUALIFICATIONS FOR HUMAN RESOURCES POSITIONS WITHIN                     THE VETERANS HEALTH ADMINISTRATION OF THE                     DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS.         (a) Establishment of Qualifications.--Not later than 180       days after the date of the enactment of this Act, the       Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall--        (1) establish qualifications for each human resources       position within the Veterans Health Administration of the       Department of Veterans Affairs;        (2) establish standardized performance metrics for each       such position; and        (3) submit to Congress a report containing the       qualifications and standardized performance metrics       established under paragraphs (1) and (2).        (b) Report.--Not later than 180 days after the       establishment of the qualifications and performance metrics       under subsection (a), the Comptroller General of the United       States shall submit to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs of       the House of Representatives and the Committee on Veterans'       Affairs of the Senate a report containing--        (1) a description of the implementation of such       qualifications and performance metrics; and        (2) an assessment of the quality of such qualifications and       performance metrics.       SEC. 3. NO ADDITIONAL FUNDS AUTHORIZED.         No additional funds are authorized to be appropriated to       carry out the requirements of this Act. Such requirements       shall be carried out using amounts otherwise authorized to be       appropriated.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H.R. 293.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I am pleased to support H.R. 293, the VA Hospitals  Establishing Leadership Performance Act, introduced by our committee's  ranking member, Mr. Bost.   This bill would require VA to establish qualifications and  performance metrics for human resources positions within the Veterans  Health Administration. This legislation follows a 2017 Government  Accountability Office report that found human capital process  deficiencies, such as a lack of performance metrics for certain  positions.   GAO concluded that these deficiencies negatively affected VA's  ability to serve veterans. The legislation does not specify what  metrics VA must use, but leaves that determination up to VA.  Instituting these human resource management improvements at VA is a  commonsense, good-government step.   H.R. 293 was favorably reported by the committee, and I ask my  colleagues to join me in supporting the VA Hospitals Establishing  Leadership Performance Act.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  [[Page H2781]]         Madam Speaker, I have no further questions, and I am  prepared to close.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to join me in  passing H.R. 293, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 290) to amend title 38, United States Code, to render an  individual, who transfers certain educational assistance, to which the  individual is entitled because of an agreement by such individual to  serve in the Armed Forces, to a dependent of that individual, and who  fails to complete such agreement, solely liable for the overpayment of  such educational assistance, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 290         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SOLE LIABILITY FOR TRANSFERRED EDUCATIONAL                     ASSISTANCE BY AN INDIVIDUAL WHO FAILS TO                     COMPLETE A SERVICE AGREEMENT.         (a) In General.--Subsection (i) of section 3319 of title       38, United States Code, is amended--        (1) in paragraph (1)--        (A) by striking ``In the event'' and inserting ``Subject to       paragraph (2), in the event''; and        (B) by inserting ``of this title'' after ``section 3685'';        (2) in subparagraph (A) of paragraph (2)--        (A) in the heading, by striking ``In general'' and       inserting ``Sole liability''; and        (B) by inserting ``for which the individual shall be solely       liable to the United States for the amount of the overpayment       for purposes of section 3685 of this title'' before the       period at the end; and        (3) in subparagraph (B) of paragraph (2)--        (A) in the matter preceding clause (i), by striking       ``Subparagraph (A) shall not apply'' and inserting ``Neither       the individual nor the dependent shall be liable to the       United States for the amount of the overpayment for purposes       of section 3685 of this title''; and        (B) in clause (ii), by inserting ``of this title'' after       ``section 3311(c)(4)''.        (b) Reversion.--Effective October 1, 2024, such subsection       (i) is amended to read as it read on the day before the date       of the enactment of this Act.       SEC. 2. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS.         The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H.R. 290, as amended.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, the eligibility for veterans to transfer their earned  educational benefits is limited based on service time and commitments  to additional service time. Recently, there have been a number of cases  where DOD erroneously calculated servicemembers' time in service,  allowing the servicemember to transfer a benefit when they should not  have, as in the case of Russell Dotson.   In Mr. Dotson's case, he was told by the Navy that he was able to  transfer his benefit to his daughter. Unfortunately, the Navy was 6  days off in its calculation. That led to his daughter's GI Bill-covered  tuition at DePaul University being cut off. Now, she and her father, a  veteran who served 22 years and was honored for saving two lives in  Afghanistan, are left having to repay more than $20,000.   As a result of these errors, the veteran and their dependent are  saddled with a huge bill, that is overpayment, for the cost of  erroneously billed educational costs. The debt levied on the dependent  is costly and can ruin their credit before they enter the labor force,  which could impact their housing and job opportunities.   H.R. 290, as amended, limits liabilities to ensure that there aren't  surprise debts created by errors in paperwork. This legislation has  been supported by VSOs such as the VFW, American Legion, and the  Student Veterans of America.   Madam Speaker, I thank Ranking Member Bost for his work on this  issue. I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 290, as  amended, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I am  prepared to close.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I ask all of my colleagues to join me in  passing H.R. 290, as amended, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from New York for  his work. We are indeed friends. We both were teachers, Mr. Bowman a  principal. We are educators at heart.   To recover from one of the worst economic crises we have faced as a  Nation, we must invest in families, our care economy, and our Nation's  childcare.   For most American families, quality childcare and preschool are  [[Page H2809]]  unaffordable. In Riverside County, where my district, the 41st District  of California, is located, it is unavailable. My district is a  childcare desert. My constituents do not have childcare locations  available, even if eligible, to help them care for their children while  they attend school or work.   It doesn't have to be this way, and it shouldn't be this way. In  fact, we should use our path toward recovery as an opportunity to  address the disparities communities like mine have been facing when it  comes to affordable childcare options. The American Families Plan will  secure universal access to preschool and will expand the supply of  quality childcare options for all families.   Studies have proven that quality preschool will positively impact  children's cognitive, behavioral, and social-emotional development that  is critical for their long-term success and mental health. If we are  serious about investing in our children's education, we must provide  universal preschool and affordable childcare for every child in need.   Investing in preschool and affordable childcare will not only help  our children, but will also greatly benefit our workforce. As more  preschools and childcare centers are available, more families can get  back to work without worrying about their child's well-being.   This is our opportunity to help struggling families and take bold  action to create a just and equitable post-COVID economy. I urge my  colleagues to invest in our care economy by supporting the American  Families Plan Act.   We just can't go back to the way things were before. We have to be  bold and act with urgency to give families and parents access to the  resources they need to help our country bounce back stronger than ever  before.   Let me just close with a short anecdote, a short story. This happened  on the weekend, the Friday before the Memorial Day weekend. I, as  chairman of the Veterans' Affairs Committee, joined Secretary McDonough  in a ceremony to honor our Nation's veterans at the Quantico cemetery.  I met the commander of the base, who has responsibility not just for  the Marine base that is there but also the FBI training center. There  are a number of different facilities that are sort of associated with  the base.   We just got in a chat, and I wasn't fishing for any sort of answers  from him or any information. But I said: What has been your biggest  challenge, in terms of reopening your base?   He said: Congressman, quite surprisingly to me, the biggest challenge  has been childcare. That is what has held us back, and that has been my  biggest challenge as a base commander.   I said: Do you think other base commanders across the country have  had the same challenge?   He said: Yes.   This challenge of providing quality childcare and preschool is  something that is really holding our road to recovery back, and it is  slowing it down. The American Families Plan is a sound and substantive  answer to meeting this challenge.
