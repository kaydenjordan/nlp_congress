 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding.   Madam Speaker, this isn't the bill I would have written. I am  incredibly frustrated that Senate Republicans stalled negotiations  without offering any fixes to help get money into the hands of the  small businesses that are hardest hit.   Funding needs to get to legitimate small businesses quickly and  efficiently, not to big corporations.   Senate Republicans also rejected funding to help support State and  local governments that are on the tip of the spear in fighting this  pandemic.   With your help, Madam Speaker, we did get some improvements in this  bill, such as additional funding for hospitals and testing to help  respond to this crisis so we can eventually reopen our country, and  improvements to the PPP and the EIDL program, which were crucial.   Times are uncertain and people in my district are hurting. They need  relief now.   I will support this bill, but I look forward to future packages to  get the needed relief to our communities that need it the most.
