 Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to  the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Latta), who is the ranking member of the  Subcommittee on Communications and Technology.  [[Page H3516]]         Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  gentleman from Florida (Mr. Bilirakis), my friend and colleague.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Duncan).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  gentlewoman from Arizona (Mrs. Lesko), my colleague and a member of the  Energy and Commerce Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   I rise to oppose H.R. 3684 as a whole, and, in particular, the AQUA  Act. This is yet another partisan attempt at unnecessary and costly  legislation. These rush-to-spend bills are bad for rural America. They  are bad for my constituents.                                time  1845    Every Member in this Congress wants safe drinking water for their  communities and constituents. That is why we have already spent over $1  billion in the last 6 months on drinking water and on wastewater  assistance.   The additional tens of billions of dollars that this legislation will  spend is wasteful and gratuitous. Under this proposal, the EPA will be  tasked, for the first time, with administering a welfare program, which  will be worth $8 billion.   Worse yet, these bills restrict the rights of local and municipal  authorities to best meet their customers' needs. In this legislation,  local water utilities are prevented from taking action to collect  overdue payments for up to 5 years, regardless of the income level of  the offenders.   It would rescind flexibility for modest communities to have variances  for their small water systems.   Furthermore, it would repeal provisions in the Safe Drinking Water  Act that prohibit burdensome regulations where costs exceed benefits.   Unfortunately, this legislation yet again demonstrates the Democrats'  fixation on urban centers while leaving rural Americans behind.   For all of these reasons, I strongly urge my colleagues to join me in  voting ``no,'' and I yield back the balance of my time.
