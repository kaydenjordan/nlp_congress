 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  my pastor, Pastor Greg Shipe, of the First Baptist Church in  Bellefonte, Pennsylvania, who offered today's opening prayer in the  United States House of Representatives.   Pastor Shipe was ordained into ministry in 2009 and has served the  congregation of First Baptist Church since 2011. I am fortunate to be a  member of the First Baptist Church congregation.   When he is not behind the pulpit, Pastor Shipe serves as the chaplain  to the Logan Fire Company and coaches recreational youth soccer and  baseball.   Pastor Shipe and his wife, Connie, are also busy raising six  children. They are active foster parents as well. They use their  experience to mentor other foster parents in Centre County and beyond.   As a foster mentor, Pastor Shipe also serves on the board of Keystone  Family Alliance, a bridge ministry helping to connect churches to  foster agencies, to equip them in caring for children, and to provide  resources to local agencies and foster families.    Mr. Speaker, Pastor Shipe and his family continue to inspire those in  our congregation, as well as the entire community, and I am thankful  for my pastor and this mighty man of God.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  World Autism Month and the efforts of north central Pennsylvanians in  supporting those with autism.   In America today, 1 in 36 children will be diagnosed with autism  spectrum disorder beginning in their first years of life. Although  several factors may influence the development of autism, each person  with an autism diagnosis requires unique support.   In Clarion and Venango Counties, Autism Tough Foundation works to  raise awareness and support for autism through numerous sensory-free  events each year. This month, more than 100 students at Keystone High  School joined Autism Tough Foundation to raise awareness in their first  Walk for Autism.   Meanwhile, neighboring Potter County is one of the first in  Pennsylvania to equip county agencies with sensory kits to aid in  communication and expressive language. Potter County is also home to  Jasmine Floof, a service dog who specializes in assisting those with  autism focus their attention and manage anxiety when accessing county  services.   This World Autism Month, I commend Potter County and Autism Tough  Foundation for leading the State in supporting people with autism in  their everyday lives.                            ____________________
