 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  congratulate Illinois State University's Mennonite College of Nursing  on celebrating 100 years of excellence in nursing education.   Founded on January 23, 1919, the Mennonite Sanitarium Training School  had a vision of training the Nation's best nurses. In 1982, they grew  to become the Mennonite College of Nursing, thereby offering  undergraduate degrees for the very first time.   In 1995, they added a graduate degree; and in 1999, the college  became part of Illinois State University, where it has expanded to  include even more academic offerings, including a doctorate degree.   Today, the ISU Mennonite College of Nursing boasts a state-of-the-art  simulation lab and a 10,000-square-foot facility to provide students  with hands-on experience in real-life situations with patient  simulators.   As the husband of a nurse who is a former nurse educator, I am proud  of the strong legacy of ISU's Mennonite College of Nursing and their  commitment to educating future generations of nurses just like these  students here. I commend them on their century of leadership and look  forward to the many achievements to come.                            ____________________
