 Madam Speaker, I rise today in honor and recognition of  Constitution Day, which is this Sunday.   On September 17, 1787, the Constitutional Convention met for the last  time to sign what would become the most important document in our  country's history, the Constitution of the United States of America.   On Constitution Day, we remember the bravery and wisdom of the 39 men  who signed the supreme law of the land. This document forever altered  the world and has dutifully guided our country through times of change  and challenge.   As we look back on its legacy and the values it holds for our  country, let Constitution Day serve as a reminder that we are here to  serve and to protect the liberties of we the people.                            ____________________
