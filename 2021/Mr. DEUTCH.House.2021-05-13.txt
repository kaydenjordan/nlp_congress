 Mr. Speaker, moral clarity--that is what this moment  calls for. Terrorists launch rockets at civilians and launch rockets  from schools and hospitals, putting kids at risk. They use humans as  shields.   Hamas is a terrorist organization sworn to wiping out the only Jewish  state on Earth, and the House of Representatives previously declared it  shall be the policy of the United States to officially and publicly  condemn Hamas for violating the international law of armed conflict by  exploiting civilians.   Democracies, on the other hand, act to limit civilian casualties and  do everything they can to defend their own citizens. Israel is a  democracy. It is the only Jewish state in the world, and our friend and  ally in Israel has a right to defend her citizens.   At this moment as more than 1,750 rockets rain down on Israel, we  must stand with our ally and stand against Hamas terrorism.   Please don't be fooled by false choices: Israel or Hamas.   But if I am asked to choose between a terrorist organization and our  democratic ally, I will stand with Israel  [[Page H2299]]  every day of the week, and so will you, and so will you, and so will  you.   Mr. Speaker, America stands with Israel.                            ____________________
