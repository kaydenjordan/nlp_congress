 Madam Speaker, in the Northwest Bronx, in Washington  Heights, Inwood, in Harlem and East Harlem, this pandemic is still  ravaging Black and Brown lives. The economic plight this virus will  leave will be unprecedented.   I am glad we are providing $60 billion for small businesses and  fought for funding for hospitals and testing, but we must come back.   Mitch McConnell's words are equivalent to Gerald Ford's words: Drop  dead, New York.   But we will come back.   We must support State and local governments. We must support our  communities. Our people are dying.
