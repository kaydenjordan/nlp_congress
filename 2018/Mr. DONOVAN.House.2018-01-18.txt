 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to demand action from our  Chinese counterparts in targeting fentanyl traffickers. This poison is  50 times more powerful than heroin and is responsible for thousands of  American deaths.   Street dealers import fentanyl from China and then mix it with heroin  and deal it on unsuspecting users in packages stamped with names such  as ``Pray for Death.'' That product was confiscated in my hometown  yesterday in Staten Island.   These mixes of deadly substances is why, as the gentleman mentioned,  I introduced the Comprehensive Fentanyl Control Act, asking our country  to prohibit the online sale of presses in which fentanyl is pressed  into these imitation tablets that unsuspecting users will take,  unknowing that fentanyl is part of that pill.   Fentanyl is dangerous even to our authorities. Police officers,  firefighters, first responders have overdosed from contact with  fentanyl during drug busts. I have spoken to far too many families who  have lost sons and daughters, first as the district attorney of Staten  Island and now as a Congressman.   The Chinese Government, as my colleagues have said, tries to control  their own citizens. Well, now it is about time they control the  fentanyl that is coming out of their country.   This past fall, President Trump extracted promises that the Chinese  would curb their export of fentanyl. Now it is time for the Chinese to  take action.   I thank the gentleman from Florida for his leadership in this area. I  thank him for yielding to me to discuss this important matter to every  part of our country. No one is immune from it.
