 Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 1215, which should be more  accurately called the taking away access to care and justice act. This  bill will do nothing to strengthen patient protections and will make  careless healthcare providers less accountable.   It will severely limit when an injured person is allowed to bring a  healthcare lawsuit by shortening the time that injured people have to  seek relief. It will also impose a one-size-fits-all cap on how much  compensation victims of medical malpractice can receive for pain and  suffering, regardless of the severity of a person's injury--in order to  benefit insurance companies and wrongdoers.   This cap even applies to intentional acts of misconduct. This bill  would unfairly limit a patient suing a healthcare provider for sexual  assault, as well as a veteran who has received substandard medical  care. The bill is written so broadly, it shields both negligent doctors  and manufacturers of dangerous drugs and medical devices from  liability.   H.R. 1215 is before us at a time when Republicans in the Senate are  working hard to pass a bill that eliminates health coverage for 22  million people in order to give the wealthiest Americans and insurance  companies a huge tax cut. The American people deserve better than this.   Our legal and healthcare system should work for the benefit of  hardworking Americans, the people we represent, not for the powerful  special interests. Republicans are chomping at the bit for the  opportunity to eliminate health coverage for honest, hardworking  Americans and are making deep cuts to Medicaid just so they can give  the richest people in this country a $600 billion tax cut.   And now, they want to prevent injured people from getting justice  when they are hurt. Middle class families need to see that we are on  their side. They don't need bills like H.R. 1215, which will rig the  healthcare and justice systems against them.   I strongly urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on H.R. 1215.    Mr. Speaker, yesterday, Senate Republicans delayed a  vote on their bill to repeal the Affordable Care Act. This is a bill  that Republicans wrote in secret. They allowed no input from the public  or members of the Democratic Caucus, yet they still could not find the  votes to pass their bill.   Maybe that is because it eliminates health insurance for 22 million  Americans; it imposes an age tax on older Americans; it allows  insurance companies to discriminate based on preexisting conditions; it  slashes Medicaid and leaves Medicare to wither on the vine. But no  matter the reason, the lesson is clear: it is time for Republicans to  give up on their effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act.   The American people are benefiting from this law. Seniors like that  they are saving money on prescriptions. Parents like that their kids  can stay on their plan until they are 26. Workers like that their  employers have to offer healthcare coverage.   It is not perfect, but let's work together to approve the Affordable  Care Act to make sure it works even better for the American people.  Democrats are willing to do that. If Republicans will give up the idea  of repeal, we can work together to make the Affordable Care Act even  better. Let's get this done for our constituents and the American  people.                            ____________________
