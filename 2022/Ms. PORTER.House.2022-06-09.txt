 Madam Speaker, all government officials must be held  accountable, especially those entrusted with the power to interpret our  country's laws.   Repeated scandals and lax ethics requirements for Federal judges are  eroding Americans' confidence in the impartiality of our courts.   When judges and Justices preside over cases that affect their  individual stock portfolios or don't disclose their connections to  special interests, they jeopardize the rule of law.   The American people should not have to question if cases are being  decided fairly. We need stronger ethics rules to prevent these abuses  of power from happening again.   I am backing legislation that will root out corruption, prevent  conflicts of interest, and increase transparency in all three branches  of the Federal Government.   To restore public trust in our institutions, we must hold government  officials to the highest ethical standards. No one is above the law.                            ____________________
