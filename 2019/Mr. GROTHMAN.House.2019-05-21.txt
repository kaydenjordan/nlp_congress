 Madam Speaker, I rise today to address what I think is  the most pressing issue in America right now. But prior to addressing  it, I yield to the gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. Foxx).      Congratulating Samaritan's Purse on New Ministry Center in North                         Wilkesboro, North Carolina     Madam Speaker, prior to addressing the immigration  crisis, which is the biggest problem, I think, facing America today,  after hearing a rather lengthy speech before mine, I was analyzing the  well here and noticing the flag of the United States of America behind  me. As I am looking at that flag, I couldn't help but think about the  Pledge of Allegiance.   The Pledge of Allegiance begins: ``I pledge allegiance to the Flag of  the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it  stands.''  [[Page H4059]]    I pondered why that Pledge of Allegiance refers to this country as a  republic instead of a democracy of which it stands. I think it would be  a good thing for the other Congressmen up here to think about that as  well.   There have been several versions of the Pledge of Allegiance. In each  one of the versions, while there are changes made, it refers to our  country as a republic instead of a democracy. We should wonder why that  is, and I think every Congressman should read up on the difference.   Now, the reason I am here today is to discuss what I think is the  biggest problem in the United States of America, the one thing we have  to deal with in the immediate future and something that I believe does  not grab the attention of Congress the way it should, and that is the  immigration crisis.   One more time, another month will go by, and another 100,000 people  will enter this country not at the designated points of entry. We  believe another 10,000 people will enter at the points of entry and  claim asylum, whether they actually need asylum or not.   No country can afford to have over 100,000 people pour into that  country month after month after month without being appropriately  vetted, stepping in line ahead of the people who are doing what is  appropriate to become a citizen of the United States or appropriate to  get a work visa in the United States.   Ultimately, this will destroy our country, and it is something that  this Congress should be dealing with immediately.   I think it is a little embarrassing, hearing all the other speeches  up here and no speeches about the immigration crisis.   I want to point out, neither I nor President Trump wants to reduce  the 700,000 people who are sworn in as citizens in this country every  year, neither do we want to deal with the 4 million work permits that  people in this country already have. Neither are they overly concerned  that we, right now, have the highest number of foreign-born people in  this country as a percentage of our total population since World War I.   Now, what are we going to do about this crisis? Because, obviously,  be it culturally, be it fiscally, we cannot allow this to go on any  further.   The first thing I think President Trump should do is end birthright  citizenship. To say that if you come here, and particularly given that  we allow entire families to stay once somebody is a citizen, to  continue to allow the situation to happen in which, if you come here,  whether you come in not at a designated point of entry, whether you  come here flying in on a jet plane, in the United States of America, a  newly born child becomes a citizen.   We and Canada are the only two countries of the 40 wealthiest  countries in the world per capita that allow this birthright  citizenship to continue.   I know President Trump understands this problem very well. He  understands very well, as some Members of Congress do not, that the  amendment to the Constitution that talks about people being born in  this country becoming citizens was meant to deal with slavery, not  meant to deal with anybody who comes here.   I strongly urge President Trump to step up and do something that he  talked about doing during his campaign, and that is ending birthright  citizenship.   In addition to the fact that it is wrong on its face, as long as you  have birthright citizenship, it encourages people to come here, even  illegally, knowing that if they have a child here, it will create a  situation in which there is a good chance the rest of the family will  follow.   The next thing I think we can do is put immigration judges on the  border. Right now, people are showing up, and they are asking for  asylum. They are given a court date 5 years down the line.   Well, who knows whether they will be around in 5 years. They probably  will not show up for the court date at that time.   I strongly encourage President Trump to put judges on the border so  we can immediately judge whether these people are entitled to asylum or  not.   The next thing, along the same lines, I strongly encourage the Border  Patrol to be trained to judge credible fear. Again, we believe that  there are people coming from other countries who claim they have a  credible fear who do not meet that standard as far as coming to the  United States. We know that people are being coached as to what to say  to come into this country. By training our Border Patrol to deal with  these issues, we will not have so many people coming into the country  illegally.    The next thing I strongly think that President Trump should do is he  should have ICE round up the million people who already have orders to  be deported. This should be a relatively simple matter. By deporting  some people, it sends the message to people in other countries that the  United States will take our immigration laws seriously.   Today, to a certain extent, because far too many politicians are  encouraging things like sanctuary cities, getting rid of ICE, talking  about giving public benefits to people who are here illegally, it is  not surprising that people in other countries are getting the message  that the United States does not treat its immigration laws seriously.   The next thing I think we ought to do is I hope President Trump  expedites the rule in the Department of Homeland Security dealing with  allowing for removal of people who are taking advantage of public  assistance.                                time  1900    Obviously, the United States cannot become the welfare magnet for the  entire Western Hemisphere. Everybody knows that, while it is frequently  illegal, many people who are here illegally are taking advantage of  public assistance, and we should expedite the legal ability to remove  these people.   I would like to take a pause here to congratulate Secretary Ben  Carson for removing illegals from public housing.   I will point out something a lot of people don't know. Frequently,  under Section 8 or, even more, under section 42, the housing assistance  they get from the government gives people housing that is superior to  what many of the working people get. It is even more ridiculous when  people who are here illegally get housing superior to what many of the  native-born people in this country who rent are receiving.   So I would like to thank Secretary Carson for having the ability to  step up and begin to take a stand on the idea that, if you come here  illegally, you should get free or reduced housing.   The next thing I would like to see this House take up is sanctuary  cities. I have introduced H.R. 516, which takes away grants from State  and local units of government that become sanctuary cities.   There are a variety of problems with sanctuary cities. First of all,  it encourages people to go to those cities to get some sort of welfare  benefit.   Secondly, whenever a mayor or a Governor wants to declare their city  or State a sanctuary city, it sends the message that the United States  is not going to enforce its immigration laws. As long as that message  is out here, people will continue to flow into our country, and it will  eventually be the end of the United States.   The next thing I want this body to do is pass H.R. 848, another bill  of mine. The purpose of that bill is to increase the verification for  compliance on any welfare benefits which people who are not in this  country could be receiving. We are also saying that anybody who is not  a citizen of this country should not receive any public assistance,  which should be common sense.   If you are coming here for an opportunity and you are not able to  find a job, even if you are coming here legally, the answer is not to  have the American taxpayer who is already $23 trillion in debt pick up  the tab. The answer is, if you cannot find opportunity in this country,  return to your country of origin.   I hope this body, which is spending so much time dealing with less  important issues, takes up this bill in the near future.   Finally, I ask President Trump to continue to work towards the wall.  I ask this Congress, as we move appropriation bills out, to make sure  that wall is funded.   I have been down on the border. I did not find any Border Patrol  agents who were embarrassed to do their job or didn't want to do their  job. The Border Patrol agents that I talked to on the Arizona-Mexico  border felt we desperately needed a wall. They realize  [[Page H4060]]  that walls work in other countries, and they realize that in the long-  or even in the short-term, walls would save us a lot of money.   Right now, different estimates vary between $50 billion, $100 billion  a year is lost because of illegal immigration. Given the cost of a wall  would be under $10 billion, it would be a big cost savings. And for a  country that is $23 trillion in debt, we need big cost savings.   In any event, those are suggestions of some of the things we can do  to deal with this crisis.   Think about it: 100,000 people coming here every month, people  unvetted, people who may wind up on welfare, people who may wind up  having a criminal record, and all coming here skipping ahead in line of  those people who have sometimes waited 5 or 10 years to come here  legally, which is incredibly unfair to them.   In any event, I hope Congress begins to act on these measures. I  encourage President Trump to make border enforcement his number one  priority over the next couple months, because we can see it. It is very  difficult to remove any of these people once they come to this country.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
