 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 1028, I call  up the bill (H.R. 2) to authorize funds for Federal-aid highways,  highway safety programs, and transit programs, and for other purposes,  and ask for its immediate consideration in the House.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  insert extraneous material on H.R. 2.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, our Nation is simultaneously confronted with multiple  crises. COVID, we have passed four bills in this House to deal with  COVID directly in terms of medical care, potential for vaccines,  treatments, and mitigation of the incredible economic harm. The fourth  bill is still lingering with an uncertain future in the Senate.   Then the murder of George Floyd brought a long-simmering crisis to a  head for our Nation. Last week this House passed the Justice in  Policing Act to deal with systemic racism in policing.   This bill deals with another crisis. Denied by the President and  denied by most in his party is the existential threat of climate change  to the world as we know it, to our Nation, to our coastal areas, to our  inland areas, to everything, our crops, our future, our children's  future and our grandkids' future.   So before us today is a long overdue transportation, comprehensive,  21st century--the first 21st century--transportation bill that moves  beyond the Eisenhower era and just reauthorizing the same old programs  all the time. It also deals with the incredibly deteriorated  infrastructure in this country. There is bipartisan agreement that it  needs investment. But the last bill we did in the House was status quo  funding. We need to invest much more to begin to deal with that crisis.   This bill also deals with the other crises. It deals with COVID in  terms of we are going to need an economic recovery. This is going to  look a lot more like--it already does--the Great Depression, and we are  going to need to put people back to work. We are going to need millions  of good-paying jobs. These aren't just construction jobs, they are  design, they are engineering, they are small businesses, and they are  manufacturing. There is a host of people--everybody will be touched by  this bill, and the investments will provide returns many, many times  over.   It also targets the largest single contributor to CO2  pollution in this country. Now, Mr. Speaker, if you don't believe in  climate change and you don't believe CO2 is the problem,  then you don't want to deal with it in a transportation bill. In fact,  an alternative was offered by my Republican colleagues in committee  where we considered 300 amendments. They had one that was a substitute.  It wouldn't reduce carbon pollution by 1 ounce.   There is no crisis, there is no climate change. Donald Trump said so,  and you can't cross the guy.   So we wove the climate change provisions throughout this bill. They  complained: Well, it is not bipartisan. But we have a disagreement in  principle, and you can't compromise on principle.   We are going to deal with the largest source of carbon pollution in  the United States of America here and now, today, this week. We are  starting. We have delayed too long. We are already at dangerous levels.   It also is going to deal with systemic racism and discrimination in  the parts of the bill that deal with education, housing, and access to  transportation, but in one particular provision that is critical to the  Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, the disadvantaged business  enterprise program. The committee has for years accumulated evidence  and testimony attesting to systemic discrimination faced by women and  minorities in their attempts to establish, grow, and operate businesses  all across the country.   The challenges are daunting. Discrimination affects minority and  women entrepreneurs at every stage of the process from access to  investment, to credit, to biased treatment from customers, suppliers,  and regulators, to acute vulnerability to sudden economic downturns as  we have seen with the COVID crisis.   Unfortunately, even with the existing DBE program, discrimination  still haunts us in the market to construct and maintain our Federal  transportation system. We have documented this in testimony, and today  we have and will provide mounds of statistical evidence documenting  this.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a list of 30 cities.

Finally, Mr. Speaker, we get to the issue at hand, the  INVEST in America Act which is the core of this infrastructure package.  It is the biggest part, but there are many other very important things.   The President, as a candidate, campaigned on infrastructure. That  gave us some bipartisan hope. We met with him a year ago last March at  the White House:   He asked the Speaker: Well, Nancy, what are you thinking?   She said: Well, $1 trillion to $1.3 trillion.   The President said: No. No. $2 trillion.   Okay. He bid us up.   We said: Good. We could spend that money productively.   Then we said: Okay, what do we define as infrastructure?   Here is what the list was: highways, bridges, transit, rail,  wastewater, drinking water and broadband.   Those things are in this package at near the level that he asked  because his number was a 10-year number for $2 trillion. We are close  to $1 trillion with those things in this package.   So there have been seven infrastructure weeks under the Trump  administration. The only product they have produced that directly  addresses transportation infrastructure are their annual budgets, each  of which has proposed dramatic cuts in investment in transportation  infrastructure. Never, never--we have heard they are on the cusp for  producing a $1 trillion bill, now it is a $2 trillion bill.   Where is it?   Where is the alternative?   If it is their alternative, then it is status quo funding and nothing  that deals with climate change. I don't know where it is. This is the  beginning of the real infrastructure week.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2, the Moving Forward  Act.   America's infrastructure is in crisis. As Chair of the Transportation  and Infrastructure Committee, I've been sounding the alarm for some  time now about the need to make massive investments in our crumbling  infrastructure so we create jobs and safer, smarter transportation  systems, and so we can cut the carbon pollution that is taking an  enormous toll on the public health of our families and our planet.   Given what we've seen over the past few months--from a global  pandemic and the resulting economic collapse, to the urgent need to  address generations of structural and systematic racism--it has never  been so apparent that we need bold action to rebuild America.   I'd like to take a moment to discuss one reason why this Moving  Forward Act is so important. This bill once again reauthorizes the  urgently needed Disadvantaged Business Enterprise, or DBE, program at  the Department of Transportation.   In case it's not obvious to the casual observer, discrimination is  alive and well in this country. The death of George Floyd at the hands  of Minneapolis police, the ensuing protests, and the police response-- these events have all shed more light on the large disparities  minorities face in our criminal justice system.   Unfortunately, those disparities are not limited to the criminal  justice system. For many years this Committee, and other Members of  Congress, have gathered evidence and testimony attesting to systemic  discrimination faced by women and minorities in their attempts to  establish, grow and operate businesses all across the country. The  challenges are daunting, and discrimination affects minority and women  entrepreneurs at every stage of the process, from access to investment  dollars and credit, to biased treatment from customers, suppliers and  regulators, to acute vulnerability to sudden economic downturns such as  we've seen in the face of Covid-19.   Unfortunately, even with the DBE Program, discrimination still haunts  us in the market to construct and maintain our federal surface  transportation system. We hear about it from constituents and others  who work as contractors in the transportation industry. We've read  about it in personal statements submitted by women- and minority- small  business owners from across the country. And we see it reflected in  mounds of statistical evidence compiled by my Committee. This evidence  includes many thousands of pages of rigorous statistical analysis  demonstrating clear disparities between the capacity of minority- and  women-owned businesses to compete for Federal dollars, and the  utilization of that capacity by Federal contractors.   Today, I'd like to submit just a sample of this evidence to the  Congressional Record in support of the reauthorization of this  essential program.   The Moving Forward Act is a game-changer--because it's an investment  in workers, families, and communities.   As Chair of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, I'm  particularly focused on investing in our roads, bridges, transit, rail,  and water systems.   In the Moving Forward Act, we do that by modernizing the crumbling  roads and bridges we already have.   We address bottlenecks and gridlock, while building out the  infrastructure for low- and zero-emission vehicles and encourage  transit-oriented housing.   We give people better and more reliable public transit options,  whether you're trying to get across town on a bus or on light-rail, or  going hundreds or even thousands of miles on Amtrak.   We encourage smarter road designs to bring down the sharp rise in  pedestrian and cyclist deaths, and make sure our roads are safer in  rural areas and for kids who need safe routes to school.   We invest in new technologies, projects, and construction materials  that are efficient and resilient--so that when we build a new bridge,  we know it will last for decades, not just until the next extreme  weather event.   In summary, the INVEST in America Act, which is the centerpiece of  the Moving Forward framework, provides nearly $500 billion over five  years to bring our nation's crumbling infrastructure to a state of good  repair, improve resiliency, address climate change, improve safety and  provide investments in both rural and low-income communities who need  it most.   Add to that the $1 trillion in additional investment in schools,  housing, broadband access, drinking and wastewater infrastructure,  airports, ports and more, and you have a package that will make a huge  impact on our economy.   This is exactly the kind of investment we need to help our economy  recover from the current pandemic. I hope my colleagues will join me in  supporting this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, as I mentioned previously, H.R. 2 once again  reauthorizes the urgently needed Disadvantaged Business Enterprise, or  DBE, program at the Department of Transportation.   Unfortunately, even with the DBE Program, discrimination still haunts  us in the market to construct and maintain our federal surface  transportation system. We hear about it from constituents and others  who work as contractors in the transportation industry. We've read  about it in personal statements submitted by women- and minority- small  business owners from across the country. And we see it reflected in  mounds of statistical evidence compiled by my Committee. This evidence  includes many thousands of pages of rigorous statistical analysis  demonstrating clear disparities between the capacity of minority- and  women-owned businesses to compete for Federal dollars, and the  utilization of that capacity by Federal contractors.   These studies represent thousands of pages of complex rigorous  analysis by many different authors in every region of our nation. And  while the findings are better than in the early days of the DBE  program, we still have a long way to go. I'd like to just highlight a  tiny fraction of the information found in these studies:   Just so my colleagues don't think I am picking on their states, let  me start with Oregon. The 2016 ODOT Disparity Study found that women-  and minority-owned firms only won 61 cents on the dollar of what we  would expect given their availability on state and federally funded  highway contracts. Non-minority women, African Americans and Native  Americans did even worse at 52 cents, 58 cents and 49 cents  respectively. (Oregon Department of Transportation 2016 Availability  and Disparity Study, Keen Independent Research, June, 2016, at 7-12.)   In Texas DOT spending, women and minority own firms as a group won  only 60 cents on  [[Page H2920]]  the dollar of what we might have expected for state-funded  transportation projects given their availability in the market. Non- minority women, African Americans, Hispanic Americans and Native  Americans all did worse. Indeed, African Americans won only 22 cents on  the dollar and Native Americans won only 18 cents on the dollar. The  numbers were even worse when considering only federal funds--32 cents  on the dollar when considering FHWA contracts alone. Texas Department  of Transportation Disparity Study 2019, Colette Holt & Associates,  2019, at 94, 126.   For Maryland, which has had one of the more robust and continuously  operated DBE programs in the nation, DBEs still get only 70 cents on  the dollar of combined federal and state transportation funding. For  African Americans, the number is 50 cents, for Native Americans it's 43  cents and for non-minority women, the number is 56 cents. Disadvantaged  Business Enterprise Disparity Study, Volumes 1-3, Prepared for the  State of Maryland, NERA Economic Consulting, June 25, 2018, at Vol. 1,  p. 224.   Sadly, in the transit industry, things are not much better. For  instance, a recent analysis of contracting for the Los Angeles,  California Metropolitan Transportation Authority, found that firms  owned by women and minorities make about 74 cents on the dollar of what  we would expect given their representation in the marketplace. For non- minority women, the number was 59 cents and for African Americans it  was 51 cents. 2017 Disparity Study LA Metro, prepared for the Los  Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (LA Metro), BBC  Research & Consulting, January, 2018, at 7-6.   These same troubling statistics are repeated in cities and states  that spend some of their budgets on surface transportation and similar  construction and architecture and engineering projects. For instance,  the 2018 study for the Nashville, Tennessee area found that M/WBEs got  54 cents of every one dollar in construction prime contracting that we  would expect given their availability in the market. Asian American  firms were at 25 cents on the dollar. Firms owned by Hispanic Americans  earned only 1 cent of every dollar we would expect for them receive  given their marketplace availability. Metro Nashville Tennessee  Disparity Study Final Report, Griffin and Strong, P.C., August, 2018,  at 83.   There's no doubt that things are better today than before the DBE  Program--more firms owned by women and minorities get work than they  did forty years ago. But the progress has been slow, halting and  exceedingly fragile. One of the powerful things about the disparity  study evidence we have collected is the diversity of approaches and  analyses these documents provide. Some studies, for instance, not only  study disparities and in the public and private surface transportation  markets, but they also attempt to analyze what might occur if the DBE  program no longer existed. One interesting example is found in the LA  Metro study where they compared the participation of minority- and  women-owned firms on contracts that had goals to encourage diverse  participation and those that did not. The results are stunning: on  contracts with goals, participation occurred at almost the level we  would expect given the presence of minority- and women-owned firms in  the marketplace; on contracts with goals, firms owned by minorities and  women earned 96 cents on the dollar--on contracts without goals, they  earned 53 cents on the dollar. The numbers are even more startling for  certain subgroups: on contracts with goals, non-minority women actually  exceeded parity (something that regularly occurs for firms owned by  non-minority males, but rarely happens for firms owned by women and  minorities). But on contracts without goals, firms owned by nonminority  women earned only 37 cents on the dollar. Firms owned by Hispanic  Americans approached parity on contracts with goals (98 cents on the  dollar) but on contracts without goals, they earned only 59 cents on  the dollar. African American owned firms earned only 64 cents on the  dollar even on contracts with goals, and on contracts without goals the  number plummeted to 30 cents on the dollar. 2017 Disparity Study LA  Metro, prepared for the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation  Authority (LA Metro), BBC Research & Consulting, January, 2018, at 7-7.   The DBE program, and the businesses it assists, are so important that  we planned to hold a hearing on this program before the Covid-19  pandemic swept the country and shut down Congressional operations for a  time. We will still hold that hearing at a later date to collect even  more evidence and discuss the possibility of updating this program. But  sadly, the pandemic that prevented us from doing so only underscores  the need. Current data on the pandemic's economic devastation shows a  massively disproportionate impact on small businesses in minority  communities. A very recent article by Dr. Robert Fairlie published by  the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research, uses statistics  from the Census Bureau's Current Population Survey to illustrate just  how devastating the Covid pandemic has already been for firms owned by  minorities and women. His analysis examines the drop in ``active  businesses'' comparing the numbers from mid-February, just before the  effects of the pandemic became clear in the United States, to mid-April  when the economy in much of the country had shut down. During that  time, all businesses experienced economic devastation--but because of  discrimination, the devastation was far greater for businesses owned by  women and minorities. For instance, during this period the number of  active businesses owned by whites dropped a staggering 17 percent, but  the number of businesses owned by African Americans dropped an almost  unimaginable 41 percent. For Latinx businesses, the number was 32  percent and for firms owned by Asian Americans the drop was 26 percent.  These numbers are not just troubling, they are catastrophic, and the  pandemic is far from over. The Impact of Covid-19 on Small Business  Owners: Evidence of Early State Losses from the April 2020 Current  Population Survey, Robert Fairlie, Stanford Institute for Economic  Policy Research, Working Paper 20-022, May 23, 2020, at 3-5.   Now, more than ever, as we prepare to spend billions of federal  dollars on transportation projects, it is urgent that we ensure the  process of awarding federal transportation contract dollars is not  discriminatory, and that minorities and women are allowed to compete on  an equal playing field for those dollars.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Massachusetts (Mr. Neal).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New  Jersey (Mr. Pallone), the chairman of the Committee of Energy and  Commerce.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 30 seconds.   Mr. Speaker, to the gentleman, I would have him recognize that,  actually, the Northeast Corridor is a shared corridor, freight and  rail. When the Baltimore tunnel goes or when the Portal Bridge goes or,  up around New York, when the Gateway tunnels go, it is a 20 percent hit  to the national economy.   So, yes, we are going to invest some money there. That stop is about  to fail and fail big.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr.  Scott), the chair of the Committee on Education and Labor.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  New York (Mrs. Carolyn B. Maloney).    Mr. Speaker, resiliency, which they keep talking about  on that side, is a reactive policy to help our transportation system  survive with rising sea levels and extreme weather events. Mitigation,  dealing with climate change, is proactive and will prevent us from  having to spend a lot more money in the future on infrastructure.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Washington,  D.C.  [[Page H2924]]  (Ms. Norton), the chair of the Surface Transportation Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Mississippi (Mr. Thompson), the chairman of the Homeland Security  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Lipinski), chair of the Railroads, Pipelines, and  Hazardous Materials Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New  Jersey (Mr. Sires), a member of the committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from the  Northern Mariana Islands (Mr. Sablan).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, just in response to the gentleman, 93 percent of Federal  aid, highway projects, go forward under categorical exclusion; 4  percent have an environmental analysis, a simple process; and, yes, 3  percent go through a NEPA process. Huge construction projects in urban  areas are often controversial, gives the public and everybody a chance  to have input into that.   And, by the way, all the studies say the biggest barrier to  transportation investment is lack of funding. And I would note that the  FAST bill froze funding, and the bill before that froze funding. The  last time we increased funding was when the Democrats were in charge in  1994.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr.  Johnson).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Nevada (Ms. Titus), a member of the committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute.   I didn't see anybody in golf carts or T-shirts. They were on the  screen, virtually. And it is not a great time to be flying back and  forth across the country. I am not really comfortable doing it.   I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from California (Mr. Huffman).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), the distinguished majority leader.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Massachusetts (Mr. Lynch), a member of the committee.    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time remains on both  sides.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  South Carolina (Mr. Clyburn), the majority whip.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Brown).

Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New  Jersey (Mr. Malinowski), a member of the committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Arizona (Mr. Stanton), a member of the committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Florida (Ms. Mucarsel-Powell), who is also a member of the committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Garcia).    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from New Hampshire (Mr. Pappas), a member of the committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewomen from  Minnesota (Ms. Craig), who is a member of the committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Waters), who is the chair of the Financial Services  Committee and who has a major section of the bill before us.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Lamb), who is a member of the committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Pelosi). Nancy D'Alesandro Pelosi is the Speaker of the  United States House of Representatives.    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time each side has  remaining.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Ohio (Ms. Kaptur).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New  Jersey (Mr. Pascrell), a soft-spoken Member of Congress.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  California (Mr. McNerney).    Mr. Speaker, I would like to inquire as to the amount of  time remaining.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, just in response to the gentleman, he had a duplicative  amendment on resilience. There is $6.25 billion for predisaster  mitigation resilience in this bill. But again, building in resilience  is only dealing with the effects of climate change, not reducing  climate change.   He said: Oh, we should just throw up our hands because the Chinese  are polluting the hell out of things.   Oh, that is a great attitude. The U.S. used to be a leader on these  policies until Trump came to the White House and said it is a hoax, and  that sort of unleashed China and other countries. He said the U.S. is  out of the Paris Agreement. That unleashed China and these other  countries.   But we can deal with it. We can deal with it in our trade policy. We  can put a huge tax on imports that are contributing to fossil fuel  pollution.   We can deal with this, and we should deal with this as a nation, but  we need to show leadership again in this area.   Then he talked about there is nothing for electricity in this bill-- and he can come down later for the debate on the E&C section. There is  a massive investment on renewables, a massive investment in  transmission in this bill. So that is not quite accurate.   And the user fee, guess what? We have been in a shortfall on the user  fee for about two decades. The last time we increased the user fee was  when we had a Republican over there with guts named Bud Shuster, who  stood up to Newt Gingrich and joined with the majority of Democrats and  raised the Federal gas tax. It hasn't been raised since 1993, 27 years.   And when they did the FAST Act, what did they do? They made up phony  things. They said: Oh, we are going to take money from the Federal  Reserve that doesn't exist, that is, $26 billion. Oh, we are going to  have private tax collection that is going to make money--except it has  been tried twice under Republican Presidents and it loses money.   And they came up with all of these phony pay-fors, and they say it  was paid for by user fees. No, it was paid for out of the general fund.  It ran a $90 billion deficit, paid for out of the general fund. We  borrowed the money. It is an investment.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Washington (Ms.  DelBene).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to gentleman from Oregon  (Mr. Blumenauer), a leader on transportation issues.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Illinois (Ms. Kelly).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Michigan (Mrs. Dingell).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to gentlewoman from  Illinois (Ms. Schakowsky).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New  York (Mr. Rose).                                time  1545     Mr. Speaker, if the gentleman wishes to close, I have no  further speakers and I will close.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, as I pointed out at the beginning of this long debate,  what we had was a disagreement in principle. And you can't compromise  on principles.   We just heard an impassioned speech from Mr. Graves from Louisiana  about how we should just throw up our hands on fossil fuel reduction in  the United States because China is building coal plants.   Well, we used to be a world leader on these things until Donald Trump  occupied the White House and we walked away from science and we walked  away from the Paris accord, and that gave leeway to these others  countries to just say, Well, look at the United States, why should we  comply with any of these strictures?   As I mentioned to him, we can deal with those things through our  trade policy, and we should. I had hoped to debate withdrawal from the  WTO. At this point it has been precluded by the Rules Committee, but I  am hoping to bring it up later this year.   We need to talk about our dependence upon China. We need to talk  about their abuses of the environment, their abuses of labor, their  abuses of stealing intellectual property, and all the other things that  they do over there. And we need to deal with them in a meaningful way  through trade policy, and we can do that. We could deal with their  fossil fuel pollution there, too. So that's one point.   The other would be that this bill is huge and transformative, and we  need it. The Republican alternative, offered in committee, had zero  funding for rail. None. It had baseline for transit. Today, transit in  America has a $106 billion backlog to bring it up to a state of good  repair. $106 billion.   Now, the good news is if we do that work, with us closing the final  loopholes and we buy America, it is going  [[Page H2938]]  to create one heck of a lot of manufacturing jobs here in the United  States. High tech jobs for new transit vehicles, everything. And then  for highways they did baseline plus 10 percent.   We talked about the scorecard of the American Society of Civil  Engineers. We have 47,000 bridges on the national highway system that  need substantial repair or replacement. That is about a $200 billion  bill.   I tried to get Obama to do that in his Recovery Act, and instead he  did Larry Summers' stupid tax cuts too small to notice at twice the  price tag. So we have let that go.    47,000 bridges. 40 percent of the national highway system has to be  rebuilt, not just overlaid.   And then transit. That is a huge bill. Huge. And you can't get there  with a baseline in transit and a 10 percent increase in highways. And,  by the way, we are about $100 billion short--over $100 billion short  with the user fee.   As I pointed out, the last time the user fee was increased we had a  Democratic President, a Democratic House, and a guy with a lot of guts  named Bud Shuster on the other side of the aisle, who was the senior  Republican on the committee. He ruled Newt Gingrich. He voted 60-some- odd Republicans with us to increase the user fee. That was 1993. The  Federal gas tax hasn't been indexed or increased in any way since 1993.   And the people say, Oh, it is politically toxic. Well, 36 States--36  States--have raised their gas taxes and user fees and registration fees  to pay for the projects because people are tired of congestion. They  are tired of potholes blowing out their tires. They are tired of crummy  transit that breaks down. They want better rail.   And people will--if you know that is where the money is going, they  will pay for it. But here in Washington, D.C., there is a fear, a fear,  that if we were to raise the user fee, oh, my God, we are all going to  lose our elections.   I propose that we just index it and bond it. Today we can borrow  money for 1.3 percent, virtually nothing. We can do this 5-year bill,  borrow all the money we need for this bill, and say, We are going to  pay interest only. We will pay it out of the existing gas tax revenues.  And at the end of 5 years when we have recovered from the pandemic,  when we have rebuilt America's infrastructure, and we are looking to  the future, then we will put in place a new system, and it will be  vehicle miles traveled when we are ready to go there, but first we have  to run a national pilot program and get the information we need to get  there.   Mr. Speaker, I recommend my colleagues to vote for a 21st century  transformative infrastructure bill that deals meaningfully with climate  change, which I believe in, and I believe everybody on this side of the  aisle believes in.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, pursuant to section 2 of House Resolution  1028, I offer amendments en bloc.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this en bloc amendment,  which provides for the consideration of 45 amendments filed by Members.  The amendments contained in this en bloc touch upon various areas of  highways and transit policy in the base bill, including:   Strengthening data collections by States under the racial profiling  grant program carried out by the National Highway Traffic Safety  Administration;   Improving the use of grant funds for education and enforcement  activities regarding cyclist and pedestrian safety. We have seen an  alarming uptick in that. We do have significant funds in the base bill  to provide for safer and more opportunities for pedestrian, cycling,  and alternate modes, access to shopping, groceries, work, and schools,  something that was substantially eliminated in the FAST Act, and the  legislation before that, MAP-21.   It adds charging speed and minimization of future upgrade costs and  considerations for electric vehicle charging infrastructure grants;  including environmental and environmental justice organizations on the  list of relevant stakeholders and considering plans for renewable or  zero-emission energy sources for charging and fueling infrastructure  when making awards under the electric vehicle charging grant program;   Requiring the Department of Transportation to consult with the  Environmental Protection Agency on the awarding of community Climate  Innovation Grants and ensure public comment in the determination of the  types of projects that most significantly reduce carbon pollution;   Adding additional environmental considerations to the goals of the  National Highway Freight Program, ensuring that the impacts of railway,  highway bottlenecks are considered under the program;   Expanding the role of historically Black colleges and universities  and other minority-serving institutions in the Department of  Transportation research;   Authorizing new research programs to expand transportation access for  low income, minority, and other underserved communities;   Ensuring that projects submitted to the FTA Capital Investment Grants  program can use ridership data collected before the COVID-19 outbreak,  that makes sense, and projections based on that data; and   Ensuring that projects carried out under the national surface  transportation system funding pilot includes privacy protections for  participants.   These are just some of the highlights of the amendments included.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues for offering these amendments to  improve the highway and transit portion of INVEST in America Act, I  urge adoption of the amendment.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Trone).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   In response to the gentleman that says, it isn't the responsibility  of the President to propose an infrastructure plan. He campaigned on  infrastructure. He campaigned on it.   Then Secretary Chao said the week of May 15, 2017, the $1 trillion  infrastructure plan will be out in the next several weeks. Whoops, here  we are, 3 years later and a couple of months, no plan. Oh, October 9,  Chao again touts the $1 trillion plan that will soon be available.  Whoops, that was 2017.   Then we had the week of February 12. Trump announced a $1.5 trillion  infrastructure plan. Actually, this time they did propose something. It  was just written out. It wasn't real language or anything. What it did  is it said the States will pay for it and the private sector will pay  for it, and by the way, we will reduce Federal investment. That was a  great plan. That was a great plan. A really good plan.   Then we went to the White House, and as other colleagues who were  there, the majority leader and others said, we went in, and when he  turned to the Speaker and said, Well, how much are you thinking for  infrastructure?   And she said, Well, Mr. President 1 to $1.3 trillion.   And the President said, No. No, not enough. Not enough.   1.9, 1.9.   He said, Nope, nope, nope. Two is better, $2 trillion.   He agreed to $2 trillion. He agreed to roads, bridges, highways,  transit, rail, wastewater, drinking water, and broadband. All those  things are in this bill funded at nearly the level because he was  proposing a 10-year figure for $2 trillion that he asked for.   And then again over the last few weeks they are on the verge of  issuing an infrastructure plan. And I have heard a couple of  Republicans say it is not up to a President to propose, and it is not  up to a President to figure out how to pay for it.   Dwight David Eisenhower; anybody remember him? Federal-Aid Highway  Program. Remember that? User fees, Dwight David Eisenhower's  initiative. He was a Republican President. He took initiative.   And then, you know, JFK brought transit into the mix. And both of  those things just happened on June 29 and June 30. For Ike it was 64  years ago, and for JFK, it was 59 years ago when we started making  major investments in public transit.   And I heard the gentleman say, Well, who is ever going to use  transit? Or they might not use it again because of COVID. Well, if we  don't get a vaccine and things don't get back to regular, yes, they may  not be using transit. But we are not going to have much of an economy  because a lot of the economic activity in this country is generated in  our urban areas. But I represent a mixed district. I have two  relatively small cities and a very large rural area.   There is a lot of stuff in this bill that is way better than the FAST  Act for rural America. We have $1 billion for off-highway bridges.  There are 47,000 bridges on the National Highway System that need  repair and replacement, but there are a heck of a lot of bridges  [[Page H2946]]  that are not on the national system. And a lot of those 47,000 are in  rural areas.   And the electrification is for the interstate system. And some of it  will go into urban areas, but it is going to be for the interstate. And  there are a lot of people in rural America who are dependent upon the  interstate. And some day they might want to be driving an electric car,  who knows? But they don't want to have range anxiety maybe. So to say  this just benefits urban America is an inanity.    And beyond that, we have put additional money into rural transit in  this bill. I have rural transit, suburban transit, and, yes, the major  urban areas, we are going to reinvest there. And, you know, if you  think it is foolish to reinvest there and you think we are never going  to be using transit again, then you are looking at a very grim future  for the United States of America and the world.   I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Washington (Ms. Jayapal).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentlewoman from Washington.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Michigan (Mr. Levin).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Oregon (Ms. Bonamici), a good friend.    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to the time remaining on  each side.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   To the gentlewoman's amendment, I appreciate Members advocating  strongly for either their State or their region. The problem that was  discovered with this amendment, after further investigation, is it  would have rewarded a smaller number of States to the detriment of 37  other States and the territories.   What has happened is that some States have built out their  Appalachian Development Highway System. They, under this amendment,  could turn that money back to DOT, then DOT would give that to other  Appalachian States. So far, so good. That would be okay with me. But it  goes one step further.   All those States that have finished and turned the money in, they get  additional funds. That means that a minority of the Appalachian States  that have already finished the system would get additional funding to  the detriment of all the 37 other States and the territories in the  United States of America.   The way it works now, they would be drawing on TFHI money. Now, when  there is excess TFHI money, there is something called the August  redistribution.   Last year, the State of Kansas got a 16.5 percent increase because of  the August redistribution. Under this amendment, nada, zero.   Texas got 16 percent. Under this amendment, zero.   Connecticut got 14.5 percent. Under this amendment, nothing.   Missouri, 13 percent; nothing. Louisiana, 12 percent redistribution;  nothing. Illinois, 11; nothing. Colorado, 10; nothing. Oklahoma, 10;  nothing.   The problem is it was a little bit of double-dipping. This was,  actually, cleverly authored at the auspices of Mitch McConnell in the  Senate.    An exchange of funds from one Appalachian State to the other to  finish the highway system, that is fine with me. But we are not going  to then give them credit and give them other Federal funds for that  money to benefit that region to the detriment of all the other States.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Iowa (Ms.  Finkenauer), who is a wonderful addition to the committee, doing  fabulous work and representing a very rural district, for the most  part.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume,  a short time.   There is actually a 35 percent increase in the National Highway  System funding in this bill--35 percent. Their bill was 10 percent.   Yes, there is a big increase in transit, but it is not at the expense  of the National Highway System or the investments in rural America or  the 47,000 bridges, many of which are in rural areas that need repair  or replacement, or the billion dollars we are putting into off-national  highway systems in rural areas. Those are huge new investments.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from California (Mr.  Ruiz).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume  to respond to the gentlewoman.   I share the gentlewoman's concern. We once had--and it is not in my  district, but Mr. Blumenauer's district--planned for a major new  highway that would have bisected the city, affecting generally working- class and minority neighborhoods, and we got it killed by, actually,  the Secretary of Transportation who was from Oregon at that time.  Highway projects have a bad history of dividing our cities, and  particularly segregating and dividing communities of color.   So I know the gentlewoman had a specific amendment targeted at this  one project, but, actually, the bill, itself, has a major focus on  looking for alternatives.   First, the States are going to have to go through--before they do any  of these projects, they are going to have to go through a rigorous  public process. They are going to have to look at what other options  are available to deal with the congestion or whatever issue they are  dealing with. So I expect that there are other provisions in this bill  that would achieve the gentlewoman's goals as we move forward.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Texas.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman. I always enjoy  working with her.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Pennsylvania (Ms. Wild).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Garcia), a member of the committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, again, I rise in support of this en bloc amendment. I  have no further speakers, and I have no further comments.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
