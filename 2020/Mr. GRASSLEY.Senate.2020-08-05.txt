 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 1  minute in morning business.    Madam President, watch the news or read the newspapers,  and you will know that there are a lot of deliberations going on to  help with the problems that we have of people being unemployed, the  pandemic we are fighting, and getting the economy up and running. While  those negotiations are going on, every once in a while, some of us on  this side of the aisle try to get things to help people who have needs.   A few days ago, the Democratic leader objected to one of these  attempts, which was a short-term extension of the Federal unemployment  supplement that was created by this body as part of the CARES Act.  Remember, the CARES Act passed unanimously by this body back in March.  Those things are running out, and we are trying to get them extended.  This effort to get this short-term extension was to provide for  Americans who need the continued help while talks continue about a  longer extension and even more relief.   Common sense ought to play a role. There doesn't seem to be any  downside to a temporary extension, but there apparently was a political  upside to the other side's blocking it. I hope we can work together and  that the Democratic leader will let his Members work with their  Republican colleagues on a path forward. This partisan ``my way or the  highway'' approach just doesn't work, particularly in a body in which  it takes 60 votes to get things done. These objections are not how we  got the CARES Act passed in the first place, and it is not how we will  continue to deliver for the American people now if we don't get more  cooperation.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, history has a way of repeating itself.  If we don't learn from the mistakes of the past, we are apt to repeat  them. As the November election draws near and as foreign adversaries  again seek to meddle in our democracy, let's review our history so we  can better identify and prevent future threats.   In late July 2016, Obama's FBI opened an investigation into the Trump  campaign that ended up spiraling out of control for years--4 years. The  investigation was ultimately based, in large part, on what is known as  the Steele dossier, which was a bunch of unverified claims from Russian  Government sources. It happens that that dossier was paid for by the  Democratic National Committee and by the Clinton campaign.   We know that its author, Christopher Steele, simultaneously pitched  those same unverified claims to U.S. media outlets, which then reported  on them without even testing their veracity. That is not responsible  journalism.   We know that Members of this Senate publicly seized on those  unverified media reports to attack their political rivals. They even  made references to the ``secret FBI investigations'' to give the  unverified, foreign-sourced claims a veneer of credibility. We know  that those unverified claims became part of the focus of a sweeping and  unnecessary multiyear investigation by some of the Justice Department's  most aggressive prosecutors.   In the end, they found no crime by the campaign or President Trump,  despite the dossier's allegations. Also, that shameful and damaging  episode was propelled by selective leaks from government officials and  breathless broadcasting by the press and the opposing political view.  [[Page S4894]]    Of course, now it is undergoing a postmortem. What we are finding out  isn't very pretty, and the people behind it ought to be ashamed--ought  to be very ashamed.   We have learned that some of those now-debunked claims of collusion  with a foreign adversary were actually sourced to that same foreign  adversary. In other words, those claims were assessed to be Russian  disinformation. Democrats got duped into falsely accusing their  political rivals of doing the very thing they were actually complicit  in.   We have learned that senior FBI officials had such disdain for  President Trump that they pushed the unverified information despite  repeated warnings of its flaws. They wanted to believe so badly in the  politically convenient narrative that they failed to do their jobs.  They lied to a court to spy on the campaign. They leaked memos to  launch a special counsel investigation. They even doctored the  paperwork--all to advance an investigation rooted in lies, innuendo,  and foreign disinformation.   I could go on about the harmful consequences from the hysteria that  consumed the last few years, but the lesson from it all is very simple:  Our adversaries will do anything to hijack our political differences to  sow discord and distrust. Our adversaries want us at each other's  throat. So long as we are fighting amongst ourselves, they win.   Why do I bring this up now? Because exactly 4 years later, we are  watching the same group run the same play today. If we aren't careful,  they will win again. Just like in 2016, foreign sources are pushing  unverified material about political candidates; just like in 2016, that  material has reportedly found its way into the U.S. intelligence  reviews; and just like in 2016, political rivals in Congress and the  press are using the unverified foreign sources and their claims to  suggest collusion between Republicans and foreign adversaries. Just  remember what I said--just like in 2016.   In the last few weeks, Democrats have falsely accused me and Senator  Johnson of receiving packets of information, including tapes, from a  Ukrainian. That is false reporting based on leaks from a letter written  by Senators Schumer, Warner, Speaker Pelosi, and Representative Schiff,  which is itself based on cherry-picked innuendo from classified  documents.   This Ukrainian claims that he also sent the information to several  Democrats. These Democrats have also denied receiving anything. Again,  what is this all about? The goal is to sow as much confusion as  possible. The claims are baseless. Neither I nor anyone on my staff had  anything to do with him. We never reached out to him or received  anything from him. We never received or reviewed anything like what was  described in the Democrats' leaked documents.   Here is the rub. But that didn't stop the press from reporting the  story anyway. Remember, 2016, 2017, and 2018? It didn't stop the press  from reaching out to this Ukrainian to present him with the apparently  leaked classified information from the Democrats' letter.   Let me be clear. My investigation with Senator Johnson is based on  how the Obama administration formulated its Ukraine policy, which then- Vice President Biden oversaw while his son was on the board of a  corrupt Ukrainian natural gas company that was under investigation.   Did the corrupt firm get special access or special treatment because  of its ties to the Vice President's son? We should know that. Did the  Obama administration appropriately address any conflicts of interest?  We should know that. In fact, the American people should know that.   In pursuit of those facts--now, following the leads where they take  you, so I say, in pursuit of the facts, we have requested records from  the State Department, National Archives, Department of Justice, some  other Federal agencies, and the U.S. consulting firm Blue Star  Strategies. We have also talked with current and former U.S. Government  officials.   Isn't this odd? Apparently, Obama administration records and speaking  with Obama administration officials is, to our Democratic friends,  foreign or Russian disinformation. Isn't that odd?   As Senator Johnson and I noted to our Democratic colleagues in a  letter when we answered their letter--if it is, then that means the  Obama administration routinely peddled in it as well.   Democrats have suggested that the cause of their concern is Andrii  Telizhenko. In March 2020, the Homeland Security and Governmental  Affairs Committee sought to subpoena him only for records from his  yearlong employment with Blue Star Strategies--a Democratic consulting  firm that lobbied the U.S. Government on behalf of the Biden-connected  Ukrainian energy firm. Blue Star also had contracts at the highest  levels of President Obama's administration. Notably, Mr. Telizhenko had  working relationships with Obama administration officials   I don't recall ever any Democrat raising concerns about Mr.  Telizhenko being a national security threat while he was meeting with  the Obama administration, but, apparently, he suddenly becomes one when  Republicans ask for records involving his time at a Democratic lobby  shop.   Truth be told, the Democrats should know a thing or two about Russian  disinformation. Investigative work by me and Senator Johnson has  revealed now declassified intelligence reporting that parts of the  Steele dossier were parts of the Russian disinformation campaign.   I am not aware of the Democrats commenting publicly on this very  disturbing revelation. Where is their outrage about concerns of actual  Russian disinformation contained in the Steele dossier and at the same  time Russian disinformation paid for by the Democratic National  Committee and Hillary Clinton?   The Steele dossier is the very, very definition of election  interference, and yet we hear no objection from Democrats. Did the  Democrats and the Clinton campaign know that the dossier was filled  with Russian disinformation and run with it, anyway, knowing it would  cause damage to Trump, his campaign, and administration?   Is Russian disinformation synonymous with Democratic National  Committee disinformation? Maybe the Democrats don't want to look under  the hood of the fake Russia investigation because--because they would  be front and center.   I would like to remind my Democratic colleagues that I ordered my  staff to interview Donald Trump, Jr., and Republican officials during  my time as chairman of the Judiciary Committee, and we did so. At the  same time, ask yourself if I ever requested an interview with Hunter  Biden. If I did that, how would the Democrats react?   My fellow Americans, this is where we are at now. The Democrats live  by the motto ``Do as I say, not as I do.'' Yet they accuse me and my  colleague, Senator Johnson, of playing politics and engaging in a  disinformation campaign.   The hard truth is, it is the Democrats who are engaged in a  disinformation campaign all because the facts don't fit into their  political narrative. Their silence regarding the Steele dossier and  fake Russia investigation, yet complaints about my legitimate oversight  investigation, is proof of that.   In conclusion, these recent media reports hinge on the leak of  Democrats' classified documents, which they hadn't shared with their  Republican colleagues. Only after the stories were published--I want to  emphasize, only after the stories were published--were I and my staff  able to review the Democrats' documents.   Their letter is full of cherry-picked lines designed to shoehorn  Republicans into warnings of a very real threat that faces all of us.  Their letter attempts to cast Republicans as unwitting pawns in foreign  disinformation, but it appears that the Democrats are playing the role  as a useful idiot for foreign adversaries.   The leaks only further distort the content of their letter. In no  conceivable way do the facts support the Democrats' and the media's  preposterous narrative.   Here is what really bothers me the most. My Democratic colleagues  have known me for a very long time. They know who I am. They know where  to find me. And they know that if they were so concerned about what I  was allegedly up to, they should have just raised all of those issues  with me. This nonsense of orchestrated leaks to plant stories and  falsely accusing me of dealing in disinformation based on actual  [[Page S4895]]  disinformation that I wasn't even privy to serves only the interest of  our shared adversaries. This happens to be the behavior of cowards.  And, of course, it should stop. As I started out my remarks today, we  have seen this movie before. It didn't end well for those who relied on  a disinformation dossier in 2016.    Finally, the truth is slowly starting to come out and the FBI, the  media, and the Members of Congress who touted the disinformation look  pretty bad today. I started out by saying we need to learn from  history--I believe it was George Santayana who said something like that  maybe 100 years ago--or you are going to repeat the mistakes of the  past. Let's not repeat this history. Instead, we ought to be learning  from it.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
