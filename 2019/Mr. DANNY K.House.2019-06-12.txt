 DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the  desk.    DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   First of all, I want to thank Representative Burgess and  Representative G.K. Butterfield, both of whom have been very helpful in  putting this amendment together.   The Davis-Burgess-Butterfield bipartisan amendment would increase the  funding to the account of the National Center on Birth Defects,  Development Disabilities, and Disabilities by $2 million and decrease  the administration account in the Office of the Secretary of Health and  Human Services by $2 million.   Currently, under this account, there is no money allocated for the  Public Health Approach to Blood Disorders Program for Sickle Cell  Disease. Increasing funding would support the CDC's sickle cell disease  surveillance program to better identify affected individuals, to  understand their health outcomes, and to evaluate strategies to prevent  complications and risk factors that affect individuals living with this  devastating disease.   The $2 million funding for the Davis-Burgess-Butterfield amendment  would assist in establishing a grant program for States representing a  majority of the sickle cell disease patient population. The current  surveillance conducted by the CDC is limited to the States of  California and Georgia.   The data accumulated under this grant program, authorized by Public  Law 115-327, would cover associated health outcomes, would identify  health disparities, and would evaluate the impact of genetic,  environmental, behavioral, and other risk factors that may impact  health.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Chairman, I include in the Record  this letter of support from the American Society of Hematology and the  Sickle Cell Disease Association of America.          American Society of Hematology and the Sickle Cell             Disease Association of America, Inc.                                                     June 12, 2019.      Hon. Danny Davis,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Michael Burgess,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. G.K. Butterfield,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representatives Davis, Burgess, and Butterfield: The       American Society of Hematology (ASH) and the Sickle Cell       Disease Association of America (SCDAA) strongly support your       amendment to provide $2 million in funding for the sickle       cell disease (SCD) data collection program authorized by the       Sickle Cell Disease Research, Surveillance, Prevention, and       Treatment Act of 2018 (Public Law 115-327). Your amendment       will enable the CDC to expand its efforts to improve SCD       surveillance in the United States.        The Davis/Burgess/Butterfield amendment will add $2 M in       funding to the National Center for Birth Defects and       Developmental Disabilities, Public Health Approach to Blood       Disorders account. This program currently oversees SCD public       health surveillance in the states of California and Georgia       and has recently released a grant announcement for additional       states to take the necessary steps to engage in SCD data       collection. The amendment will enable additional high       incidence states to undertake SCD surveillance.        The CDC estimates that SCD affects nearly 100,000       Americans; however, absent a nationwide surveillance program,       we are not confident of this estimate, nor do we know where       individuals with SCD live, how they receive care or if they       have access to healthcare providers with expertise in SCD.       Surveillance is necessary to improve understanding of the       health outcomes and health care system utilization patterns       of people with SCD, increase evidence for public health       programs, and establish cost effective practices to improve       and extend the lives of people with SCD.        SCD is an inherited, lifelong disorder that causes a       person's red blood cells to become deformed and get stuck in       veins, blocking oxygen flow throughout the body. This       devastating disease can cause complications including severe       pain, stroke, acute chest syndrome, organ damage, and in some       cases premature death. The many complications of SCD can make       every stage of life extremely challenging for individuals       with the disease. This is compounded by the fact that many       people living with SCD are unable to access quality care and       are limited by a lack of effective treatment options.        ASH represents more than 17,000 physicians, researchers,       and medical trainees committed to the study and treatment of       blood and blood-related diseases and disorders, including       SCD. SCDAA's mission is to advocate for people affected by       sickle cell conditions and empower community-based       organizations to maximize quality of life and raise public       consciousness while advancing the search for a universal       cure.        Thank you again for your leadership to improve ``the lives       of individuals living with SCD. Expansion of CDC's work in       SCD will significantly help improve our understanding of the       disorder and in turn, improve healthcare outcomes for       individuals with SCD.            Sincerely,      Roy L. Silverstein, MD,        ASH President.      Beverly Francis-Gibson, M.A,        SCDAA President and Chief Executive Officer.     DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Chair, I yield such time as she  may consume to the gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms. DeLauro).    DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Chairman, I simply want to  commend and thank, again, Dr. Burgess for not only his passion, but the  tremendous work and effort that he has put forth over the years to help  make sure that this population group gets the service and attention  that they deserve.   Mr. Chair, I thank Representative DeLauro for her comments,  especially the fact that many researchers believe that they are very  close to finding a cure for sickle cell anemia, and this just moves us  one step further.   Mr. Chair, I urge adoption, and I yield back the balance of my time.
