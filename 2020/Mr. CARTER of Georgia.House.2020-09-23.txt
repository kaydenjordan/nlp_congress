 Madam Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman  yielding.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in opposition to H.R. 4447, despite  holding out hope that we would have a truly bipartisan energy package  moving through this body.   As I look at the bill, we can't ignore the tremendous price tag, $135  billion, without discussing the use of valuable taxpayer dollars. This  bill's price tag reflects the many subsidy programs that duplicate  existing programs without meaningful attention applied to addressing  the regulatory burdens facing these industries.   If the goal is to transition to a cleaner energy economy, we won't  see real progress without a serious discussion about reforming existing  regulatory barriers.  [[Page H4869]]    An example is the cumbersome NEPA review process which has slowed  infrastructure projects for years and added countless sums in costs to  projects, without any added benefit to the people.   Another concern I have with this bill is the focus on larger cities  while leaving rural communities, like the ones I represent in south  Georgia, on the wayside. If the goal is to spur on economic investments  in the energy sector, the rural parts of America must be included.   There are also other concerns, such as expensive electric vehicle  mandates and experimental technologies that will leave the taxpayer  footing the bill.   This package, unfortunately, is not reflective of extensive  bipartisan work in committee to pass policies that would help us move  forward. Instead, it is a wish list of expensive and duplicate programs  that will bog down the significant progress that has already been made  here.   There are some programs and ideas that deserve separate consideration  because of bipartisan support, but unfortunately, this package falls  short.   I urge my colleagues to oppose this bill.
