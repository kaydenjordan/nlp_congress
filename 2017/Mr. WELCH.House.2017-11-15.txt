 Mr. Speaker, I have a question for my colleagues: What do  you have against students?   This tax bill means that if an employer provides tuition assistance,  the student is going to have to pay income tax on that. Students who  borrow money for school have to pay interest on the loan. Students who  want to get low interest rates are going to have to pay high interest  rates because of the elimination of the private activity bond.   The second question I have is this: What do you have against  democracy?   This bill was written in secret. There were no public hearings on  this bill. Nobody had a chance to have any input. That is why, if you  ask 435 Members of Congress, if they want to raise taxes on students,  the answer from 435 would be ``no.'' But you have rigged this bill so  that we have literally no opportunity to offer a single amendment. That  is wrong.   This bill was written by and for the donor class. Let's defeat this  bill and stand up for the middle class.    Madam Speaker, I have a few questions for the authors of  this bill.   What do you have against students? You are imposing an opportunity  tax. A young Vermonter who wants to get a certificate in welding, or  get a degree from our community college, and gets tuition assistance  from an employer, they have to pay taxes on that. If they borrow money  from the Vermont Student Assistance Corporation, they have to pay more  because they can't deduct that interest.   By the way, the Vermont Student Assistance Corporation has to charge  higher interest because we are eliminating private activity bonds, and  they don't get the benefit of their municipal bonds rate.   I have another question. What do you have against teachers? They  reach in their pocket at the beginning of school to help out with  school supplies. They lose the deduction.   I have another question. What do you have against people who have a  loved one with Alzheimer's? They can't deduct the cost of that medical  care.    Well, I have another question for the Chair, and I ask it  of the leadership.   What happened to democracy? We were promised an open process. And  there was a model for this. It was President Reagan and Dan  Rostenkowski, 4 months of actual hearings, witnesses testifying about  the bill.   This was written in secret. Oh, by the way, no amendments.   Now, we could ask 435 Members of Congress whether we should stick it  to the students like we are doing in this bill, and 435 of us would all  stand up for the students. But you know what? Not a single one of us is  given the opportunity to ask the question: Do we want to stick it to  our students who want to get a welding degree or a college degree?   That is disgraceful, it is inexcusable, it is within the control of  the majority, and they are denying us the opportunity.   Here is the big deal that we know. This bill was written by and for  the donor class that has flooded and contaminated this political  process with billions of dollars in our campaigns.   Madam Speaker, I say defeat this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I would be glad to. Just by way of  introduction, I thank the ranking member for his leadership.   As the gentleman said, the biggest challenge we face in this  country--and it is not a Democrat or Republican issue--is that wages  have been stagnant for Americans for 20 years. They haven't had a pay  raise. That is a huge challenge because the American Dream has always  been premised on the fact that our parents have made an economy that  has provided more opportunity for their kids.   Wages are flat. America hasn't had a pay raise in 20 years. So the  fundamental question for me on a tax bill is whether that tax bill will  increase opportunity for hardworking Americans. And it doesn't matter  where they are  [[Page H9370]]  from, rural or urban. It doesn't matter what their race is. It doesn't  matter what their gender or their sexual orientation is. Most Americans  want to work and they want to take care of the people they love and  they want to have an opportunity.   This tax bill comes up real short. By the way, I want to be somewhat  self-critical of the Democrats. We haven't been where we have needed to  be, oftentimes, which is for hardworking Americans, but I think we are  solidly where we need to be on this tax bill.   Mr. Speaker, I will give the gentleman a couple of examples in  explicit response to his question. I went out to a school that provided  training for young Vermont men and women who wanted to become welders.  That is a great job. They get out of school and they get a job that  pays them good wages. They have got to borrow money in order to do  that.   In some cases, they have an employer who pays their tuition. Under  this tax bill, that young woman or that young man who gets tuition  assistance from his or her employer has to declare that as income and  pay taxes on it.   That is an opportunity tax. A lot of those folks have borrowed money.  We have got a wonderful Vermont Student Assistance Corporation program.  It doesn't matter whether you are a Republican child or a Democratic  child, you get low interest loans. They have lost their tax deduction.   This is when they are beginning their career, so their income is not  great, and they are trying to pay their bills, maybe get a condominium;  maybe, if they are really lucky, get a house. They have got to pay more  taxes as a result of this bill.   The other thing is private activity bonds. This is unbelievable  because what those bonds are--I didn't know much about this before I  came to Congress--but it is a benefit where there can be an opportunity  to borrow money from the private market, by the way, in order to  provide low interest rates. The people who buy these bonds get the  benefit of a tax deduction in order to provide a continuing benefit to  lower interest rates for kids who are trying to get a welding degree or  a community college degree or a higher education degree.   We are taking that away. We are taking away opportunity. We are  imposing a big tax on the opportunity for young women and men in  Vermont. There is not a single Republican who would want to do that.  But we don't have an opportunity in this bill to propose an amendment,  to say: Hey, wait a minute. We made a mistake on this provision because  we don't want the would-be welders in Alabama, the would-be welders in  Texas, the would-be welders in Vermont to have to pay more in order to  develop a skill that is really essential to making those joints on our  bridges and doing the things that we need to rebuild our cities.   We are not allowed an opportunity to propose an amendment where every  single American would know whether your Representative wanted to impose  an opportunity tax on that student who wants to become a welder.   Where is the democracy in this? Where is the transparency in this?   That is what really is heartache for me. As Chairman Neal knows, we  grew up in the same city and it was rough and tumble, working class,  proud people, and ethnic.                                time  2045    We played hard in sports, and we battled all the time. But we had a  kind of common pride in the value of work. We saw how hard our parents  worked. We didn't necessarily notice that when we should have when we  were younger. But as we grew up, we really were stunned at the kind of  commitment they had to rebuilding the city that we were in and the  gentleman became mayor of. We became so appreciative of the opportunity  they gave us.   I grew up in a family of six kids, and how my parents did it in a  small house with four bedrooms and sharing a bedroom, we didn't know.  It was only after the fact that we became aware of how wonderful this  opportunity was that they gave us and the sacrifices that they made.   Isn't it our job in this House of Representatives to give everybody  the same opportunity to the experience that Mr. Neal had, that Mr.  Lipinski had, and that I had? That was on the shoulders of parents who  sacrificed for our benefit.   So the bottom line for me on this tax bill is whether it enhances the  opportunity of every American striver, every American who wants to  become better, more contributing, more of an active citizen, more of an  accomplished adult, and more of a contributor to our workforce. Does  this bill help them achieve that or does it impede them from doing  that?   When I look just at one specific provision where we say that students  are going to have to pay taxes on the interest that they pay on their  student loan or when a student who earns, in fact, a scholarship or a  fellowship to go advance their higher education and they have to pay  income tax on that, I am truly horrified because this country--and this  is not a Republican-Democratic deal--is all based on the optimism that,  if we give people opportunity, it will benefit all of us. It will  benefit that individual who is there to seize that opportunity and make  the best of what they can do and, therefore, build the country.   So, Mr. Speaker, I really appreciate the ranking member's efforts on  this.
