 Mr. President, as we all know, the Senate has been  quite busy. Legislatively, we have been hard at work on everything from  budgets, to disaster relief, to consumer protections, to tax reform.   On the nominations front, we have taken strong action to strengthen  the judiciary, including confirming a slate of very-well-qualified  nominees in recent days. This week, we are continuing our work to staff  up the rest of the government as well. This is one of the Senate's most  important functions and one we take seriously.   We are currently considering men and women who have been nominated to  serve in many different roles at many different agencies. The one thing  they all share in common is this: They are ready to get to work, and  the sooner we confirm them, the sooner they can get on the job for our  country.   First, we will vote to confirm John Gibson as Deputy Chief Management  Officer at the Department of Defense. He will be responsible for  increasing efficiency throughout the Department's business operations.   Afterward, the Senate will continue its consideration of Steven  Engel, who will, as I discussed yesterday, serve as the Deputy Attorney  General in the Department of Justice Office of Legal Counsel.   The next nomination we will consider is that of Peter Robb to serve  as the General Counsel of the National Labor Relations Board.   For most of its 80-year existence, the NLRB has had the important  responsibility of supporting stable labor relations by acting as a fair  and impartial umpire in the resolution of labor disputes.  Unfortunately, that changed under the previous administration, which  wielded its Board majority as an anti-worker political cudgel at the  behest of special interests and union bosses. Instead of the Board's  historic commitment to impartially applying the law, the NLRB's Obama- appointed Democratic majority put forward policies that diminished the  rights of employees, hurt small businesses, and rewarded entrenched  political elites at the expense of workers and the middle class.   Thankfully, this Senate recently confirmed a new majority to the NLRB  that is already beginning to undo the damage of the past 8 years. Now  we have the opportunity to build upon that good work with the  nomination of Mr. Robb.   The NLRB's General Counsel is responsible for investigating cases of  unfair labor practices and for advancing cases before the Board and its  members. Mr. Robb will fulfill these duties under the aegis of a new  Board majority that is returning the NLRB to its true mission once  more.   Labor policy is not simply some theoretical abstraction for Mr. Robb;  he knows what it means to work as a hospital orderly or a construction  worker, welder, truckdriver, forklift operator, or highway sign maker  because he himself has worked in all of those jobs before. After law  school, Robb gained valuable experience in employment law. His previous  leadership roles, including as an NLRB regional field attorney and  chief counsel to a Board member, contribute to making Robb an ideal  candidate to serve as the Board's General Counsel.   I look forward to voting to advance this nomination, and I urge my  colleagues to join me in helping restore the NLRB to the neutral umpire  of labor disputes it was meant to be.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on another matter, our complex Tax Code  is in desperate need of reform, and we now have a once-in-a-generation  opportunity to overhaul it. We all want an economy that reaches for its  full potential again. We all want to support small businesses and the  middle class. Tax reform represents the single most important action we  can take today to advance goals such as these.   I have heard from many Kentuckians calling out for relief from our  outdated and burdensome Tax Code. Listen to this small business owner  from Murray, KY, who wrote to my office about his struggles under our  current Tax Code. This is what he said:   [[Page S7034]]              I am writing to stress the importance of tax reform for       small businesses. As a small business owner, I have been       saddle[d] with tax burdens since I began my business over 8       years ago. Tax reform for small business and families need[s]       to be done immediately [so] we can have some economic hope       once again.    Small businesses just like this one are calling out for relief. So  are families. So are middle-class workers all across our country.  Instead of better opportunities, our Tax Code gives them a complicated  web of schedules, deductions, and regulations, a byzantine system that  is easy for the wealthy and well-connected to exploit and impossible  for almost anyone else to understand. It is time for a system that  actually helps the middle class succeed and actually encourages small  businesses to grow, invest, and hire.   We want to help families plan for their future. We want to get the  economy going again and growing again. Most of all, we want to take  more money out of Washington's pockets and put more money in the  pockets of the middle class. To accomplish these goals, both the House  and the Senate are continuing to move forward to deliver tax reform.  Yesterday, the House Ways and Means Committee completed its first day  of discussing the House legislative proposal unveiled last week. That  bill, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, builds upon the unified tax reform  framework and reflects goals shared by President Trump, Republicans in  the House, and our conference here in the Senate--priorities shared by  Americans of both parties all across our country.   Later this morning, a group of Senators, administration officials,  and tax reform advocates will highlight the benefits of relief for  families, small businesses, and the American economy. They will share  their constituents' calls for tax reform.   As they do, the Senate Finance Committee will continue its work on  this important issue as well. Chairman Hatch will continue to lead the  committee through an open process, giving members the opportunity to  provide their input, offer amendments, and work together to take  another big step forward.   I am grateful for the work of both Chairman Brady and Chairman Hatch  to get us to this point. We still have a lot of work to do, but we are  committed to passing tax reform to help our Nation's economy reach its  full potential.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that  notwithstanding rule XXII, at 4:30 p.m. today, Tuesday, November 7,  there be 30 minutes of post-cloture time remaining on the Engel  nomination, equally divided between the leaders or their designees;  that following the use or yielding back of time, the Senate vote on the  confirmation of the Engel nomination; and that if confirmed, the motion  to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table, and the  President be immediately notified of the Senate's action; further, that  there be 2 minutes, equally divided, prior to the cloture vote on the  Robb nomination.    Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.
