 Mr. Speaker, I rise today on a matter that is  incredibly important to our national security, our public health  knowledge, and preparing for the next pandemic.   It has been well over a year since the start of the COVID-19  pandemic, and our country has closed down in the face of a public  health crisis the likes of which we have not seen in decades.   And to this day, we still do not have a definitive answer regarding  the origins of COVID-19. Getting to the bottom of how this virus  originated and how it spread across the globe should be one of our top  priorities in Congress.   Today, the Republican members of the Select Subcommittee on the  Coronavirus Crisis will hold a forum to discuss the origins of this  virus. This is not a partisan issue, and every Member of this body  should want to know where this virus came from and every member of the  select subcommittee should be in attendance.   As I said earlier, finding the origins is important to our national  security, public health knowledge, and preparing for the next pandemic.   Additionally, Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the  Committees on Energy and Commerce, Ways and Means, and the Judiciary be  discharged from further consideration of H.R. 18, No Taxpayer Funding  for Abortion Act, and ask for its immediate consideration in the House.
