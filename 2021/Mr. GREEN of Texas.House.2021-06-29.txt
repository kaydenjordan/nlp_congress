 Madam Speaker, I thank the chairwoman for  yielding.   Madam Speaker, the great Thurgood Marshall won 29 of 32 cases before  the Supreme Court of the United States of America. He was eminently  qualified then and he is now, and this is a proper thing for us to do.   I want to close with this: If Judge Taney and his cohorts had their  way, there would be no person of color in this building today.    Madam Speaker, if they had their way, you would not be at that  podium.   Madam Speaker, I stand with Mr. Hoyer. I am grateful for what he has  done, and I will vote for this legislation. Its time has long since  come, and we are doing the right thing. Dr. King reminded us, ``the  time is always right to do that which is right.''
