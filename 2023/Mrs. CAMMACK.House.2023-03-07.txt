 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1123, the  Understanding Cybersecurity of Mobile Networks Act.   H.R. 1123 would require the National Telecommunications and  Information Administration, in partnership with relevant agencies and  other stakeholders, to study the current state of U.S. mobile  communications networks and to report to Congress on its findings.   This report is developed by compiling government and nongovernmental  research and would assess the cybersecurity of these networks and  vulnerabilities in the networks or mobile devices for cyberattacks and  surveillance conducted by our adversaries.   Americans rely on their phones and mobile networks more than ever to  communicate with family and friends and to conduct business all across  the country.   At the same time, cybersecurity threats to these essential U.S.  communications networks have never been higher.   Accordingly, Congress must be informed of these threats and any  successful tools or methods used to counter or mitigate existing cyber  threats. This bill would do just that by simply providing Congress an  overview of the status of mobile network cybersecurity, which would  include the degree to which cyber vulnerabilities have been addressed,  are being addressed, or will be addressed.   The report required by this bill takes an important first step in  tackling network security by informing Congress, stakeholders, and most  important, the American people of the security or lack thereof of these  vital mobile networks.   I am so proud to lead this bill along with my colleague, Ms. Eshoo,  and I thank my good friend, our chairman of the subcommittee, for his  leadership on this important issue.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to vote in support of this  bill.
