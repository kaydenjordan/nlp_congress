 Mr. Speaker, today is Flag Day and the  U.S. Army's 247th birthday.   Every year on June 14 we celebrate our Stars and Stripes. We  celebrate on June 14 because on this day in 1777 the Continental  Congress approved the design for our first flag.   Over the years our flag has been changed to reflect the growth of our  Nation, but one thing remains the same: It will always stand for  freedom.   Our flag is a glorious symbol of hope for our brave servicemen and - women who salute it, defend it, serve it, and, in some cases, die to  protect our freedom and liberty.   Today is also the U.S. Army's birthday. For the last 247 years, our  servicemembers have been defending freedom at home and abroad.   Today, our Nation celebrates our Army and our flag, which symbolize  both America being the land of the free and the home of the brave.                            ____________________
