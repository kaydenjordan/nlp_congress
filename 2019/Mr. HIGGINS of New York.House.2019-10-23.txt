 Madam Speaker, this Saturday, October 26,  early voting begins in New York State for the first time, expanding the  window for voters to select their government representatives.   This country has long upheld its protection of free and fair  elections, keeping the power and decisionmaking where it should be:  with, and only with, the American people.   Foreign interference in our elections is real, and its existence is  threatening the legitimacy of our elections, national security, and the  democracy this Nation was founded on.  [[Page H8398]]    Today the House will vote on the SHIELD Act, adding further  transparency in campaigns, stiffer penalties for voter deception, and  further restrictions against foreign interference, including making  campaigns mandatory reporters if there is any offer of foreign  assistance in those campaigns.   Madam Speaker, I urge others to join me in voting to protect the vote  of the American people.                            ____________________
