 Mr. President, I ask that the following statement  from Mona Wadsworth, a Florida constituent, be printed in the Record.   The material follows:   Until my memory begins to fail me there will be one date that will  remain one of the most significant to me.   That is not to say that there are not other dates in my life that are  important; birthdays, weddings, graduations, holidays, the usual dates  we all mark on the calendar.   Then there are those dates that hold great value to us because on  those days something happened to alter our lives in some way.   For me there is one that stands out among all others. December 15,  2017. That is the day God sent an angel into my life and that angel is  here in this room.   Before I identify that angel I want to tell you a story about a  woman.   There was nothing exceptional about this woman. She was much like  most of us. She played as a child, drove her parents crazy as a teen,  became a young adult, fell in love, married, raised a family, worked  and was basically the average everyday woman in her community.   She had always wanted to own a house of her own but no matter how she  tried life's ups and downs always dipped into her savings and that  dream never came to pass.   She may not have owned any of dwellings she and her family lived in,  but she took pride in her home. It was always well furnished, clean and  had many of the comforts of the day.   In the hustle and bustle of everyday life we tend to take for granted  all the things that give us joy and comfort. She was no different. She  never  [[Page S4341]]  thought about how nice it felt to sleep in a comfortable bed or how  nice that warm shower felt. I could go on and on and on, mentioning  everything that made her life comfortable but I think you all have the  general idea.   Age creeps up on us subtly. It may begin with your eyes not seeing as  clearly as they used to or you don't seem to hear as well. One day you  might get up off the floor and find that it took a little longer this  time. You start to feel aches and pains you didn't before.   Fighting off a cold is harder this time. Trips to the doctor become  more frequent. When once you were a mother or a father you're now gram  or gramps. No matter how you've tried to deny it, one day you look in  the mirror and wonder who this old person is looking back at you.   And so it was for this woman. Now in her 60's, her children grown,  she still counted herself pretty lucky. Except for the glasses she put  on each morning, the need to take blood pressure medication and  insulin, she was doing pretty good health wise. She still made holiday  meals, still cleaned her home with the same determination, she  basically was living her life as much as she always had.   Then one day something happened in this woman's life that would  forever-more change it.   In September 2017 Hurricane Irma slammed into Florida. Irma was not a  lady. She left a great deal of damage in her wake and devastated many  lives. Irma rendered the house this woman lived in uninhabitable,  starting a domino effect in this woman's life that would eventually  render her homeless.   She went to every agency she was aware of only to find out she either  didn't qualify for assistance or there simply wasn't the housing or the  funds available to help her out of a situation she had no control over.   On October 23rd, this woman now in her 60's took what clothes she  managed to save, the necessary toiletries she needed, a few towels, a  frying pan, a sauce pan and a coffee pot. With the little money she had  left until her next meager Social Security benefit payment came in, she  bought some food, a cooler, ice, paper plates, cups and plastic spoons,  forks, and knives. Her last purchase was a small tent.   That night and for the next 12 weeks her bed was the floor of a tent,  her covers were a thin blanket. She fell asleep that night to the sound  of rain pelting the tent. She cried herself to sleep.   As time moved on she bought an air mattress, sheets, a heavier  blanket, a small grill, little things that would make her life a little  easier to bear.   She'd crawl in and out of the tent several times a day. She used  public facilities to shower, brush her teeth, and comb her hair. She  carried a bucket of warm water from the shower house to her campsite so  that she could wash the few pans she'd used to cook in.   In November, many people from the North come down to Florida and many  come in RV's. This woman now found herself moving her campsite from one  place to another every 3 or 4 days to accommodate these people who had  reserved these campsites.   When the temperature in Florida gets into the upper 70's, the inside  of a tent feels like an oven. When the evening temperature falls into  the lower 50's or 40's it feels like a freezer.   Unable to take her insulin because she couldn't keep it properly  cooled or take her blood pressure medication because the heat melted  it, her health was deteriorating with each passing day.   In the later part of December, weak, sick, questioning her faith in  God and wondering if she wanted her life to go on, she walked through  the doors of a hospital's emergency room.   If you haven't guessed already I'll tell you now. This woman was me.   But this story is a story of triumph over tragedy and this is where  my angel comes in. As I said, my angel is here in this room and her  name is Lynn.   I'm going to embarrass her now because Lynn doesn't really think she  did that much. But I say, if it wasn't for her I'm not sure I'd be  standing here today.   Upon hearing about my situation from a hospital social worker, Lynn  set up an appointment for me the next day. It was December 15th. I'll  never forget Lynn looking at me from across her desk and saying she  wouldn't have a merry Christmas unless she knew I was settled into  Trinity Towers before Christmas.   There was still a problem however: Rent. I didn't have the money to  pay until the 3rd of January. That didn't deter Lynn. She got on the  phone and talked to those in charge. They came through for her. I have  Beth and Marlene to thank for that.   Lynn had a merry Christmas because on December 20th I was handed the  keys to apartment 427.   Yes, Lynn is my angel. She went that extra mile to help me and in  doing so she renewed my faith in humanity and more than that, she  renewed my faith in God.   Jesus once said the poor will always be among us and we should help  them. Lynn lives those words.   This life experience has changed my life for the better. I don't  sweat the small stuff anymore. I don't judge the homeless because I  know how easy it is to be there. I don't take for granted God's  blessings and I start every day thanking God for the roof over my head,  a warm bed to sleep in and the food in my belly.   In closing, I want to thank all the residents of Trinity Towers South  for the graciousness in which you welcomed me into your community and  thank each and every one of you who saw a person down on their luck and  came to my door one by one and gave me things I so badly needed.   I didn't tell this story because I wanted a pity party. I told it in  hopes that people will understand how important affordable housing is.   I ask our government officials, you whom we've entrusted the job of  representing us, those who make the difficult decisions on our behalf  to fight the good fight and make sure that programs set up to help the  less fortunate, especially food and housing programs, do not fall by  the wayside. Do not forget the poor, the disabled, the sick or the  elderly.   If I could have one wish granted in my life, it would be this. That  every man, woman and child would forever have, without question, the  basic needs of life, a roof over their head, a warm bed to sleep in and  food to fill their stomachs.   Thank you for listening to my story.                            ____________________
