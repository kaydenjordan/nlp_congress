 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   I have three daughters. They are all adults. They are all amazed that  we are here debating this issue. The ranking member said, me too;  obviously, for different reasons.   In 1965, the Supreme Court--long before any of the present Justices  had these theories about what due process is and is not--said that  women had a constitutional right and, in addition, men, to seek  services related to family planning.   Madam Speaker, women's rights are under assault in America. From the  very beginning, of course, women were second-class citizens until we  radically, in the beginning of the last century, decided, oh, well,  women are part of America and we are going to let them vote. And  successively, we have taken steps to treat women equally.   The Supreme Court's extremist Dobbs v. Jackson decision overturned 49  years of legal precedent and erased decades of progress toward women's  equality. This bill deals with 57 years of constitutional law, since  1965, when Griswold was decided 7-2. It was not a controversial opinion  with the American people nor, frankly, is this bill controversial, of  whatever faith you may be.   Not only did Republican-appointed Justices strip women of their  constitutional right to access safe, legal abortions, they also opened  the door for lawmakers to restrict women's ability to make reproductive  healthcare decisions.   Justice Thomas, of course, as all of us know, issued a radical  concurring opinion that called for a reconsideration of landmark legal  precedents, one of which we are dealing with today, Griswold v.  Connecticut, as I said, decided in 1965, which established Americans'  constitutional right to contraception.   Birth control allows women and their partners to make essential  decisions about their health and their lives, including whether to have  children and start a family. That is the consensus in America,  overwhelmingly.   Nevertheless, the Supreme Court has put all forms of contraception in  jeopardy with this decision. Now, some say, No, it doesn't. But Justice  Thomas points out that the rationale of Dobbs is equally applicable  from his perspective and, in my opinion, from his perspective, he is  probably right, for himself and for radical members of the Court.   Restricting contraceptives means undermining women's health, personal  privacy, and bodily autonomy. Now, there are many authoritarian regimes  in the world that don't take any consideration into the rights we have  over our own bodies.   Madam Speaker, we need to do everything we can here in Congress to  ensure that all Americans have access to safe, reliable contraceptive  care. That is why I am pleased to bring this bill to the floor.   And I thank Kathy Manning for her leadership on the Right to  Contraception Act. I also want to thank Representatives Williams,  Jacobs, and Craig, as well as Lizzie Fletcher, who just spoke, for  their leadership on this bill. I am grateful to them for standing up on  this issue, as well as to Chairman Pallone, for moving quickly to  advance this bill through the Energy and Commerce Committee.   This legislation will enshrine the constitutional rights established  by Griswold v. Connecticut and Eisenstadt v. Baird in Federal statute,  ensuring that Americans can access contraceptive care legally wherever  they live.   As I said at the beginning, my three daughters are amazed that this  legislation is on the floor; amazed that there would be a premise that  somehow the Constitution did not guarantee to my three daughters the  right to make these decisions and not all of us.   This is about freedom. This is about individual integrity. And this  vote will show the American people where Members stand on this question  of whether it should continue to be legal for people in this country to  pursue family planning as they perceive they want to do.   So let's vote ``yes'' to promote women's health. Let's vote ``yes''  to prevent further restrictions on women's basic rights to privacy and  autonomy.   Let's vote ``yes'' for freedom. There is a lot of talk about freedom,  right up until the time one decides to restrict that freedom, and then  it is okay.   I urge all my colleagues to vote ``yes'' to protect the Constitution,  the constitutional precedents, and freedom.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Scalise for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, on Tuesday, the House will meet at 12 p.m. for morning  hour and 2 p.m. for legislative business with votes postponed, as  usual, to 6:30 p.m.   On Wednesday and Thursday, the House will meet at 10 a.m. I reiterate  that because that's 2 hours earlier than the usual meeting, but we have  a lot of business to do. So the House on Wednesday and Thursday will  meet at 10 a.m. for legislative business.   On Friday, the scheduled last day of the session before the August  break, the House will meet at 9 a.m. for legislative business.   Next week, pending action of the Senate, hopefully, the House will  consider the CHIPS Plus legislation to  [[Page H6943]]  combat inflation by easing supply chain bottlenecks and semiconductors  that are critical components in everything from cars to dishwashers to  small electronics.    Essentially, all of that, so many things that we use, rely on having  chip presence. That will help lower costs for Americans and increase  supplies.   This bill also will authorize a generational shift in research and  innovation in America, helping ensure the next big ideas will start  here, and, importantly, stay here.   The House will also consider H.R. 5118, the Wildfire Response and  Drought Resiliency Act. All of us have seen the awful drought and  wildfires that are occurring in the West and in other parts of the  country, actually.   A package of bills aimed at helping those living in Western States  meet the challenges of fire and drought exacerbated by the climate  crisis will be in that legislation. It would save lives, property,  farms, and businesses from damage and destruction from fire and extreme  drought.   The House will also consider, Mr. Speaker, Representative Kildee's  bill, the Susan Muffley Act, to restore retirement benefits for over  20,000 hardworking Delphi salaried employees. That is a bipartisan  bill.   We will also consider Representative Quigley's H.R. 263, the Big Cat  Public Safety Act, which would ban the private ownership of big cats  and bring an end to the harmful cub petting industry in an effort to  enhance the safety of our communities.   You may not think about this, but law enforcement has indicated this  is a significant issue for them because they are the ones that are  called in to handle it. This is an effort to enhance the safety of our  communities and protect first responders and safeguard these wild  animals.   The other reason it is on is because the Senate has asked, and I  think there is a possibility that they will pass this through their  unanimous consent process.   Representative Jayapal's bill, H.R. 3771, the South Asian Heart  Health Awareness and Research Act, will also be on the floor to raise  awareness regarding the alarming rate of heart disease in the South  Asian community and invest in reversing this trend.   Lastly, I would say that we are going to have Representative Liz  Cheney's H.R. 4040, the advancing telehealth beyond COVID-19 Act, which  would further extend critical telehealth policies implemented during  the pandemic, while also making it easier for seniors, especially those  in rural areas, to access emergency healthcare technology.   Additionally, Mr. Speaker, the House may consider public safety  legislation, including legislation marked up yesterday by the House  Judiciary Committee with a focus, as well, on accountability in terms  of enforcement.   The House will consider bills under suspension of the rules, of  course. The complete list of suspension bills will be announced by the  close of business today. As always, additional legislative items are  possible, particularly in this last week for us of our planned session  prior to the August break.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the Republican whip for yielding the time.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlemen for his question.   Of course, we are hearing rumors all the time and press reports all  the time about what may happen. I think most of us don't know actually  what will happen. But to speculate, we clearly on our side of the  aisle, and, obviously, there is discussion that continues in the Senate  about taking some parts of the reconciliation bill that can be agreed  upon by sufficient numbers to pass it through reconciliation.   If something does happen, and it doesn't happen next week and it  happens the following week when we will not be here, then we may well  have to come back.   I tell the gentleman the reason for that is it may well deal with the  Affordable Care Act and the premium subsidies that were included in the  American Recovery Plan and then further extended in the Build Back  Better Act.   The reason that is important is because the insurance companies will  be setting prices in September and maybe as late as October. In order  to price their product properly, they will need to know what we are  going to do.   Now, with respect to the gentleman's--and everybody's interested in  this, of course. The gentleman asked the question, I think, that  everybody wants to know: Are we going to come back in August?   I don't know the answer to that, but I will tell you this--and you  and I have discussed this before--one of the reasons we are leaving  next week and the week thereafter is because we have a lot of people  with young children. We see them on the floor all the time.   Of course, schools now are going back earlier than they used to. When  I was in school in the 1800s, schools went back after Labor Day. Now,  as you know, we have schools going back as early as the middle of  August. Therefore, what we have tried to do is have 2 weeks that  Members will have to be with their families on vacation.   So my expectation is if we have to come back that we will not come  back during the first 2 weeks. That would be from my perspective, and I  don't want to guarantee that, but I feel pretty strongly about that.   I am telling our Members that, and I want to respond publicly, but we  may have to come back in August, again, because if the Senate passes  language, if it has an impact on ACA, then we need to let the insurance  companies know, not as a favor to them but as a favor to our  constituents, so the pricing of their product will be more affordable.    I thank the gentleman for yielding. We are all very  concerned about inflation, and one of the things that I talked about in  the Affordable Care Act, a significant cost for Americans is their  health insurance, and that bill is designed specifically to help them  with the costs that they are incurring.   But I would point out to the gentleman: Gas prices, which are a  significant part of inflation, have come down 36 days in a row, have  come down over half a dollar in most areas of the country, and so we  are making some progress, but not enough.   We passed a bill, of course, through this House which talked about  price gouging. I don't know that anybody is for price gouging.  Obviously, how to define price gouging is not simple, but having said  that, I think certainly Americans want to make sure that they aren't  gouged because they have to have a product.   We have also passed the act related to food and fuel to help with  supply lines, to help with competition and help consumers bring their  food prices down and gasoline prices by, for instance, helping out in  the Midwest with E-15 being available, which is a cheaper price.   The gentleman is correct. We have and we are dealing with  inflationary issues. In fact, hopefully, the CHIPS bill is going to  pass the Senate. Hopefully, we are going to pass it here, and it will  have other items involved in it, hopefully dealing with manufacturing.   I have an agenda that I think the gentleman has heard me talk about  probably ad nauseam, Make It In America. I believe we ought to make  things in America, and in doing so, help bring prices down because we  will have supply availability here. I don't know if the gentleman has  heard me use a phrase, we need to stop relying on the unreliable. I  think the gentleman has made some of those comments himself.   I also want to say that there is a lot of, in my opinion, political  assertion of the fact that this administration has caused inflation,  which I think is completely without any factual support. In fact,  although clearly inflation is unacceptably high at 9.1 percent in June,  the OECD average of economically developed countries in the world is  9.6 percent, so this is not something unique to America.   It is a global inflation. It is not Biden policy inflation. It is  global, largely caused by the pandemic, largely caused by the reduction  in supply of goods and the reduction in demand for a period of time.  And then with the American Rescue Plan we saw, not only in our country,  but all over the world, there came a surge of demand, but because you  had had the pandemic and you had sent workers home and they hadn't come  in to produce goods, the supply was down, the demand went up, and  unfortunately, inflation followed, which is very harmful to our people.   As I say, the average OECD, however, is higher than we are. We are  not an outlier. The G20 average is 8.8 percent, just about exactly what  we are, and our closest peers--Germany, Canada, and the U.K.--are all  around 8 percent inflation, so we are all in that place where inflation  is causing our people a lot of pain, and we need to deal with it.   The President has been trying to deal with it, and I think we have  been trying to deal with it. As I said, we passed a lot of legislation.  I think the CHIPS bill is going to have a really big impact.   The car industry and related industries are one-third of inflation.   Why is that? Because the chips shortage has caused literally millions  of cars to be sitting on docks or sitting in parking lots somewhere  unable to be sold because we can't get the chips. Used car prices have  gone up because they are in greater demand. Again, when you have  greater demand, prices go up.   So I would say to my friend, you and I agree 100 percent that  inflation needs to be dealt with. The Fed, obviously, is trying to do  that as well because one way you deal with inflation is to increase  interest rates and try to slow down the economy. When you slow down the  economy what you are trying to do is reduce demand to meet supply and  stabilize prices.   So I say to my friend, we have been doing a lot of things to try to  deal with inflation. I mentioned a number of those bills that we  passed. A number of them are still in the Senate. But let us hope that  gasoline prices keep coming down. There are some who expect they may go  back up.   They are not set by us. They are set on the international market, and  clearly there is no doubt that the war has had an impact on those  prices, a significant impact on those prices. That is not the only  reason because, as I said in our colloquy a couple weeks ago, the oil  companies reduced production by 800,000 barrels per day.   Why? Because demand was down.   Why? Not for a bad reason. The pandemic kept people in their homes,  and they weren't driving, so demand went down, so the normal reaction  of the supplier was to reduce their supply.   This President believes that inflation is one of the top problems  confronting the American people and the administration, and he is going  to continue to work to try to bring that down.   I am hoping the CHIPS bill comes over soon, the Senate gets that  done. In whatever form it comes, I hope it is more robust than less  robust. I think it will have a positive impact on bringing down  inflation.    And it would surprise him.   Mr. Speaker, we have had this discussion for over a month now about  these bills, but also every time we have it, there is the plea that we  produce, and if we would only produce. I bring this statistic up.   As the gentleman knows, as a result of our going back and forth, my  staff has prepared a paper--and they have done an excellent job--as to  what actually is the fact. Fact one, U.S. rig count--that is what  drills for oil--is at current levels of 733. That is up 272 from 1 year  ago. That is a 59 percent increase from a year ago, so that there is no  doubt that we are producing more.                                time  1230    Now, as a practical matter, those of us who believe in the private  sector and the capitalist system understand that the reason production  goes up is because demand goes up and, therefore, companies want to  sell more. But there are also companies that have not chosen to produce  more for reasons of their own business judgment as to whether they  think producing more will cause them to have better profits or lower  profits or stay even.   This administration has presided over greater production in their  first year than was true in the first 3 years individually--2017, 2018,  and 2019, each one of those 3 years--under the Trump administration.   We are producing oil, and we are producing product. We are going to  continue to do that. I can give you statistic after statistic of how  many applications have been approved, are ready to go, and are not  being used.   Rather than just rehash that, I will simply say, back to the issue of  the gas prices, gas prices are lower today in real terms than they were  at the end of the Bush administration in 2008. I pause for emphasis. In  real dollars, the cost of gasoline at the pump at the end of 2008 was  higher than it is today, and it is way too high today.   I was out in Virginia, in a rural area, and I saw gas for $4.36. At  home, it had been almost $4.95, and that was an extraordinary decrease.  I said: Boy, look at that. Then I caught myself because it is still a  burden on our consumers, middle-class, working families, when, as the  whip says, they confront a price of two or three times what they were  used to when filling up their car. So, we need to continue to work on  that.   I disagree with the whip in the sense, Mr. Speaker, that I think the  President's visit overseas--there was some controversy to it. I get  that. I think it was very positive vis-a-vis our close ally Israel, and  Israel said it was a very productive visit. I am glad the President did  that. I also think that it gave additional stability indicating that  this President, although we are focused like a laser on Ukraine and  focused like a laser on the Far East, we are still focused on the  Middle East and trying to make that region of the world a stable region  of the world.
