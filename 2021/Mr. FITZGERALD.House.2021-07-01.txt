 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to stand for life and to  speak about the removal of the Hyde amendment from President Biden's  budget.   The President's decision to remove this lifesaving measure from his  budget was disappointing, as this provision has been in every budget  since its enactment in 1980.   H.R. 18, the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act, would correct this  misguided omission from the President's budget for codifying the Hyde  amendment into Federal law, preventing taxpayer dollars from funding  abortions. In no circumstance should any American be forced to go  against their conscience and publicly fund abortions with their tax  dollars.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the Committees on Energy  and Commerce, Ways and Means, and the Judiciary be discharged from  further consideration on H.R. 18, and ask for its immediate  consideration in the House.
