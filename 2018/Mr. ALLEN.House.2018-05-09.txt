 Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Carter for putting  together this Special Order to honor someone who probably everybody in  Georgia has been touched by in some way or another.   Of course, I rise today to honor the life and legacy of what we all  consider a true legend in the State of Georgia, former Governor Zell  Miller. He was known for his quick wit, and he had a deep love for the  State of Georgia and, of course, obviously from the mountain area in  north Georgia. He was always willing to do what was right for our  State, the State that we all love to call home.   Zell Miller's service to our country began at a young age and, as was  mentioned, he served in the United States Marine Corps, where he later  attained the rank of Sergeant.   Upon returning home from his military service, Zell received degrees,  as has been said, in history from the University of Georgia, and would  eventually use that education to teach college at his hometown in Young  Harris, Georgia. I did not know that he was the baseball coach, but I  was glad to learn that.   After only a few years of teaching, Zell was called to run for public  office, as was said, as Mayor, State Senator, Lieutenant Governor, and  later Governor, then U.S. Senator. It is hard to imagine who has had a  greater impact on the lives of Georgians.   Zell was one of those true conservatives. As Governor, Zell Miller  will be remembered for his great accomplishments, as we mentioned, of  the HOPE Scholarship program, and funding it with the Georgia Lottery,  which has surpassed $10 billion in total financial aid assistance to  Georgia students. Let me repeat that: $10 billion in total financial  aid assistance to Georgia students.  [[Page H3878]]    Because of the HOPE Scholarship, Georgia higher education is now a  national leader in entry requirements and graduation rates.   A quick story about the University of Georgia. On visiting that  campus, we learned--and this was when we were doing our higher  education bill, and we were told that graduation rates were 55 to 60  percent across the country. Well, in visiting the University of Georgia  now, that has been under the HOPE Scholarship since Governor Miller  served his term, we learned that the entry requirement, Buddy, was  1,300 on the SAT, and you had to be at the top of your class to get  into the University of Georgia. And the student body is 80 percent of  Georgians. They only accept 20 percent from out of State, so you can  imagine how much more difficult it is to get into the University of  Georgia out of State.   But the amazing statistic is that the graduation rate is 95 percent;  and those students either get a job upon graduation, or go on to higher  education; an amazing accomplishment for the University of Georgia, and  largely because of the opportunities presented to Georgians through the  HOPE Scholarship.   Because of the HOPE Scholarship, like I said, Georgia is now a  national leader in education. Zell Miller will always be known as the  ``Education Governor,'' and he helped build a foundation that, of  course, our State enjoys today.   During his tenure, he also played a pivotal role in bringing the  Children's Medical Center to the Medical College of Georgia at Augusta  University. We have a special attachment, our family does, as many  families across the State of Georgia do, to the Medical College of  Georgia.   Our 12th grandchild was born 8 weeks premature. Her first year of  life she spent in that Medical Center, off and on, to deal with being  born premature. Our family, among many families in the State of  Georgia, thank Zell Miller for his foresight in bringing the Children's  Medical Center of Georgia to the 12th District. It means so much to the  health and welfare of families in that area.                                time  1815    Zell Miller established Georgia as a State to watch, and his hard  work paid off. Georgia has been named, for 5 years running, as the  number one State to do business. You don't attain that rating unless  you have one of the top education systems in the country.   Zell Miller was the Governor who gave Georgia hope. He will be dearly  missed, and his legacy will live on forever. I am one person that is  glad that I knew him, and I thank him for what he has done for my  family and for fellow Georgians.
