 Mr. Chair, before I came to Congress, my job  was to make sure that those without healthcare and those who could  barely afford it, could have access.   Every day, we would see doctors and nurses do the impossible in the  worst system. And without fail, we all would wonder why no one would do  anything to change it. Well, today we are. This bill does not cater to  a base. This bill does not cater to Big Pharma, but this bill does  cater to that family tonight who is going to have to choose between  paying for prescription drugs or putting food on the table. This bill  caters to the American people.   Today, Big Pharma loses, and the American people win. Because what we  are doing today is giving Medicare the power to negotiate skyrocketing  costs of prescription drugs. This historic legislation also creates new  out-of-pocket limits on prescription drug costs for Medicare  beneficiaries. It reinvests savings so that we can create new  breakthrough treatments and cures at NIH, and it provides $10 billion  in funding to combat the opioid epidemic.   For decades, Big Pharma and corporate PACs could count on their  lobbyists and politicians to keep them safe at the expense of the  American people. Not anymore. Today, the American people win. I urge  all my colleagues to vote ``yes.''
