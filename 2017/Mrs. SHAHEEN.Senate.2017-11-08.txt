 Mr. President, it is hard to read or to listen to the  news these days without hearing about Russia's interference in our  American democracy, its influence peddling, and about the  misinformation that has  [[Page S7075]]  been spreading on social media. I have bipartisan legislation that  would address an aspect of this. This legislation is cosponsored by  Senator Todd Young, and it is legislation that would give law  enforcement the tools they need to create greater transparency about  foreign individuals and entities that are operating in the United  States in the interest of other governments. It would make it easier  for the public to better track information they are receiving,  particularly from governments that are hostile to the United States.   This bill would give the Department of Justice necessary authority to  investigate potential violations of the Foreign Agents Registration  Act, which is also known as FARA. We have heard a lot about that. This  was legislation that was passed during the thirties, as there was fear  about the rise of Nazism and Hitler in Germany and the effort to spread  propaganda in the United States.   This would allow the American public to clearly trace where  information is coming from and who is paying for it. I think, in this  age of misinformation, that is especially important to the public.   At a time when our law enforcement officials, foreign policy experts,  and leaders continue to grapple with the extent of Russia's intrusion  into our democratic elections, this legislation is more urgent than  ever. The need for this legislation is perhaps most clearly  demonstrated by the case of Russian propaganda networks like RT America  and Sputnik International. Both networks continually propagate and  share content and programming that are designed to very subtly confuse  and influence audiences worldwide. If you have ever listened to either  of those channels, you will know there is just this subtle difference  in how they present information.   In the United States, RT America is available on cable TVs across the  country. It is considered to be one of the most high-profile assets in  Vladimir Putin's vast $1.4 billion propaganda machine.   According to an assessment made public by the U.S. intelligence  community in January, RT is the Kremlin's ``principal international  outlet,'' and it is integral to Russia's information warfare operations  across the globe. The Kremlin selects the staff for RT and closely  supervises RT's coverage, including disinformation and false news  stories designed to undermine our democracy. If you have any question  about that, watch RT here. It is on the cable network here in the DC  area.   RT News has publicly boasted that it can dodge our laws by claiming  to be financed by a nonprofit organization and not by the Russian  Government. Recently, the Department of Justice asked RT America to, in  fact, register as a foreign agent. RT rejected an entirely reasonable  request from the Justice Department to respect our laws. They refused  to register.   How did we respond? Well, we continued to allow RT America to spread  its disinformation and false narratives. This is unacceptable. We  responded that way because we don't have the teeth we need in the law  to be able to enforce it. That is what my legislation with Senator  Young will do. That is why it is so important. It would strengthen FARA  by giving the Department of Justice authority to compel foreign  organizations to produce documentation to confirm funding sources and  foreign connections. This new investigative authority was requested by  the Department of Justice, and it is supported by the Government  Accountability Office, the Sunlight Foundation, and the Project on  Government Oversight. This is a good government piece of legislation.   In fact, if this authority that we have in our legislation were in  place today, the Justice Department could immediately investigate RT  America and publicly expose its ties to the Kremlin. In the absence of  such authority, all the Justice Department can do is ask RT to  voluntarily adhere to FARA regulations and hope the propaganda outlet  complies. What are the odds of that? Pretty slim. Clearly, based on  RT's refusal to comply with FARA, the Kremlin is well aware of the  limitations that are inherent in our law.   As we wait for this commonsense legislation to move forward, the  Kremlin, RT America, and Sputnik continue to wield their harmful  propaganda and attempt to influence the American public.   Since the publication of the intelligence community's January report  on Russia's interference in our 2016 Presidential election, we have  learned that Moscow spent millions of dollars buying ads on social  media sites and search engines, often using the very clips that had  been aired by RT on its YouTube channel.   Last week, representatives of American social media companies  testified before Congress and illustrated the lengths the Kremlin went  in order to deceptively spread divisive propaganda, all seemingly  without a trace or any clear indication about the origins of these ads  and RT's news blasts.   The misinformation included numerous reports run by RT News on  supposed U.S. election fraud and voting. So they spread, and they  clearly intended to spread confusion about our elections in 2016 to try  and encourage people to believe our elections don't work, to undermine  our election process. They talked about machine vulnerabilities. They  claimed the results of U.S. elections could not be trusted and did not  reflect the people's will. Sadly, too many people saw those stories and  believed they were real.    These are not just random examples of fake news. These stories are  part and parcel of a broader influence campaign designed and directed  by the Kremlin's leadership and pedaled by government-funded trolls in  St. Petersburg and other front organizations. So in the same way that  Russia is building up its military force, its navy, its ability to  operate in space, and its missile program, it has also built up its  propaganda campaign in ways that are designed to undermine Western  democracies. If we don't pay attention to this, then shame on us.   We are, of course, a resilient democracy. We are confident that our  values and institutions will prevail in the free marketplace of ideas.  Our Constitution, unlike Russia's, protects the right of individuals  and organizations to spread Russian viewpoints, disinformation, and,  even, outright lies. But no organization, including RT America or any  other front outlet for a country that is hostile to the United States,  has the right to conceal a foreign funding source and thumb its nose at  requests from our Department of Justice.   The American people have a right to know if RT America is a Russian  propaganda organization that takes its direction from the Kremlin. They  have a right to know who is funding those programs and what kind of  misinformation they are spreading.   To that end, I urge my colleagues to put an end to the Kremlin's  charade by supporting the Foreign Agents Registration Modernization and  Enforcement Act. Let's give the Department of Justice the tools it  needs to investigate and expose RT America and to fight back against  the Kremlin's interference in our democracy.   Thank you, Mr. President.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.   The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.    Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague from  Washington, Senator Murray, and congratulate her and Senator Alexander  on being able to reach agreement to move forward to address the  uncertainty in the marketplace.   Like Senator Murray, I also want to begin with what we are seeing  going on in this open enrollment period. Despite all of the efforts to  undermine the Affordable Care Act, to shorten the time  [[Page S7090]]  period in which people can sign up, to make it more difficult by having  the site closed for part of Sundays, we are seeing a record number of  people enroll in the initial days of open enrollment.   According to news reports, on the first day alone, about 1 million  people visited healthcare.gov and more than 200,000 people selected a  plan for 2018. That is almost double the number who signed up last year  on the first day.   For anybody who is still thinking about it, you have until December  15, so sign up early. As my colleague from New Hampshire, Senator  Hassan, says, it is the best Christmas shopping you can do--take care  of your healthcare. Go to healthcare.gov and shop around, get the best  deal, and enroll during this open enrollment period.   This surge in signups is especially remarkable in light of the widely  publicized efforts by the Trump administration to depress enrollment.  The administration has slashed the advertising and outreach budget by  90 percent, cut the open onrollment period by half, and shut down the  marketplace website for 12 hours on Sundays, taking away valuable  weekend hours when people have free time to explore plans.   I think the healthy volume of enrollments sends two very important  messages.   First, it shows again that ordinary citizens, faith groups, insurance  navigators, and other private organizations have done an amazing job of  filling the outreach void that has been created by this effort by the  administration to cut back on letting people know about the website and  how to enroll. Those folks have spent countless hours getting out the  word that the Affordable Care Act remains the law of the land and that  those who qualify for financial assistance can purchase high-quality,  affordable coverage.   The second message that I think is important from this strong  enrollment is a message that has been echoed in recent public opinion  polls. It is one that we saw in the turnout in the Virginia elections  last night. It is that a clear majority of the American people support  the Affordable Care Act, that they reject efforts to sabotage it and  they want Members of Congress to work together to strengthen it, just  as Senator Murray said.   I am very pleased that we have come together in the Senate to do just  that. We have come together in support of bipartisan efforts led by  Senator Murray and Senator Lamar Alexander, the chair and ranking  member of the HELP Committee. They have come together to stabilize the  Affordable Care Act and the marketplaces and bring down premiums. I am  proud to be one of the 12 Democrats who were original cosponsors with  12 Republicans of this legislation. This balanced agreement, which was  negotiated by Senators Alexander and Murray over many months, is our  best bet for restoring stability to the marketplaces in the short run  and giving us the time we need to negotiate longer term to deal with  other changes to the health law to make it work better.   I am especially pleased that the Alexander-Murray agreement provides  for the continuation of cost-sharing reduction payments, or CSRs, which  are payments that are necessary to keep premiums, deductibles, and  copayments affordable for working families. They are extended for 2  years in this bill. Without these payments, the cost of coverage will  skyrocket, insurers will leave the marketplaces--as we have already  seen, as the Trump administration has said they are going to  discontinue those payments--and millions of people will lose their  health coverage. This is an opportunity for us to keep that from  happening. Both Democrats and Republicans have recognized that these  cost-sharing reduction payments, these CSRs, are an orderly, necessary  subsidy that keeps down the cost of health coverage for everyday  Americans.   In recent months, I have heard from hundreds of people across New  Hampshire about the enormous difference that healthcare reform has made  in their lives. We are a small State--we have just over 1.3 million  people--but nearly 94,000 Granite Staters have gotten individual health  coverage through the Obama marketplace, and nearly 50,000 have gotten  coverage thanks to the Medicaid expansion, which had bipartisan support  in New Hampshire. So that is about a tenth of New Hampshire that is  covered either through the Affordable Care Act or through the expansion  of Medicaid. And for us in New Hampshire, it has been particularly  critical in responding and providing treatment to those people with  substance use disorders.    Patricia Tucker has written to me. She is a substance use disorder  counselor in Northfield, NH, and she talks about how grateful she is  for the Medicaid expansion. She writes:         I am seeing people come for help that were not able to get       help in the past because they couldn't afford it. They are       getting help and remaining abstinent. If one mother gets       clean, this affects so many others.    She goes on to say:         [I treat] one mother who has two children. She now cares       for these children and has a full-time job. In the past, she       lived off the state and did not care for anyone, including       herself. Multiply this by thousands, just in New Hampshire,       and this makes such a big difference.    And think about how across the country we have affected people with  substance use disorders because they can now get treatment.   I agree with Patricia Tucker and so many others who have contacted me  about the Affordable Care Act. We are grateful for the progress, and we  refuse to be taken backward. That is why the bipartisan agreement  hammered out by Senator Alexander and Senator Murray is such an  important breakthrough. This agreement stands on its merits as a good- faith, win-win compromise. But just as important and maybe even more  important, these two Senators have given us a template for bipartisan  negotiations on other critical matters that lie ahead, including tax  reform, reauthorizing the community health centers and the Children's  Health Insurance Program, and reaching an agreement on the 2018 budget.   The Senate is at its best when we observe regular order, when we  honor the committee process, and when we work across the aisle and make  principled compromises and get big things done for the American people.   In a Senate that is nearly evenly divided between Republicans and  Democrats, bipartisanship is the only productive way forward. This is  how the great majority of Americans want us to conduct the Senate's  business, and this is especially true on matters such as healthcare and  tax reform that impact families in New Hampshire and all across  America.   I am grateful to people across our country who have gotten out the  word about the health insurance open enrollment period that began on  November 1 and continues through December 15. I am heartened by the  surge in enrollments. I am encouraged by bipartisan progress in the  Senate to stabilize the health insurance marketplaces. I certainly hope  the leadership in the Senate allows this bill to come to the floor  because we know we have the votes to pass it.   Instead of partisan efforts to undermine the law and take health  insurance away from people, let's embrace the spirit of the Alexander- Murray agreement. Let's work together in a good-faith, bipartisan  fashion to build a healthcare system that leaves no American behind.   Thank you, Mr. President.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.
