 Mr. President, today I wish to recognize 17-year- old Charles Edward Gray for his service to his community. Charles is a  member of the Montana Area Council of the Boy Scouts of America, Troop  214, out of Helena, MT.   On November 16, 2016, Charles was awarded the rank of Eagle Scout at  his Eagle board review. Charles' Eagle Scout Service Project involved  the planning, building, and installation of three wheelchair ramps at  the YMCA Camp Child where children and families grow, learn new skills,  and have fun in Montana's outdoors. He made the ramps out of treated  lumber and composite planks and installed them at the camp's main lodge  and in the girls' and boys' respective shower houses. The installation  of these ramps will provide access to those with disabilities for many  years to come, making Camp Child a more inclusive place.   Charles is a shining example of what it means to be a local servant  leader and is using his skills to better his own community. Charles,  thank you for rising to the challenge of serving Montana. I look  forward to seeing what great things await your future.                            ____________________     Mr. President, this week, I have the distinct  honor of recognizing Ty Lantis, a distinguished Montana craftsman with  deep roots along the Yellowstone Valley. Ty grew up not too far from  where the Powder River joins the Yellowstone River. During his  adolescent years, Ty's family operated a saw mill south of Terry. He  grew up building barns, garages, sheds, and many other structures. It  is no surprise that Ty learned to make good use of his own talents and  Montana's abudance of trees in order to become a successful  homebuilder.   Shortly after graduating from Terry High School in Prairie County, Ty  moved west along the Yellowstone Valley and started building homes in  the Billings area. He helped build his first home when he was 19 years  old. After a few more years of honing his craft, Ty teamed up with Greg  Schmidt, and they launched their own company in 2003. Ty's Montana work  ethic helped him to discover, develop, and deploy his talents in a way  that literally helped to build a better community. In recent years, his  company's craftsmanship has been honored in the Billings Parade of  Homes, selected as the ``Builder of the Year'' in Billings, and  recognized by the Yellowstone Valley People's Choice Award for  homebuilding. In 2013, Ty's company built the house for the St. Jude  Dream Home Giveaway, with the proceeds of this effort going to benefit  children's medical research. The following year Ty served as the  president of the Home Builders Association in Billings.   Despite the positive recognition from the community and from others  in his industry, Ty remains a humble man who doesn't seek the attention  that comes with a job well done. Ty prefers to go about his business  and do quality work, but ultimately the quality of Ty's work speaks for  itself. Today is my chance to say a simple thank you to Ty for the work  he has done and will continue to do to build a Montana that is a  treasure to all of us.                            ____________________     Mr. President, Montana is the fifth largest producer of  hydropower in the Nation, with 23 hydroelectric dams contributing one- third of all electricity production in Montana. The Gibson Dam project  near Augusta, Montana will provide fifty to one hundred years of stable  tax revenue for the state and local counties, reduce carbon emissions,  create good-paying jobs, and will provide clean, reliable electricity  to Montana. This bill would reinstate and provide a six-year extension  of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission license, allowing Montana  to continue to be a leader in clean, hydropower electricity.   I thank Senators Tester and Risch for joining me on introducing this  bill and I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting this bipartisan  legislation.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be  printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                   S. 490         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. REINSTATEMENT AND EXTENSION OF TIME FOR FEDERAL                     ENERGY REGULATORY COMMISSION PROJECT INVOLVING                     GIBSON DAM.         Notwithstanding the time period specified in section 13 of       the Federal Power Act (16 U.S.C. 806) that would otherwise       apply to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission project       numbered 12478-003, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission       (referred to in this section as the ``Commission'') shall, at       the request of the licensee for the project, after reasonable       notice, and in accordance with the good faith, due diligence,       and public interest requirements of, and the procedures of       the Commission under, that section, reinstate the license and       extend the time period during which the licensee is required       to commence construction of the project for the 6-year period       that begins on the date of enactment of this Act.                                  ______                                         By Mr. DAINES (for himself, Mr. Tester, Mr. Risch, and Mr.          Crapo):   S. 491. A bill to reinstate and extend the deadline for commencement  of construction of a hydroelectric project involving Clark Canyon Dam;  to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.    Mr. President, hydropower is a critical hcomponent of an  all of the above energy portfolio that provides a reliable and  affordable source of electricity for hard-working Montana families.  Clark Canyon Dam hydropower project near Dillon, MT will power over  1,000 homes annually in the region, create good-paying jobs, reduce  carbon dioxide emissions, and produce hundreds of thousands of dollars  in tax revenue for Montana. This bill would reinstate and provide a 3- year contract extension of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission  license, allowing Montana to continue to be a leader in clean,  hydropower electricity.   I thank Senators Tester, Risch and Crapo for joining me on  introducing this bill, and I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting  this bipartisan legislation.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be  printed in the Record.  [[Page S1580]]    There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                   S. 491         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. EXTENSION OF TIME FOR A FEDERAL ENERGY REGULATORY                     COMMISSION PROJECT INVOLVING CLARK CANYON DAM.         Notwithstanding the time period described in section 13 of       the Federal Power Act (16 U.S.C. 806) that would otherwise       apply to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission project       numbered 12429, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission       (referred to in this section as the ``Commission'') shall, at       the request of the licensee for the project, and after       reasonable notice and in accordance with the procedures of       the Commission under that section, reinstate the license and       extend the time period during which the licensee is required       to commence construction of project works for the 3-year       period beginning on the date of enactment of this Act.                                  ______                                         By Mr. CORNYN (for himself and Mr. Casey):   S. 492. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow  members of the Ready Reserve of a reserve component of the Armed Forces  to make elective deferrals on the basis of their service to the Ready  Reserve and on the basis of their other employment; to the Committee on  Finance.    Mr. President, as a fifth-generation Montanan and having  spent 18 years in the private sector, I know how important it is to  receive your fair share in any deal. However, the Office of Natural  Resources Revenue Consolidated Federal oil and gas and Federal and  Indian coal valuation reform rule does not protect the taxpayers' fair  share of mineral royalties as finalized. The rule as finalized creates  high uncertainty and, at worst, could cause many energy operators  across the country to shut-in what is already very capital-intensive  production, placing our Nation's energy and infrastructure security and  good-paying energy jobs at risk. The rule could leave the taxpayer at a  net loss in royalties. This resolution would halt implementation of the  final ONRR valuation rule, a rule whose implementation is already  postponed due to litigation, allowing the States and producers to work  with the Department of the Interior to reform valuation in a common- sense way.   I thank Senators Hatch and Kennedy for joining me on introducing this  resolution, and I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting this  legislation.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the joint  resolution be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the joint resolution was  ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S.J. Res. 29         Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the       United States of America in Congress assembled, That Congress       disapproves the rule submitted by the Office of Natural       Resources Revenue of the Department of the Interior relating       to ``Consolidated Federal Oil & Gas and Federal & Indian Coal       Valuation Reform'' (published at 81 Fed. Reg. 43337 (July 1,       2016)), and such rule shall have no force or effect.                            ____________________     Mr. President, Montana is the fifth largest producer of  hydropower in the Nation, with 23 hydroelectric dams contributing one- third of all electricity production in Montana.
