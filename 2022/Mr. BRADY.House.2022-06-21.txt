 Madam Speaker, on this day in 1788, the United States  Constitution was ratified making that remarkable document the law of  this land, and it began with those immortal words: ``We the People.''   So 234 years to the day after that call to create a more perfect  Union, the U.S. House of Representatives makes history today with the  inspiring swearing in of the first Mexican-born Member of Congress,  Mayra Flores of Texas.   There is so much to be impressed by with Mayra. She was born and  raised with humble beginnings in Burgos, Mexico. From a young age, her  parents and grandparents raised her with strong conservative values of  faith, family, and hard work.   She came legally to the United States at 6 years old, and with the  enthusiastic help of her father, she became a proud, naturalized  American citizen. Growing up, Mayra worked alongside her parents in the  cotton fields in Memphis, Texas, to earn extra money for school  supplies and clothes. With the support of her family, Mayra graduated  as a respiratory care practitioner and has worked ever since to care  for the elderly and the disabled.   She did serve on the front lines helping patients combat COVID-19 and  remains every day an active member of her community in south Texas. She  remains a firm believer in the American Dream--it is a dream she is  living--and will always fight so that others can achieve it, as she  has.   A proud wife and mother of four, her husband serves as a Border  Patrol agent in the Rio Grande Valley working to protect our country  during an unprecedented border crisis.   So on behalf of the entire Texas delegation, please welcome with me  to the United States Congress the Honorable Mayra Flores, her husband  John, and their four beautiful children.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Texas (Mrs. Flores).
