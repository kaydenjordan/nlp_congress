 Mr. Speaker, on Monday night, I had the  privilege of attending the Allen County Right to Life's 20th annual  Uniting Our City for Life Banquet.   The event was a wonderful time with fellow Hoosiers who share a  common concern for the sanctity of innocent human life, from the moment  of conception to the moment of natural death. It also was a celebration  of the fact that our culture increasingly is recognizing the value of  human life.   A poll released last year found that a majority of young Americans  support increasing restrictions that protect the unborn. Another recent  poll found that 61 percent of Americans oppose using tax dollars to  fund abortions. This  [[Page H7927]]  growing recognition that life is a precious and sacred gift is due, in  large part, to the tireless efforts of organizations like Allen County  Right to Life.   I want to express special thanks to Allen County Right to Life  Executive Director Cathie Humbarger and Operations Director Abigail  Lorenzen for all they do in northeast Indiana to promote life and  defend the unborn.   I also want to congratulate Pat Miller on receiving the Daniel Award  for pro-life commitment during Monday night's dinner. Throughout his  career, he has been a consistent and compassionate voice for the cause  of life, and there is no one more deserving of this prestigious award.                            ____________________
