 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss the importance of  water and my concerns with the Biden administration's unnecessary  overreach.   We use water to sustain ourselves; for industrial manufacturing; for  swimming and recreation with our family and friends; to bathe; and to  produce the most affordable, abundant, and safe food supply in the  world.   Agriculture is the largest industry in Kansas' Big First District and  across the State, so water conditions determine good or bad crop years,  the amount of time livestock producers spend hauling water or moving  cattle to land with a better pond, and ultimately, the kinds of foods  that show up on the grocery store shelves across the country.   In western and south-central Kansas, the Ogallala aquifer is the main  source of water and represents the supply of one-third of the State of  Kansas. The Ogallala covers about 175,000 square miles across eight  States from South Dakota to Texas, making it the largest aquifer in the  country and one of the largest in the world.   At the beginning of the 20th century, States began pumping water from  the Ogallala to irrigate the land for agricultural production use. In  arid climates like western Kansas, irrigation transformed the Dust Bowl  ridden region into the incredibly productive land that we see today. On  average, Kansas has about three million irrigated acres with nearly 2.6  million acres irrigated with water from the Ogallala and the rest of  the High Plains aquifer. The Ogallala's groundwater is essential to our  food supply, as it supports nearly one-fifth of all of the wheat, corn,  cotton, and cattle produced in the United States.   In 2018, when I was Lieutenant Governor of Kansas, we worked with the  Ogallala Water Coordinated Agriculture Project to hold the first ever  Ogallala Aquifer Summit in Garden City and gathered stakeholders from  the eight States covering the aquifer to discuss the need to conserve  water and sustain the Ogallala region's agriculture productivity over  the long-term, adapting new technologies and voluntarily reducing water  waste.   Since then, producers like Lynn Goossen have made changes to their  operations to reduce the amount of water they pump and protect  Ogallala. Goossen Farms has shifted from irrigated corn to a wheat  rotation, adapted conservation practices when applying fertilizer,  and changed from flood to sprinkler irrigation. Understanding the  depletion of the Ogallala caused Mr. Goossen to take on leadership  within his Groundwater Management District and work with other  producers to voluntarily use their water wisely.    Efforts at the State level in Kansas through Groundwater Management  Districts have also supported the sustainable use of the Ogallala  aquifer where districts work with communities to set their own water  conservation goals and control measures; develop plans to reduce water  withdrawals in a designated area; and continue using water in a manner  that is economically viable. The research from the Northwest Kansas  Technical College Water Technology Farm has helped producers like Tim  Franklin in Sherman County. The Franklin family farm was early to  enroll in a Water Conservation Area, and uses the technology developed  and tested at Northwest Tech to help meet their water reduction goals.   These voluntary, locally led efforts to safeguard our water were  supported during the Trump administration when they published a  reasonable and clear definition of ``waters of the United  [[Page H3246]]  States'' in the Navigable Waters Protection Rule. This rule provided  certainty for farmers and ranchers, and designated authority back to  States to regulate their own waters after years of Federal overreach.   Unfortunately, President Biden has once again determined that the  Federal Government knows best and announced his intent to review the  rule, likely signaling a return to the Obama administration's WOTUS  rule, which sought to Federally regulate every small stream, ditch or  puddle of water. This announcement is especially frustrating as many  western States currently face an extreme drought, leading to a severe  water shortage for not only our agriculture producers, but also  drinking water and hydroelectric energy generators. Further regulation  adds insult to injury.   Producers and water users at the local level know their community  best, which is why I joined several of my House colleagues on  legislation that would codify the Navigable Waters Protection Rule and  on a letter to President Biden stating our strong opposition to any  return to the expanded Federal jurisdiction over waters around the  country. I have also led legislation that would push back on executive  overreach in our agriculture, energy, and natural resource sectors.   Our farmers and ranchers are the original conservationists and  continually update practices to reduce water use and inputs so that  they can continue to produce safe, affordable food while maintaining  their water supply for generations to come. We must provide certainty  regarding their local water rights and continue to stand in opposition  to any overreaching regulations that threaten the livelihoods of Kansas  farmers and ranchers.                            ____________________
