 Mr. President, I rise today to discuss why I do not  think Betsy DeVos is the right person for this very important job.   As you know, I have been a long and proud supporter of our education  system. I have supported public, charter, private, and magnet schools  across the great State of California. I have always supported a  parent's right to choose the right school for his or her child, and I  have always believed that different models of schools provide students  with more individualized experiences that are tailored to meet their  needs and how they best learn and are enabled to succeed.   While Mrs. DeVos is also a proponent of school choice, I believe we  have very different philosophies on this issue. Personally, I can only  support schools when there is accountability. Schools should be  accredited, well managed with proper fiscal controls, and transparent  in regard to student performance for all of the students they serve. We  owe it to our parents and students to protect their right to access a  high quality education. We owe it to our teachers to provide them with  the resources and leadership they need to become master educators.   Mrs. DeVos has never worked in the classroom or as a school  administrator, and during the Senate committee hearing on her  nomination, she clearly showed she does not have a firm grasp of basic  tenets of education policy or program implementation. Mrs. DeVos and  her family have been longtime donors to efforts to expand unregulated  school choice. Their financial efforts prevented accountability efforts  to go into effect that would have provided regulation over the  proliferation of the for-profit charter schools throughout Michigan.   Additionally, I found it troubling that, during Mrs. DeVos's  confirmation hearing before the Senate Health Education and Pensions  Committee, she testified that she would support the repeal of the Gun  Free School Zones Act, which bans guns in schools. Mrs. DeVos cited  that grizzly bears in Wyoming is one legitimate reason why guns should  be allowed in schools; yet the vast majority of our Nation's schools  face zero threat of an attack from grizzly bears that would justify the  risk of allowing guns on their premises.   Throughout my career, I have been a strong supporter of gun free  school zones. And educators, parents, and students--who are all  directly affected by this law--support gun free school zones. I find it  problematic that Mrs. DeVos makes light of this issue and would go  along with the President's opinion on this issue, considering we had 15  school shootings throughout 2016.   The Secretary of Education serves in a very important role. The  Secretary ensures that all of our Nation's students have equitable  access to a high quality education. They ensure that students' civil  rights are protected under Federal law and that schools are held  accountable for the performance of all students regardless of  socioeconomic status, language barrier or disability.   My colleagues and I have an opportunity to stand up for our children  by opposing Betsy DeVos and demand that the President put forward a  highly qualified candidate that can best serve our students, parents,  and teachers in this important role.   I would also like to mention that I have heard from over 96,000 of my  constituents, whether they left comments with my staff or wrote me a  letter, explaining why Mrs. DeVos was an unacceptable candidate for  Secretary of Education. I heard you all loud and clear, and I want you  to know that I am here to serve you, and I will continue to be your  voice.   Thank you.    Mr. President, thank you very much, and I want to  thank the distinguished chairman of the Judiciary Committee for his  remarks. I greatly appreciate the opportunity to work with him, and we  have a number of major issues forthcoming.   I rise to oppose the nomination of Senator Sessions to become the  Attorney General of the United States. I think some of us and I  certainly have lived through many difficult times in this country, but  today this country is as divided as I have ever seen it.   Some Republicans have said that Democrats are in the anger stage of  grief, but with all due respect, those statements just trivialize what  is going on in this country. It is not trivial, and it is not small.  Today America is a country split in half, with at least half objecting  to the actions of this President, including his nominee for Attorney  General.   My office has received approximately 114,000 calls and emails  regarding Senator Sessions, with 112,000--more than 98 percent--opposed  to this nominee. I would like to quote a few of my constituents who  deeply oppose this President and this nominee and have been taking to  the streets to protect the fundamental values of America.   Here is one from a doctor:         I marched because of the thousands of patients I've seen in       the community, people of color, immigrants from all over the       globe, who are terrified about the loss of their rights and       the dramatic explosion of racially and culturally focused       hate crimes we're reading about.        I marched on Saturday because women must not be denigrated,       as we've seen by the attitude exemplified by our new       President in his unmeasured remarks.        I marched on Saturday because I'm desperately worried that       the progress this country has made in recognizing the rights       of all Americans regardless of race, ethnicity and religious       belief, is now threatened with a roll-back to the `50s.        The American process of justice is a beacon and an example       to the world. Jeff Sessions must not be confirmed.    Here is another:         As a Californian who wants to finish school, as a       Californian with ``pre-existing conditions,'' as a Latina and       as the kid of a South American immigrant--I don't know what I       can say other than please, please, protect us from whatever       is coming as best you can.    One woman who marched after the inauguration came to my office the  following Monday and wrote a handwritten note explaining why she  marched. Here is what it said:         Our President quickly dismisses all protesters as       ``professionals'' and ``sore losers.'' I am here in       Washington for his first full week of the presidency to send       the message that I am neither a ``professional'' nor a ``sore       loser''--just an ordinary American citizen who can no longer       sleep well at night worrying about how his agenda will       negatively impact not only our country, but democracies all       over the globe. America is already great; what Trump and his       administration will do is destroy it.    To my constituents--112,000 have called and emailed to oppose this  nominee--let me just say this: I hear you.   To my Republican colleagues, this is not grief about losing an  election. At no time when my party lost an election or when the  President was of a different party did I feel the way I feel today. For  most Presidents, there is hope--a hope of unity, a hope of bringing  people together, a sense of common purpose. That is what it means to be  a leader of this country, the whole country--red States and blue  States, all of our people.   President Obama began his tenure in office with a 69-percent approval  rating. President George W. Bush talked about compassionate  conservatism. After a terrorist attack killed nearly 3,000 people,  President Bush went to the Islamic Center in Washington on September  17, 2001, and said: ``Islam is peace.''   He said:         Muslims are doctors, lawyers, law professors, members of       the military, entrepreneurs, shopkeepers, moms and dads. And       they need to be treated with respect. In our anger and       emotion, our fellow Americans must treat each other with       respect.    Incidentally, President Eisenhower dedicated the Islamic Center in  1957, and here is what he said then:         Under the American Constitution, under American tradition,       and in American hearts, this Center, this place of worship,       is just as welcome as could be a similar edifice of any other       religion. Indeed, America would fight with her whole strength       for your right to have here your own church and worship       according to your own conscience.    Now, Mr. President, that was the man who led American and Allied  forces in Europe against Nazi Germany, a regime of pure evil that  targeted Jews based on their religion and exterminated millions of  Jews, Poles, Serbs, Roma, Soviet citizens, gays, lesbians, and many  others. President Eisenhower was saying that this country, the United  States of America, would fight with her whole strength to protect the  religious freedom of Muslims. ``Without that concept,'' President  Eisenhower said, ``we would be something else than what we are.''   Can anybody even imagine Donald Trump uttering words like two of his  Republican predecessors, Dwight Eisenhower and George W. Bush?   Instead, there is attack after attack after attack on minorities, on  immigrants, on Muslims, on women, on his critics, on judges, on the  press, and yes, even on truth itself.   There is the President's Muslim ban Executive order, which our  government says has caused between 60,000 and 100,000 visas to be  revoked. That order, which caused chaos at airports around the country,  is now subject to nearly 60 legal challenges in Federal courts. On  Friday, a Federal judge in Washington State blocked implementation of  major portions of the Executive order. The judge, appointed by  President George W. Bush, was then promptly attacked on Twitter by  President Donald Trump. This afternoon, the Ninth Circuit will review  the stay.   To say this is just a stage of grief after losing an election is  really to ignore reality.  [[Page S827]]    Last week Sally Yates had to stand up and tell the President no. Now  more than ever, it is clear how important it is that the Department of  Justice be independent from the President. When she stood up, she was  promptly fired by this President. And not only was she fired, but her  integrity and her character were maligned in an over-the-top press  statement. This woman is a career prosecutor with 27 years of  experience. She was the lead prosecutor in the terrorist prosecution of  1996 Olympic bomber Eric Rudolph. She actually went after a real  terrorist, and she got a conviction. The President called her a  ``disgrace'' and ``weak on borders.''   Here is the point: This is the man for whom Senator Sessions has been  a stalwart campaign advocate. In response to my written questions,  Senator Sessions stated: ``I endorsed him in part because he was a  leader advocating for issues I supported and believed in.''   Senator Sessions was a close campaign adviser and supporter of the  President. He was the first Senator to endorse him. He spoke on Trump's  behalf at the National Republican Convention. He appeared at numerous  rallies. He attended at least 45 campaign events. During the campaign,  he spoke at large rallies, smiling and laughing, while crowds chanted  ``Lock her up.''   Then in October of last year, at one of the Presidential debates and  again at a rally in Virginia, Candidate Trump repeatedly referred to  him as ``my attorney general.''   A month after the announcement of his nomination to be Attorney  General, he appeared again with the President-elect on a thank-you tour  in Alabama. This was a rally where many of the President's campaign  promises, such as building the wall, were repeated. Crowds once again  chanted ``Lock her up.'' The President-elect introduced him, and  Senator Sessions came forward. As he walked out to speak to dramatic  effect, he whipped out a ``Make America Great Again'' hat, put it on,  and pumped his fists into the air.   Already, at this point, he had been designated to be the next  Attorney General of the United States, an independent legal check on  the President, a man who responds to the Constitution and the law  independent of the Chief Executive. One would have thought a sense of  the solemn duty of the Office of Attorney General would have counseled  against appearing at yet another political rally with Trump, but it did  not.   At that rally, as Attorney General designate, Sessions said that the  Trump campaign was ``more than a normal campaign, but a movement,'' and  when he finished speaking, he thanked the President-elect for ``the  opportunity to participate in a movement that I believe can help make  America great again.''   So, to me, this is key. This shows how Senator Sessions views this  appointment--as an ``opportunity to participate in a movement'' to  advance the President's agenda. This is not the role of the Attorney  General of the United States. This is more political than any Attorney  General nominee in recent memory has ever been. Can we really expect  him to be an Attorney General who is independent from President Trump?  I do not believe so.    In fact, a recent Washington Post story reports the depth of Senator  Sessions' involvement in the Trump transition. The Washington Post  reported that during the transition, ``Sessions became a daily presence  at Trump Tower in New York, mapping out the policy agenda and making  personnel decisions.'' In fact, you can search C-SPAN, the Web site,  for video of Senator Sessions speaking at Trump Tower about the  transition.   On November 15, in the lobby of Trump Tower, he said:         My former chief of staff is doing a great job under       incredible demands, and the whole team is working long hours       I mean, 20 hours a day kind of work and just remarkable what       is happening. I'm one of the co-chairs, of five, I believe,       co-chairs of the committee under Vice President-elect Pence.    Then Senator Sessions said, ``Steve Bannon is a powerful intellect  and a thoughtful leader that consistently provides good advice.''   We learned last week that Steve Bannon thinks the same thing about  Senator Sessions. As Bannon wrote to the Washington Post just days ago,  Sessions was--and I quote, and here it is--``the fiercest, most  dedicated and most loyal promoter in Congress of Trump's agenda, and  has played a critical role as the clearinghouse for policy and  philosophy to undergird the implementation of that agenda.''   The Post went on to report that Senator Sessions ``lobbied for a  `shock-and-awe' period of executive action that would rattle Congress,  impress Trump's base, and catch his critics unaware, according to two  officials involved in the transition planning.''   The article says: ``Sessions had advocated going even faster.''   Now, we have seen the consequences of those actions, and what is the  result? Division, legal challenges, people marching in the streets.   Senator Sessions is not a man apart from this agenda. He is not  independent of this agenda. He is part of it. He is committed to it. He  is a leader of it.   Now, let me move to other parts of Senator Sessions' record and what  we learned from him in the hearing.   I said earlier that I cannot imagine a more important time for the  Department of Justice to be independent of the President. Part of that  is because of what we know about the Russians and their illegal efforts  to get this President elected.   The Intelligence Community has reached the following conclusions  about Russian activities during the election, among others: ``We assess  Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an influence campaign in 2016  aimed at the U.S. presidential election.''   Quote: ``Russia's goals were to undermine public faith in the United  States Democratic process, denigrate Secretary Clinton, and harm her  electability and potential presidency.''   Quote: ``We further assess Putin and the Russian Government developed  a clear preference for President-elect Trump.''   Quote: ``We also assess Putin and the Russian Government aspired to  help President-elect Trump's election chances when possible by  discrediting Secretary Clinton and publicly contrasting her unfavorably  to him.''   Quote: ``We assess with high confidence that Russian military  intelligence (General Staff Main Intelligence Directorate or GRU) used  the Guccifer 2.0 persona and DCLeaks.com to release U.S. victim data  obtained in cyber operations publicly and in exclusives to media  outlets and relayed material to WikiLeaks.''   These are just some of the conclusions that our intelligence  agencies--all of them--have reached, including the FBI.   The Department of Justice, through the National Security Division and  the FBI, has an important role to play in investigating and prosecuting  Russians or coconspirators in this matter. The FBI, as I said, was part  of the assessment that led to the January report.   Now, Senator Sessions chaired the President's National Security  Advisory Committee during the campaign. That is a committee on which  National Security Advisor Flynn served. So he was Trump's top person on  national security, and it is no secret that explosive allegations about  the President's and his campaign team's connections to Russia are out  there.   As a Senator, including as a member of the Armed Services Committee,  Senator Sessions was quite critical of Russia. In 2000, he said Russia  is a country where leaders lie, cheat, and steal to maintain political  office.   That was a floor speech on April 13, 2000.   In 2014, after Russia invaded Crimea, Senator Sessions said, ``I  believe a systematic effort should be undertaken so that Russia feels  pain for this.''   This was in the Montgomery Advertiser, March 19, 2014.   When he was a Senator in the 1990s, he and other Republican Judiciary  Committee members called for a special prosecutor because of  allegations of $1 million in Chinese monetary contributions to a  Presidential campaign.   That is from a floor speech on March 9, 2000.   He pointed to the campaign connection and said that meant the  Attorney General needed to appoint a special prosecutor. He said:  ``This is serious business. We ought not to treat this lightly.''   Floor speech, March 9, 2000.   Yet, now that our intelligence community has concluded that Russia,  at  [[Page S828]]  the direction of Vladimir Putin, invaded the American political process  with massive hacks and leaks for the purpose of favoring candidate  Trump, Senator Sessions says that he has not even reviewed the  intelligence community's reports.   When asked in writing by myself in Question for the Record 2b after  his hearing whether he had even read the intelligence assessments,  classified or unclassified, he said he had not read either one.   Now, that is stunning. One of the most important national security  revelations in recent years, and he is nominated to be Attorney  General, and he hasn't reviewed it? Why? He attended 45 campaign  events, was intimately involved in the campaign and transition, but  despite all of this, he would not commit himself to recuse himself.   This should be of real concern to all of us.   Another nation--namely, Russia--has attacked our political process in  a major way: hacking a political party and leaking its internal  deliberations. This time, it targeted the Democratic Party; next time,  it could be the Republican Party, but whichever party it is, we can't  let this continue.   Intelligence and law enforcement professionals must be able to follow  the facts wherever they lead. The investigation could lead to the  prosecution of people who helped hack and leak information hacked by  Russia to help the President's campaign. It obviously has the potential  to create embarrassment for the President and his people, and to  implicate people involved in the campaign.   So the question is a big one, and we ought to think about it. How  will this nominee handle investigation and prosecution into an  unprecedented and major foreign intrusion into the election of the  President of the United States? Can he be independent of the White  House? I do not believe he can.   Let me move on to voting rights. Senator Sessions long ago testified  that he thought the Voting Rights Act was an intrusive piece of  legislation. He acknowledged this again in his hearing. In 1986,  Senator Sessions said: ``It is a serious thing . . . for the Federal  Government to come in and sue a county and say we are going to change  the form of government you have been living with for 20 years.''   That implies a hesitation to use the Voting Rights Act to change  certain systems of election in counties that were adopted to  disenfranchise minorities.   When we considered the Voting Rights Act Reauthorization of 2006, the  Senator voted for it. But he also expressed skepticism about the  preclearance provision of the act, section 5, which was a core part of  the act. And then, when the Supreme Court narrowly ruled five to four  in Shelby County--that is a decision--and that section 5 of the Voting  Rights Act could no longer be enforced, Senator Sessions called it  ``good news for the South.''   What does that mean? It means State after State that had been  prevented from denying the right to vote by section 5 can now proceed  unless they are affirmatively stopped by a new lawsuit that takes time  to develop, and a wave of new laws suppressing the vote were quickly  passed following the Supreme Court's ruling.   He has tried to argue that he will fully enforce the Voting Rights  Act. In his committee questionnaire, he pointed to 4 cases he claimed  were among the 10 most significant litigated cases he personally  handled. As Senator Franken demonstrated in our committee, his record  of handling these cases is thin, at best. Lawyers who handled three of  the cases say Senator Sessions had no substantive involvement. He did  not mention them in his 1986 questionnaire, even though the cases were  ongoing at that time. And now he says he played a supporting or  assistance role in them.   So these cases do not make me confident that as Attorney General  overseeing the Civil Rights Division, he will ensure that the civil  rights and voting rights laws are fairly enforced.   So I asked him questions to see what he would do. I pointed out in  written questions that several voter ID laws have now been struck down,  or severely limited, under the Voting Rights Act. Just one example: One  of the most conservative appeals courts in the Nation, the Fifth  Circuit, found that Texas's law violates the Voting Rights Act.  According to the courts, 608,470 registered voters in Texas lack  required ID, and Black and Latino voters were far more likely than  White voters to lack the required ID. The court found that the Texas  law had a discriminatory effect, in violation of the Voting Rights Act.   Now, this means the Justice Department can protect the voting rights  of Americans in these cases. So I asked him, would you continue to  enforce the Voting Rights Act in these situations? There is now  precedent for it. He would not answer. He tried to say that the Supreme  Court has actually held that voter ID laws do not necessarily violate  the Voting Rights Act.   That is my written question for the record, No. 14.   But the Supreme Court decision he referenced, Crawford v. Marion  County Election Board, did not talk about the Voting Rights Act at all.   So I asked him to clarify his response. His answer indicated that it  was just his own view that voter ID laws do not necessarily violate the  Voting Rights Act. This was a follow-up question, No. 7a. That may be  his personal view, but the courts' view is that these laws can and in  some circumstances do violate the Voting Rights Act. But he still has  refused to say whether he will bring those cases.   Then, when asked about voter fraud by Senator Coons, Senator Sessions  responded that he believes ``fraudulent activities regularly occur''  during elections. He pointed to a single report to support his view  that voter ID laws are a good idea. That is Senator Coons' question for  the record 9b. He refused to comment on data provided by Senator Coons  that showed the rarity of in-person voter impersonation fraud, which is  the only thing a voter ID law can catch. He didn't comment about the  impact on hundreds of thousands of legitimate voters, many of them  minorities and students, who are denied the fundamental right to vote  by these laws.   Now we have the President on Twitter and television claiming that  millions of illegal votes were cast and that is why he lost the popular  vote by nearly 3 million votes, and he is ordering his administration  to investigate that. If President Trump asks Attorney General Sessions  to carry out his partisan, pointless investigation, what will Senator  Sessions do? Is the legendary Civil Rights Division of the Justice  Department going to become President Trump's political investigator? Or  will it defend and use the Voting Rights Act to protect the right to  vote of millions of Americans against efforts by States to take that  right away? I just don't have confidence that Jeff Sessions will fairly  apply the law in this area.   Now, if confirmed, what will Senator Sessions do when faced with  questions on reproductive rights? Will he undermine a woman's  fundamental right to control her own body and her own reproductive  system?   In 2015, Senator Sessions voted for legislation that would impose a  nationwide ban on abortion after 20 weeks. That legislation had a  penalty of jailing doctors for up to 5 years, and it would have forced  survivors of rape and incest to overcome additional and medically  unnecessary hurdles before they could receive an abortion. The  legislation also had no exception for a woman's health and only a  narrow exception to save her life.   Imagine what it is like to be a woman who learns that she has serious  complications late in pregnancy and that she will suffer debilitating  physical health effects if she cannot get an abortion. Then imagine  having to tell her that her health must suffer for the rest of her life  because politicians have prohibited her from making her own health care  decisions. But this is the outcome Senator Sessions voted for.   Senator Sessions believes the case that established a woman's right  to control her own reproductive system--Roe v. Wade--is one of the  ``worst, colossally erroneous Supreme Court decisions of all time.'' In  fact, weeks ago when testifying before our committee, I asked him if  this is still his view, and he said ``it is.'' He even said Roe v. Wade  ``violated the Constitution.''   That statement essentially invites States to enact more and more  restrictions on women's fundamental access to health care. It is a  signal to those  [[Page S829]]  States that if they enact restrictions and are challenged in court,  then the Justice Department may in fact support them and try to  overturn Roe v. Wade. In fact, I asked him about that, and he did not  rule out the Justice Department's pushing to overturn Roe. He left the  door open by saying:         Such decisions would depend upon the unique circumstances       of the case or cases as they arise. I will not pre-judge the       issues.    That is the response to my question for the record 6a.   He even refused to rule out punishment for women who have abortions-- a position President Trump took during the campaign. That is a response  to Senator Blumenthal's question for the record 11a.   So what does it mean for him, as Attorney General of the United  States? It means he very well may seek to overturn Roe v. Wade. It  means the Justice Department may go to court and support continued  State efforts to further and further restrict the rights of women to  control their own reproductive system.   The bottom line: I do not have confidence that Senator Sessions will  fairly and independently safeguard the freedoms of the women of  America.   Let me move on to immigration. Senator Sessions has been the  staunchest opponent of comprehensive immigration reform, preventing the  passage of legislation to strengthen the border and prevent families  from being torn apart.   Senator Sessions opposed immigration reform so strenuously that he  drafted and distributed his own book entitled ``Immigration Handbook  for the New Republican Majority.'' This handbook implied that  immigrants were taking jobs from low-income minorities and abusing  public benefit programs--setting people against each other. More  alarmingly, Senator Sessions voted at least twice against the DREAM  Act, which seeks to protect some of our country's most vulnerable  youth, undocumented individuals--children--who were brought here  through no choice of their own.    On President Obama's Executive action to protect those children-- known as DACA--he doesn't just oppose it. He is actively seeking to  take it down. A recent Washington Post article says he is lobbying for  the administration to overturn DACA. It is one thing to disagree on  policy, but it is quite another when the policy could crush the lives  of ordinary people.   In December, I wrote an op-ed in the San Francisco Chronicle about  the importance of DACA and what it means for Californians.   I discussed the story of Denisse Rojas, brought to the United States  as a 10-month-old baby. Rojas' family is similar to many families with  mixed status. Her mother and father came to the United States to create  a better life for their children.   Denisse excelled in high school and majored in biology at UC  Berkeley. She worked as a waitress and commuted an hour each way to  classes because she couldn't afford to live near campus. After  graduation, she volunteered at San Francisco General Hospital. Denisse  dreamed of going to medical school, driven in part by a family member's  early death from cancer. The disease was diagnosed at a late stage  because the family's immigration status made it impossible to afford  health insurance.   Today, Rojas is enrolled in New York's Icahn School of Medicine at  Mount Sinai, where she is on track to earn her degree in 2019. She  intends to specialize in emergency medicine and work in low-income  communities to provide health care to families, like her own, who would  otherwise go without necessary treatment.   This is the perfect case for discretion. This is the perfect case for  the exercise of a just humanity. But Senator Sessions is lobbying to  overturn DACA. The consequences of such a draconian and inhumane action  would be devastating to thousands of people in my State, and I find it  deeply disturbing that Senator Sessions would advocate for the  deportation of children who have known no other country but the United  States.   If he doesn't believe these youth deserve some sort of prosecutorial  discretion when it comes to deportation, how is he going to act as our  Nation's leading Federal criminal prosecutor?   It is no secret that he believes in an aggressive use of executive  enforcement power in the area of immigration. He testified in response  to Senator Flake that he favors ``a zero tolerance'' policy for  immigration crimes. Immigration offenses already make up about a third  of all Federal prosecutions each year. So does it make sense to  increase that substantially? There certainly are more troubling crimes  at the border and across the country that require the attention and  resources of the Department of Justice: human trafficking, smugglers,  organized crime, gangs, drug trafficking, hate crimes, white-collar  crimes, civil rights, and voting rights, just to name a few. So Senator  Sessions' opposition to prosecutorial discretion caused me great  concern.   Let's move on to criminal law.   During the hearing, discussing sentencing with Senator Coons, Senator  Sessions revealed his view about what a Federal prosecutor should be.  He said it was ``a problematic thing'' that is ``difficult to justify''  when a prosecutor uses some discretion to bring lesser charges or not  to charge the maximum drug charge available.   As we know, drug prosecutions were the most common Federal charge in  2015. So Senator Sessions' view on them will have a big impact on the  workload in U.S. attorneys' offices. If it becomes the nationwide  policy of the Department, it will mean mandatory sentences of 5 years,  10 years, 20 years, and even life in prison for drug charges will be  imposed much more often, because depending on how prosecutors charge  cases, the law will tie a judge's hands when it comes to a sentence.  That is how our system works today.   The mission of a prosecutor is to do justice, not instinctively bring  the maximum charge. As then-Attorney General Robert Jackson said in  1940:         The prosecutor has more control over life, liberty, and       reputation than any other person in America. His discretion       is tremendous.        Your positions are of such independence and importance that       while you are being diligent, strict, and vigorous in law       enforcement, you can also afford to be just. Although the       government technically loses its case, it has really won if       justice has been done.    For Senator Sessions to say that a prosecutor cannot exercise some  judgment, based on the circumstances of a case, to seek a lesser charge  or a lesser punishment, in my view, is just not correct.   We have discussed mandatory minimum sentencing in the Judiciary  Committee. The Senator from Illinois, distinguished as he is, has been  a leader in this cause. It has been discussed for years in the context  of the sentencing reform efforts led by Senators Lee, Cornyn, Durbin,  Grassley, Leahy, and Whitehouse. Senator Lee, in particular, has been a  passionate advocate against mandatory minimum sentencing.   I believe in enforcement of the drug laws. I always have. There are  difficult questions about what actions the Justice Department would  take in States that have legalized marijuana in some way or another  under their own laws.   The bottom line is this: sensitivity and good judgment are needed in  prosecutorial decisions. We want to make sure the sentence fits the  crime and that resources are used wisely. Senator Sessions' comments  make it clear that he generally opposes granting discretion to a  prosecutor to impose a lesser charge or a lesser sentence based on the  circumstances of the case before them.   One thing I found striking was that in Senator Sessions' written  statement to the committee, he said the following: ``I understand the  demands for justice and fairness made by the LGBT community.''   I have served on the Judiciary Committee for 24 years. Twenty of them  have been alongside Senator Sessions. I cannot recall a single time  when he spoke about supporting any kind of ``justice and fairness'' for  the LGBT community or made any kind of statement like this. We looked  and couldn't find one in the Congressional Record either. In fact, the  statement stands at odds with his record.   Let me give you a few examples. In 2011, we marked up a bill I had  introduced to repeal the Defense of Marriage Act, known as DOMA, that  denied married gay and lesbian couples equal protection under the law.  Not only did Senator Sessions vote no--as  [[Page S830]]  all Republicans on the committee did--but he asked questions like,  ``What about two sisters?''--as if to compare same-sex marriage to  incest, a demeaning statement about hundreds of thousands of families  in this country.   He voted against allowing gay and lesbian Americans to serve in the  military. In 2009, he voted against the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd,  Jr. Hate Crimes Act. He said he did not see the kind of discrimination  happening against the LGBT community or women. He said the law was  potentially unconstitutional, which is not an argument that, to my  knowledge, has ever been accepted by a court.   In 2006, he voted to enshrine discrimination in our Constitution by  supporting the constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage  everywhere in the country. What did he say? He said the Senate had to  debate the amendment because of a ``deliberate and sustained effort by  leftists in America,'' ``social activists,'' and ``activist judges.''   He talked about harm to children, ignoring the fact that same-sex  couples are raising children and that denying equal recognition to  their families actually hurts those children. Then he went on to  criticize the 2003 decision of the Supreme Court in Lawrence v. Texas,  which essentially said that private homosexual conduct cannot be made a  crime in this Nation.   The Lawrence decision, written by Justice Anthony Kennedy, was a  victory for freedom. How did Senator Sessions describe it? He argued  the decision was wrong, and ``troubling with far-reaching  ramifications.'' He said it was a ``new vision of social justice,  masquerading . . . as constitutional law.''   He called Justice Scalia's dissent ``brilliant.'' That dissent, by  the way, accused the Supreme Court of ``sign[ing] on to the so-called  homosexual agenda, by which I mean the agenda promoted by some  homosexual activists directed at eliminating the moral opprobrium that  has traditionally attached to homosexual conduct.''   When he was Attorney General of Alabama, he sought to shut down a  conference of LGBT students on a public university campus in Alabama.  This was despite a Supreme Court decision issued just a year earlier  protecting a Christian student group from discrimination based on  viewpoint.   The Eleventh Circuit Court--in a panel of three judges appointed by  Republican Presidents--called the State's action ``blatant viewpoint  discrimination'' and characterized Sessions' arguments as ``feeble.''   Does any of this sound like the actions of a person who understands  the demands for justice and fairness made by the LGBT community? My  answer is no.   How will that impact the Attorney General? The Attorney General must  enforce Federal hate crimes laws. The Attorney General must ensure that  Federal law treats same-sex couples equally; that the right to marry  and be treated equally under Federal law is recognized and protected.   Here we are, I think, at a very difficult and dangerous turning  point. We have a President with little apparent regard for  constitutional or legal restrictions and who is willing to take to  Twitter to target and abuse individuals and groups of Americans, and  even belittle and demean Federal judges and the Federal court system,  just as he did during the campaign.   We have a President who has taken a ``shock and awe'' approach with  cruel, un-American, and potentially illegal Executive orders even in  his first 2 weeks in office, which this nominee reportedly urged be  done even faster.   We have a President who wants to bring back torture, even though-- thanks to Senator McCain--Congress has already stated it is clearly  illegal. We have a President who is already angering long-term allies  like Australia and making ridiculous threats of sending troops to  Mexico.   We have a nominee for Attorney General who is anything but  independent. He was part and parcel of the Trump campaign apparatus,  transition, agenda, and way of thinking.   As Steve Bannon wrote in the Washington Post just days ago, Sessions  was ``the fiercest, most dedicated and most loyal promoter in Congress  of Trump's agenda, and has played a critical role as the clearinghouse  for policy and philosophy to undergird the implementation of that  agenda.''   Do any of my colleagues--Republican or Democratic--think Steve Bannon  didn't know what he was talking about in this email to the Washington  Post? Do any of my colleagues believe that if Senator Sessions is  confirmed, he is going to take off the political hat and be an even- handed Attorney General for all Americans who will tell this President  no when it is merited on the basis of the law and the Constitution?   I don't believe it for a second. I must vote no and urge my  colleagues to do the same.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hoeven). The Senator from South Carolina.    Mr. President, I yield one hour of the time under my  control to Senator Booker.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right.    And I yield 30 minutes of my time to Senator Leahy.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right.    And I yield 10 minutes of my time to Senator  Klobuchar.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right.    I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.
