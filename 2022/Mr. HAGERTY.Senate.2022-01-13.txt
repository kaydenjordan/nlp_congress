 Mr. President, Robert J. O'Brien, Sr., age 103,  passed away on January 4, 2022. A native of Chicago, O'Brien returned  home after serving in the Navy during the Second World War and  graduated from DePaul University.   Soon after, Mr. O'Brien joined John V. McCarthy & Co., the  predecessor of R.J. O'Brien & Associates, where he focused on client  and business research. By 1959, Mr. O'Brien was named President of John  V. McCarthy & Co. and, in  [[Page S219]]  1964, was elected to the Board of Governors of the Chicago Mercantile  Exchange, a position he held continuously until 1977. He served as  Chairman of the Exchange from 1967 to 1968 and was inducted into the  FIA Futures Hall of Fame in 2007.   During his tenure on the Board of Governors, contracts on live  animals were successfully introduced to the market, representing the  first in a wave of innovation in contract design. He was also involved  in changing the structure of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange to make it  more democratic and in revitalizing the audits and investigations  department to attract new exchange members.   Mr. O'Brien's entrepreneurial spirit is best illustrated in his  countless contributions to the futures industry as he built the largest  independent futures brokerage and clearing firm in the United States.  He pioneered new industry practices and created opportunity for others,  including taking delivery of the first live cattle contract traded on  the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, broadcasting the first live commodity  report from the trading floor, and sponsoring the first woman to work  on the trading floor in 1966.   The longevity of Mr. O'Brien's career and the lasting success of his  company are a testament to the focus placed on the relationships that  have been built with more than 80,000 clients, his employees, and his  family. Mr. O'Brien is survived by five children, 22 grandchildren, and  33 great grandchildren.                            ____________________
