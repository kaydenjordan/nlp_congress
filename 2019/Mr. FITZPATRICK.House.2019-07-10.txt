 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a dedicated  public servant from Bucks County, Pennsylvania, Yardley Borough Chief  of Police Joseph Kelly.   Chief Kelly was presented with the Excellent Police Service Award, a  well-deserved distinction for a man who has dedicated his life to  public service.   Before he served in Yardley, Chief Kelly was a 23-year veteran of the  New Jersey Transit Police Department, serving as deputy chief and chief  of operations. Before his service there, he was an EMT dispatcher for  the Maplewood, New Jersey, Police Department.   Upon becoming Yardley Borough police chief, the area saw a 20 percent  drop in traffic accidents compared to the year before, as well as a  more successful enforcement of transit laws.   In addition, Chief Kelly has moved to make the department more  approachable, especially for victims of domestic violence, pushing for  a closer relationship with A Woman's Place and other organizations.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Chief Joseph Kelly for his continued service,  and I would also like to thank all the members of the Yardley Borough  Police Department for their tireless work in protecting our community.     Honoring Theodore Hauptman, Feasterville Business Association 2019                             Person of the Year     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and honor the  distinguished achievements of the Feasterville Business Association  2019 Person of the Year, Theodore Hauptman.   Mr. Hauptman serves both in his immediate community in Holland,  Pennsylvania, as well as the greater community of Bucks County.   He has logged 25 active years with the Feasterville Business  Association, serving as its president, corresponding secretary, and as  a member of its executive board. He currently serves as legal counsel  for the organization.   Mr. Speaker, the mission statement of the Feasterville Business  Association is to foster and encourage growth, progress, and the  betterment of the community.   Mr. Hauptman has shown his belief in and dedication to this mission  as he serves his community with distinction in his practice of law; his  position on the Northampton Township Zoning Hearing Board; and his  positions as director, counsel, and president of the Northampton  Community and Economic Development group.   Mr. Hauptman is a black belt in taekwondo and serves as a certified  coach and referee for the World Taekwondo Federation.   He and his wife are also the proud parents of three children:  Jonathan, Adam, and Allyson, the latter of whom is currently serving  our country on Active Duty as a captain in the United States Army.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to once again thank Mr. Hauptman for his  service to Bucks County and our constituents, and we congratulate him  on his achievement.                       Remembering Kristen Marie Ridge     Mr. Speaker, it is with a heavy heart that I rise  today to recognize the remarkable life of 26-year-old Kristen Marie  Ridge, who, on July 5, was taken from us too soon.   Kristen was a veterinary technician at the Animals' Hospital of  Levittown. She deeply cared about the safety and well-being of all  animals.   Her thoughtfulness continues after her death with her urging friends  and family to donate towards animal welfare in lieu of flowers.   Mr. Speaker, Kristen's selflessness is precisely why we recognize her  today on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives.   She is an example of someone with a compassionate heart having a  desire to help people and animals in our community.   We send our love to her parents, Susan and Robert Ridge; her sister,  Katherine Ridge Mayer; and her grandparents, Rob and Lil Boyson.   May they find peace knowing that Kristen left an indelible mark on  our community and she is now enjoying her eternal reward for a life she  spent caring for all of God's creatures.                            ____________________
