 Mr. Speaker, this Republican rules package is more like  rules wreckage, and it has very little to do with governance.   Adding insult to the American people, Speaker McCarthy and MAGA  Republicans want to defund the IRS so that their millionaire and  billionaire friends don't have to pay their fair share in taxes while  hardworking people in Nevada's Fourth District pick up the tab.   There is a persistent problem with the wealthiest Americans evading  taxes or hiding their money in secret, offshore bank accounts in order  to avoid paying their tax obligations. In fact, according to a new  Syracuse University analysis, low-income wage earners were audited 5.5  times more than the people in every other tax bracket in 2022.   Democrats put people over politics and provided the resources and  funding that the IRS needs to go after the super-rich tax cheats. It is  not fair that taxpayers with lower incomes are more likely to be  audited than high-income taxpayers.   Adding additional insult, their first bill adds more than $100  billion to the deficit over the next 10 years. What does that say about  reducing our deficit?   Mr. Speaker, I urge the body to vote down this hypocritical package.
