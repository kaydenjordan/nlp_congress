 Mr. Speaker, I just want to say thank you to Congressman  Raskin for holding down this Special Order. You do such an excellent  job, you and Pramila Jayapal, and we are grateful for it.   Mr. Speaker, here are just a few headlines from the budget that the  Trump administration just released:   ``Trump Budget Leaves Working Class Base Behind''; that is the  Detroit Free Press.    ``Meatloaf Again: Christie Meekly Accepts Trump's Medicaid Cuts'';  that is the New Jersey Star-Ledger.   ``Trump Budget Replicates Disastrous Kansas Approach. This Won't End  Well''; that is the Kansas City Star, Mr. Speaker.   ``No Help from Trump''; that is the Houston Chronicle.   ``Trump Meets the Pope While His Budget Threatens the Least of Us'';  that is The Sacramento Bee.   ``The Harsh Budget Americans Voted for''; that is the Charlotte  Observer.   ``Another Bad Budget from Trump Targets the Poor,'' The Washington  Post.   ``Trump's Assault on Working Voters''; that is the Baltimore Sun.   ``Surprise, Surprise: Trump's Budget Punishes the Sick and the Poor  While Rewarding the Wealthy''; that is the LA Times.   ``A Slash-and-Burn Budget,'' New York Daily News.   ``Budget Cuts Include U.S. Heart''; that is northjersey.com;   The New York Times: ``A Budget That Promises Little But Pain.''   Bloomberg View: ``Trump's Budget is a Waste of Everybody's Time.''   Financial Times, no beacon of liberalism there, Mr. Speaker:  ``Trump's Implausible Plan for the U.S. Budget.''   So whether you are talking about conservative instruments in the news  or more liberal ones or more middle-of-the-road, it is really kind of  amazing: Everyone seems to share one feeling about the Trump budget. We  all hate it. It is bad. It is not a good thing, and there are plenty of  reasons why people don't like it.   And so I just want to add that the OMB is led by one of our former  colleagues, Mick Mulvaney, and I think Mick is a nice guy. I can't tell  people that I personally dislike Mick. He is nice to me. But that is  not what this is about.                                time  1800    This is about how we are operating in our public lives. In our public  lives and discharging our public responsibility, I have to quote the  Director of the Office of Management and Budget. He says: Meals on  Wheels sounds great. We're not going to spend money on programs that  cannot show that they actually deliver on promises that we've made to  people.   I will submit to you that Meals on Wheels is a very meritorious  program, it costs very little money, and it allows vulnerable seniors  and people with disabilities to live at home. Deep cuts.   Actually, Mick said as well: Deep budget cuts are actually one of the  most compassionate things we can do.   I wonder, Mr. Speaker, compassionate for who?   Maybe those billionaires at Mar-a-Lago--maybe they need a little  love, too, sometimes--or the people who occupy Trump Towers.   Regarding HUD, or Housing and Urban Development, he said: It doesn't  work very well. Tell that to the people who rely on low-income housing  tax credits, section 8 voucher programs, and all types of housing  programs that allow people to afford their housing.   On the issue of school nutrition programs, he says: Guess what.  There's no demonstrable evidence that they're actually doing that.  There's no demonstrable evidence that we're actually helping kids to do  better in school. This is about school nutrition.   Here is another one: We can't ask single mothers to continue to pay  for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.   Well, single moms might rely on the Corporation for Public  Broadcasting to help their kids learn how to read. I think that Sesame  Street is a pretty good outfit. That might be their only avenue.   Here is another one: If you ask, 999 people out of 1,000 would tell  you that Social Security disability is not part of Social Security. It  is an old-age retirement that they think of when they think of Social  Security.   Quite the contrary. People do think of Social Security disability  when they think of Social Security.   Here is another quote: ``Are there folks on SNAP who shouldn't be?''   That is the question.   So we are, again, trying to focus on fraud in SNAP, rather than  worrying about hungry Americans.   Here is another quote: ``Maybe it's reasonable to ask if there are  folks who are on there that shouldn't be. That is a reasonable question  to ask.''  [[Page H4559]]    You know what? I think it is focusing on the wrong part of the  problem. Hunger, Mr. Speaker, is the problem in the richest country in  the history of the world. At its richest point in its own history, we  are being told by the Director of the Office of Management and Budget  that we cannot afford SNAP, Meals on Wheels, and public broadcasting.  Amazing.   I think that, honestly, Mr. Speaker, it is often said that you should  speak truth to power. I think we must speak truth to power. I think the  gentleman from Maryland would agree with me that we have got to speak  truth to power. But it occurs to me, Mr. Speaker, that the power knows  exactly what the truth is: this budget is going to hurt hungry  children. The budget is going to cut seniors. It is going to cut  veterans. It is going to cut public broadcasting, which is one of the  major ways people get news in South Dakota and rural America. It is  going to cut the Appalachian Regional Commission. It is going to leave  devastation almost everywhere. It is going to cut the EPA by a third.   The power knows--and I am talking about Trump and his  administration--the devastation that they are going to inflict on  people. In fact, that is why they are doing it. They just don't believe  the government has any role in helping to make Americans lives better.   Their idea of freedom, Mr. Speaker, is a billionaire being able to  pollute anywhere and everywhere he wants. Their idea of freedom is  amassing great fortunes at the expense of everyone else, all the while  relying on our Nation's military, our Nation's police, the road system;  all the while relying on clean water, clean air; all the while relying  on public schools to educate their workforce.   They say: I did it all by myself. Yet everything they have done has  been with the help of the government of the people of the United States  of America. It is really outrageous, Mr. Speaker.   I think that we are in a moment when we have got to speak truth to  each other, Mr. Speaker. We have got to go all across this Nation and  talk to people in the barbershops, the VFW halls. We have got to talk  to people in the church basement, the mosque basement, the synagogue  basement. We have got to talk to people on the corners and tell them  about this budget. If they hear about this Trump budget, they will be  outraged.   Nobody can support this budget, not even a millionaire or a  billionaire, unless you believe that you are not your brother's keeper,  that you have no obligation to other people around you, that everything  around you should be amassed to accumulate wealth for yourself. That is  the only possible way anybody can stand next to this budget.   I really do hope that the Republican caucus puts this budget up for a  vote. I want to see who is going to stand next to this monstrosity of a  budget. I am curious to see who, representing southern Ohio, Kentucky,  or Tennessee, is going to vote to zero out the Appalachian Regional  Commission; who, representing a northern-tier State, is going to cut,  zero out, LIHEAP. I want to see the Republican who is going to do that.  I think that will be a pretty gutsy move. I guarantee you, your  constituents will know exactly what you did. They are watching, Mr.  Speaker. People watch C-SPAN and they read the news. They read the  headlines that I read off, Mr. Speaker, and they are aware of what is  happening in the people's House at this very hour.   I want the people to know that it is the government's responsibility  to take care of the least of these. If you are too poor, too old, or  too sick to work, we should help people. We should do it. I believe it  is the right thing to do.   Mr. Speaker, I don't care if they call me a bleeding heart liberal-- they can call me anything they want--but I am going to be there for  low-income people who are too old, too sick, or too young to work. I am  going to be there to make sure that people who are out of work but who  are able-bodied have the support that they need to get to work, to have  clean air, to have clean water, to promote jobs and infrastructure.   We are going to be there to do those things, Mr. Speaker, because we  believe in them.   Do you know what else, Mr. Speaker?   We don't believe ``tax'' is a four-letter word. It is actually a  three-letter word. It is not a bad word at all. In fact, it is the dues  that you pay to live in a civilized society. If you think tax is some  kind of a curse word, you can move to Somalia, because they don't have  many there.   Here, we have the protection of our police. We have the protection of  our courts. We have the protection of our Nation's military. We have  the protection of people who inspect the meat, the water, the air, and  everything else, and these people look after us as they discharge their  public responsibility and they get paid in our tax money. There is  nothing wrong with it. We stand on that.   I believe there has got to be a few Republicans who agree with what I  just said. I believe there has got to be a few Republicans who believe  that it is a good idea for the public to spend money on figuring out  the vexing diseases that are ravaging people all over America, like  ALS, Parkinson's, and Alzheimer's. We should research these diseases.  And if we need public money to do it, Mr. Speaker, we should spend that  money. But I don't think this Trump budget reflects that.   I want to see my friends on the Republican side of the aisle join us  and say we should not cut the Corporation for Public Broadcasting; we  should not cut critical programs that help people; we should not cut  supplemental assistance programs, SNAP, and food stamps for hungry  Americans; we should not cut Medicaid, leaving families on the hook to  pay more for the care of their loved ones with disabilities.   I don't believe they believe these cuts are right. I just think that  it is going to take a lot of political courage to stand up and say: You  know what? Sometimes the government does good for people--we have spent  decades saying the government is the problem--and now people actually  believe it sometimes, except they don't believe it when you are cutting  their healthcare, basic research, cutting money for our parks, and  literally cutting everything, except the military.   Oh, by the way, I am the proud father of a military son. My son is a  veteran. He just finished 4 years of service in the United States Army,  Mr. Speaker. He was a combat veteran. My whole family is proud of him.  But I am going to tell you one thing: the money didn't go to him. He  made less than $25,000 a year. He didn't mind. He is serving his  country.   Where is all this Big Money going to go? Who is getting it?   I don't know. People who make the machinery, the weapons industry,  they are going to make out like bandits, you better believe that.   At the end of the day, Mr. Speaker, even the money that they are  asking us to spend is going to hurt veterans. I know they are trying to  plus-up a little on the VA, but there are a whole lot of other services  that veterans benefit from, and they are going to get hurt.   Mr. Speaker, this Trump budget is wrong, and I believe that every  Democrat knows it is wrong, and I even believe a few Republicans know  that it is wrong. We should stand up and say that it is wrong.   It is wrong to slash the earned income tax credit and child tax  credit by $40 billion. This is money that goes to people who actually  work for a living.   I heard one of our Nation's leaders in the administration say: Oh,  you are crying about these people who are going to get cut. What about  the people who pay all the taxes?   Mr. Speaker, if we would raise the minimum wage, you would have more  people paying taxes, because people's pay would be higher. It is no  comfort to say that half the people don't pay taxes. They do pay taxes.  They pay payroll taxes, they pay sales taxes, they pay property taxes,  they pay all kind of taxes, Mr. Speaker. It is wrong to try to imply  that they are freeloaders because they don't pay income taxes. They  would be glad to pay those income taxes if their income were higher,  which it would be if we invested in America, which this budget does the  opposite of. It divests America.   I just want to say to you as we begin to wrap up that our Nation is  the greatest Nation in the world not because of bombs and guns and  military. It is the greatest Nation because we believe in liberty and  justice for all, and not just a millionaire's and a billionaire's  liberty to pollute all they want,  [[Page H4560]]  escape taxes all they want, do whatever they please, without any  ramifications.   Mr. Speaker, justice is also a part of that equation. Justice means  doing right by people. Justice means being fair to people. This budget  is the exact opposite of it. This budget leaves out people like our  veterans. It cuts almost a billion dollars from housing assistance  programs to keep a roof over people's heads. It cuts Social Security by  $72 billion by restricting enrollment in disability insurance programs.   It hurts our national security. It spends over $2 billion to build an  unnecessary border wall. Oh, this wall. Mr. Speaker, in his campaign,  the wall was among the most offensive things, because what it really  said is we don't really want folks from south of the border around  here. That is what it said. That is how they felt. Yet here we are  spending money to prove that point.   It cuts the State Department and USAID by almost 32 percent. Generals  will tell you that it is better to talk it out than to shoot it out.  Yet here we are cutting down our ability to talk it out. What an  outrage.   It eliminates international family planning.   Let me wrap up by saying this. I was talking to some of my Republican  friends--and I do have many, and I am proud to say so--and one of them  said to me: Keith, this thing probably is never going to see the light  of day.    I said: Maybe it will and maybe it won't. But this Trump budget is a  direct reflection of what he would do if he could do it. And that is  scary.
