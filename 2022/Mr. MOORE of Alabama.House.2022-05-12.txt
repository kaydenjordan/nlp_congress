 Mr. Speaker, I have been here probably about 16  months now, and I am really getting tired of being right on so many  issues in general, just the things we talk about from sort of the right  of the political perspective.   We warned that if we spent trillions and trillions of dollars on  COVID that we would see inflation as a result. Now, the American people  are feeling that pain.   We warned that if we shut down the Keystone pipeline, and then we had  to beg OPEC to increase production, we would see an increase in prices.  We continue to see that impact the American families.   Today, I am here to yield another warning, and I hope I am wrong on  this. I really do. I had an opportunity to go down to the border, and I  have been down a couple of times. One of the things that I found very  interesting is that people coming to this country are having to deal  with the drug cartels.   We no longer have operational control of the southern border, no  matter what Secretary Mayorkas says. We don't have control of the  southern border.   What is happening is now we have people coming to this country, and  they have a couple of different options, depending on where they are  coming from. If you are coming from Mexico, just south of the border,  you can pay the drug cartels approximately $4,000 to $5,000. Those  prices, I think, are changing gradually. But if you want to come from  the triangle nations a little further south, it will cost you about  $8,000 to come to America.   Syria, the last price I heard was $20,000. This week, we had a  sheriff's department in Texas on a random traffic stop that had two  Chinese people who they arrested and detained who had paid $80,000 each  to come to our country.   What do the people do that don't have the money to come to our  country? What do they do? What are the policies of Biden's southern  border? What do they do? They have a couple of options.   One option is they can become drug mules. If you want to pay passage  to the drug cartels, you have an option. You can backpack heroin,  fentanyl, or cocaine across the U.S. southern border to pay for your  passage to the Mexican drug cartels.   Now, the thing we need to be reminded of is those drugs are not going  to stay in those border towns. We saw that this year. We are losing  about one person every 5 minutes to fentanyl overdoses. We are setting  a new record level.   There were a lot of sad mothers on Mother's Day this past Sunday. I  talked to a physician friend of mine in a college town, and she warned  me. She said, Barry, we are seeing a lot of young people who see these  drugs online. They might think they are getting Xanax, and they are  getting something laced with fentanyl.   That is one of the warnings that we are issuing here today: The drugs  are coming to a town near you.   The other thing that this policy of crossing our southern border,  this open border policy of the Biden administration, the other thing it  is doing is creating human trafficking.   We heard a briefing yesterday morning. What happens now is, used to,  they would at least separate the child from the mother and do an  interview to try to get to the bottom of: Are these people really  related, or are these children being trafficked into America?   The Border Patrol agents are so overwhelmed right now on our southern  border--the text I heard was ``broken arrow,'' I believe was the term.  They don't even interview now. We are putting these children on buses.  We don't know what cities we are sending them to.   I remember asking an admiral at Fort Bliss: Sir, what are we doing  with these children? Where are they going? He said: Well, we are  shipping them to addresses.   My question was: Why don't we send them back to where they came from?  Now, these are kids who are 14 to 17 years of age. His response to me  was: Well, they don't really have an address where they came from.   You are telling me they lived there most of their life, but we are  going to send them to a Google address in America?   We are creating a crisis in this Nation, and I hope I am wrong, but I  am afraid I am not. The drugs are coming to your community as the left  wants to defund police.   These people are making payments. Most of this money now, the  indentured servants and the human traffic, the ones who don't traffic  the drugs across in a backpack, they are making installment payments to  the cartels south of the border. Most of the money that is being made  is being sent south of the border.   We have a ton of statistics here, and I don't want to try to go  through this, but let me say this: Under this administration, instead  of every 30 years, about every 30 to 40 days, we are seeing a new  historic event, whether it is inflation, gas prices, the border crisis,  or the number of deaths as a result of drug overdoses.   Again, I hope I am wrong on this, but let me say this for all of our  friends: I hope you will go see the border. I would encourage the  President, the Vice President: Please, go see what is going on.   We have an invasion on the southern border. We do not have  operational control anymore of the southern border. The drug cartels  are controlling our southern border, and it is estimated that they are  going to make close to $100 billion on just human trafficking across  the border alone. That does not count their drug profits.   We have a crisis on our southern border, and I will say this: A  closed border is a compassionate border.                            ____________________
