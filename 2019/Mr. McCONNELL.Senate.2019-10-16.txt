 Mr. President, I mentioned yesterday the contrast  between our work in the Senate and what is transpiring over in the  House.   On this side of the Capitol, we are focused on working for the  American people. We are overcoming the Democrats' historic delay  tactics and obstruction to confirm more of the President's impressive  nominees for the executive branch as well as for the judiciary. Later  today, we will confirm a new Secretary of the Air Force and will then  turn to several impressive nominees to district court vacancies in  order to continue our renewal of the Federal judiciary.   We will also keep working on the appropriations process and on  providing the funding our Armed Forces certainly need, and we are  discussing ways to discourage the withdrawal of U.S. forces from the  Middle East and ensure the United States continues to provide the  essential global leadership that has cornered ISIS and other radical  Islamic terrorists and has kept our Nation safe.   So what is going on over in the House?   Those in the House are doubling down on their 3-year-old obsession of  finding ways to nullify the decision the American people made back in  2016. Speaker Pelosi's Democrats are blocking the USMCA, which is the  landmark trade deal that would create 176,000 new jobs for American  workers. They are dragging their heels on funding the government, which  is keeping our military commanders in limbo. All of their energy is  going into this all-consuming impeachment parade that has been rolling  on for 3 years now--ever searching for a rationale.   Remember, it was literally on Inauguration Day of January 2017 when  the Washington Post ran this headline: ``The campaign to impeach  President Trump has begun.'' Well, the Post got it right. Before  President Trump even took office, one prominent House Democrat had  already declared he would not be a legitimate President. Just a few  months later, another was already promising she would not rest until  she impeached him.   From the very beginning of this Presidency, Washington Democrats have  lived in a state of denial. They have seemed positive that some inside- the-Beltway maneuver would save them from the consequences of Secretary  Clinton's defeat. They had hoped Special Counsel Mueller's report would  have validated their theories about the conspiracy between the Trump  campaign and the Russians. They used their minority powers in the  Senate to effectively try to nullify his Presidency by obstructing even  completely uncontroversial nominees to all kinds of government posts  simply because this President was the one who nominated them.   There have been 3 years of this. Now, finally, Speaker Pelosi's  efforts to hold back her leftwing caucus have officially crumbled, and  the House has thrown itself into impeachment.   Given the lip service the House Democrats pay in defending the norms  and institutions of American Government, you might think they would at  least run this so-called impeachment inquiry by the book. You might  think the people who are trying to overrule the American voters and,  from Washington, cancel out an election would conduct their process by  the very highest standards of fairness and due process.   If you thought that, you would be wrong. Our Democratic colleagues  have had their minds made up since long before this inquiry began.  Remember, the chairwoman of one of the committees Speaker Pelosi put in  charge of the process said in April of 2017: ``I'm going to fight every  day until he's impeached.'' That was back in 2017. So this is not about  seriously discharging constitutional responsibilities. It is about the  end result they have had in mind since day one.   Remember when the campaign to block Justice Kavanaugh began with  protest signs with a big, empty blank for the name? It was a fill-in- the-blank protest before they even knew who the nominee was. Now we  have the sequel with this fill-in-the-blank quest for impeachment. The  Democrats' process already speaks for itself.   For the first time ever, Speaker Pelosi has simply ordered the House  to conduct an inquiry into impeaching a President without a full vote  of the House. Just yesterday, the Speaker doubled down on this  unprecedented and undemocratic process by once again refusing to hold a  vote on an impeachment inquiry.   Democrats have refused to give Republicans the same rights and fair  treatment that Republicans afforded Democrats during the Clinton  impeachment--things like equal subpoena power for the ranking members.  Likewise, Democrats have refused to give President Trump's counsel the  same opportunities that Republicans gave to President Clinton--rights  such as attending all hearings, depositions, offering evidence, and  cross-examining witnesses.   We have already seen Chairman Schiff say in public that his committee  had not been in touch with the whistleblower when they actually had  been. We have seen Chairman Schiff bizarrely and brazenly fabricate  what the President actually said to the President of Ukraine during an  official hearing that he was chairing, only to claim that his  fabrications were a parody--a parody--when Republicans called him out  for it.   The same Democrats who are running this circus turn around and claim  with a straight face that they are solemnly following the facts and the  Constitution wherever it leads.   Give me a break. Give me a break. The entire country can see that  that is not what is happening here.   And here is what else the American people can see: The Democrats  would rather fight with the White House than work with the Republicans  and the administration to pass legislation.   We need real solutions, like full-year funding for our Armed Forces  so our men and women in uniform can receive their pay raise and our  commanders can engage in long-term planning; real solutions like the  USMCA, the major victory for American workers and American businesses  that the Trump administration negotiated with Canada and Mexico but  which Speaker Pelosi has blocked for months, with 176,000 new American  jobs hanging in the balance.   Opportunities are right before us. Senate Republicans have been ready  and waiting for weeks and months to do our part and actually make law  on these subjects for the benefit of American families. We just need  our counterparts across the Capitol to get serious about this.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  remaining votes in the series be 10 minutes in length.
