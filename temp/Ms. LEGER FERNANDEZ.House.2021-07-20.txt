 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to save Oak Flat. Oak  Flat is a sacred land for the San Carlos Apache Tribe, a land deserving  of protection under our Historic Preservation Act.   The Resolution Copper Mine, a Chinese company, will completely  destroy the sacred area and leave behind 1.4 billion tons of mine  tailings waste and create a crater 1.8 miles long and 1,000 feet deep.   We have to ask ourselves, will we allow a foreign-owned mining  company to create such destruction? Will we allow them to devastate a  sacred land so they can export American natural resources to China for  their profit?   No.   This project would use enormous amounts of water and will produce  toxic waste that will destroy ecosystems in the area and change the  landscape forever.   We must stand against foreign companies destroying traditional  cultural landscapes. We should not grant China this competitive edge.   I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 1884, the Save Oak Flat Act, so  we can protect this Tribal sacred area.  [[Page H3739]]                                ____________________
