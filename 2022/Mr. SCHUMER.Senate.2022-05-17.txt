 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, it has been a sorrowful, painful few  days for the people of Buffalo, NY. Earlier today, I joined with  President Biden, the First Lady, Governor Hochul, Senator Gillibrand,  Buffalo's Mayor Brown, Attorney General Tish James, and other local  officials to meet with families of those killed on Saturday, to visit  the Tops supermarket where the shooting happened and to grieve with the  community that has been ripped apart by unspeakable violence.   There is no single word to encapsulate what it was like to visit the  Tops supermarket, to lay down flowers in honor of the dead, and to meet  the families whose lives have been forever--forever--torn apart.   It was equal parts sorrow for the innocent victims we have lost. It  was grief for the families who must carry on. Today, I met a young boy,  only 3 years old, who lost his dad on Saturday because his dad was at  the store buying his kid a birthday cake, just heartbreaking.   It was also with anger that somebody could act with such horrible  evil. And yet, despite all that, it was hope. Hope that somehow, some  way, this beloved community will find the will and the grace and the  courage to cohere. I know, I know in my heart of hearts, that they  will.   To the people in Buffalo I met today, I say this: All of New York and  all of America stands with you in this hour of deep darkness. We love  you; we hold you in our hearts; and we pray for each and every one of  you. We will be with you in spirit at every prayer service and every  march and in every moment of silence.   Today, we are all Buffalonians. I just don't know what could possess  someone to bring violence to a place like the East Side. I just don't.  But what we do know is that in each passing day, new and frightening  details emerge about the lengths to which the shooter planned his  attack. We know that the shooter chose Tops supermarket in order to  target as many Black Americans as possible.   It is a supermarket I know well. I helped bring it to the East Side  decades ago because they were a food desert and needed a supermarket,  and I persuaded the owners of Tops to open one. And as the years grew,  that supermarket became not just a supermarket but a community  convening place. And when this awful man went to Tops to do his  terrible shooting, it was like putting a dagger in the heart of the  community because the supermarket had really been much more than a  supermarket.   And we know through online posts that the terrorist--that is what he  could be called--likely visited the Tops market months ago in a  reconnaissance mission to map out the store, to observe the security  guards, and even to find a parking spot. We know all that.   We know that had he gotten away, he intended to carry out more  shootings at another store.   And one other thing we know, we know that his reprehensible views-- his racist, White supremacist views--belong to an extreme ideology of  hate that is increasingly finding home in the American mainstream.   In Buffalo, the President was right to strongly condemn these views  with the whole Nation watching. All elected officials--all elected  officials--should do the same.   The ``great replacement'' or ``replacement theory'' used to be  something that was found only in the darkest corners of deranged minds  and in the deepest trenches of the internet. But today, sadly,  indisputably, you don't need to go online anymore to find White  ``replacement theory'' rhetoric. You can find it on cable TV from the  comfort of your own couch.   And perhaps no network has had more impact in propagating and  normalizing the rhetoric of ``replacement theory'' than FOX News.   To follow up from my remarks yesterday, this morning I sent a letter  to Rupert Murdoch, to FOX News executives, and to Tucker Carlson,  imploring the network and Mr. Carlson to cease their amplification of  ``replacement theory'' on their network.   According to one study, Mr. Carlson has used rhetoric echoing  ``replacement theory'' on at least 400 episodes of his show--400  episodes--which has an average nightly audience of 3 million people.   It is dangerous and un-American for one of the biggest news networks  in the world to amplify conspiracy theories that are eerily similar to  those cited by the Buffalo shooter.   And to those who think this is an exaggeration, to those who refuse  to acknowledge that fringe White supremacist views are now increasingly  out in the open, I would simply ask them: Where were you on the night  that thousands of White supremacists marched openly on the streets of  Charlottesville, bearing torches and chanting, ``You will not replace  us''? That is what they said, ``You will not replace us.''   Where were you when thousands of insurrectionists stormed into the  Halls of this Capitol, waving Confederate flags and donning sweatshirts  about the Holocaust?   Where have you been during any Trump rally, where the Republican  standard-bearer goes on and on about undocumented immigrants stealing  the 2020 election--a message parroted by countless MAGA Republican  candidates across the country.   And where were you when White supremacists shot up a Walmart in El  Paso, a synagogue in Pittsburgh, spas in Atlanta and a Black church in  Charleston--or at a grocery store in Buffalo, NY?   It would be the easiest thing in the world to denounce something as  evil and vile and un-American as ``replacement theory.''   To its credit, this week, the Wall Street Journal editorial board  acknowledged that ``politicians and media figures have an obligation to  condemn . . . such conspiratorial notions as `white replacement  theory.' ''   But while that is necessary, it is hardly sufficient, and too many  MAGA Republicans refuse to do even just that.   And last night, Tucker Carlson did not do that either. He deflected  and refused to acknowledge that a clear connection exists between the  messages on his shows and some of the views championed by these mass  shooters.   He dismissed the shooter's 180-page rant as the product of a  ``diseased and disorganized mind,'' while omitting that the shooter's  mind was diseased and warped precisely--precisely--by online conspiracy  theories that are echoed regularly on his show.   The plain fact is that the shooter responsible for the violent murder  of 10 innocent lives espoused the same false and racist conspiracy  theories that Tucker Carlson has pushed to his audience 400 times and  which far too many MAGA Republicans, including former President Trump,  are happy to amplify.   Tucker Carlson and, indeed, all voices of influence in this country  should come out and not just condemn racial violence, not just condemn  racial theory but refuse to give these false and racist conspiracy  theories a platform.   Let me say it again: Anchors like Tucker Carlson, and, in fact, all  MAGA Republicans and all voices of influence across the political  spectrum, should not just condemn racial violence, not just denounce  White supremacist views like ``replacement theory'' but further refuse  to give these false and racist conspiracy theories a platform  whatsoever.  [[Page S2530]]    It is horrific to see that most on the hard right haven't done that  to date.   Until we unite to stomp views like ``replacement theory'' out of  existence, until we band together to call these vile conspiracy  theories for what they are--White supremacist propaganda--we cannot  find closure to the attacks like the one we saw this weekend in  Buffalo, NY.   And communities across the country, especially communities of color,  will continue to live in fear that at any moment they may be targeted  by violence just because of who they are.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.  [[Page S2534]]     Madam President, I have an amendment at the desk.
