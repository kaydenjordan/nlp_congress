 Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding this  time to me.   Mr. Chairman, I am pleased that my bipartisan amendment has been  included in this en bloc package.   There is a major problem in our country that Americans want us to  address. It is a bipartisan issue related to contamination related from  defense-related activities, and I want to thank  [[Page H4656]]  the chairman of the committee for his assistance in working on this, as  well as my colleagues, Congressman Cook and Congresswoman Hanabusa, for  their work in helping to get this done.   Military bases and munitions storage depots and armament  manufacturing facilities have left behind a multibillion-dollar legacy  of required environmental cleanup.    Under my amendment, the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Energy,  Installations, and the Environment will be required to brief the  Committee on Armed Services on initiatives being pursued to accelerate  environmental restoration efforts.   In my district alone, there is a site that was contaminated by a  Grumman in conjunction with the United States Navy. It was discovered  over 40 years ago. It has contaminated groundwater, which is the sole  source of drinking water on Long Island.   There are people that are trying to get these things cleaned up, but  there is so much bureaucracy, so much red tape, so much finger- pointing, that we need to send a clear message from Congress that we  need the executive branch to work together with us to accelerate this  cleanup.   Mr. Chairman, this amendment will help get that done.
