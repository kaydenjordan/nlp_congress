 Mr. President, reserving the right to object.   The Senator from New Hampshire has acknowledged that she had made  this previous request last week. The Kaiser Family Foundation, among  other publications, has clearly stated that the cost-sharing reductions  she is asking for are paid directly by the Federal Government to  insurance companies. Thus, when I call this an insurance company  bailout, I believe that is literally true.   The Congressional Budget Office estimates the cost of these payments  at $7 billion in 2017, $10 billion in 2018, and $16 billion by 2027.   So what my friend, the Senator from New Hampshire, is proposing is an  insurance company bailout in the tens of billions of dollars with no  reform, throwing more money at a broken Affordable Care Act, which has  been in existence 7 years now.   I know they would like to blame this on President Trump, who has been  in office just a short time--about a half a year--but this is built  into the very structure of the Affordable Care Act, and it isn't  working.   I, personally, will not be part of any bailout of insurance companies  without reforms. That is why we were trying to structure something  under the Better Care Act, which unfortunately we haven't been  successful with so far. We are going to keep on trying, but this is not  the answer.   I object.    The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator  from Arizona (Mr. McCain).   Further, if present and voting, the Senator from Arizona (Mr. McCain)  would have voted ``yea''.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, after weeks--make that months, make that  years of discussions about the path forward to rescue the American  people from ObamaCare, we find ourselves at an important fork in the  road.   We have talked among ourselves about the necessity of keeping our  promises to repeal and replace ObamaCare. We are coming down to the  reality that, without the Democrats being willing to participate in the  process and given the strictures of the budget reconciliation process,  it is not going to be possible for us to do as much as we would like to  do. We will continue to talk, and my hope is that we will continue to  make progress with some sort of consensus on how best to proceed.   In the meantime, we do have a bill that 51 Republicans voted for in  2015 to repeal ObamaCare and leave 2 years available for a transition  on a bipartisan basis. Here is my concern. Under ObamaCare, there are  massive amounts of money being paid to insurance companies for  something called cost sharing in order to try to help bring the  premiums down, in order to try to help bring the deductibles down to  make them affordable. It is pretty clear it is not working, given the  105-percent increase in premiums since 2013 alone under ObamaCare.  Right now, we know the individual market, which is the insurance market  where individuals and where small businesses buy their health  insurance, is in a meltdown mode. That is after 7 years of ObamaCare.   Our friends across the aisle would like to convince you that in the 6  months or so President Trump has been in office, he has been the cause  of that. It is not true.   Many of us, myself included, would love to see us stabilize the  individual insurance market while we get some important reforms done to  try to help bring premiums down in order to reassure people that we are  going to protect preexisting conditions and while we do some additional  important work on Medicaid reform.   I would be lying if I said that this is easy. Frankly, people didn't  send us here to do easy stuff. They sent us here to do the hard stuff,  and we need to continue to use our best efforts to keep our commitments  and to deliver something better than the broken status quo of  ObamaCare.   My concern is, if we are unsuccessful in doing that--we have already  seen, for example, our friend, the distinguished Senator from New  Hampshire, propose some additional mandatory cost sharing for insurance  companies. According to the Kaiser Foundation, these are direct  payments from taxpayers to insurance companies. Rather than working  with us to try to make a course correction in ObamaCare and to put it  on a sustainable path--our friends across the aisle want none of that.  What they want is the cash. They want the billions of dollars that are  going to go to insurance companies and no reform.   I personally find that to be an unacceptable alternative. We do need  to do something to protect people who are being hurt right now from the  sky-high premiums and the deductibles that render their health  insurance unaffordable. My concern is, to be absolutely candid with  you, right now the President is authorizing on a month-to-month basis  the cost-sharing payments, which are sustaining the market as it  currently is--not well enough, given the structural problems, but at  least keeping some insurance companies available in most places,  although not all.   My concern is, unless we pass something like the Better Care Act, we  are left with an untenable alternative. The President's statement that  he may decide not to make those cost-sharing payments would provoke an  immediate crisis in the marketplace, which would force us to act. I  don't think that is inherently bad, but I want to make sure that we act  in a constructive way, that we are not just throwing billions more  dollars at a broken system, but that we actually implement the reforms  to put it on the right path.   I know in Washington people tend to think in terms of Republicans and  Democrats, and this is all about Obama, this is about Trump, this is  about personalities. It is not. It is not even about politics. It  shouldn't be, ultimately. This should be about the people we represent  in our States and the people we represent across the country. How can  we do the best job, given the difficult hand we have been given, to try  to help make things better?  [[Page S4041]]    This is not going to be the end of the process. This is another step  along the journey toward helping to make healthcare more affordable and  more accessible.   There is a lot of great work that has been done. As the Presiding  Officer knows, he has been at the forefront of trying to make sure we  address things like the opioid crisis, which is devastating communities  across the country. I was here showing a chart yesterday that the  Presiding Officer has seen, showing HIV deaths going way down thanks to  modern drugs, car wrecks were still in the 30,000 range, but deaths as  a result of overdoses were up around 52,000 a year, I think, is the  rough number. That is a public health crisis.    We need to do everything we can to make sure we are delivering  services to the people who need it most who are suffering, but if all  we do is bail out insurance companies, we will not have done our job,  especially toward the communities hurt by the opioid crisis.   We are going to continue to work, but at some point we are going to  have to vote, and, yes, people are going to have to be put on record.  Now, we are all grownups. Most of us have held political office for a  fair time now. We know how to explain our votes to the voters back  home, to whom we are accountable.   If you don't vote, then nobody is accountable, and everybody can  blame each other for the outcome. I really do worry, unless we redouble  our efforts to come up with meaningful reforms to the broken ObamaCare  system, that we will be left with an untenable choice, either an  insurance company bailout of the same flawed structure of ObamaCare or  an immediate crisis that is going to force us to act and do the bailout  without any reforms.   Mr. President, the other thing I just want to point out, in the  closing minutes I wish to speak, is the process by which our Democratic  friends have dragged their heels to the point of almost bringing this  place to a halt, particularly when it comes to a new President getting  votes on his nominees for Cabinet positions and sub-Cabinet positions.  They are the first to criticize the President for not getting things  done that he wants to get done, but when they sabotage his ability to  try to populate these important positions in the Cabinet and sub- Cabinet positions by dragging their heels on nominations, they are  causing a large part of the problem.   To put this in perspective, in 2009, 90 percent of President Obama's  confirmations happened by voice vote. That is without a recorded vote,  and that is without 30 hours expiring after voting and closing off the  debate. This was just essentially an agreement in 90 percent of the  cases.   Democrats in the Senate under the Trump administration have allowed  only 10 percent of his nominees to be voice-voted. We allowed 90  percent for President Obama. We didn't agree with President Obama on a  lot of things, but we agreed that he won the election, and he was  entitled to populate his Cabinet and sub-Cabinet with people of his  choice, assuming they weren't disqualified for some other reason.   Well, this week, we have considered Patrick Shanahan, nominated to be  Defense Secretary of the Department of Defense, which is a role vitally  important to the Department as it works through readiness,  modernization, and of course the service to our men and women in  uniform, providing them the tools and equipment and the training they  need in order to protect the country. In order to accomplish that, the  Defense Department needs a full team.   We spend more than $600 billion a year on national defense, and yet  the President can't get his full team put in place on a timely basis  because of partisan foot-dragging.   Well, it serves another purpose, I suppose, because the more we are  tied up on nominations, the less time we have to deal with legislation.  These kinds of tactics remind me of the former majority leader, Harry  Reid, whose political schemes cost his party a 60-vote, filibuster- proof majority.   I know the distinguished senior Senator from New York, my friend, the  Democratic leader, remembers that when Members of his own party can't  bring back home any record of accomplishment for what they have done  during their time here in Washington, it is pretty hard to make the  case you should be reelected. After Harry Reid blocked participation,  not just from the minority but also from the majority so they couldn't  go back home and demonstrate that they had fought and accomplished  things for their constituents, their party suffered a very tough  political price.   So I would urge our colleagues to end this perpetual obstruction on  nominations, legislation, and everything else. Noncontroversial  nominees should not require days to get confirmed or judges, for that  matter, should not require a 30-hour postcloture vote in order to get  confirmed by more than 90 votes. That indicates it is not a  controversial vote so why burn up the time except out of spite or  desire to slow down this administration or this Congress in terms of  getting things done.   The American people sorely want leaders at every level of our  government. They are hungry for us to lead and to demonstrate we are  listening to them and doing what we believe to be in their best  interest, and they deserve a Senate that fulfills one of our most  fundamental responsibilities, which is to consider and vote on  Presidential nominees.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                  S. 1574         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Vietnam Human Rights       Sanctions Act of 2017''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress makes the following findings:        (1) The relationship between the United States and the       Socialist Republic of Vietnam has grown substantially since       the end of the trade embargo in 1994, with annual trade       between the countries reaching more than $36,000,000,000 in       2014.        (2) However, the transition by the Government of Vietnam       toward greater economic activity and trade, which has led to       increased bilateral engagement between the United States and       Vietnam, has not been matched by greater political freedom or       substantial improvements in basic human rights for the people       of Vietnam.        (3) Vietnam remains an authoritarian state ruled by the       Communist Party of Vietnam, which continues to deny the right       of the people of Vietnam to participate in free and fair       elections.        (4) According to the Department of State's 2014 Country       Reports on Human Rights Practices, Vietnam's ``most       significant human rights problems . . . were severe       government restrictions of citizens' political rights,       particularly their right to change their government through       free and fair elections; limits  [[Page S4058]]       on citizens' civil liberties, including freedom of assembly       and expression; and inadequate protection of citizens' due       process rights, including protection against arbitrary       detention''.        (5) The Country Reports also state that the Government of       Vietnam ``continued to restrict speech that criticized       individual government leaders; promoted political pluralism       or multi-party democracy; or questioned policies on sensitive       matters, such as human rights, religious freedom, or       sovereignty disputes with China'' and ``sought to impede       criticism by monitoring meetings and communications of       political activists''.        (6) Furthermore, the Department of State documents that       ``arbitrary arrest and detention, particularly for political       activists, remained a problem'', with the Government of       Vietnam sentencing 29 arrested activists during 2014. Of       those, 6 activists were convicted on national security       charges in the penal code for ``undermining the unity       policy'', 17 for ``causing public disorder'', and 6 for       ``abusing democratic freedoms''.        (7) At the end of 2014, the Government of Vietnam       reportedly held more than 125 political prisoners.        (8) On September 24, 2012, 3 prominent Vietnamese       bloggers--Nguyen Van Hai (also known as Dieu Cay), Ta Phong       Tan, and Phan Thanh Hai (also known as Anh Ba Saigon)--were       sentenced to prison based on 3-year-old blog postings       criticizing the Government and leaders of Vietnam and the       Communist Party of Vietnam. Nguyen Van Hai served 2 years of       a 12-year prison sentence on charges of ``conducting       propaganda against the state'' but was later released and       departed from Vietnam. If he were to return, he would likely       have to complete his prison sentence.        (9) United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi       Pillay responded to the sentencing of the bloggers on       September 25, 2012, stating that ``[t]he harsh prison terms       handed down to bloggers exemplify the severe restrictions on       freedom of expression in Vietnam'' and calling the sentences       an ``unfortunate development that undermines the commitments       Vietnam has made internationally . . . to protect and promote       the right to freedom of expression''.        (10) On March 21, 2013, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State       for Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor Daniel B. Baer       testified before the Subcommittee on East Asian and Pacific       Affairs of the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate       that ``in Vietnam we've been disappointed in recent years to       see backsliding, particularly on . . . freedom of expression       issues . . . people are being prosecuted for what they say       online under really draconian national security laws . . .       that is an issue that we continue to raise, both in our human       rights dialogue with the Vietnamese as well as in other       bilateral engagements''.        (11) Although the Constitution of Vietnam provides for       freedom of religion, the Department of State's 2013       International Religious Freedom Report maintains,       ``Government practices and bureaucratic impediments       restricted religious freedom. Unregistered and unrecognized       religious groups were often subject to harassment, as well as       coercive and punitive actions by authorities.''.        (12) Likewise, the United States Commission on       International Religious Freedom 2015 Annual Report states,       ``The Vietnamese government continues to control all       religious activities through law and administrative       oversight, restrict severely independent religious practice,       and repress individuals and religious groups it views as       challenging its authority, including independent Buddhists,       Hoa Hao, Cao Dai, Catholics, and Protestants.''.        (13) The 2013 Annual Report notes that in 2004 the United       States designated Vietnam as a country of particular concern       for religious freedom pursuant to section 402(b)(1) of the       International Religious Freedom Act of 1998 (22 U.S.C.       6442(b)(1)), and that Vietnam responded at that time by       releasing prisoners, prohibiting the policy of forced       renunciations of faith, and expanding protections for       religious groups, and that ``[m]ost religious leaders in       Vietnam attributed these positive changes to the [country of       particular concern] designation and the priority placed on       religious freedom concerns in U.S.-Vietnamese bilateral       relations''.        (14) However, the 2013 Annual Report concludes that since       the designation as a country of particular concern was lifted       from Vietnam in 2006, ``religious freedom conditions in       Vietnam remain mixed'', and therefore recommends to the       Department of State that Vietnam should be redesignated as a       country of particular concern.        (15) Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Baer likewise       testified that ``[i]n Vietnam the right to religious freedom,       which seemed to be improving several years ago, has been       stagnant for several years''.       SEC. 3. IMPOSITION OF SANCTIONS ON CERTAIN INDIVIDUALS WHO                     ARE COMPLICIT IN HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES COMMITTED                     AGAINST NATIONALS OF VIETNAM OR THEIR FAMILY                     MEMBERS.

(3) Convention against torture.--The term ``Convention       against Torture'' means the United Nations Convention against       Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or       Punishment, done at New York on December 10, 1984.        (4) United states person.--The term ``United States       person'' means--        (A) a United States citizen or an alien lawfully admitted       for permanent residence to the United States; or        (B) an entity organized under the laws of the United States       or of any jurisdiction within the United States, including a       foreign branch of such an entity.        (b) Imposition of Sanctions.--Except as provided in       subsections (e) and (f), the President shall impose the       sanctions described in subsection (d) with respect to each       individual on the list required by subsection (c)(1).

SEC. 4. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON DESIGNATION OF VIETNAM AS A                     COUNTRY OF PARTICULAR CONCERN WITH RESPECT TO                     RELIGIOUS FREEDOM.         It is the sense of Congress that--        (1) the relationship between the United States and Vietnam       cannot progress while the record of the Government of Vietnam       with respect to human rights and the rule of law continues to       deteriorate;        (2) the designation of Vietnam as a country of particular       concern for religious freedom  [[Page S4059]]       pursuant to section 402(b)(1) of the International Religious       Freedom Act of 1998 (22 U.S.C. 6442(b)(1)) would be a       powerful and effective tool in highlighting abuses of       religious freedom in Vietnam and in encouraging improvement       in the respect for human rights in Vietnam; and        (3) the Secretary of State should, in accordance with the       recommendation of the United States Commission on       International Religious Freedom, designate Vietnam as a       country of particular concern for religious freedom.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                  S. 1574         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

Baer       testified before the Subcommittee on East Asian and Pacific       Affairs of the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate       that ``in Vietnam we've been disappointed in recent years to       see backsliding, particularly on . . . freedom of expression       issues . . . people are being prosecuted for what they say       online under really draconian national security laws . . .       that is an issue that we continue to raise, both in our human       rights dialogue with the Vietnamese as well as in other       bilateral engagements''.        (11) Although the Constitution of Vietnam provides for       freedom of religion, the Department of State's 2013       International Religious Freedom Report maintains,       ``Government practices and bureaucratic impediments       restricted religious freedom. Unregistered and unrecognized       religious groups were often subject to harassment, as well as       coercive and punitive actions by authorities.''.        (12) Likewise, the United States Commission on       International Religious Freedom 2015 Annual Report states,       ``The Vietnamese government continues to control all       religious activities through law and administrative       oversight, restrict severely independent religious practice,       and repress individuals and religious groups it views as       challenging its authority, including independent Buddhists,       Hoa Hao, Cao Dai, Catholics, and Protestants.''.        (13) The 2013 Annual Report notes that in 2004 the United       States designated Vietnam as a country of particular concern       for religious freedom pursuant to section 402(b)(1) of the       International Religious Freedom Act of 1998 (22 U.S.C.       6442(b)(1)), and that Vietnam responded at that time by       releasing prisoners, prohibiting the policy of forced       renunciations of faith, and expanding protections for       religious groups, and that ``[m]ost religious leaders in       Vietnam attributed these positive changes to the [country of       particular concern] designation and the priority placed on       religious freedom concerns in U.S.-Vietnamese bilateral       relations''.        (14) However, the 2013 Annual Report concludes that since       the designation as a country of particular concern was lifted       from Vietnam in 2006, ``religious freedom conditions in       Vietnam remain mixed'', and therefore recommends to the       Department of State that Vietnam should be redesignated as a       country of particular concern.        (15) Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Baer likewise       testified that ``[i]n Vietnam the right to religious freedom,       which seemed to be improving several years ago, has been       stagnant for several years''.
