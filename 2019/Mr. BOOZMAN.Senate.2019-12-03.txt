 In the interest of time, I am going to put my remarks in  the Record, but I do want to take just a moment to thank Johnny for his  friendship. I won a special election to the House of Representatives  and was assigned to the Transportation Committee. Literally, Johnny was  one of the first people I met there. He was an important person on  Transportation.   I was the 435th Member of the House, and he was so very, very kind.  He helped me get acclimated.   His wife Dianne was just wonderful to my wife Cathy when I came to  the Senate. Nobody was any nicer, again, helping her to get acclimated  to the ways of the Senate, and, certainly, this is a family affair. We  appreciate that so very much.   I had the honor of serving on the Veterans Affairs Committee. The  reality is, we got a bunch done under your leadership. We appreciate  that so very much.   Proverbs tells us that a good man is worth more than silver and gold,  and that is really what this has all been about this afternoon, just  hearing Member after Member express the good name of Johnny Isakson. We  appreciate you, Johnny. We truly will miss you more than you know.   I yield back.
