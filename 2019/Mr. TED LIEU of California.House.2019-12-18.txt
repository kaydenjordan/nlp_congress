 Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Nadler for  his leadership.   Let's start by making this very simple. No one in America could do  what Donald Trump did and get away with it. No American elected  official can call up a foreign government and ask for an investigation  of a political opponent. No Member of Congress can call up a foreign  official and ask for help in our reelection campaign. If we did that,  we would likely get indicted.   No one is above the law, and the Constitution is the supreme law of  the land.   I first swore an oath to the Constitution when I joined the United  States Air Force on Active Duty. The oath I took was not to a political  party or to a President or to a king; it was to a document that has  made America the greatest nation on Earth, and that document contains a  safeguard for when the President's abuse of power is so extreme that it  warrants impeachment.   We are not here because of policy disputes. While I disagree with the  President, I acknowledge he has the right to restrict the number of  refugees entering our country, he has the right to eliminate  environmental executive orders, and he has the right to sign a bill  that has given tax breaks to the wealthy.   But the President does not have the right to cheat and to solicit  foreign interference in our elections. That is illegal, it is not what  the voters elected him to do, and we will not stand for it.   The President's actions in this case were particularly insidious,  because he also used our government for his private gain.   He conditioned taxpayer-funded military aid and a critical White  House meeting with the Ukrainian president on the requirement that  Ukraine publicly announce an investigation into his opponent. And by  harming Ukrainian national security, the President also harmed U.S.  national security.                                time  1245    Then, the President solicited foreign interference again on the south  lawn of the White House when he again asked Ukraine to investigate his  political opponent. Then, he asked China, our peer competitor, to do  the same. That abuse of power is not acceptable.   Whether or not the Senate convicts, the House has an independent duty  to do the right thing. That is why we have passed over 275 bipartisan  bills that are stuck in the Senate. Whether impeaching or legislating,  we will continue to be faithful to the Constitution, regardless of what  the Senate may or may not do.   Moreover, impeachment is a form of deterrence. Our children are  watching. No President ever wants to be impeached. Whether Donald Trump  leaves in 1 month, 1 year, or 5 years, this impeachment is permanent.  It will follow him around for the rest of his life. History books will  record it, and the people will know why we impeached.   It is all very simple. No one is above the law, not our Commander in  Chief, not our President.
