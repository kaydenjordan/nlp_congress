 Mr. Speaker, in the past year, you might  have noticed a difference while doing your taxes.   If you called IRS with a question, you waited on the phone for maybe  5 minutes instead of 30 or more from years past.   If you got your tax refund in a reasonable amount of time, there is a  difference. If you are one of the Americans who attempted to evade  taxes and ended up paying your fair share, you can thank the Inflation  Reduction Act for that.   This historic legislation has enabled the IRS to be better funded,  better staffed, and better at getting hard-earned money back to the  people.   My constituents have noticed. When we legislated $80 billion over the  next decade to modernize IRS, Republicans  [[Page H2768]]  set out spreading disinformation and fear: agents coming out to get  you.   They were wrong. They knew that was not the case, but they wanted to  demonize IRS anyway. Instead, what happened? We saw improvements.   In one of the most immediate results from a bill I have ever seen,  wait times are down to 4 minutes across the country. Tax returns are  arriving without months-long delays.   In my own office, we had more than 250 cases open at any one time,  trying to help constituents. Now that number is below 60.   Again, Republicans launched an attack on IRS funding during their  manufactured debt ceiling crisis of the last few weeks.   Thankfully, their success against IRS was limited. They were able to  claw back only a small portion of that funding that we set forward.   Still, their opposition is incomprehensible. Republicans say they  don't like government, that government doesn't work. President Biden  and congressional Democrats reveal that when we fund government  properly, it does work.   I thank the IRS team for their hard work on behalf of my constituents  and Americans all across this country.                             A Scourge in America     Mr. Speaker, every year in this country,  43,000 people, 44,000 people--in one year, as high as 49,000 people-- die of gun violence.   Every single day, we lose people in this country to gun violence. Mr.  Speaker, 54 percent of that horrific number is gun violence suicide.   This week the Gun Violence Prevention Task Force held a hearing, and  we had six, eight, nine folks testifying before us: folks who had  survived mass shootings; folks whose family members lost their lives  due to gun violence and suicide; and folks who had accidental shootings  take place in their communities that harmed and took the lives of  others.   When we asked for a committee room in this Capitol in order to host  that testimony and to learn something more about it, guess what  happened?   It was Monday, a fly-in day, when these committee rooms are not busy.  There was no room in the House for that committee to be hosted, so we  had to go to the Senate.   Committee chair after committee chair of the Republican Party, the  majority party, denied us access to a committee room to simply hear the  testimony of those who know something sad and tragic all too well about  gun violence.   We had the benefit of the Senate giving us a small committee room  where we were stuffed in: advocates, victims, researchers, professors,  and others.   That should tell you all you need to know, America, about the shame  of gun violence in our country and why we are so hampered in dealing  with it.   Gun violence death is preventable. It is an extraordinary scourge  here in America. Yet, we are blocked by Republican majority leadership  who won't even give us a room to be heard.                            ____________________
