 Mr. Speaker, John Adams, our first Vice President, such  a prominent fixture within the Continental Congress, Declaration of  Independence, so important to our founding, such a strong antislavery  personality--and he was very, very learned, constantly reading--said: I  have examined all the religions, and the result is that the Bible is  the best book in the world.   Patrick Henry, who gave the stem-winding speech that moved so many to  support the Revolution, said: The Bible is a book worth more than all  the other books that were ever printed.   Benjamin Rush, also a Founder, a dear friend of John Adams, said:  ``By renouncing the Bible, philosophers swing from their moorings upon  all moral subjects. . . . It is the only correct map of the human heart  that has ever been published.''   And I love what C.S. Lewis said in his book ``The Case for  Christianity.'' He was discussing dualism, this idea that there are two  equal forces in the universe and that they are at war, and we don't  know how it is going to come out.   He said there is a war going on, but it is not between two equal  forces. It is between a master and a rebel, and we happen to live in  rebel-occupied territory. Basically, he goes on to say, can you imagine  being behind enemy lines and getting a message from your home  headquarters and you don't even pick it up and read it?   Those of us who are Christians, we believe that God gave us this book  of messages, just like C.S. Lewis said. Unfortunately, many don't pick  them up.   It is well known that Thomas Jefferson, though he was not a deist,  believed the Bible, not all of the miracles. But the story is told that  he was coming down--and CRS has verified he came to church every Sunday  here in the Capitol. He usually rode his horse. When Madison came every  Sunday--he was here in D.C.--he came down to the Old House Chamber.   But someone asked Jefferson: Where are you going this Sunday morning?   He said: I am going to church in the Capitol.   He had a big Bible under his arm.   He said: But you don't believe everything they do.   He said: Sir, I am the highest elected magistrate in this country. It  is imperative that I set the proper example.   I thank my friend for setting that same proper example.    Mr. Speaker, I really haven't ever become friends with  General Michael Flynn. He doesn't object to being called Michael Flynn,  even though he earned the title of ``General,'' even though he has not  been treated fairly at all and has actually been treated unjustly.   There is an article today from Margot Cleveland in The Federalist. It  talks about Michael Flynn's case, and I am learning some things.   I think the world of Sidney Powell. She is an amazing attorney. She  is a friend. But there is a motion pending before Federal Judge Emmett  Sullivan on a motion to compel and motion for sanctions that attorney  Sidney Powell had filed.   ``Powell's motion seeks to force Federal prosecutors to provide Flynn  an array of documents withheld from his attorneys and to sanction  government lawyers for their failure to provide relevant evidence to  the defense team in a timely manner.''   Now, as a former judge--and I have prosecuted, I have defended, and I  have been a chief justice, but nothing is more infuriating to me, when  it comes to our justice system, than prosecutors who are unjust, who  lie, who misrepresent. And it looks like all of that has been occurring  in Michael Flynn's case or with deference to, like Colonel Vindman,  General Michael Flynn.   This article points out: ``Then, mere days after the final briefing  came in,'' to Judge Sullivan, ``Federal prosecutors found themselves  forced to admit that, for nearly 3 years, they had wrongly identified  the authors of the handwritten notes taken by the FBI agents during  their January 24, 2017, interview of then-National Security Advisor  Flynn. Prosecutors had told defense counsel, and the court, that the  notes written by Peter Strozk had been compiled by FBI Agent Joe  Pietka, and those taken by Pietka had been written by Strozk.   ``This embarrassing mea culpa surely added strength to Powell's plea  for access to other withheld evidence. After all, if Federal  prosecutors made such a basic blunder concerning key evidence, what  other mistakes lay buried in the undisclosed evidence?''   This goes on and points out that, at a minimum, things that are being  set out now ``would also support the withdrawal of Flynn's guilty  plea--something Powell does not appear to be considering at this time-- including''--and  [[Page H9117]]  here is the circumstance that is just phenomenal, that, in a Federal  district court we could have Justice Department attorneys who are this  flagrantly abusive of the process.   So, ``Flynn's original attorneys had a conflict of interest  preventing them from representing Flynn in the criminal case; Flynn did  not intentionally make false statements to the FBI agents; the FBI  agents entrapped Flynn; Flynn's purported misstatements were immaterial  to the investigation into supposed Russia collusion and, thus, no crime  occurred; the government engaged in selective prosecution and charged  Flynn solely because of his relationship to Trump; prosecutors used  threats to induce Flynn's plea; the prosecutors' failure to timely  disclose exculpatory and impeachment evidence invalidates Flynn's plea;  and that egregious prosecutorial and government misconduct mandates  dismissal of all charges against Flynn.''   If you go down further, more revelations.   ``The government had pushed Flynn's previous attorneys at Covington  and Burling LLP, in February 2017, to quickly file a registration  statement under the Foreign Agent Registration Act, FARA, for Flynn  Intel Group, FIG. Federal prosecutors later obtained indictments  against Flynn's FIG business partners for supposed Foreign Agent  Registration Act violations, and still later, the prosecutors branded  Flynn a co-conspirator in the FARA case. There was a clear conflict of  interest, which the government failed to mention to Judge Sullivan.   ``Further, since Flynn last appeared before Sullivan, the  government's FARA case against his FIG partners has imploded. Following  a 6-day trial, a jury had convicted Flynn's former business partner,  Bijan Rafiekian, of acting as an unregistered agent of Turkey,  conspiring to act as an unregistered agent of Turkey. . . . `'   It says: ``But Federal Judge Anthony Trenga stepped in and tossed the  guilty verdict, concluding that no `rational jury could conclude that  Rafiekian conspired with Alptekin or anyone else.' Judge Trenga further  held that `there is no evidence of discussions or suggestions, let  alone any agreement express or implied, to either avoid filing under  FARA or to cause the filing of a false FARA registration statement.' ''                                time  2000    ``That the government's FARA case against Flynn's business partner  proved bogus should also trouble Sullivan because, according to  Powell's earlier court filings, the special counsel's office had  informed Flynn's `counsel in the summer of 2017 that it was going to  indict the FARA case then, had obtained authorization to target Michael  Flynn, Jr.--who had a newborn--and had seized all his electronic  devices.'   ``The threat was clear: Plead guilty and cooperate or we will  prosecute your son. And given Judge Trenga's conclusion in the  Rafiekian case that there was no evidence of a FARA crime, there is an  added postscript: We will prosecute your son on bogus charges.''   Unbelievable. It also should be quite scary to someone situated as  Michael Flynn, General Flynn, that the Federal Government, the DOJ-- especially when they use unscrupulous and unethical means--they can  convict anybody, even when there is no evidence whatsoever as Judge  Trenga found, there was no evidence whatsoever.   I don't know these people, but I know the Federal judge said there  was no evidence whatsoever. And, yet, the jury came back--I am sure the  judge was just thinking: I will let the jury find there is no evidence  because there is none.   And when they came back and convicted, wow, the judge is going: I  have got to throw this out. This is totally bogus.   ``The threat also wasn't a one off: After Powell took over  representation of Flynn, federal prosecutors attempted to force Flynn  to testify at Rafiekian's trial that Flynn had knowingly made false  statements in the FARA filings--something Flynn denies. When Flynn  refused to lie, federal prosecutors abruptly added Michael Flynn, Jr.  to the witness list for the Rafiekian trial, but then never called him  to testify.''   Total intimidation. Total effort to intimidate. Very unethical.   ``The government, according to Powell, also had an FBI agent contact  Flynn, Jr. directly, even though the younger Flynn was represented by  counsel.'' Also quite unethical.   Boy, the unethical conduct in this Department of Justice hasn't gone  away. It hasn't stopped with Strzok and Page, being gone--Bruce Ohr,  all of these others that appeared to conspire to defeat a Presidential  candidate, and then to try the coup to take him out.   ``The government, according to Powell, also had an FBI agent contact  Flynn, Jr. directly.   ``These maneuvers corroborate the prosecutors earlier use of Flynn,  Jr. as a pawn to pressure his father to plead guilty.''   I mean, this stuff is just amazing. And if they can do this to  someone who spent over 30 years dedicated to the defense of his  country, all kinds of decorations for heroism, and powerful friends in  Washington, they can do this to him, it is difficult to think about the  terrible situation of someone without money, without friends.   If these people can be this unscrupulous to people with some power,  it just bodes very poorly for this little experiment in self-government  when the judicial branch, or I am sorry, the executive branch's  prosecutorial wing is this abusive. Absolutely incredible. A bit  frightening, actually.   So I would like to also touch on some of the testimony that has gone  on in yesterday's hearing, the part where we had Jennifer Williams and  Lieutenant Colonel Vindman.   He said, I think, that he has been in over 20 years. Didn't make  Colonel. And I have known people, you know, my 4 years in the Army, we  saw those folks. They were so self-righteous on the one hand, maybe  they didn't get a promotion they thought they deserved. Maybe it was  because they did something like Vindman did and was trashing the United  States to Russians when he was overheard by a superior that reprimanded  him for it.   Sometimes it is just because there is a mean superior that doesn't  want somebody promoted. But for whatever reason, he didn't become a  full Colonel. Here he is, harping after he had been called Lieutenant  Colonel over and over by my friend, Devin Nunes, he interrupts and  demands--and I notice he didn't always call people Congressman. That  didn't bother me, but it is just quite interesting that he has such a  double standard for himself and for others.   But when you look at the testimony, especially page 2, it is  interesting--and actually, this is from our friend Adam Schiff,  Congressman Adam Schiff--``Colonel Vindman, we have seen''--and I guess  it should have been Lieutenant Colonel Vindman--``we have seen far more  scurrilous attacks on your character, and watched as certain  personalities on Fox have questioned your loyalty. I note that you have  shed blood for America, and we owe you an immense debt of gratitude.''  So that is the case, we owe him a debt of gratitude for defending our  country.   I do love history and I point out down the hall when we are in the  rotunda to groups, we have got General Gates standing there accepting  surrender from the British, and he was not the real hero of the Battle  of Saratoga, and that was the biggest victory since December 24, 1776,  probably.   And it was a big one, but it wasn't Gates. I read another book on the  Revolution just months ago, and this book was saying Gates never got  out of his tent, whether it was cowardice or whatever, he never would  get out of his tent. But there was this great, brave, courageous, young  major that just knew they could defeat the British there at Saratoga if  they get on going and attack them. Gates wouldn't give the order, so  this major rallied folks, and they went down and they attacked the  British, and they defeated them.   So the real hero of Saratoga wasn't General Gates. It was this major,  a tough, strapping guy. He took them on, and he was wounded. And he  carried a limp with him probably the rest of his life. He was wounded.  He was hurt severely. But we owe that guy a debt of gratitude for his  defense of his country.   Of course, later on, he got upset that he had been slighted and  didn't get a promotion like Gates' immediate subordinates, and then  that caused him to  [[Page H9118]]  fall prey to the British talking him into helping them because they  would pay him, and they would appreciate him a whole lot more than  Washington and others. And, of course, then he ended up setting up  Washington to be kidnapped by the British.    But I am amazed how many people don't know that we owe a great debt  of gratitude to Major Benedict Arnold, because without him, there is no  victory at the Battle of Saratoga, and that was a huge victory, so very  important to our becoming an independent country.   So anyway, it is just interesting when you think about history and  people who demand to be given respect, and if they are not, they get  rather snippy.   And I don't know that I have ever met Lieutenant Colonel Vindman, but  to find out that he was trashing the United States to Russians, and it  was just intriguing to go through his testimony.   For example, he said this about the investigation into the 2016  elections, Bidens, Burisma.   ``I stated to Ambassador Sondland that this was inappropriate and it  had nothing to do with national security. Dr. Hill also asserted his  comments weren't proper. Following the meeting, Dr. Hill and I agreed  to report the incident to the NSC's lead counsel.''   So it is interesting. Further, he was asked by Mr. Goldman: ``On  September 10, the Intelligence Committee requested the whistleblower  complaint from the Department of National Intelligence.''   He wasn't aware of that. But it is just, wow, so September 10, they  obviously knew all about the so-called whistleblower complaint.   But when you get over here to part of the questioning by Congressman  Nunes: ``Did you ask or encourage any individual to share the substance  of the July 25th phone call or any matter associated with the call with  any member of the press?''   ``I did not.''   And he goes on like that. And then he said:   ``Lieutenant Colonel Vindman, did you discuss the July 25th phone  call with anyone outside the White House on July 25th or the 26th, and  if so, with whom?''   And he said: ``Yes, I did. My core function is to coordinate U.S.  Government policy, interagency policy, and I spoke to two individuals  with regards to providing some sort of readout of the call.''   Nunes says: ``Two individuals that were not in the White House?''   Vindman: ``Not in the White House.'' And that is Lieutenant Colonel  Vindman. ``Not in the White House, cleared U.S. Government officials  with appropriate need to know.''   ``And what agencies were these officials with?''   Lieutenant Colonel Vindman said: ``Department of State, Deputy  Assistant Secretary George Kent, who is responsible for the portfolio,  Eastern Europe including Ukraine, and an individual from the office  of--an individual in the intelligence community.''   And that is where Nunes says: ``As you know, the intelligence  community has 17 different agencies. What agency was this individual  from?''   And that is when Chairman Schiff said: ``If I could interject. We  don't want to use these proceedings''--and then cross talk--``we need  to protect the whistleblower.''   And what is really interesting, of course, is when he calls out  Congressman Nunes. ``It's Lieutenant Colonel Vindman, please.'' So I  want to make sure that I don't slight him.   He says--and he is under oath--``I don't know who the whistleblower  is. That is correct.''   And yet, he gets down to there is two people. He identifies one, and  Chairman Schiff interrupts and doesn't want him to out the other  person, because that would be outing the whistleblower.   And, yet, Chairman Schiff and Lieutenant Colonel Vindman say they  don't know who the whistleblower is, but it must be that one that he  has been told not to answer because that would give away the  whistleblower's identity.   And yet, they say, we don't know who the whistleblower is, but we are  down to one person, but we don't know who it is. Even though if he  gives the name, it will out the whistleblower. It is just really  amazing when you look at this stuff.   And it is actually rather tragic. There was a question Mr. Castor  says: ``And are you aware, and George Kent testified a little bit about  this last week, that under the Obama administration, the U.S.  Government encouraged Ukraine to investigate whether Zlochevsky used  his government position to grant himself or Burisma exploration  licenses. Are you aware of that?''   And Lieutenant Colonel Vindman said: ``I would defer to George Kent.  He's a fount of knowledge on Ukraine, much deeper knowledge than I  have. If he attested to that, then I'd take his word for it.''   Well, isn't it interesting that Mr. Kent knew that the Obama  administration was trying to get to the bottom of corruption about  Burisma, and, yet, he freaks out, not Kent, but Lieutenant Colonel  Vindman, freaks out over Burisma being brought up, that that is some  kind of crime for an impeachable offense, basically, for President  Trump to bring up the corruption and including Burisma.   But isn't that interesting? He didn't bring up there is a problem  with the Obama administration bringing it up, just President Trump.                                time  2015    But Ranking Member Nunes also brings up that, I asked Ms. Williams  about this, about, if she had ever accessed, without authorization,  colleagues' computers. She answered no. And he goes on through some of  that.   But you get down here and then it is turned over to   Jim Jordan.  Congressman Jordan said, ``Mr. Morrison said this: `I had concerns  about Lieutenant Colonel Vindman's judgment. Among the discussions I  had with Dr. Hill--that is Fiona Hill--in the transition with our team,  its strength, its weaknesses, and Fiona and others had raised concern  about Alex's--he should have said Lieutenant Colonel Vindman's-- judgment'. When Mr. Morrison was asked by Mr. Castor, `Did anyone ever  bring concerns to you that they believe Colonel Vindman may have leaked  something,' Mr. Morrison replied, `yes.' ''   They thought he was a leaker well before this all happened.   So your boss had concerns about your judgment--your favored boss, Dr.  Hill--had concerns about your judgment, your colleagues had concerns  about your judgment, and your colleagues felt that there were times  when you leaked information. Any idea where they might have gotten  those impressions, Colonel Vindman?   He calls him ``Colonel.'' He gave him a promotion.   But Vindman says ``yes.'' And then he raised an OER that was somewhat  glowing, but actually the answer should have been ``no,'' if he was  being truthful, because he later says, ``I can't say why Mr. Morrison  questioned my judgment.''   But Congressman Jordan goes on: ``Colonel, it's interesting, we  deposed a lot of people in the bunker, in the basement of the Capitol,  over the last several weeks, but of all those depositions, only three  of the individuals we deposed were actually on the now-somewhat-famous  July 25 phone call between President Trump and President Zelensky.  There was you, the individual sitting beside you, Ms. Williams, and  then there, of course, was your boss, Mr.  Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 8 o'clock and 20 minutes  p.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until tomorrow,  Thursday, November 21, 2019, at 9 a.m.                            ____________________
