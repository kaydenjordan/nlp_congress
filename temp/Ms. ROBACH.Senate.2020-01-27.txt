 You were paid $50,000 a month for your       position?        Mr. Hunter BIDEN. Look, I'm a private citizen. One thing       that I don't have to do is sit here and open my kimono as it       relates to how much money I make or made or did or didn't.       But it's all been reported.    Mr. Counsel HERSCHMANN. So what was the real reason that Hunter  Biden, the Vice President's son, was being paid by Burisma? Was it  based on his knowledge and understanding of the natural gas industry in  Ukraine? Was he going to discuss how our government regulates the  energy industry here? Was he going to discuss how we set gas rates? Was  he going to discuss pipeline development construction or environmental  impact statements? Did he know anything about the natural gas industry  at all? Of course not.   So what was the reason? I think you do not need to look any further  than the explanation that Hunter Biden gave during the ABC interview  when he was asked why.   Here is what he had to say.   (Text of Videotape presentation:)          If your last name wasn't Biden, do you think       you would have been asked to be on the board of Burisma?        Mr. Hunter BIDEN. I don't know. Probably no. I don't think       there are a lot of things that would have happened in my life       if my last name wasn't Biden.    Mr. Counsel HERSCHMANN. And as if to confirm how suspect this conduct  was that it should be a concern to our country, Hunter Biden and his  lawyer could not even keep their story straight. Compare the press  release that was issued by Burisma on May 12, 2014, with Hunter Biden's  lawyer's statement on October 13 of 2019. The May 2014 press release  begins: ``R. [Robert] Hunter Biden will be in charge of holding's legal  unit.'' He was going to be in charge of a Ukrainian gas company owned  by an oligarch's legal unit. However, in his lawyer's statement in  October of 2019, after his involvement with Burisma came under renewed  public scrutiny, he now claims: ``At no  [[Page S600]]  time was Hunter in charge of the company's legal affairs.''   Which is it? What was Hunter Biden doing at Burisma in exchange for  millions of dollars? Who knows? What were they looking to hide so much  for his corporate governance and transparency?   But let's take a step back and realize what actually transpired,  because the House managers would have us believe this had nothing at  all to do with our government, nothing at all to do with our country's  interests, nothing at all to do with our Vice President, nothing at all  to do with the State Department. It was simply private citizen Hunter  Biden doing his own private business. It was purely coincidental that  it was in his father's portfolio in Ukraine, in the exact sector--the  energy sector--that his father said was corrupt.   But we have a document here--again, something that House managers did  not show you or even put before the House before voting on these  baseless Articles of Impeachment. If you look at that email, it is an  email from Chris Heinz. And as Attorney Bondi already told you, he is  the stepson of the then-Secretary of State John Kerry, and he was the  other business partner with Hunter Biden and Devon Archer. Our  Secretary of State's stepson and our Vice President's son are in  business together.   It was sent on May 13, 2014, to the official government email  addresses of two senior people at the State Department. These two  people are the Chief of Staff to the Secretary of State and the Special  Adviser to the Secretary of State. The subject line in the email is not  ``corporate transparency.'' It is not ``corporate governance.'' It is  not ``here's a heads-up.'' The subject line is ``Ukraine.''   Chris Heinz certainly understood the sensitivity to our U.S. foreign  policy. What does the Secretary of State's stepson say about Hunter  Biden and Devon Archer? He says this:         Apparently Devon and Hunter both joined the board of       Burisma and a press release went out today. I can't speak to       why they decided to, but there was no investment by our firm       in their company.    What is the most telling thing about this? It is clear that the Chief  of Staff and the Special Assistant to the Secretary already knew who  Devon was because Mr. Heinz did not include his last name. It is just  ``Devon.'' They obviously knew who Hunter was because, again, it is  Hunter Biden. This is Chris Heinz saying: ``I can't speak to why they  decided to join the board of Burisma.'' He is their business partner-- not that there were good corporate reasons that they are going there  for corporate governance, not that they are there to enhance corporate  transparency, not that they are there to further U.S. policy, not that  they are there to help fight corruption in Ukraine, not that they are  there to ensure boards of directors' compensation and benefits are  publicly disclosed--nothing like that. He cannot say those things  because he knows Devon and Hunter well and he knows they have no  particular qualifications, whatsoever, to do those things, especially  for a Ukrainian gas company.   Instead, Mr. Heinz is planning to go on the record to report what  Hunter and Devon were doing through official channels to take pains to  disassociate himself from what they were doing. And what did the State  Department do with this information that the Secretary of State's  stepson thought they needed to know? Apparently, nothing. They did not  tell Mr. Heinz to stay away. They did not tell Mr. Heinz there is no  problem--nothing. But all this, the House managers want us to believe,  does not even merit any inquiry. Anyone asking for one, anyone  discussing one is now corrupt.   Does it matter in an inquiry why a corrupt company in a corrupt  country would be paying our Vice President son's a million dollars per  year, plus, it appears, some additional expenses, and paying his  business partner an additional million dollars per year? Secretary of  State Kerry's stepson thought it was important enough to report. Why  aren't the House managers concerned?   And I ask you, why would it not merit an investigation? You know  something else about Vice President Biden? Well, back in January of  2018, as you heard, former Vice President Biden bragged that he had  pressured the Ukrainians--threatened them, indeed, coerced them--into  firing the state prosecutor who reportedly was investigating the very  company that paid millions of dollars to his son. He bragged that he  gave them 6 hours to fire the prosecutor or he would cut off $1 billion  in U.S. loan guarantees.   (Text of Videotape presentation:)         Vice President BIDEN. I said: We're not going to give you       the billion dollars.        They said: You have no authority. You're not the President.       The President said--        I said: Call him. I said: I'm telling you, you're not       getting the billion dollars. I said: You're not getting the       billion. I'm going to be leaving here in--I think it was,       what--6 hours. I looked at him and said: I'm leaving in 6       hours. If the prosecutor is not fired, you're not getting the       money.        Well, son of a bitch, he got fired, and they put in place       someone who was solid at the time.    Mr. Counsel HERSCHMANN. Are we really to believe it was the policy of  our government to withhold $1 billion of guarantees to Ukraine unless  they fired a prosecutor on the spot? Was that really our policy? We  have all heard continuously from the managers and many agree about the  risks to the Ukrainians posed by the Russians. We have heard the  managers say that a slight delay in providing funding to Ukraine  endangers our national security and jeopardizes our interests and,  therefore, the President must immediately be removed from office. Yet,  they also argue that it was the official policy of our country to  withhold $1 billion unless one individual was fired within a certain  matter of hours. Was that really or could it ever be our United States  policy?   According to the House managers' theory, we were willing to  jeopardize Ukrainians unless somebody who happened to be investigating  Burisma was promptly fired. Are we going to jeopardize a Ukrainian  economy because a prosecutor was not fired in the 6-hour time period  Vice President Biden demanded? Does anyone really believe that was or  ever could be our U.S. foreign policy? And, just in case, the managers  or others tried to argue: No, no, no, he wasn't serious about that; he  was just bluffing. What kind of message would that send to the Russians  about our support for the Ukrainians that we would bluff and bluff with  the Ukrainian economy?   From 2014 to 2017, Vice President Biden claimed to be on a crusade  against corruption in Ukraine. He repeatedly spoke about how the cancer  of corruption was endemic in Ukraine, hobbled Ukraine, how Ukraine  faced no more consequential mission than confronting corruption, and he  encouraged Ukraine to close the space for corrupt middlemen who rip off  the Ukrainian people. The Vice President railed against monopolistic  behavior where a select few profit from so many sweetheart deals that  has characterized that country for so long.   On his last official visit to Ukraine, 4 days before he left office,  he spoke out against corruption and oligarchy, that eats away like a  cancer, and against corruption, which continues to eat away at  Ukraine's democracy within. Why was Vice President doing this? Was he  so concerned about corruption in Ukraine--even singling out that  country's energy sector--because corruption in Ukraine is a critical  policy concern for our country?   But during this whole time, what else was happening? His son and his  son's business partner were raking in over $1 million a year from what  was regarded as one of the most corrupt Ukrainian companies in the  energy sector, owned and controlled by one of the most corrupt  oligarchs. Were Vice President Biden's words and advice to Ukraine just  hollow? According to the House managers, the answer apparently is yes,  they were empty words, at least when it came to anyone questioning his  son's own sweetheart deal, his own son's deal with Ukraine's corruption  and oligarchy.   Again, to raise Manager Schiff's own question: What kind of message  did this send to future U.S. Government officials? Your family can  accept money from foreign corrupt companies? No problem. You can pay  family members of our highest government officials, and no one is  allowed to even ask questions.   What was going on? We have to just accept now the House managers'  conclusory statements, like ``sham,'' ``discrediting,'' even though no  one has  [[Page S601]]  ever investigated why. And can you imagine what House Manager Schiff  and his fellow Democratic Representatives would say if it were  President Trump's children on an oligarch's payroll?   And when it finally appeared that a true Ukrainian corruption fighter  had assumed the country's Presidency, President Trump was not supposed  to--he was not permitted to--- follow up on Vice President Biden's own  words about fighting corruption and try to make those words something  other than empty?   According to the House managers, Ukrainian corruption is now only a  private interest. It no longer is a serious important concern for our  country.   Now I want to take a moment to cover a few additional points about  the July 25 telephone call in which the House managers believe that the  President of the United States, in their words, was shaking down and  pressuring the President of Ukraine to do his personal bidding.   First of all, this was not the first telephone call that the  President of the United States had with other foreign leaders. Think  about this for a moment. The call was routed through the Situation  Room. It was a scheduled call. There were other people on the call.  There were other people taking notes. Obviously, the President was  aware of that fact.   The House managers talked about the fact that the President did not  follow the approved talking points as if the President--any President-- is obligated to follow approved talking points. The last time I  checked--and I think this is clear to the American people--President  Trump knows how to speak his mind.   Do you remember the fake transcript that Manager Schiff read when he  was before the Intelligence Committee--his mob, gangster-like, fake  rendition of the call? Well, I prosecuted organized crime for years.  The type of description of what goes on--what House Manager Schiff  tried to create for the American people--is completely detached from  reality. It is as if we were supposed to believe that mobsters would  invite people they do not know into an organized crime meeting to sit  around and take notes to establish their corrupt intent.   Manager Schiff, our jobs as prosecutors--and I know you were one-- would have been a lot easier if that were how it worked.   Think about what he is saying. Think about the managers' position:  that our President decided with corrupt intent to shake down, in their  words, another foreign leader, and he decided to do it in front of  everyone, in a documented conversation, in the presence of people he  did not even know, just so he could get this personal benefit that was  not in our country's interest. This logic is flawed--it is completely  illogical--because that is not what happened, and that is why Manager  Schiff ran away from the actual transcript. That is why he created his  own, fake conversation.   I would like to just address another point, for the transcript, of  the July 25 phone call.   The House managers alleged that an Oval Office meeting with the  President was critical to the newly elected Ukrainian President because  it would signal to Russia, which had invaded Ukraine in 2014 and still  occupied Ukrainian territory, that Ukraine could count on American  support. They actually argued that it was a quid pro quo, that the  President withheld this critical Oval Office meeting that would deter  the Russians and save the Ukrainians because he wanted something  personal.   Now, if that were, in fact, critical to President Zelensky for the  safety of his own citizens, he would have immediately jumped at the  opportunity to come to the Oval Office, especially when President Trump  offered him that invitation during the July 25 call. Let's see what  President Zelensky actually said when he was invited to Washington on  that call.   He does not say: Oh, this is what I would like to do. It is critical  for my people. We will arrange it in a meeting.   His response is:         I would be very happy to come and would be happy to meet       you personally and get to know you better . . . On the other       hand, I believe that, on September 1, we will be in Poland,       and we could meet in Poland, hopefully.    If an Oval Office meeting were critical to President Zelensky, that  was the time to say so, not to suggest another venue.   When we look at the evidence that is before us, it is clear that the  only people who talked about having an Oval Office meeting were lower  level government employees who thought it was a good idea. But for the  principals involved, those who actually make the decisions--President  Zelensky, President Trump--to them, it was not critical, it was not  material, and it was definitely never a quid pro quo. What was  important to President Zelensky was not an Oval Office meeting but the  lethal weapons that President Trump supplied to Ukraine and the  sanctions that President Trump enforced against the Russians. That is  what the transcript of the July 25 call demonstrates.   Let us now consider what President Zelensky knew about the support  that President Trump had provided to Ukraine compared to the support-- or more accurately, the lack thereof--that the prior administration had  provided to Ukraine.   In February 2004, Russia began its military campaign against Ukraine.  Against the advice and urgings of Congress and of many in his own  administration, President Obama refused then and throughout the  remainder of his Presidency to provide lethal assistance to Ukraine.   In the House, Manager Schiff joined many of his colleagues in a  letter-writing campaign to President Obama, urging ``the U.S. must  supply Ukraine with the means to defend itself'' against Russian  aggression, urging President Obama to quickly approve additional  efforts to support Ukraine's efforts to defend the sovereign territory,  including the transfer of lethal defense weapons to the Ukraine  military.   On March 23, the House of Representatives overwhelmingly passed a  resolution urging President Obama to immediately exercise the authority  by Congress to provide Ukraine with a lethal defensive weapons system.   The very next day, this Senate passed a unanimous resolution urging  the President to prioritize and expedite the provision of defensive  lethal and nonlethal military assistance to Ukraine, consistent with  U.S. national interests and policies.   As one Senator here stated in March 2015, ``Providing nonlethal  equipment like night vision goggles is all well and good, but giving  the Ukrainians the ability to see the Russians coming but not the  ability to stop them is not the answer.''   Yet President Obama refused. He refused even in the face of support  by senior career professionals recommending he provide lethal weapons  to the Ukrainians.   By contrast, what did President Zelensky and the Russians know? They  knew that President Trump did--did--provide that support. That,  clearly, was the most material thing to him, much more important than a  meeting in the Oval Office.   The House managers also made much of the contention that President  Trump supposedly wanted President Zelensky only to announce an  investigation, not conduct it, but that contention makes no sense.  President Trump's call with President Zelensky was in July of 2019-- almost a year and a half before our next election. Would only a bare  announcement so far in advance, with no followup, really have had any  effect on the election, as the managers claim? Would anyone have  remembered the announcement a year or more later?   Ironically, it is the House managers who have put Burisma and its  connection to the Bidens front and center in this proceeding, and now  the voters will know about it and probably will remember it. Be careful  what you wish for.   Manager Schiff--well, there he goes again. He is putting words in the  President's mouth that were never there. Again, look at the transcript  of the July call. President Trump never asked about any announcement of  any type of investigation, and President Zelensky told President Trump:         I guarantee, as the President of Ukraine, that all the       investigations will be done openly and candidly. That I can       assure you.    What happened next?   The House managers say President Zelensky did not want to get mixed  up  [[Page S602]]  in U.S. politics, but it is precisely the Democrats who politicized the  issue.   Last August, they began circling the wagons in trying to protect Vice  President Biden, and they are still doing it in these proceedings. They  contend that any investigation into the millions of dollars of payments  by a corrupt Ukraine company--owned by a corrupt Ukraine oligarch--to  the son of the second highest officeholder in our land, who was  supposed to be in charge of fighting corruption in Ukraine, to be a  sham, debunked. But there has never been an investigation, so how could  it be a sham--simply because the House managers say so?   Which brings me to yet another one of the House managers' baseless  contentions--that President Trump raised the matter with President  Zelensky because Vice President Biden had just announced his candidacy  for President. But, of course, it was far from a secret that Vice  President Biden was planning to run.   What had, in fact, changed?   First, President Zelensky had been elected in April on an anti- corruption platform. In July, running on the same platform, his party  took control of the Ukrainian Parliament. That made it the opportune  time to raise the issue because finally there was a receptive  government in Ukraine that was committed to fighting precisely the kind  of highly questionable conduct displayed by Burisma in its payments to  Hunter Biden and his partner, just as Joe Biden had raised years  before.   There are two other things.         In late June, ABC News ran a story entitled ``Hunter       Biden's foreign deals. Did Joe Biden's son profit off of his       father's position as Vice President?''    Then, just a couple of weeks before President Trump's telephone call  with President Zelensky, the New Yorker magazine--not exactly a  supporter of President Trump's--ran an expose--``Will Hunter Biden  Jeopardize His Father's Campaign?''--and went through some of the facts  that we do know about Hunter Biden's involvement with Burisma and his  involvement with the Chinese company.   The New Yorker reporter--again, this was in July, just a couple of  weeks before the phone call--said that some of Vice President Biden's  advisers were worried that Hunter would expose the Vice President to  criticism.   A former senior White House aide told the New Yorker reporter that  Hunter's behavior invited questions about whether he was ``leveraging  access for his benefit.'' The reporter wrote: ``When I asked members of  Biden's staff whether they did raise their concern with the Vice  President, several of them said they had been too intimidated to do  so.''   ``Everyone who works for him has been screamed at,'' a former adviser  told the reporter. ``I don't know whether anyone has been intimidated  by Vice President Biden or has been screamed at by him about Burisma or  his son's involvement.''   Do we want the type of government where questions about facially  suspect conduct are suppressed or dismissed as illegitimate because  someone is intimidating or screams or is just too important? No. That  is precisely when an investigation is most important.   Last Thursday night, Manager Jeffries provided us with the Democrats'  standard for abuse of power.   He said: ``Abuse of power occurs when the President exercises his  official power to obtain a corrupt personal benefit while ignoring or  injuring the national interest.''   Mr. Jeffries and the House managers contend that, under this  standard, President Trump has committed an impeachable offense and must  be immediately removed from office. But if Manager Jeffries' standard  applies, then where were these same Democrats' calls for impeachment  when uncontroverted, smoking-gun evidence emerged that President Obama  had violated their standard?   The American people understand this basic notion as equal justice  under the law. It is as American as apple pie. Yet the House managers  want to apply their own version of selective justice here, which  applies only to their political opponents. They want one system of  justice for Democrats and another system of justice for everyone else.  You do not need to take my word for it; let's walk through the facts.   On March 26, 2012, on the eve of the 2012 Nuclear Security Summit in  Seoul, South Korea, President Obama met with Russian President Dmitry  Medvedev to discuss one of the pressing issues in the U.S. national  security interests--missile defense.   How important was the issue of missile defense to the strategic  relationship between the United States and Russia?   As President Obama's Defense Secretary Robert Gates said in June  2010, upgraded missile interceptors in development ``would give us the  ability to protect our troops, our bases, our facilities and our allies  in Europe.''   Gates continued:         There is no meeting of the minds on missile defense. The       Russians hate it. They have hated it since the late 1960s.       They will always hate it, mostly because we will build it,       and they won't.    During the Nuclear Security Summit, President Obama had a private  exchange with Russian President Medvedev that was picked up on a hot  microphone.   (Text of Videotape presentation:)         President OBAMA. This is my last election. After my       election, I have more flexibility.        President MEDVEDEV. I understand. I will transmit this       information to Vladimir, and I stand with you.    President Obama said:         On all these issues, but particularly missile defense, this       can be solved, but it's important for him to give me space.    President Medvedev responded:         Yeah, I understand. I understand your message about space.       Space for you.    President Obama:         This is my last election. After my election, I will have       more flexibility.    President Medvedev responds:         I understand. I will transmit this information to Vladimir.    As we all know, it is Vladimir Putin.   As you just saw in 2012, President Obama asked the Russians for space  until after the upcoming 2012 election, after which he would have more  flexibility.   Now, let me apply Mr. Jeffries' and the House managers' three-part  test for abuse of power.   One, the President exercises his official power. President Obama's  actions clearly meet the test for exercising official power because in  his role as head of state during the nuclear security summit, after  asking President Medvedev for space, he promised him that ``missile  defense can be solved.'' What else did that mean but solved in a way  favorable to the Russians, who were dead set against the expansion of a  U.S. missile defense system in Europe?   Two, to obtain a corrupt personal benefit. President Obama's actions  were clearly for his own corrupt personal benefit because he was asking  an adversary for space for the express purpose of furthering his own  election chances.   Again, President Obama said:         This is my last election. After my election, I have more       flexibility.    President Obama knew the importance of missile defense in Europe but  decided to use that as a bargaining chip with the Russians to further  his own election chances in 2012.   Three, while ignoring or injuring our national interest. As President  Obama's Defense Secretary said, ``Missiles would give us the ability to  protect our troops, our bases, our facilities, and our allies in  Europe.''   Surely, sacrificing the ability to protect our troops and our allies  would injure the national interest. Yet President Obama was willing to  barter away the safety of our troops and the safety of our allies in  exchange for space in the upcoming election.   In short, President Obama leveraged the power of his office to the  detriment of U.S. policy on missile defense in order to influence the  2012 election solely to his advantage. And we never would have known  had President Obama realized that the microphone was on; that there was  a hot mic.   One could easily substitute President Obama's 2012 exchange with  President Medvedev into article I of the House's Impeachment Articles  against President Trump.   Using the powers of his high office, President Obama solicited  interference of a foreign government, Russia, in the 2012 U.S.  Presidential election. He did so through a scheme or course of conduct  that included soliciting the Government of Russia to give him ``space''  on missile defense that would benefit  [[Page S603]]  his reelection and influence the 2012 U.S. Presidential election to his  advantage.   In doing so, President Obama used the powers of the Presidency in a  manner that compromised the national security of the United States and  undermined the integrity of the U.S. democratic process. He thus  ignored and injured the interest of the Nation.   Does it sound familiar, House managers? It should, as the case  against President Obama would have been far stronger than the  allegations against President Trump.   President Obama's abuse of power to benefit his own political  interests was there and is here now for everyone to hear. It was a  direct, unquestionable quid pro quo. No mind reading was needed there.  Where were the House managers then?   And that points out the absurdity of the House managers' case against  President Trump. It was President Obama, not President Trump, who was  weak on Russia and weak on support to Ukraine.   President Obama caved to Russia and Putin on missile defense when he  decided to scrap the U.S. plans to install missile bases in Poland. Yet  he criticized Senator Romney during the 2012 Presidential campaign when  Senator Romney said Russia was the greatest geopolitical threat to the  U.S.   (Text of Videotape presentation:)         President OBAMA. I'm glad that you recognize that al-      Qaida's a threat because a few months ago when you were asked       what's the biggest geopolitical threat facing America, you       said Russia. Not al-Qaida, you said Russia, and the 1980s are       now calling to ask for their foreign policy back because, you       know, the Cold War's been over for 20 years.    Mr. Counsel HERSCHMANN. Now, when it is politically convenient, the  Democrats are saying the same thing that President Obama criticized  Senator Romney for saying. In fact, they are basing their entire  politicized impeachment on this inversion of reality, this claim that  President Trump is not supporting Ukraine far more than the prior  administration.   President Obama caved on missile defense in late 2009. His hot mic  moment occurred in March 2012. His reelection was 8 months later. Two  years later, in March 2014, Russia invaded Ukraine and annexed Crimea.  President Obama refused to provide lethal aid to Ukraine to enable it  to defend itself. Where were the House managers then?   The House managers would have the American people believe that there  is a threat--an imminent threat--to the national security of our  country for which the President must be removed immediately from the  highest office in the land because of what? Because he had a phone call  with a foreign leader and discussed corruption? Because he paused for a  short period of time giving away our tax dollars to a foreign country?  That is their theory.   It is absurd on its face. Not one American life was in jeopardy or  lost by this short delay, and they know it.    And how do we know that they know it? Because they went on vacation  after they adopted the Articles of Impeachment. They did not cancel  their recess. They did not rush back to deliver the Articles of  Impeachment to the Senate because of this supposed terrible imminent  threat to our national security. What did they do?   (Text of Videotape presentation:)         Speaker PELOSI. Urgency.
