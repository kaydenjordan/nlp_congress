 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to defend the unborn and  protect taxpayers from being forced to fund abortions.   The Hyde amendment, which prohibits taxpayer dollars from paying for  abortion, has enjoyed broad, bipartisan consensus since 1976, and a  majority of Americans support it today. It is estimated to have saved  nearly 2.5 million lives.   It saddens me that I now have to defend this commonsense provision  from attacks by congressional Democrats and the Biden administration.  Americans should not be forced to financially support the destruction  of life.  [[Page H3585]]    That is why I am proud to cosponsor H.R. 18, the No Taxpayer Funding  for Abortion Act, which would codify this vital prohibition into law.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the Committees on Energy  and Commerce, Ways and Means, and the Judiciary be discharged from  further consideration of H.R. 18, and ask for its immediate  consideration in the House.
