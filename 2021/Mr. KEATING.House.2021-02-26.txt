 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of my amendment to H.R.  803, Protecting America's Wilderness and Public Lands Act, which will  reauthorize the Cape Cod National Seashore Advisory Commission until  the year 2028.   The park that would eventually become the Cape Cod National Seashore  was first conceived as a way to protect one of the last truly unspoiled  barrier beaches in New England. From Chatham in the south to  Provincetown in the north, the seashore resides within the six towns  that form the outer Cape Cod area.   And since the creation of the seashore, the fate of that outer cape  community has been uniquely intertwined with the success of the  national seashore.                                time  0930    Today, more than 4 million visitors from around the world come every  year to experience the natural beauty and recreational opportunities  that the seashore provides. In this way, the seashore is a crucial,  pivotal point to local businesses that depend on the cape's tourism  industry for their own livelihoods and those that reside there.   Last year, the Great American Outdoors Act was signed into law. Our  landmark conservation legislation will bring millions of dollars to  rebuild and protect the national seashore in the coming years.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Last year, the Great American Outdoors Act was signed into law. Our  landmark legislation will bring millions of dollars that will be used  to rebuild and protect the national seashore in the coming years. The  advisory commission's role is greater than ever.   The Cape Cod National Seashore, the vision of then-Senator John F.  Kennedy, continues to be a success. Working together, making sure that  this model of cooperation between the Federal Government and local  governments in this time of necessary cooperation with governmental  interaction, is more important than ever as well.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I thank him for  including this in our bill.
