 Madam Speaker, after nearly a century, the  equal rights amendment is on the cusp of ratification.   At America's founding, women were intentionally left out of the  Constitution. As second-class citizens, we lacked the right to vote,  hold most jobs, or even own property. Today, we still receive less pay  for the same work, and we face violence and harassment just for being  women. But the ERA will prohibit all of that. In the eyes of our most  sacred document, we will finally be equal.   Women's rights should not depend on congressional whims or who  occupies the White House. These basic fundamental rights must be  guaranteed.   But, if we want to hand a more perfect union to our daughters--and I  have two of them--we must seize this moment to end sex discrimination.  We owe it to the women who sacrificed before us and all of our  daughters and sons who deserve a life of true equality.   So I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this resolution to remove  the arbitrary and outdated deadline for ratifying the ERA.
