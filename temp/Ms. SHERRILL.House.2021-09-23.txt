 Mr. Speaker, I rise today because, for too long, women  in our workforce have struggled with almost insurmountable childcare  issues. Due to our lack of investment, our economy has lost too many  talented women as they try to juggle the demands of work and childcare.   After gaining significant ground in the seventies, eighties, and  nineties, and expanding our workforce, and increasing our GDP in the  process, women have not made significant gains in the workforce in the  last two decades. Two decades where women faced economic penalties when  they were forced to leave the workforce due to lack of quality and  affordable child care. Two decades where, if we had just kept pace with  some of our allies, we would have grown our GDP by another $600  billion.   I rise today because women falling behind is the American middle  class falling behind. Penalizing women in the workforce penalizes  families and imperils opportunities for our children. And this crisis  has been made exponentially worse by COVID.   That is why I am calling on all my colleagues to support legislation  to ensure all families have access to quality and affordable childcare.  Congress needs to realize this is not simply a women's issue or a  children's issue. This is a critical economic issue.                            ____________________
