 Mr. Speaker, I don't think anyone is happy  about the present situation. But the free market did not close the  economy. The governments chose that response to an exceptional risk to  public health.   The various governments that make up our country need to make sure  that individuals, families, and businesses affected by their  unprecedented decisions remain solvent and that as many people as  possible remain employed.   Like any war, the enemy votes, too, but the sooner we can get lower  risk Americans back to work, the safer most people will feel.   In our response, we must always defend our values and the way of life  that makes America the world's land of opportunity.   God bless you all.
