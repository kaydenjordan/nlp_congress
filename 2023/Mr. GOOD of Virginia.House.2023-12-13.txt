 Madam Speaker, I thank my friend, Mr. Cloud  from Texas, for holding this very important discussion here on the  House floor because what we will be voting on tomorrow represents the  very worst of Washington.   I was thankful that back in the summer, for the first time since I  have been in Congress, I could vote for an NDAA after 2 years in the  minority where the majority party under this President believes that  the greatest threat to the military is climate and that the greatest  threat to the military are conservative patriots, God forbid, Trump  supporters in the military. That has been the focus of this  administration as it relates to our military.                                time  2000    I voted four times against bad NDAAs that were focused on climate  extremism; that were focused on forcing our military to convert to  electric vehicles; that were focused on diversity, equity, and  inclusion and CRT training in our academies; red flag for our military  members; forcing our daughters to be drafted; focused on funding for  abortion in the military; funding for transgender surgery.   This past summer, our Republican Conference passed a good NDAA that I  was proud to vote for because it reversed those harmful policies. Then  we were supposed to have a Conference Committee that would go and  negotiate with the Senate. We are actually the stronger body with our  majority than the Senate is because the Senate has to have 60 votes to  pass legislation and, last time I checked, there is only 51 Democrats  over there; however, in the House, we can pass whatever we want with a  one-vote majority.   We should be the stronger party in negotiations, but that Conference  Committee really never took place. Instead, a new NDAA was negotiated  from what I call the four corners--the House Speaker, the House  minority leader, the Senate majority leader, and the Senate minority  leader. They came up with a new NDAA that takes out all of the good  things that we fought for; the policy wins in the NDAA we voted for  last summer.   To make it worse, we are going to combine that with an extension of  FISA, surveillance on U.S. citizens, trampling on our most precious  constitutional freedoms in this country with no reforms.   Our friend,   Andy Biggs, authors the bill out of Judiciary with help  from individuals like Chip Roy, who is here with us tonight, and Warren  Davidson. Instead of bringing that bill to the floor for a vote as an  individual bill, instead we are going to take a FISA extension with no  reforms--not fixing the constitutional issues, not protecting Americans  from warrantless surveillance on them like they are foreign  terrorists--and we are going to combine the two together in an effort  to force passage on suspension of the rules, nonetheless, that some  Members of this body might be afraid to vote against a bad FISA bill  because they don't want to be accused of being against the military.  The NDAA is a bad bill. Attaching it to FISA makes it that much worse.  Every Republican should vote against it.   Madam Speaker, I thank Mr. Cloud for holding this time of discussion  tonight.
