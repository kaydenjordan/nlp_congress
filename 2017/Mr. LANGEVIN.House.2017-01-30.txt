 Mr. Speaker, on rollcall vote No. 66, I was unavoidably  detained. Had I been present, I would have voted ``yea.''    Mr. Speaker, on rollcall vote No. 66, I was unavoidably  detained. Had I been present, I would have voted ``yea.''    Mr. Speaker, I believe that we live in the greatest  country on Earth, and I am proud to say so. But I have to say that last  week's executive order by President Trump on refugee resettlement is  shaking that faith.   How can we hold ourselves as a beacon of hope when we turn away tens  of thousands of the most desperate and vulnerable of our men, women,  and children of this planet? How can we be the light of the world when  our policies are driven by darkness and fear?   I am going to keep that light alive. I am going to fight to keep it  that way because that is what we are, that is what we represent. I am  going to fight because I still believe that we are that shining city on  the hill. And I am going to fight for my State of Rhode Island, which  was founded on the principle of free religious practice, not fear of  the other. I am going to fight against injustice with my amazing  constituents who joined together for the second weekend in a row of  rallying at our State House to keep that light alive.   Mr. Speaker, we are a strong country, but we are strong because of  our values and our principles embodied in our Constitution. Let's  continue to build that shining city on the hill for the world. I am  going to continue this fight, and I hope my colleagues will, too.                            ____________________
