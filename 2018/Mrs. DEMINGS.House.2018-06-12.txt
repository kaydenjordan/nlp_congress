 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on the subject of this Special Order.    Mr. Speaker, today marks 2 years since the Pulse  shooting. Tonight, my colleague Congressman Soto and I stand on the  floor of the United States House of Representatives to honor and  remember the victims of that horrible night.   The Pulse attack was the second worst mass shooting marring American  history, the worst terrorist attack on U.S. soil since 9/11, and the  worst attack against the LGBTQ population in our history.   This evening, in our hometown of Orlando, thousands of people are  gathered, like they were 1 year ago and 1 year after that. They gather  to mourn, to honor, and to pay tribute to the 49 lives we lost on June  12, 2016, just as we do here tonight.   Mr. Speaker, I wish I could be there with my friends, neighbors, and  loved ones in Orlando, but I felt it was important to be here,  fulfilling our duty as Members of Congress. We stand here tonight on  the floor of the House of Representatives so that the world will not  forget the lives we lost in the Pulse nightclub shooting.   This month, we are celebrating Pride Month. June 1 was Gun Violence  Awareness Day. For the men and women at Pulse 2 years ago, the  nightclub was a refuge. It was a haven for our LGBTQ community and  their friends; and particularly, it was Latin Night, and they gathered  to celebrate. It was a place where, my bishop likes to say, they were  there for a late night fellowship.   This is what I want to emphasize. The victims at Pulse, like every  other mass shooting, were not in the wrong place at the wrong time.  They were living their lives, taking refuge in song, dance, joy, and  celebrating their common humanity at a time when the common humanity of  LGBTQ Americans was not, and it is still not, universally recognized in  our country.   It was supposed to be, Mr. Speaker, like any other Saturday night for  the men and women inside the Pulse nightclub. It was about 2:02 a.m.,  when everyone was closing their tabs for the night and about to head  home. That is when an ISIS-inspired gunman walked into the club with an  assault rifle and a handgun. Within a few minutes, he killed 49 people  and wounded 53 others.   The innocent men and women in the club didn't stand a chance against  the gunman. We will return to that point later. The fact is that the  weapons available to this gunman made his attack, in many instances, as  bad as a battlefield.   Orlando lost 49 lives that night; we lost 49 lives that night. Many  others have had their lives changed forever. But after the attack, we  saw our community come together. We donated blood together. We raised  money together, and we mourned and grieved together. Mr. Speaker,  tonight we continue to mourn, and we continue to grieve.  [[Page H5079]]    Together with my colleague, Congressman Darren Soto, we want to  remember the victims, tell their stories, and celebrate the lives we  lost 2 years ago.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Soto), my  colleague, whom I am absolutely honored to serve with.    Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Congressman Soto as he  talked about the advocacy that we have seen in the place that we call  home, the place that we love in Orlando.   It is amazing how, out of the ashes, out of tragedy, good things can  happen. We are so proud of Brandon and others like him who have turned  their unbelievable, unbearable pain into action.  [[Page H5080]]    Congressman Soto said one of the best ways to honor the victims is  through action. When we looked at the devastation 2 years ago, we  started a serious conversation about how to do that.   Of course, this year is a painful time for us, for Orlando, for our  Nation, for the world, for so many who grieved with us and continue to  grieve with us. But as we think about action and what has happened  since Pulse, I just have to mention a horrible tragedy that happened in  Orlando yesterday, as we talk about gun violence and continue to work  hard to turn our pain into advocacy and to legislation.   Yesterday, the Orlando Police Department responded to a domestic  violence call. The suspect was a convicted domestic abuser who had been  arrested several other times for felonious actions and for violating  his probation, but he also had a gun.   When the officers arrived, he opened fire, hitting one officer,  Officer Kevin Valencia, who had been with the department since 2016.  This young officer is in his twenties, and he has a wife and two young  children. Our thoughts and prayers go out to Officer Valencia, who is  in critical condition, fighting for his life.   But, inside, the shooter had his partner's four young children:   Irayan was 12. She wore glasses with pink rims. She had dark, wavy  hair and a bright smile. At school, she was known as an overachiever.   Lillia was 10. She was blonde and wore glasses.   Aiden was 6. He and his sister attended Sadler Elementary School, and  he loved dinosaurs.   Dove was 1 year old. She loved to play outside.   Officers evacuated the apartment complex where the standoff was  occurring. Neighbors stood by in parking lots, some of them in their  pajamas, while the hours ticked away. But when the police entered the  apartment, desperate to save lives, they found all four children dead,  as well as the shooter.   As we very painfully remember the victims of Pulse, a day before the  2-year anniversary, we lost two young girls and two young boys. These  children will never grow up, will never realize their full potential.   It is amazing what our children are now having to endure and having  to deal with. A 10-year-old girl who lives in the area spoke to a  reporter this morning, and she said: ``He killed himself and killed the  little kids.'' That is this 10-year-old girl's reality.   Gun violence kills our children. It kills our future. It breaks into  our homes, our theaters, our restaurants, our nightclubs. It turns  nightclubs into shooting ranges. It turns homes into battlefields. It  turns schools into theaters of war at worst, prisons at best.   We have few answers at this point about what happened and why on the  eve of a 2-year anniversary of Pulse, why this man, this convicted  felon with a history of violence, had a gun.   We know that in more than half of our Nation's mass shootings, a  family member is at least one of the victims.   We know that in nearly half of our Nation's mass shootings, there are  warning signs beforehand, often violence against family members.   Let's think about it. Before a gunman in Sutherland Springs, Texas,  killed 26 people, he had been convicted of domestic violence. Before a  shooter tried to kill our friends and colleagues at the congressional  baseball practice, he had beat his foster daughter and shot a gun at  her boyfriend. Before the Sandy Hook murderer killed 20 children and  six others at a Connecticut elementary school, he first killed his  mother.   There are usually warning signs beforehand.   The Pulse shooting was no exception. Before the Pulse gunman murdered  49, he beat his previous wife and locked her away from her family.   The American Journal of Public Health found that having a gun in the  household during a domestic violence situation makes it five times more  likely that the abuse will turn into a homicide.   So what do we do? What do we do as we talk about the advocacy that we  are so proud of that is going on in our hometown? What do we do as  legislators in one of the most powerful bodies not only in our country,  but in the world?   We remember our victims. We tell their stories. We grieve with their  families and with the survivors.   Mr. Speaker, at this time, I yield to Congressman Soto to continue to  share his thoughts with us.    Congressman Soto, I want to thank you so much for  several things that you've talked about.   First of all, your recognition of our first responders, our brave  police officers and firefighters and the absolutely amazing job that  they do, not just in Orlando, but across the Nation, to keep, as you  put it, our homeland safe.   When you think about it, our first responders get called to every  tragedy. I heard someone once say that--I believe it was Chief David  Brown, former Chief David Brown in Dallas, Texas who said that every  time society fails or something goes wrong, law enforcement's called in  to deal with it, to fix it. So thank you for your recognition of them.   We lost four law enforcement officers in the line of duty last year.  And we have one, as you heard me mention earlier, Officer Valencia, who  is in the hospital fighting for his life.   I also thank you for the beginning comments when you talked about the  bravery of some of the survivors at the Pulse nightclub, those who did  what they could to shield others from harm, to help others get to  places of safety.   But also, I think the elephant in the room are the giant loopholes  that you spoke about. When we share the stories of the Pulse victims,  it is impossible to separate those stories from the discussion of gun  violence in this country. The two are certainly intertwined, and we  cannot discuss one without discussing the other.   As we remember the lives of these 49 victims, and countless others  throughout the great Nation that we serve, I am reminded that every  American should have the right to go to school or church or a mall,  synagogue, a movie theater or a nightclub without being brutally  murdered or wounded by someone with a gun.                                time  2015    You have reminded me, Congressman Soto, that our job as legislators  is to create laws that allow Americans to live their lives in safety  and security. Two years after Pulse, we have not done that job, and you  so clearly pointed that out in your comments.   We have not closed the loopholes that allow disturbed people to buy a  gun without a background check, even though we represent Americans and  97 percent of Americans support that idea.   We have not implemented universal background checks while we  represent Americans, although 83 percent of Americans support universal  background checks.   We have not banned assault weapons like the one that was used to take  so many lives in the Pulse shooting, the Las Vegas shooting, the  Parkland shooting, and so many others, while 67 percent of Americans  support banning assault weapons.   The gentleman talked earlier about what those weapons were designed  to do. I spent 27 years in law enforcement. I can tell you that they  were designed for the battlefield. Persons shot by assault weapons, the  chances of survival are greatly diminished.   They were not designed for the streets of our neighborhoods and in  our communities and in our school campuses and at our churches and in  our movie theaters and other places that are designated safe places.   No, we have not banned bump stocks. What sense does it make to say  that automatic weapons are illegal, but allow individuals to go out  and, for less than $200, purchase a device that will take your  semiautomatic weapon and make it function like an automatic weapon?   As the gentleman mentioned earlier, no, we have not fully empowered  law enforcement to better protect our families by allowing them to  temporarily remove guns from troubled individuals.   Mr. Speaker, 2 years after Pulse is more than 2 years too late, but  the time is always right. I believe Dr. King said this, to do what is  right.   Instead of responding to mass shootings where police officers are  shot in the head, and children are killed and other innocent people, we  should work to prevent them. As a police chief, my goal was to stop  violence from occurring in the first place. We, as Members of Congress,  have the ability to do that.   Congress has acted on this issue before. We passed the National  Firearms Act of, gosh, 1934; the Gun Control Act of 1968; the Gun-Free  Schools Act; the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act; and the Federal  assault weapons bans. These were bipartisan efforts that saved lives.   Where is the legislative response to the Pulse shooting 2 years  later? Where is the legislative response to the Parkland shooting?   I urge my colleagues, my friends, let's do our job and make schools  and theaters and nightclubs of our country truly safe.   Mr. Speaker, how much time do I have remaining?    Mr. Speaker, we are here tonight to honor the victims  of Pulse. They deserve to be remembered. Their families deserve  recognition, and they also deserve action. The men, the women, the  mothers, the fathers, the sons and daughters, the brothers and sisters  gunned down in our country deserve remembrance.   They also deserve courage from their leaders. They deserve action  from us.   As we utilize the last, I guess, 11 minutes now, I will yield to  Congressman Soto to just kind of wrap up his thoughts and leave with us  some words that, hopefully, will carry us to the right direction.    Mr. Speaker, 49 bells to represent 49 people. Our  community declared June 12 to be Orlando United Day, a day of love and  kindness.   Today, we take time to remember the 49 angels and all of those who  still carry physical and mental wounds from that day, 2 years after the  attack.   I believe, Congressman Soto, more strongly than ever, that love will  win. While the pain will never go away, I do believe that we have an  obligation to turn our pain into action. We will not forget those who  lost their lives.   I am proud to represent a community that has acted with such  incredible strength and love. I am proud to continue to honor these men  and women, not only through our words, but through our actions. I am  also proud to be joined by Congressman Soto, and I thank the gentleman  for his unwavering commitment and dedication to protecting our  homeland, and his commitment to creating and passing meaningful  legislation to keep guns out of the hands of bad people.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his advocacy and his  leadership on this issue, and I thank him for joining me in this day of  remembrance.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
