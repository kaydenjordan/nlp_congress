 Mr. Chief Justice, for all of our colleagues'  information about scheduling, today we will plan to take short breaks  every 2 to 3 hours and will accommodate a 30-minute recess for dinner,  assuming it is needed, until the House managers have finished their  opening presentation.   For scheduling purposes, we have organized tomorrow's session to  convene at 10 a.m. and run for several hours as the President's counsel  begin their presentation.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Pursuant to the provisions of S. Res. 483, the  managers for the House of Representatives have 7 hours 53 minutes  remaining to make the presentation of their case.   The Senate will now hear you.                         Opening Statement--Continued    Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Mr. Chief Justice, Senators, distinguished  counsel of the President, I keep wanting to say ``good morning,'' but  good afternoon. I just wanted to give a very brief orientation to the  argument you will hear today.   We will begin with Jason Crow, who was talking about the  conditionality of the military assistance. This is the latter part,  although not the end, of the argumentation on the application of the  constitutional law as it respects article I, the abuse of power. I will  have a presentation after Mr. Crow, and soon thereafter we will  conclude the presentation on article I. We will then begin the  presentation on article II, once again applying the constitutional law  to the facts on the President's obstruction of Congress. We will then  have some concluding thoughts and then turn it over to the President's  counsel.   That is what you should expect for the day, and with that, I will now  yield to Mr. Crow of Colorado.   Mr. Manager CROW. Mr. Chief Justice, good afternoon. I woke up this  morning and walked to my local coffee shop, where, unlike my esteemed  colleague Mr. Jeffries from New York, nobody complained to me about  Colorado baseball. So I could only conclude that this is only a New  York Yankees problem.   As Mr. Schiff mentioned, we talked last night about the July 25 call  and the multiple officials who had confirmed the intent of the  President in withholding the aid, so now I would like to turn to what  happened around the time the aid was lifted.   We know that the aid was lifted ultimately on September 11, but it  wasn't lifted for any legitimate reason. It was only lifted because  President Trump had gotten caught. Let's go through how we know that.   On August 26, the whistleblower complaint had been sent to the  Director of National Intelligence, and public reports indicate that  President Trump was told about the complaint by White House Counsel Pat  Cipollone.   On September 5, though, the scheme became public. An editorial in the  Washington Post on that day, for the first time publicly, explicitly  linked the military aid hold and the investigations that President  Trump wanted.   Keep in mind that public scrutiny of the President's hold increased  exponentially after this became public. And this is where things start  moving really fast.   A few days later, on September 9, the House investigative committees  publicly announced their investigation of the President's conduct in  Ukraine. Lieutenant Colonel Vindman testified to the National Security  Council, and others at the White House learned about the investigation  when it was announced. And a colleague of his said that it might have  the effect of releasing the aid. On that same day, the  [[Page S532]]  House Intelligence Committee learns that the administration had  withheld the whistleblower complaint from Congress. The scheme was  unravelling. What happens 2 days later? President Trump released the  military aid.   He only released it after he got caught. But there is another reason  we know the President lifted the aid only because he got caught:  because there is no other explanation. The testimony of all of the  witnesses confirmed it. Both Lieutenant Colonel Vindman and Ms.  Williams testified that they were not provided any reason for lifting  the hold. Vindman testified that nothing on the ground had changed in  the 2 months of the hold, and Mark Sandy of the OMB also confirmed  that. Ambassador Taylor, too, testified that ``I was not told the  reason why the hold had been lifted.''   Let me take a moment to address another defense I expect you will  hear: that the aid was released and the investigations were never  announced; so therefore no harm, no foul, right? Well, this defense  would be laughable if this issue wasn't so serious.   First, I have spoken over the past 3 days about the real consequences  of inserting politics into matters of war. Real people, real lives are  at stake. Every day, every hour matters. So, no, the delay wasn't  meaningless. Just ask the Ukrainians sitting in trenches right now. And  to this day, they are still waiting on $18 million of the aid that  hasn't reached them.   Jennifer Williams, who attended the Warsaw meeting with Vice  President Pence, described President Zelensky's focus during this time.   (Text of Videotape presentation:)          Mr. Chief Justice, I suggest a 15-minute recess.   There being no objection, at 3:30 p.m., the Senate, sitting as a  Court of Impeachment, recessed until 4:04 p.m.; whereupon the Senate  reassembled when called to order by the Chief Justice.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Senate will come to order.   Mrs. Manager DEMINGS. Mr. Chief Justice and Senators, first of all, I  want to join my colleagues in just thanking you for your patience and  your indulgence.   What I can tell you today is that we are closer today than we were  yesterday because I am prepared to present article II: Obstruction of  Congress.   The second Article of Impeachment charges the President with misusing  the powers of his high office to obstruct the House impeachment  inquiry.   We are here today in response to a blanket order issued by President  Trump directing the entire executive branch to withhold all documents  and testimony from that inquiry.   President Trump's obstruction of the impeachment inquiry was  categorical, indiscriminate, and historically unprecedented. And its  purpose was clear: to impede Congress's ability to carry out its duties  under the Constitution to hold the President accountable for high  crimes and misdemeanors.   As part of his effort to cover up evidence of his scheme to solicit  foreign interference in the upcoming election, President Trump did  something no President has ever dared to do in the history of our  Republic. President Trump directed the entire executive branch not to  cooperate with the House's impeachment inquiry. President Trump blocked  every person who works in the White House and every person who works in  every department, agency, and office of the executive branch from  providing information to the House as part of the impeachment inquiry.   This was not about specific, narrowly defined security or privacy  issues. Nor was it based on potential privileges  [[Page S545]]  available to the executive branch. Indeed, President Trump has not once  asserted executive privilege during this process.   This was a declaration of total defiance of the House's authority to  investigate credible allegations of the President's misconduct and a  wholesale rejection of Congress's ability to hold the President  accountable.   The President's order, executed by his top aids, substantially  interfered with the House's constitutionally authorized power to  conduct an impeachment inquiry.   At President Trump's direction, the White House itself refused to  produce a single document or record in response to a House subpoena  that remains in full force and effect, and it continues to withhold  those documents from Congress and from the American people.   But it is not just the White House. Following President Trump's  order, the Office of the Vice President, the Office of Management and  Budget, the Department of State, the Department of Energy, and the  Department of Defense all continued to refuse to produce a single  document or record in response to 71 specific requests, including 5  subpoenas.   Additionally, following President Trump's order, 12 current or former  administration officials continue to refuse to testify as part of the  House's impeachment inquiry--not only current administration officials  but former administration officials as well. Nine of those witnesses,  including senior officials with direct firsthand knowledge of the  President's actions, continue to defy subpoenas for testimony because  of the President's order. And yet, despite President Trump's  obstruction, as you have heard and seen throughout the House managers'  presentation of the facts of the President's scheme, the House gathered  overwhelming evidence of his misconduct from courageous public servants  who were willing to follow the law, comply with subpoenas, and tell the  truth.   On the basis of that formidable body of evidence, the House adopted  the first Article of Impeachment. These witnesses also testified with  great specificity about extensive documents, communications, and  records in the possession of the White House and other agencies  regarding the President's scheme to coerce Ukraine's leader to help his  reelection.   As you have heard over the past few days, the House was, therefore,  able to develop an extensive catalog of specific documents and  pertinent communications that go to the heart of the President's  wrongdoing and which the President has ordered be concealed from  Congress and the American people.   Revelations of evidence harmful to the President have only continued  since the House compiled its investigative reports. Recent court- ordered releases under the Freedom of Information Act, as well as  disclosures to the media, have further demonstrated that the White  House, OMB, State Department, and other agencies are actively  withholding highly relevant documents that could further implicate the  President and his subordinates.   Over time, these documents and this evidence will undoubtedly come to  light, and I ask this body to not wait to read about it in the press or  in a book. You should be hearing this evidence now--hearing this  evidence now.   Now, there is one point that I would like to make very clear.  President Trump's wholesale obstruction of Congress strikes at the very  heart of our Constitution and our democratic system of government.   The President of the United States could undertake such comprehensive  obstruction only because of the exceptional powers entrusted to him by  the American people. Only one person in the world has the power to  issue an order to the entire executive branch. That person, Senators,  as you know, is the President. And President Trump used that power not  to faithfully execute the law but to order agencies and employees of  the executive branch to conceal evidence of his misconduct.   Now, I know that no other American could seek to obstruct an  investigation into his or her wrongdoing in this way. We all know that  no other American could use the vast powers of our government to  undertake a corrupt scheme to cheat to win an election and then use  those same powers to suppress the evidence of his constitutional crime.  We would not allow--I am convinced that we would not allow any member  of our State or local governments to use the official powers of their  office to cover up crimes and misdeeds. As this body is well aware,  mayors and Governors have gone to jail for doing so. Sheriffs and  police chiefs are certainly not immune. If we allow President Trump to  escape accountability, we will inflict lasting damage on the separation  of powers among our branches of government--our fundamental system of  checks and balances. It would inflict irreversible damage by allowing  this Commander in Chief and establishing precedence for future  Presidents to act corruptly or abusively and then use the vast powers  of their office--the Office of the Presidency--to conceal their own  misconduct from Congress and the American people. In other words, we  would create a system that allows this President and any future  President to really do whatever he or she wants.    It is an attack on congressional oversight, not just on the House but  also on the Senate's own ability to oversee and serve as a check on  this and future Presidents in both Republican and Democratic  administrations. Without meaningful oversight, without the power of  impeachment, Americans will have to come to accept a far greater  likelihood of misconduct by the Oval Office, and they would not be able  to look to other branches of government to hold their President--the  people's President--accountable.   Executive power without any sort of restraint, without oversight, and  without any checks and balances is absolute power. We know what has  been said about absolute power: ``Absolute power corrupts absolutely.''   This is the very opposite of what the Framers intended. The Framers  of the Constitution purposefully entrusted the power of impeachment to  the legislative branch so that it may protect the American people from  a corrupt President. Well, the times, Senators, have found us. If  Congress allows President Trump's obstruction to stand, it essentially  nullifies the impeachment power.   Senators, we are the keepers, the protectors, the defenders of what  the Framers intended. We must hold any unprincipled and undisciplined  Executive accountable.   Senators, I know that this is not easy. I don't take this moment  lightly. These are tough times. I remember quite a few tough times  during my 27 years as a law enforcement officer, but we must stop this  President. Today we will explain why.   First, we will review key facts regarding the scope and breadth of  President Trump's unprecedented actions to stop the House's impeachment  powers. As you well know, we covered many of these facts on Tuesday  when we explained in depth what evidence the President had blocked from  Congress. We addressed documents we know the White House and other  agencies are concealing. We addressed testimony the President's aides  would provide if they testified under oath. We will, therefore, review  the documents and witnesses briefly.   Second, after surveying relevant history and constitutional law, we  will explain why obstruction of Congress in and of itself warrants  impeachment and removal from office.   Finally, we will demonstrate that President Trump is without question  guilty of obstruction of Congress, that his defenses lack any legal  foundation, and that his actions pose a dire and continuing threat to  the foundation of our constitutional framework.   This is very simple. It is simple. The President abused the powers  entrusted in him by the American people in a scheme to suppress  evidence, escape accountability, and orchestrate a massive coverup, and  he did so in plain sight. His obstruction remains ongoing.   Ms. Manager GARCIA of Texas. Mr. Chief Justice, Senators, President's  counsel:   Before I start, I, too, want to thank all the Senators for being so  patient and being such good listeners. It reminds me, quite frankly, of  one of the first days that I went to what was affectionately called  ``baby judge school.'' When we first got started, those were the first  two things they told us--that we needed to be patient and that we  needed to listen and that we needed to be fair and always give the  opportunity to be heard to each side.  [[Page S546]]    I am going to say that you have certainly been playing a very good  role as judges because, although I know the press calls you jurors, I  know that you are in the role of judges, and I commend you for being  good listeners and for having the patience to listen to us these last 2  days and in our final remarks today. So thank you all.   Ms. Demings has given us an overview of the second Article of  Impeachment: Obstruction of Congress.   So let us now turn to the facts of the case because to fully  appreciate the scope and the scale of the President's wrongdoing and  the size of the coverup he has orchestrated, it requires an  understanding of the evidence that he has lawlessly hidden from  Congress and the American people.   President Trump categorically, indiscriminately, and in unprecedented  fashion obstructed Congress's impeachment inquiry; in other words, he  orchestrated a coverup. He did it in plain sight.   First, from the beginning, the Trump administration sought to hide  the President's misconduct by refusing to turn over the Intelligence  Committee whistleblower complaint. That complaint would sound the first  alarm of the President's wrongdoing.   Second, the President issued an order prohibiting the entire  executive branch from participating in the impeachment inquiry--no  cooperation, no negotiation, nothing--or as we say in Texas, nada.   Following the President's orders, Federal agencies refused to produce  documents, and key witnesses refused to testify. In fact, the President  sanctioned specific directions to officials, ordering them to defy  congressional subpoenas. Third, and perhaps the most reprehensible of  all, the President waged a campaign of intimidation against those brave  public servants who did come forward to comply with their obligation  under the law.   Senators, as I mentioned, I am a lawyer and a former judge. I have  never ever seen anything like this from a litigant or a party in any  case, not anywhere. But from the very beginning of this scandal,  President Trump has sought to hide and cover up key evidence.   The coverup started even before the House began to investigate the  President's Ukrainian-related activity. It began when the White House  sought to conceal the record of Donald Trump's July 25 call with the  President of Ukraine by placing it on a highly classified system. But,  as we have said before, there was no legitimate national security  reason to do so. The coverup continued. A top OMB official instructed  the freeze to be ``closely held.'' In other words, ``Don't say anything  to anybody.''   Senators, you know that in order to lock in the hold of the funding,  the President was required to notify Congress about the amount of money  involved and why he was intending to freeze it. Instead, the White  House tried to keep the freeze secret.   Maybe they kept it a secret because a senior White House aide, Rob  Blair, accurately predicted to his boss, Mick Mulvaney, to ``expect  Congress to become unhinged'' if it learned that bipartisan aid  approved for a valuable foreign partner was being frozen for the  President's personal gain.   But the coverup reached its peak soon after August 12 because, on  August 12, a whistleblower filed a lawful and protected complaint  intended for Congress with the inspector general of the intelligence  community. The President, who was the subject of the complaint, learned  of the filing well before Congress and the American people.   In an effort to conceal the whistleblower's concerns, the White House  and the Department of Justice took an unprecedented step. No  administration had ever intervened in such a manner before. But  President Trump maneuvered to keep the whistleblower's concerns from  the congressional Intelligence Committee.   In the history of the Intelligence Committee Whistleblower Protection  Act, no credible and urgent complaint had ever, ever been withheld from  Congress--not ever before. It was through immense public pressure and  vigorous oversight by the House that the Trump administration  ultimately produced a complaint to the House and Senate Intelligence  Committees. I will add that even when it was produced, it was weeks  after the legal deadline.   If the President's efforts to conceal the whistleblower's concerns  had succeeded, Congress would never have learned about the existence of  the complaint, let alone the allegations that it contained. But this  attempt to hide key information from Congress was only the first sign  of what was to come.   Following new, deeply troubling revelations about the President's  July 25 call, on September 24, the Speaker of the House announced that  the House investigations into the President's scheme to pressure  Ukraine for personal gain would be folded into the ongoing impeachment  inquiry. Just days later, the President began to attack the legitimacy  of the House impeachment inquiry.   While standing on the tarmac at Andrews Air Force Base, President  Trump argued that the House impeachment inquiry ``shouldn't be  allowed.'' He claimed ``There should be a way of stopping it--maybe  legally, through the courts.''   Let's watch the President and what he had to say:   (Text of Videotape presentation:)         The PRESIDENT. My call was perfect. The President,       yesterday, of Ukraine said there was no pressure put on him       whatsoever. None whatsoever. And he said it loud and clear to       the press. What these guys are doing--Democrats--are doing to       this country is a disgrace and it shouldn't be allowed. There       should be a way of stopping it--maybe legally, through the       courts.    Ms. Manager GARCIA of Texas. ``There should be a way of stopping  it.''   Soon after, President Trump took the matter into his own hands. The  President used his authority and his office to wage a relentless and  misleading public campaign to attack the impeachment inquiry.   The President spent time at rallies, at press conferences, and on  Twitter trying to persuade the American people that the House's inquiry  was invalid and fraudulent.   Here are just a few of President Trump's comments about the  impeachment inquiry. He called it ``a witch hunt,'' ``a COUP,'' ``an  unconstitutional power grab,'' and ``a fraud against the American  people.'' He said it is ``the phony Impeachment Scam,'' ``the phony  Impeachment Hoax,'' the ``Ukraine Hoax,'' and ``a continuation of the  greatest Scam and Witch Hunt in the history of our Country.''   Those are probably some of the ones that I can repeat here. And it  didn't stop. The attacks did not end there. President Trump turned from  rhetoric to action.   On October 8, the White House sent a letter to Speaker Nancy Pelosi  informing her that President Trump would seek to completely obstruct  the impeachment inquiry. They sent this letter. White House stationery.  I shouldn't say this--I am a lawyer--but it is very lawyerly. It is an  eight-page letter. You know, lawyers can't do one thing in one page; we  have to do it in seven or eight. This was eight pages, and it is long.  No worries, I am not going to read it all. I just want to get to the  bottom line. It says: ``President Trump cannot permit his  Administration to participate in this partisan inquiry under these  circumstances.''   He was just saying: We are not going to cooperate.   The letter is dated, again, October 8, and it is signed by Pat  Cipollone, who is here, of course, with us today as the lead counsel  for the President.   The President did not make any claim of privilege. The President did  not make any attempt to compromise. He had no valid excuse. Although we  are all too familiar with President Trump's rhetoric and rants, these  words in this letter on White House stationery, signed by his lead  counsel here today, have consequences. These words have consequences.  They were more than just ink on a page. They were more than just eight  pages of words.   In the days that followed, President Trump's agencies and officials  followed his order to conceal information from Congress. Over the past  few days, you have heard in extensive detail from all of us about some  of the specific and incriminating documents that the President has  withheld from Congress. But, again, here is the bottom line: The House  investigating committees sought a total of 71 specific categories of  documents from 6 different agencies and offices. President Trump  blocked every single one of these requests--all of them.  [[Page S547]]    Between September 27 and October 10, the investigating committees  issued subpoenas to the Department of State, the White House, the  Office of Management and Budget, Department of Defense, and the  Department of Energy. The committees always remained open to working  with the executive branch to discuss and prioritize the subpoenas.   Some agents initially suggested that they might comply. For example,  a few days after receiving the subpoena, the Department of State staff  reached out to the committee to ``discuss accommodations.''   As you all know, the accommodation process is when Congress and the  executive branch discuss priorities and concerns so that the committee  gets what it needs most efficiently, while minimizing any burden to the  agency.   On October 7, the committee staff met with State Department  officials. During that conversation, the committees made a good-faith  attempt to engage the Department in negotiations.   To start, the committees requested that the Department prioritize  production of a narrow set of nonprivileged documents. The Department's  representatives stated that they would take the request back to senior  State Department officials, but that was the end. That was the end.  Those priority documents were never provided to the committees.   In addition to the State Department, the Department of Defense also  showed an initial interest in cooperating. During an October 13  television appearance, Secretary of Defense Mark Esper stated  repeatedly that the Department of Defense would seek to comply. He said  on air, on TV, that they would seek to comply with the subpoena.   In an exchange on ``Face the Nation,'' he was specifically asked:         Question. Very quickly, are you going to comply with the       subpoena that the House provided you and provide documents to       them regarding the halt to military aid to Ukraine?        Answer. [From the Secretary] Yeah we will do everything we       can to cooperate with the Congress. Just in the last week or       two, my general counsel sent out a note as we typically do in       these situations to ensure documents are retained.        [But, again, the question is] Is that a yes?        Answer. [By the Secretary] That's a yes.        Question. You will comply with the subpoena?        Answer. [Again, by the Secretary] We will do everything we       can to comply.    These are his very own words: We can comply.   But remember that October 8 letter from the White House Counsel sent  to the Speaker stating the President's position of total defiance.  President Trump--again, I will quote it. It said: ``President Trump  cannot permit his Administration to participate in this partisan  inquiry under these circumstances.''   So every department and every office, top to bottom, of the executive  branch was under these instructions. You know, that is about 2 million  public servants, top to bottom. The executive branch was all ordered by  President Trump not to provide information to Congress. The President  offered no accommodation and no opportunity for negotiation.   Ultimately, each agency and office followed the President's order. In  response to each subpoena, the Trump administration produced no  documents--nothing, nada--and the agencies and offices made clear that  it was due to the President's instructions. They always deferred to  that October 8 letter.   For example, despite the Secretary's initial signal of cooperation--I  gave you the quote from when he was asked specifically on TV. He said  they would try to cooperate. But despite that, the Department of  Defense later refused to respond to the committee's subpoena. In a  letter to the committees, the Department of Defense echoed many of the  White House's unsupported legal arguments and concluded: ``In light of  these concerns, and in view of the President's position as expressed in  the White House Counsel's October 8 letter, and without waiving any  other objections to the subpoena that the Department may have, the  Department is unable to comply with your request for documents at this  time.''   In a TV interview on ``Face the Nation, they tried to ask him again.  When asked by Chris Wallace on FOX News:         Question. And--but do you feel Congress has a right to       oversight and to be able to see documents from the Pentagon       about a program that was approved by Congress?        Answer. Well, they do, but provided it's done in the right       and proper way. And I think that was the issue. Again, I       think my reputation is pretty good in terms of being very       transparent. I like to communicate with members of Congress.       But in this case, they were--my recollection is that there       were technical and legal issues that prohibited us from doing       exactly what was requested by Congress.    So he said he would try to cooperate, to seek to comply, but now they  are back-peddling. But, Senators, there were no valid technical or  legal arguments. None were put forth to justify the stonewalling of the  impeachment inquiry. The documents President Trump is withholding are  highly relevant, responsive, and would further our understanding of the  President's scheme.   Here is just a sampling of the documents we know exist that are  currently being withheld: National Security Advisor John Bolton's  notes, Ambassador Taylor's first-person cable to Secretary Pompeo,  emails between OMB and other agencies about the President's directive  to place a hold on the Ukraine military aid, and the hundreds of  heavily redacted documents that the administration has now turned over  to third parties under FOIA court orders.   Certainly the documents released pursuant to the FOIA lawsuits were  not subject to any claims of privilege or confidentiality or burden.  The administration released them publicly. By contrast, the President  turned over nothing in response to the House impeachment investigation.   Senators, there still is another component of the President's  obstruction that I want all of us to focus on.   Not only did the President block agencies and offices from producing  documents, his administration also blocked current and former officials  from identifying, producing, or even reviewing relevant documents.   First, the Trump administration actively discouraged its employees  from even identifying documents responsive to the committees' request.   Deputy Assistant Secretary George Kent testified in his deposition  that he informed the State Department attorney about additional  responsive records that the Department had not collected. According to  Kent, the Department attorney ``got very angry'' and ``objected to [Mr.  Kent] raising of the additional information.'' He ``made clear that he  did not think it was appropriate for [Mr. Kent] to make the  suggestion.''   So here is a lawyer telling the witness: Don't say that. I just-- frankly, as a lawyer and former judge, I just can't believe something  like this would happen. But Kent responded that he was just trying to  ``make sure that the Department was being fully responsive.''   Second, the Trump administration refused to permit individual  witnesses to produce relevant documents themselves.   After the State Department failed to respond to voluntary requests  for documents at the beginning of the investigation, the committee sent  document requests to six individual State Department employees.  Secretary Pompeo objected to the committee's request to State  officials, calling them ``an act of intimidation and invitation to  violate federal court laws.'' He also claimed that the House inquiry  was ``an attempt to intimidate, bully, and treat improperly the  distinguished professionals of the Department of State.''   Now we were the bullies. But let's be clear: His statement has been  contradicted by actual State Department professionals from whom the  committees sought documents. Kent testified that he ``had not felt  bullied, threatened, and intimidated'' by the House. In fact, Kent said  that the language in Secretary Pompeo's letter, which had been drafted  by a State Department attorney, was without consulting Mr. Kent.   He said: ``It was inaccurate''--``inaccurate.'' Then the State  Department ordered witnesses to withhold documents from Congress.   For example, on October 14, the Department sent a letter to Kent's  personal attorney warning--warning: ``Your client is not authorized to  disclose to Congress any records relating to official duties.''   Certain witnesses defied those orders and produced the substance of  key documents, providing critical insight into  [[Page S548]]  the President's scheme. Other witnesses produced documents to the Trump  administration so they could be turned over to Congress, but now the  administration is also sitting on those documents and is refusing to  turn them over. Ambassador Taylor testified that he turned over  documents to the Trump administration but, to his knowledge, they had  not been produced to the House.   Let's watch.   (Text of Videotape presentation:)          Mr. Chief Justice, we will take a 30-minute break for  dinner.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Without objection, it is so ordered.   There being no objection, at 6:45 p.m. the Senate, sitting as a Court  of Impeachment, recessed until 7:32 p.m.; whereupon the Senate  reassembled when called to order by the Chief Justice.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. The majority leader is recognized.    I have spoken with Congressman Schiff and his team,  and it looks like we have a couple more hours.   Mr. Manager CROW. Mr. Chief Justice, Members of the Senate, counsel  for the President, impeachment exists not to inflict personal  punishment for past wrongdoing but, rather, to protect against future  Presidential misconduct that would endanger democracy and the rule of  law.   President Trump remains a threat in at least three fundamental ways:   First, he continues to assert in court and elsewhere that nobody in  the U.S. Government can investigate him for wrongdoing, making him  unaccountable.   Second, his conduct here is not a one-off; it is a pattern of  soliciting foreign interference in our elections to his own advantage  and then using the powers of his office to stop anyone who dares to  investigate.   Finally, the President's obstruction is very much a constitutional  crime in progress, harming Congress, as it deliberates these very  proceedings, and the American people, who deserve to know the facts.   A President who believes he can get away with anything and can use  his office to conceal evidence of abuse threatens us all.  [[Page S559]]    President Trump is the first President in U.S. history to say he is  immune from any effort to examine his conduct or check his power. He  claims he is completely immune from criminal indictment and prosecution  while serving as President. He claims he can commit any crime--even  shoot someone on Fifth Avenue, as he has joked about--with impunity.  The President's own lawyers have argued in court that he cannot even be  investigated for violating the law under any circumstance. No President  of either party has ever made claims like this.   If an investigation somehow does uncover misconduct by the President,  as this investigation has done, the President believes he can simply  quash it. He claims the right to end Federal law enforcement  investigations for any reason--or none at all--even when there is  credible evidence of his own wrongdoing.   Added together, the President's positions amount to a license to do  anything he wants. No court has ever accepted this view and for good  reason: Our Founders created a system in which all people--even  Presidents--are bound by the law and accountable for their actions.   In addition to claiming that he is immune from criminal process,  President Trump contends that he is not accountable to either Congress  or the judiciary. He has invoked bizarre legal theories to justify  defying congressional investigations. He has argued that Congress is  forbidden from having the courts intervene when executive branch  officials disregard its subpoenas. He has sued to block third parties  from complying with congressional subpoenas.   Perhaps most remarkably, President Trump has claimed that Congress  cannot investigate his misconduct outside of an impeachment inquiry,  while simultaneously claiming that Congress cannot investigate his  misconduct in an impeachment inquiry. Of course, President Trump  considers any inquiry to be illegitimate if he thinks he did nothing  wrong, doubts the motives of Congress, or decides that he would prefer  a different set of rules.   Let's review the President's position. He can't be investigated for  crimes. He can end any Federal law enforcement investigation into him.  He is immune from any State law enforcement investigation. Neither he  nor his aides can be subpoenaed. He can reject subpoenas based on  broad, novel, and even rejected theories. When he does reject  subpoenas, Congress is not allowed to sue him, but he is allowed to sue  to block others from complying with congressional subpoenas. Congress  definitely can't investigate him outside of an impeachment inquiry,  and, again, it can't investigate him as part of one.   The bottom line is that the President truly believes that he is above  the law. This is not our system, and it never has been. The President  is a constitutional officer. Unlike a King, he is accountable to the  Constitution. But this President doesn't believe that, and that is why  we are here.   Remember, the precedent that you set in this trial will shape  American democracy for the future. It will govern this President, and  it will govern those who follow. If you let the President get away with  his obstruction, you risk grave and irreparable harm to the separation  of powers itself.   Representative Lawrence Hogan, a Republican from Maryland, made this  point during the Nixon impeachment hearing.   (Text of Videotape presentation:)         Mr. HOGAN (Republican). The historical precedent we are       setting here is so great because in every future impeachment       of a President, it is inconceivable that the evidence       relating to that impeachment will not be in the hands of the       executive branch which is under his controls. So I agree with       the gentleman from Ohio, Mr. Seiberling, if we do not pass       this article today, the whole impeachment power becomes       meaningless.    Mr. Manager CROW. This leads us to a second consideration: the  President's pattern of obstructing.   Article II describes President Trump's impeachable conduct in  obstructing Congress. On its own, that warrants removal from office.  Yet it must be noted that the President's obstruction fits a disturbing  pattern.   As stated in article II, President Trump's obstruction is  ``consistent with [his] previous efforts to undermine United States  Government investigations into foreign interference in United States  elections.''   Another example is President Trump's attempts to impede the special  counsel's investigation into Russian interference with the 2016  election, as well as the President's sustained efforts to obstruct the  special counsel after learning that he was under investigation for  obstruction of justice.   The special counsel's investigation addressed an issue of  extraordinary importance to our national security and democracy: the  integrity of our elections themselves. Rather than aid the special  counsel's investigation, however, President Trump sought to thwart it  and used the powers of his office to do it.   After learning that he himself was under investigation, President  Trump ordered the firing of the special counsel, sought to curtail the  special counsel's investigation, instructed the White House Counsel to  create a false record and make false public statements, and tampered  with at least two key witnesses in the investigation.   The pattern is as unmistakable as it is unnerving.   In one moment, President Trump welcomed and invited a foreign nation  to interfere in an election to his advantage, and the next, he  solicited and pressured a foreign nation to do so.   In one moment, President Trump used the powers of his office to  obstruct the special counsel, and the next, he used the powers of his  office to obstruct the House impeachment inquiry.   In one moment, the President stated that he remained free to invite  foreign interference in our elections. In the next, he, in fact,  invited additional foreign interference in our elections.   (Text of Videotape presentation:)         President TRUMP. By the way, likewise, China should start       an investigation into the Bidens.    Mr. Manager CROW. Indeed, President Trump placed his fateful July 25  call to President Zelensky just 1 day after the special counsel  testified in Congress about his findings.   As Professor Gerhardt testified before the Judiciary Committee:         The power to impeach includes the power to investigate,       but, if the president can stymy this House's impeachment       inquiry, he can eliminate the impeachment powers as a means       for holding him and future presidents accountable for serious       misconduct. If left unchecked, the president will likely       continue his pattern of soliciting foreign interference on       his behalf in the next election.    I must emphasize that President Trump's obstruction persists to this  day.   The second Article of Impeachment charges a high crime in progress.  As a result, the President's wrongdoing did not just harm the House as  we have performed our own constitutional duty; it is also harming the  Senate, which is being deprived of information you need before the  votes you will soon take. And, of course, the true victim is the  American people, who deserve the full truth.   As we have discussed, the President claims that all the evidence he  is hiding and covering up would actually prove his innocence. To borrow  a phrase from the late Justice Scalia, that claim ``taxes the credulity  of the credulous.''   President Trump has used all the authority of his office to block the  full truth from coming to light. He has defied subpoenas and ordered  others to do so. He has publicly intimidated and threatened witnesses.  He has attacked the House for daring to investigate him. And he has  lobbed an endless volley of personal attacks on witnesses and meritless  complaints about procedure to sow confusion and distract the American  people.   The President's abuses are unfolding before our eyes, and they must  be stopped.   Before I conclude, I think you all deserve an explanation from me as  to why I am standing here. There has been a lot of conversation in the  last few years about what makes America great, and I have some ideas  about that. I happen to think that what makes America great is that  generation after generation, there have been Americans who have been  willing to stand up and put aside their self-interest to make great  sacrifices for the public good, for our country. I know because I have  seen people do that. Like some of the people in this Chamber, I have  seen people give everything for this country so we could sit here  today.  [[Page S560]]    Now, this isn't politically expedient. It certainly isn't for me. It  is hard. It requires sacrifice. It is uncomfortable. But that is the  very definition of ``public service''; that we are here to give of  ourselves for the country, for others, at sacrifice to ourselves. Those  who have given so much for this country deserve nothing less from us  now than to try to honor those sacrifices. I have tried to do that the  last few days. My time is done, and it is now your turn.   Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Chief Justice, Senators, counsel for the  President, you will be pleased to know this is the last presentation of  the evening. And as I started last night, I made reference to some good  advice I got from an encouraging voice that said: Keep it up but not  too long.   Tonight I got some equally good advice: To be immortal, you don't  need to be eternal. I will do my best not to be eternal.   The first point I would like to make is I am tired. I don't know  about you, but I am exhausted, and I can only imagine how you feel. But  I am also very deeply grateful for just how you have attended to these  presentations and discussions over the last few days. I am deeply  grateful. I can tell how much consideration you have given to our point  of view and the President's point of view, and that is all we can ask.  At the end of the day, all we can ask is that you hear us out and make  the best judgment that you can, consistent with your conscience and our  Constitution.   Now, I wanted to start out tonight with where we began when we first  appeared before you about a week ago, and that is with the resolution  itself, with what the President is charged with in the articles and how  that holds up now that you have heard the evidence from the House.   Donald Trump was impeached in article I for abuse of power, and that  article provides that:         In his conduct of the office of the President of the United       States--and in violation of his constitutional oath       faithfully to execute the office of President of the United       States and, to the best of his ability, preserve, protect,       and defend the Constitution of the United States, and in       violation of his constitutional duty to take care that the       laws be faithfully executed--Donald J. Trump has abused the       powers of the Presidency, in that:        Using the powers of his high office, President Trump       solicited the interference of a foreign government, Ukraine,       in the 2020 United States Presidential election.    ``President Trump solicited interference of a foreign government,  Ukraine, in the 2020 election.''   That has been proved.         He did so through a scheme or course of conduct that       included soliciting the Government of Ukraine to publicly       announce investigations that would benefit his reelection,       harm the election prospects of a political opponent, and       influence the 2020 Presidential election to his advantage.    That has been proved.         President Trump also sought to pressure the Government of       Ukraine to take these steps by conditioning official United       States Government acts of significant value to Ukraine on its       public announcement of the investigations.    That has been proved.         President Trump engaged in this scheme or course of conduct       for corrupt purposes in pursuit of personal political       benefit.    That has been proved.         In so doing, President Trump used the powers of the       Presidency in a manner that compromised the national security       of the United States and undermined the integrity of the       United States democratic process.    That has been proved.         He thus ignored and injured the interests of the Nation.    That has been proved.         President Trump engaged in this scheme or course of conduct       through the following means:        (1) President Trump--acting both directly and through his       agents within and outside the United States Government--      corruptly solicited the Government of Ukraine to publicly       announce investigations into--        (A) a political opponent, former Vice President Joseph R.       Biden, Jr.; and    That has been proved.         (B) a discredited theory promoted by Russia alleging that       Ukraine--rather than Russia--interfered in the 2016 United       States Presidential election.    That has been proved.         (2) With the same corrupt motives, President Trump--acting       both directly and through his agents within and outside the       United States Government--conditioned two official acts on       the public announcements that he had requested--        (A) the release of $391 million of United States taxpayer       funds that Congress had appropriated on a bipartisan basis       for the purpose of providing vital military and security       assistance to Ukraine to oppose Russian aggression and which       President Trump had ordered suspended.    That has been proved.         (B) a head of state meeting at the White House, which the       President of Ukraine sought to demonstrate continued United       States support for the Government of Ukraine in the face of       Russian aggression.    That has been proved.         (3) Faced with the public revelation of his actions,       President Trump ultimately released the military and       security assistance to the Government of Ukraine, but has       persisted in openly and corruptly urging and soliciting       Ukraine to undertake investigations for his personal       political benefit.    That has been proved.         These actions were consistent with President Trump's       previous invitations of foreign interference in United States       elections.    That has been proved.         In all of this, President Trump abused the powers of the       Presidency by ignoring and injuring national security and       other vital national interests to obtain an improper personal       political benefit.    That has been proved.         He also betrayed the Nation by abusing his high office to       enlist a foreign power in corrupting democratic elections.    That has been proved.         Wherefore President Trump, by such conduct, has       demonstrated that he will remain a threat to national       security and the Constitution if allowed to remain in office,       and has acted in a manner grossly incompatible with self-      governance and the rule of law.    That has been proved.         President Trump thus warrants impeachment and trial,       removal from office, and disqualification to hold and enjoy       any office of honor, trust, or profit under the United       States.    That will be for you to decide. But the facts have been proved. Those  facts are not contested. We have met our burden.         Article II: Obstruction of Congress.        The Constitution provides that the House of Representatives       ``shall have the sole Power of Impeachment'' and the       President ``shall be removed from Office on Impeachment for,       and Conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and       Misdemeanors.'' In his conduct of the office of President of       the United States--and in violation of his constitutional       oath faithfully to execute the office of President of the       United States and, to the best of his ability, preserve,       protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States,       and in violation of his constitutional duty to take care that       the laws be faithfully executed--Donald J. Trump has directed       the unprecedented, categorical, and indiscriminate defiance       of subpoenas issued by the House of Representatives pursuant       to its ``sole Power of Impeachment''.    That has been proved.         President Trump has abused the powers of Presidency in a       manner offensive to, and subversive of, the Constitution, in       that:        The House of Representatives has engaged in an impeachment       inquiry focused on President Trump's corrupt solicitation of       the Government of Ukraine to interfere in the 2020 United       States Presidential election.    That has been proved.         As part of this impeachment inquiry, the Committees       undertaking investigation served subpoenas seeking documents       and testimony deemed vital to the inquiry for various       Executive Branch agencies and offices, and current and former       officials.    That has been proved.         In response, without lawful cause or excuse, President       Trump directed Executive Branch agencies, offices, and       officials not to comply with those subpoenas.    That has been proved.         President Trump thus interposed the powers of the       Presidency against the lawful subpoenas of the House of       Representatives, and assumed to himself functions and       judgments necessary to the exercise of the ``sole Power of       Impeachment'' vested by the Constitution in the House of       Representatives.    That has been proved.         President Trump abused the powers of his high office       through the following means:        (1) Directing the White House to defy a lawful subpoena by       withholding the production of documents sought therein by the       Committees.    That has been proved.         (2) Directing other Executive Branch agencies and offices       to defy lawful subpoenas and withhold the production of       documents and records from the Committees--in response to       which the Department of State, Office of Management and       Budget, Department of Energy, and Department of Defense       refused to produce a single document or record.    That has been proved.         (3) Directing current and former Executive Branch officials       not to cooperate with the  [[Page S561]]       Committees--in response to which nine Administration       officials defied subpoenas for testimony, namely John Michael       ``Mick'' Mulvaney, Robert B. Blair, John A. Eisenberg,       Michael Ellis, Preston Wells Griffith, Russell T. Vought,       Michael Duffey, Brian McCormack, and T. Ulrich Brechbuhl.    That has been proved.         These actions were consistent with President Trump's       previous efforts to undermine United States Government       investigations into foreign interference in United States       elections.    That has been proved.         Through these actions, President Trump sought to arrogate       to himself the right to determine the propriety, scope, and       nature of an impeachment inquiry into his own conduct, as       well as the unilateral prerogative to deny any and all       information to the House of Representatives in the exercise       of its ``sole Power of Impeachment.''    That has been proved.         In the history of the Republic, no President has ever       ordered the complete defiance of an impeachment inquiry or       sought to obstruct and impede so comprehensively the ability       of the House of Representatives to investigate ``high Crimes       and Misdemeanors''.    That has been proved.         This abuse of office served to cover up the President's own       repeated misconduct and to seize and control the power of       impeachment--and thus to nullify a vital constitutional       safeguard vested solely in the House of Representatives.    This has been proved.         In all of this, President Trump has acted in a manner       contrary to his trust as President and subversive of       constitutional government, to the great prejudice of the       cause of law and justice, and to the manifest injury of the       people of the United States.    That has been proved.         Wherefore, President Trump, by such conduct, has       demonstrated that he will remain a threat to the Constitution       if allowed to remain in office, and has acted in a manner       grossly incompatible with self-government and the rule of       law.    That has been proved.         President Trump thus warrants impeachment and trial,       removal from office, and disqualification to hold and enjoy       any office of honor, trust, or profit under the United       States.    That will be for you to determine.   Let me say something about this second article. The facts of the  President's defiance of Congress are very simple because they were so  uniform, because they were so categorical, because they are so  uncontested; yet do not mistake for a moment the fact that it was  simple and quick to present that course of conduct compared with the  sophisticated campaign to coerce Ukraine into thinking that that second  article is any less significant than the first. Do not believe that for  a moment. If there is no article II, let me tell you something: There  will never be an article I. If there is no article II, there will never  of any kind or shape or form be an article I.   And why is that? Because, if you and we lack the power to investigate  a President, there will never be an article I. Whether that article I  is an abuse of power or that article I is treason or that article I is  bribery, there will never be an article I if the Congress can't  investigate an impeachable offense. If the Congress cannot investigate  the President's own wrongdoing because the President prevents it, there  will never be an article I because there will be no more impeachment  power. It will be gone. It will be gone.   As I said before, our relationship with Ukraine will survive. God  willing, our relationship with Ukraine will survive, and Ukraine will  prosper. We will get beyond this ugly chapter of our history.   Yet, if we are to decide here that a President of the United States  can simply say, Under article II, I can do whatever I want, and I don't  have to treat a coequal branch of government like it exists, and I  don't have to give it any more than the back of my hand, that will be  an unending injury to this country--Ukraine will survive, and so will  we--but that will be an unending injury to this country because the  balance of power that our Founders set out will never be the same if a  President can simply say: I am going to fight all subpoenas.   I will tell you something else. Truism in the courts is just as true  here in the Senate. When they say, ``Justice delayed is justice  denied,'' if you give this President or any other the unilateral power  to delay as long as he or she likes--to litigate matters for years and  years in the courts--do not fool yourself into thinking it is anything  less.   In April, it will be a year since we subpoenaed Don McGahn, and there  is no sign of an end to that case. I will tell you, when it gets to the  Supreme Court, you might think that is the end, but it is just the end  of the first chapter because Don McGahn is in court, saying: I am  absolutely immune from testifying.   Now, that has been rejected by every court that has looked at it. We  will see what the court of appeals says, and then we will see if it  goes to an en banc court of appeals, and then we will see what the  Supreme Court says. When we prevail in the Supreme Court, do you know  what happens? That is not the end of the matter. It goes back to the  trial court, and then--well, they can't claim absolute immunity  anymore. They can't claim that. They don't even have to bother showing  up.   So now we are going to turn to plan B, executive privilege, where  ``we can't and won't answer any of the questions that are really  pertinent to your impeachment inquiry.'' Let's start out in district  court and then go to the court of appeals and then go to the en banc  and then go to the Supreme Court.   You can game the system for years. Justice delayed is justice denied,  and so it is true about Presidential accountability. When you suggest  or I suggest or anyone suggests or the White House suggests ``why  didn't the Congress--why didn't the House--just exhaust their  remedies?''--as if in the Constitution, where it says ``the House shall  have the sole Power of Impeachment'' there is an asterisk that reads:  ``after exhausting all court remedies and seeking relief in the  district court and seeking relief in the court of appeals and, after  that, going to the Supreme Court''--let's not kid ourselves about what  that really is.   What that really means is you allow the President to control the  timing of his own impeachment or if it will ever be permitted to come  before this body. That is not an impeachment power. That is the absence  of an impeachment power.   Article II is every bit as important as article I. Without article  II, there is no article I ever again, no matter how egregious this  President's conduct or any other's. It is fundamental to the separation  of powers. If you can't have the ability to enforce an impeachment  power, you might as well not put it in the Constitution.   Shortly, the President's lawyers will have a chance to make their  presentation. As we will not have the ability to respond to what they  say, I want to give you a little preview of what I think they are going  to have in store for you so that, when you do hear it, you can put it  into some perspective.   I expect that they will attack the process, and I don't think that is  any mystery. I want to tell you both what I expect they will share with  you and what it really means. When you cut through all of the chaff,  what does it really mean that they are saying? This is what I expect  they will tell you.   The process was so unfair. It was the most unfair in the history of  the world because, in the House, they took depositions. How dare they  take depositions? How dare they listen to Trey Gowdy? How dare they  follow the Republican procedures that preceded their investigation? How  dare they?   They were so secretive in the bunker in the basement, as if whether  it is on the ground floor or in the basement or on the first floor  makes any difference. There were those supersecret depositions in which  only 100 Members of Congress--equivalent to the entire Senate--could  participate. That is how secret they were. That is how exclusive they  were. Every Democrat, every Republican on the three committees could  participate. Of course, that wasn't enough, so you even had more storm  the SCIF, right? So you have 100 people who can participate, but as you  heard earlier, the Republicans were not allowed to participate.    OK. That is just false. Do you know how we did it in those  supersecret depositions? You can look this up yourselves because we  released the transcripts. We got an hour. They got an hour. We got 45  minutes. They got 45 minutes. We did that back and forth until everyone  was done asking their questions.   You are going to hear that Chairman Schiff was so unfair, he wouldn't  allow us to ask our questions. Well, there were certain questions I  didn't allow,  [[Page S562]]  questions like ``Who is the whistleblower? because we want to punish  that whistleblower.'' Some of us in that House and in this House  believe we ought to protect whistleblowers. So, yes, I did not allow  the outing of the whistleblower.   When they say the chairman wouldn't allow certain questions, that is  what they mean. It means that we protect people who have the courage to  come forward and blow the whistle, and we don't think--though the  President might--that they are traitors and spies. To believe that  someone who blows the whistle on misconduct of the serious nature that  you now know took place is a traitor or a spy, there is only one way  you can come to that conclusion, and that is if you believe you are the  state and that anything that contradicts you is treason. That is the  only way that you could conceive of someone who exposes wrongdoing as  being a traitor or a spy, but that is exactly how this President views  those who expose his wrongdoing--because he is the state. Like any good  monarch, he is the state.   You will hear the President wasn't allowed to participate in the  Judiciary Committee. Well, that is false, too, as you know. The  President had the same rights in our proceedings as President Nixon and  President Clinton. Nonetheless, you will hear it was so unfair.   One other thing that was really unfair was that all of the subpoenas  were invalid because the House didn't pass a resolution announcing its  impeachment inquiry--never mind that we actually did. The problem was,  they said, well, we had not, and then we did. Then the problem was,  well, you did.   Of course, as you know, the Constitution says the House will ``have  the sole Power of Impeachment.'' If we want to do it by House  resolution, we can do it by House resolution. If we want to do it by  committee, we can do it by committee. It is not the President's place  to tell us how to conduct an impeachment proceeding any more than it is  the President's place to tell you how you should try it.   So, when you see that eight-page diatribe from the White House  Counsel, saying we should have been able to have had a resolution in  the House or we should have been able to have had ``this,'' what you  should hear--what they really mean--is Donald Trump had the right to  control his own impeachment proceeding, and it is an outrage that  Donald Trump didn't get to write the rules of his own impeachment  proceeding in the House. If you give a President that right, there is  no impeachment power. You will hear them say that.   You will hear them complain about depositions that were the same as  the Republicans' or the right to participate that was the same as with  Clinton and Nixon and that, by the way, they were not allowed to call  witnesses, they said. Well, 3 of the 12 witnesses that we heard in our  open hearings were the minority's witness requests. You will hear those  arguments, that it was the most unfair in history. The fact is we have  the same process.   In those other impeachments, the majority did not surrender its  subpoena power to the minority. Do you know what it did? It said you  can subpoena witnesses, and if the majority doesn't agree, you can  force a vote. That is the same process we have here. The majority does  not surrender its subpoena power. It didn't in the prior impeachments,  and it didn't in this one. When they say the process was unfair, what  they really mean is, Don't look at what the President did. For God's  sake, don't look at what the President did.   I think the second thing you will hear from the President's team will  be to attack the managers. Those managers are just awful. They are  terrible people, especially that Schiff guy. He is the worst. He is the  worst. In exhibit A, he mocked the President. He mocked the President.  He mocked the President as if he was shaking down the leader of another  country like he was an organized crime figure. He mocked the President.  He said it was like the President said: Listen, Zelensky, because I am  only going to say this seven times.   Well, I discovered something very significant by mocking the  President, and that is, for a man who loves to mock others, he does not  like to be mocked. As it turns out, he has got pretty thin skin. Who  would have thought? Never mind that I said I wasn't using his words  before I said it and that I wasn't using his words after I said it and  that I said I was making a parody of his words. It is an outrage, he  mocked the President--that Schiff, terrible.   They will attack other colleagues, too, for things said in the heat  of debate here on the floor as we were reaching the wee hours in the  morning, and they will attack some of my colleagues who aren't even in  this Chamber. Maybe they will attack The Squad. That is a perennial  favorite with the President. If they attack The Squad, you should ask:  What does that have to do with the price of beans?   You can expect attacks on all kinds of Members of the House that have  nothing to do with the issues before you. When you hear those attacks,  you should ask yourself: Away from what do they want to distract my  attention? Nine times out of ten, it will be the President's  misconduct. Look for it--attacks on the managers, attacks on other  House Members, attacks on the Speaker, attacks on who knows what. It is  all of the same ilk. Whatever you do, just don't consider the  President's misconduct.   You will also hear attacks on the Constitution. Of course, it will  not be framed as attacking the Constitution, but that is really what it  represents, and that is: Abuse of power doesn't violate the  Constitution.   Presidents of the United States have every right to abuse their  power. That is the argument.   OK. I know it is a hard argument to make, right? Presidents have a  constitutional right to abuse their power, and how dare the House of  Representatives charge a President with abusing his power?   Now, I am looking forward to that constitutional argument by Alan  Dershowitz because I want to know why abusing power and trust is not  impeachable now, but it was a few years ago. The last time I checked, I  don't think there was significant change to the Constitution between  the time he said it was impeachable and the time he is saying now that,  apparently, it is not impeachable. So I am looking forward to that  argument.   But I am also looking forward to Ken Starr's presentation because,  during the Clinton impeachment, he maintained that a President not only  could but must be impeached for obstructing justice, that Clinton--Bill  Clinton--needed to be impeached because he lied under oath about sex,  and to do so obstructed justice.   You can be impeached for obstructing justice, but you cannot be  impeached for obstructing Congress.   Now, I have to confess I don't know exactly how that is supposed to  work because the logical conclusion from that is Ken Starr is saying  that Bill Clinton's mistake was in showing up under subpoena, that Bill  Clinton's mistake was in not saying: I am going to fight all subpoenas.  Bill Clinton's mistake was in not taking the position that under  article II he could do whatever he wanted.   Does that really make any sense? You can be impeached for obstructing  your own branch of government, but you cannot be impeached for  obstructing a coequal branch of government. That would make no sense to  the Framers. I have to think, over the centuries, as they have watched  us, they would be astonished that anyone would take that argument  seriously or could so misapprehend how this balance of power is  supposed to work.   So I look forward to that argument, and maybe, when they make that  argument, they can explain to us why their position on abuse of power  isn't even supported by their own Attorney General. So I hope they will  answer why even their own Attorney General doesn't agree with them--not  to mention, by the way, the constitutional law expert called by the  Republicans in the House who also testified, as to abuse of power, that  it is impeachable, that you don't need a crime. It is impeachable.   When you hear them make these arguments--cannot be impeached for  abusing your power--this is what it really means: We cannot defend his  conduct, so we want to make it go all away without even having to think  about it. You don't even need to think about what the President did  because  [[Page S563]]  the House charged it wrong, so don't even consider what the President  did. That is what that argument means. We can't defend the  indefensible, so we have to fall back on this: Even if he abused his  office, even if he did all the things he is accused of, that is  perfectly fine. Nothing can be done about it.   You will also hear, as part of the defense--and you heard this from  Jay Sekulow. I think it was the last thing he said: ``The  whistleblower.'' And then he stepped back to the table. ``The  whistleblower.''   I don't really know what that means, but I suspect you will hear more  of that. ``The whistleblower.'' ``The whistleblower.'' It is his or her  fault that we are here. ``The whistleblower.''   You know, I would encourage you to read the whistleblower complaint  again. When you read that complaint again, you will see just how  remarkably accurate it is. It is astonishingly accurate.   You know, for all the times the President is out there saying that  the complaint was all wrong, was all wrong, you read it--now that you  have heard the evidence, you read it, and you will see how remarkably  right the whistleblower is.   When that complaint was filed, it was obviously before we had our  depositions and had our hearings, all of which obviated the need for  the whistleblower.   In the beginning, we wanted the whistleblower to come and testify  because all that we knew about was the complaint, but then we were able  to hear from firsthand witnesses about what happened.   Then something else happened. The President and his allies began  threatening the whistleblower, and the life of the whistleblower was at  risk. And what was the point in exposing that whistleblower at the risk  of his or her life when we had the evidence we needed? What was the  point, except retribution? Retribution--and the President wants it  still.   Do you know why the President is mad at the whistleblower? Because,  but for the whistleblower, he wouldn't have been caught, and that is an  unforgiveable sin. He is the State, and but for the whistleblower, the  President wouldn't have been caught. For that he is a spy, and he is  guilty of treason.   Now, what does he add to this? Nothing but retribution--a pound of  flesh.   You will also hear the President's defense: They hate the President.  They hate the President. You should not consider the President's  misconduct because they hate the President.   Now, what I have said--I will leave you to your own judgments about  the President. I only hate what he has done to this country. I grieve  for what he has done to this country.   But when they make the argument to you that this is only happening  because they hate the President, it is just another of the myriad forms  of ``Please do not consider what the President did.''   Whether you like the President or you dislike the President is  immaterial. It is all about the Constitution and his misconduct. If it  meets the standard of impeachable conduct, as we have proved, it  doesn't matter whether you like him; it doesn't matter whether you  dislike him. What matters is whether he is a danger to the country  because he will do it again, and none of us can have confidence, based  on his record, that he will not do it again because he is telling us  every day that he will.    You will hear the further defense that Biden is corrupt--that Joe  Biden is corrupt, that Hunter Biden is corrupt. This is their defense.  It is another defense because what they hope to achieve in a Senate  trial is what they couldn't achieve through their scheme.   If they couldn't get Ukraine to smear the Bidens, they want to use  this trial to do it instead. So let's call Hunter Biden. Let's smear  the Bidens. Let's succeed in the trial with what we couldn't do with  this scheme. That is the goal.   Now, I don't know whether Rudy Giuliani, who said he was going to  present his report to some of the Senators, has presented his report.  Maybe he has. Maybe you will get to see what is in Rudy Giuliani's  report. Maybe you will get to see some documents smearing the Bidens  produced by--who knows? Maybe these same Russian, corrupt former  prosecutors.   But make no mistake about what that is about. It is about completing  the object of the scheme through other means, through the means of this  trial.   You may hear the argument that what the President is doing when he is  obstructing Congress is protecting the office for future Presidents  because there is nothing more important to Donald Trump than protecting  the Office of the Presidency for future Presidents. And I suppose when  he withheld military aid from Ukraine, he was trying to protect future  Presidents. And when he sought to force a foreign power to intervene in  our election, he was doing it on behalf of future Presidents because  future Presidents might likewise wish to cheat in a further election.   I don't think that argument goes very far, but I expect you will hear  it. I expect you will hear it.   You may hear an argument that the President was really concerned  about corruption, and he was concerned about the burden-sharing. I  won't spend much time on that because you have heard the evidence on  that. There is no indication that this had anything to do with  corruption and every, every bit of evidence that it had nothing to do  with fighting corruption or burden-sharing. Indeed, nothing about the  burden changed between the time he froze the aid and the time he  released the aid. There was no new effort to get others to contribute  more, and Europe contributes a great deal as it is. This is an after- the-fact rationalization.   You probably saw the public reporting that there was an exhaustive  effort after the fact to come up with a post hoc rationalization for  this scheme. I would like to show you the product of that  investigation, but I will need your help because it is among the  documents they refuse to turn over. They will show you just what an  after-the-fact invention this argument is.   Now, I expect you will hear the argument that Obama did it. Obama did  it. That may take several different forms, but the form of ``Obama did  it'' that I am referring to is ``Obama also withheld aid.'' Honestly, I  think that argument is an insult to our intelligence because the  argument is that Obama withheld aid from Egypt, and he made a condition  with it.   Obama withheld aid from Egypt after they had a revolution and  circumstances changed. And do you know something? He didn't hide it  from Congress. In fact, Congress supported it. Yes, there are times  when we withhold aid for a good policy reason--not a corrupt effort to  get help in your election.   The American people know the difference between right and wrong. They  can recognize the difference between aid that is withheld for a  malicious purpose and aid that is held in the best interests of our  national security. But you will hear the ``Obama did it'' argument.   You will hear the call was perfect. You will hear the call was  perfect. I suspect the reason they will make the argument that the call  was perfect is because the President insists that they do. I don't  think they really want to have to make that argument. You wouldn't  either. But they have a client to represent, so they will make the  argument that the call was perfect, and they will also make the  argument that Ukraine thinks the call was perfect. Ukraine says there  was no pressure.   What that really means is that Ukraine wants a future. Ukraine knows  it is still beholden to us for aid. Ukraine still hasn't gotten in  through the door of the White House. Ukraine knows if they acknowledged  that they were shaken down by the President of the United States, the  President of the United States will make them pay. So when you hear  them say that Ukraine felt no pressure and their proof is because the  Ukraine President doesn't want to call the President of the United  States a bad name, you will know why--because they need America. They  need America. The Framers did not expect you to leave your common sense  at the door.    Now, you will also hear the defense that the President said there was  ``no quid pro quo.'' The President said there was ``no quid pro quo.''  I guess that is the end of the story. This is a well-known principle of  criminal law--that if the defendant says he didn't do it, he couldn't  have done it.  [[Page S564]]    If the defendant learns he has been caught and he says that he didn't  do it, he couldn't have done it. That doesn't hold up in any courtroom.  It shouldn't hold up here.   You also will hear a variation of ``no harm no foul.'' They got the  money. They got the money, and they got the meeting--even though they  didn't. They got the meeting on the sideline of the U.N.--kind of a  drive-by. But they got a meeting--no harm no foul, right? The meeting  on the sidelines is pretty much the same thing, right, as a head-of- state meeting in the Oval Office? Of course, it is not.   Why do you think, at the meeting at the United Nations, the President  of Ukraine was still saying: Hey, when am I going to get to come to  town? He certainly recognizes the difference, and we should too. What  is more, there is every bit of harm and every bit of foul in  withholding aid from an ally at war and releasing it only when you are  caught.   Russia knows now about the wedge in our relations with Ukraine. The  moment Russia found out about this--and I have to imagine, given how  good their intel services are, they did not have to wait for POLITICO  to break the story any more than Ukraine. In fact, there is so deep a  penetration of Ukraine, I would have to expect that the Russians would  have found out at least as early as the Ukrainians did, if not earlier.   The moment Ukraine learned and Russia learned, there was harm,  because Ukraine knew they couldn't trust us and Russia knew they could  take advantage of us. There was immediate harm, and just because  someone is caught, because a scheme is thwarted, doesn't make that  scheme any less criminal and corrupt. You get no pass when you get  caught.   I expect one of the defenses you will see is they will play you  certain testimony from the House where my colleagues on the other side  of the aisle ask questions like these: Did the President ever say he  was bribing Ukraine? Did you ever see him actually bribe Ukraine? Did  you hear him say that he was going to bribe Ukraine? Did you personally  see this yourself? If you didn't see it, if he didn't lay it out for  you, then it could not have happened. Two plus two does not equal four.  You are not allowed to consider anything except for a televised  confession by the President, and, even then, don't consider it.   So I imagine you will hear some of that testimony where witnesses are  asked--they work for the Defense Department: Did the President ever  tell you that he was conditioning the aid? Never mind that these are  people who don't necessarily even talk to the President, but I expect  you will see some of that.   As I mentioned before, you will hear the defense say: We claim  privilege. You can't impeach the President over the exercise of  privilege. Never mind the fact that they never claimed privilege; they  never asserted privilege. And do you know why? Do you know why they  never actually invoked privilege in the House? It is because they know  that if they did, they would have to produce the documents and they  would have to show what they were redacting, and they didn't want to do  even that. They knew for the overwhelming majority of the documents and  witness testimony there was no even colorable claim of privilege. So  they didn't even want to invoke it. All they were saying is ``Maybe  someday.'' But you will hear that you can't be impeached for a claim of  privilege they never made.   So what do all these defenses mean? What do they mean? What do they  mean collectively when you add them all up?   What they mean is, under article II, the President can do whatever he  wants. That is really it. That is really it, stripped of all the detail  and all the histrionics. What they want us to believe is that the  President can do whatever he wants under article II, and there is  nothing that you or the House can do about it.   Robert Kennedy once said:         Moral courage is a rarer commodity than bravery in battle       or great intelligence. Yet it is the one essential, vital       quality for those who seek to change a world that yields most       painfully to change.    ``Moral courage is a rarer commodity than bravery in battle.'' I have  to say, when I first read that, I wasn't sure I agreed. Moral courage  is a rarer quality than courage in battle. It just doesn't seem right.  I wasn't sure I really agreed, and for a Democrat not to agree with a  Kennedy is kind of a heresy. I am sure my GOP colleagues feel the same  way about the Kennedys from Louisiana. After all, what can be more  brave than courage in battle? What could be more rare than courage in  battle? But then I got to visit, as I know all of you have, our  servicemembers around the world and see just how blessed we are with an  abundance of heroes by the millions who have joined the service of this  country--servicemembers who, every day, demonstrate the most incredible  bravery. I just have the greatest respect for them, for people like  Jason Crow and John McCain and Daniel Inouye and so many others who  served in this body or the other or who never served in office, by the  millions, around the country and around the world--the most incredible  respect. It is an amazing thing, how common is their uncommon bravery.   My father is 92. He is probably watching. He is part of the  ``greatest generation.'' He left high school early to join the service.  He tried to enlist in the Marine Corps, and he failed the physical. At  the end of World War II, he failed the physical for bad eyesight and  flat feet--which was apparently enough to fail the physical. So 2 weeks  later, he went and tried to enlist in the Army, thinking: Maybe it is a  different physical standard, and even if it isn't, maybe I will get a  different physician. As it turned out--same standard, same physician.  He recognized my father, and he said: Weren't you here 2 weeks ago?    And my father said: Yeah.   And he said: Do you really want to get in that bad?   And my father said: Yeah. And he was in the Army.   So the war was over, and he never left the United States. When he  left the service, he went to the University of Alabama. About midway  through, he wanted to get on with his life, and he left college and  went out into the business world. It is something he will always  regret--leaving college early--but I think in many ways he got a better  education than I did.   I think I was lucky to get a good education, but I think those like  Jason--and others who served in the military and also went to school-- got the best education. But I think there are certain things you can  only learn by being in the military. Certainly, you can't really learn  about war without going to war, and maybe there are things you just  can't learn about life without going to war. So those of you who have  served have the most complete education I think there is.   Even so, is moral courage really more rare than that on a  battlefield? And then I saw what Robert Kennedy meant by moral courage.  He said: ``Few men are willing to brave the disapproval of their peers,  the censure of their colleagues, [and] the wrath of their society.''   Then I understood by that measure just how rare moral courage is. How  many of us are willing to brave the disapproval of our peers, the  censure of our colleagues, and the wrath of our society?   Just as those who have not served in the military can't fully  understand what service means, so, too, there is a different kind of  paternity or sorority among those who have served in the House. I  always tell my constituents that there are two kinds of jobs in  Congress, and it is not Democrats or Republicans; it is those in a safe  seat, and those in an unsafe seat. I am sure the same is true of those  in a safe State or an unsafe State. It is why I think there is a  certain chemistry between Members who represent those swing districts  and States--because they can step into each other's shoes.   One of the things that we in this fellowship of officeholders  understand that most people don't is that real political courage  doesn't come from disagreeing with our opponents but from disagreeing  with our friends and with our own party because it means having to  stare down accusations of disloyalty and betrayal: He's a Democrat in  name only or she's a Republican in name only.   What I said last night, if it resonated with anyone in this Chamber,  didn't require courage. My views, as heartfelt as they are, reflect the  views of my constituents. But what happens when  [[Page S565]]  our heartfelt views of right and wrong are in conflict with the popular  opinion of our constituents?   What happens when the devotion to our oaths, to our values, to our  love of country depart from the momentary passion of the large number  of people backing us? Those are the times that try our souls.   CBS news reported last night that a Trump confidante said that GOP  Senators were warned: ``Vote against the President, and your head will  be on a pike.'' I don't know if that is true.   ``Vote against the President, and your head will be on a pike.'' I  have to say when I read that--and again, I don't know if that is true,  but when I read that, I was struck by the irony. I hope it is not true.  I hope it is not true. I was struck by the irony of the idea, when we  are talking about a President who would make himself a Monarch, that  whoever that was would use the terminology of a penalty that was  opposed by a Monarch--``head on a pike.''   Just this week America lost a hero, Thomas Railsback, who passed away  on Monday, the day before this trial began. Some of you may have known  or even served with Congressman Thomas Railsback. He was a Republican  from Illinois and the second ranking Member on the House Judiciary  Committee when that committee was conducting its impeachment inquiry  into President Nixon.   In July of 1974, as the inquiry was coming to a close, Congressman  Railsback began meeting with a bipartisan group of Members of the  House--three other Republicans and three Democrats. Here in the Senate  they might have called them the Gang of 7.   They gathered and they talked and they labored over language and  ultimately helped develop the bipartisan support for the articles that  led a group of Republican Senators, including Barry Goldwater and  Howard Baker, to tell President Nixon that he must resign.   Some say that the Nixon impeachment might not have moved forward were  it not for those four courageous Republicans led by Congressman  Railsback, and it pained the Congressman because he credited Nixon with  giving him his seat and with getting him elected. He did it, he said,  because ``seeing all the evidence, it was something we had to do  because the evidence was there.'' One of his aides, Ray LaHood,  eulogized him saying: He felt an obligation to the Constitution to do  what is right.   Now, soon, Members of this body will face the most momentous of  decisions--not, as I said at the outset, between guilt and innocence,  but a far more foundational issue: Should there be a fair trial? Shall  the House be able to present its case with witnesses and documents  through the use of subpoenas as has been the case in every impeachment  trial in history?   Now, the President's lawyers have been making their case outside of  this Chamber, threatening to stall these proceedings with the assertion  of false claims of privilege. Having persuaded this body to postpone  consideration of the witnesses and documents, they now appear to be  preparing the ground to say it will be too late to consider them next  week.   But consider this: Of the hundreds of documents that we have  subpoenaed, there is no colorable claim and none has been asserted. To  the degree that you could even make a claim, that claim has been  waived. To the degree that even superficially the claim would attach,  it does not conceal misconduct. And what is more, to the degree that  there were a dispute over whether a privilege applied, we have a  perfectly good judge sitting behind me empowered by the rules of this  body to resolve those disputes.   When the Chief Justice decides where a narrow application of  privilege ought to apply, you will still have the power to overrule  him. How often do you get the chance to overrule a Chief Justice of the  Supreme Court? You have to admit, it is every legislator's dream.   So let us not be fooled by the argument that it will take too long or  persuaded that the trial must be over before the State of the Union.  This is no parking ticket we are contesting and no shoplifting case we  are prosecuting. It is a matter of high crimes and misdemeanors.   How long is too long to have a fair trial--fair to the President and  fair to the American people? The American people do not agree on much,  but they will not forgive being deprived of the truth and certainly not  because it took a back seat to expediency.   In his pamphlet of 1777, ``The American Crisis,'' Thomas Paine wrote:         Those who expect to reap the blessings of freedom must . .       . undergo the fatigue of supporting it.    Is it too much fatigue to call witnesses and have a fair trial? Are  the blessings of freedom so meager that we will not endure the fatigue  of a real trial with witnesses and documents?   President Lincoln, in his closing message to Congress in December  1862, said this:         Fellow citizens, we cannot escape history. We of this       Congress and this administration will be remembered in spite       of ourselves. No personal significance, or insignificance,       can spare one or another of us. The fiery trial through which       we pass, will light us down, in honor or dishonor, to the       latest generation.    I think he was the most interesting President in history. He may be  the most interesting person in our history. This man, who started out  dirt poor--dirt poor. Like hundreds of thousands of other people at the  time, he had nothing--no money and no education. He educated himself.  He educated himself. But he had a brain in that head, a brilliance in  that mind that made him one of the most incredible, not just  Presidents, but people in history.   I think he is the most interesting character in our history. Out of  the hundreds and hundreds of thousands of other Americans at the time,  why him? Why him?   I think a lot about history, as I know you do. Sometimes I think  about how unforgiving history can be of our conduct.   We can do a lifetime's work, draft the most wonderful legislation,  help our constituents, and yet we may be remembered for none of that.  But for a single decision, we may be remembered, affecting the course  of our country.   I believe this may be one of those moments--a moment we never thought  we would see, a moment when our democracy was gravely threatened and  not from without but from within.   Russia, too, has a constitution. It is not a bad constitution. It is  just a meaningless one. In Russia, they have trial by telephone. They  have the same ostensible rights we do to a trial. They hear evidence  and witnesses, but before the verdict is rendered, the judge picks up  the telephone and calls the right person to find out how it is supposed  to turn out. Trial by telephone. Is that what we have here--a trial by  telephone, someone on the other end of the phone dictating what this  trial should look like?   The Founders gave us more than words. They gave us inspiration. They  may have receded into mythology, but they inspire us still. And more  than us, they inspire the rest of the world. They inspire the rest of  the world.   From their prison cells in Turkey, journalists look to us. From their  internment camps in China, they look to us. From their cells in Egypt,  those who gathered in Tahrir Square for a better life look to us. From  the Philippines, those who were the victims and their families of mass  extrajudicial killings, they look to us. From Elgin prison, they look  to us. From all over the world, they look to us.   Increasingly, they don't recognize what they see. It is a terrible  tragedy for them. It is a worse tragedy for us, because there is  nowhere else for them to turn. They are not going to turn to Russia.  They are not going to turn to China. They are not going to turn to  Europe with all of its problems. They look to us because we are still  the indispensable Nation. They look to us because we have a rule of  law. They look to us because no one is above that law.   One of the things that separates us from those people in Elgin prison  is the right to a trial. It is a right to a trial. Americans get a fair  trial.   So I am asking you. I implore you. Give America a fair trial. Give  America a fair trial. She is worth it.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. The majority leader is recognized.                            ____________________     Mr. Chief Justice, I ask unanimous consent that the  trial adjourn until 10:00 a.m., Saturday, January 25, and that this  order also constitute the adjournment of the Senate.  [[Page S566]]    There being no objection, at 8:54 p.m., the Senate, sitting as a  Court of Impeachment, adjourned until Saturday, January 25, 2020, at 10  a.m.
