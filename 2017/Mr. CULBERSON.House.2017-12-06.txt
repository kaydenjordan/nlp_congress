 Mr. Speaker, the difference of opinion on this bill  vividly illustrates the profoundly different world view of Democrats  versus Republicans. Democrats instinctively trust the government and  instinctively distrust individuals. Republicans instinctively distrust  the government and trust the good hearts and good sense of individual  Americans to be the best stewards of protecting themselves, their  family, their property, and their freedoms.   Our Founders understood this, and this is why the First Amendment  protects our freedom of conscience and the Second Amendment follows it  immediately so that we, as free people, have the ability to protect  ourselves--our freedom of conscience--against the overpowering force of  the government.   We in Texas enacted in 1995, while I was a member of the Texas house,  a concealed carry law, and we have had now over 20 years of data.  People can go to the Department of Texas Public Safety website and look  under conviction rates and see that the concealed carry permit holders  in Texas, over the last 22 years, are 21 times less likely to commit a  crime than the average Texans.   The 7 minutes Sheriff Rutherford just mentioned to us are a lifetime,  if you or your family or neighbors are at risk of attack. The  individual law-abiding American who is carrying a concealed weapon has  had a background check, they have been trained in the  [[Page H9699]]  use of the weapon, and they know the law. We all, as Americans, should  work together to preserve the Second Amendment right of every American  to keep and bear arms no matter what State they are in.   Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to support this important legislation.
