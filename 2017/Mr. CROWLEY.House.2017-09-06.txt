 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding to me.   Mr. Speaker, I look at the pictures of Houston, Galveston, and parts  of Texas, and Louisiana, and elsewhere, and I harken back to the same  images I saw in New Jersey, New York, throughout New England, and other  parts of the Northeast after Sandy.   I want to also note that the NYPD and the FDNY were amongst the first  responders to head down to Texas to help our fellow Americans at a time  of crisis and need.   I also would like to point out that I have no clue where the town is  that the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Poe) mentioned, and I may never ever  go there. I may never go to that town, but I will  [[Page H6667]]  tell you, Mr. Speaker, I don't need to go to that town to help those  people. They are Americans, and I will help them at any opportunity I  get when they have a storm like this that hits them. I don't ask  questions. I never asked you if you knew where Edgewater in the Bronx  was.   I was prepared to vote immediately to help my constituents on Sandy.  I wasn't going to have to wait until next week or 30 days from now, or  60 days from now, or 90 days from now. And I think it is important we  have to point out the hypocrisy.   We are not going to stop this funding from going through. We need to  point out that 20 members of the Republican caucus, some from Texas,  all but one, Mr. Culberson, voted against Sandy relief. It must be  understood that we are all Americans, and I will stand to help every  American who needs help.
