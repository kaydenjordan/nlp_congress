 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   At the outset, I want to thank Chairman Frelinghuysen. It has been a  pleasure for me to work with him. I am cautiously optimistic that we  will complete this process. Although overdue, we will get our work  done.   This is the third continuing resolution during fiscal year 2017. We  should be voting today on a bipartisan omnibus appropriations act, not  another stopgap bill to keep the government running. After all, we are  7 months into the fiscal year.   Federal departments and agencies have been operating on outdated  funding levels and policies for more than half of the year. This is  unacceptable, and it cannot continue. Assuming we get to a solution  that lasts the remainder of the fiscal year, I do hope Chairman  Frelinghuysen will help avoid this outcome in the future.   The continuing resolution we are considering today is a simple date  change to continue government funding through next Friday and to extend  health insurance for miners through the same day.   The backdrop of this continuing resolution is ongoing negotiations on  an omnibus appropriations act. Democrats continue to work in good faith  to develop a bipartisan omnibus that provides sufficient funding for  critical priorities and rejects divisive poison pill riders. For many  months, Democrats have been clear that we will not help pass an omnibus  that fails to meet these basic standards, and that remains the case.  [[Page H2956]]    As if this process weren't difficult enough, it occurs as the  majority is seeking to strip health insurance from 20 million Americans  and repeal protections against insurance company discrimination for  millions more. Meanwhile, President Trump continues to tweet false and  damaging comments about the omnibus negotiations.   It is my hope that these games will end so that we can come together  to support investments that create jobs, improve infrastructure,  provide a quality education for every student, and invest in technology  and biomedical research that will benefit hardworking Americans.   To achieve this, we must make progress on eliminating poison pill  riders and advancing shared priorities in an omnibus appropriations  act. Next week, we must not consider a fourth continuing resolution,  but instead have a positive, bipartisan bill after this unnecessarily  lengthy process.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1030     Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), the Democratic whip.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Maryland.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Maryland.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
