 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2288, the  Veterans Appeals Improvement and Modernization Act of 2017, a bill that  addresses the Department of Veterans Affairs' broken appeals process.   As of April 1, 2017, the number of pending appeals for disability  compensation with the VA has reached 470,000. That is more than a 20  percent increase since fiscal year 2015. At current funding levels and  using its current operational structure, the Department of Veterans  Affairs estimates that it will take at least 5 years to address the  backlog of appeals claims.   That is unsatisfactory. We can do better. We must do better. Our  veterans deserve better. They have risked their lives to protect the  freedoms we hold so dear, and it is up to us to make sure they receive  the benefits they have earned and deserve.   H.R. 2288 modernizes the appeals process to efficiently and  effectively resolve backlogged claims and prevent this kind of backlog  from happening in the future. This bipartisan piece of legislation  takes a giant leap toward a more efficient Department of Veterans  Affairs, and I strongly urge my colleagues to support it.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, before I begin, I ask unanimous consent  that all Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and  extend their remarks and include extraneous materials on the topic of  my Special Order.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Michigan?   There was no objection.    Madam Speaker, before I begin, I ask unanimous consent  that all Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and  extend their remarks and include extraneous materials on the topic of  my Special Order.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Michigan?   There was no objection.    The topic of today's Special Order is to recognize the  importance of Armed Forces Day and Memorial Day.   I am not going to give a history lesson here tonight, but, rather, a  series of personal remembrances that started when I was about 5 or 6  years old in the early 1950s.   My father, a World War II veteran, and some of his fellow veterans  organized the local VFW in Minnesota where I was born. We would spend  Memorial Day in the morning visiting three cemeteries in our local  town.   At each cemetery, the color guard would post the colors, the rifles  would give their report, and taps would play. Everyone who attended-- and when I say everyone who attended, that was really the whole town-- came out in a long train of automobiles to go to these three cemeteries  to honor the veterans who were no longer of this Earth.   I remember the solemnness of that day. I remember the tears for  family members and friends who had passed on, those who had worn the  cloth of our Nation both in peace and in war. Those kinds of memories,  as I stand here and talk tonight, are very vivid in my mind.   Some years later, in the mid-1960s, we were involved in Vietnam, and  I was a sophomore in college. Because of the fact that my parents had  both stepped up during World War II, I felt--and with their support--it  was the right thing to stand up and take the oath that sent me into the  Marine Corps to serve our country.   When you go into harm's way, you don't know what the outcome is going  to be, but you do know that those you serve with are going to give it  their all and you are going to remember them and honor them for as long  as we walk this Earth.   I was very fortunate to have absolutely spectacular commanding  officers along the way that taught me what it was like to be a young  leader and what it meant to take care of your marines--most notably my  commanding officer in Vietnam, who, thankfully, is still with us. He  was the kind of individual that made the tough calls because he  understood the sacrifices needed and the outcomes that were required.   One by one, we all pass. Memorial Day is our opportunity to remember,  share stories, share tears, share laughter for those who have now gone  on into God's hands. The past and the present set the tone for the  future.   As David French said:         Sacrifice sustains our Nation far beyond the battlefield.       As iron sharpens iron, so one man sharpens another in times       of stress. In times when we are under great duress, that       ability to sharpen not each other's bodies but each other's       souls carries us on.    We remember on Memorial Day those who have made that effort.   In the Marine Corps, we believe a lot of things, but three words  encompass them all: honor, courage, and commitment.   Tonight we honor those who fought for our country, who made the  ultimate sacrifice and gave their lives in the service of our country,  and those who have passed on since their service. It is our job to make  sure that their sacrifice wasn't in vain.   Courage: there is moral courage and there is physical courage. You  never know until the time comes whether you have the physical courage,  but you do find out. It is the moral courage that we know from the  beginning, and it is set by our predecessors that sets our attitude and  our mindset in stone that we know that we have that. And when it is  tested, we are ready.                                time  2000    Commitment: Our commitment is always to the mission and to one  another. We never leave anyone behind. Never. No one is more invested  in peace than our men and women in uniform. They take the risks. They  make the sacrifices, and they bear the cost of the battle in full  force. Those rows of white headstones across the bridge in Arlington  remind us of their commitment every day, and for that we owe them more  than gratitude. We owe them every effort to keep our world at peace.   On Memorial Day in 1982, President Reagan said:   ``War will not come again, other young men will not have to die, if  we will speak honestly of the dangers that confront us and remain  strong enough to meet those dangers.   ``It's not just strength or courage that we need, but understanding  and a measure of wisdom as well.''   We owe it to our men and women who have fought and died for our  country to take a stand, to prepare for peace not by ignoring the  dangers we face and placating the enemies of freedom but by facing them  head on.   Madam Speaker, I am honored to yield to my fellow Members who will be  presenting and speaking tonight. I yield to the distinguished gentleman  from Minnesota (Mr. Lewis).    Madam Speaker, it is our job not just to remember but to  carry the torch of freedom forward so that the sacrifices of our  brothers and sisters have not and will not be in vain.   Oliver Wendell Holmes said: ``But grief is not the end of all. . . .  Our dead brothers still live for us, and bid us think of life, not  death--of life to which in their youth they lent the passion and joy of  the spring.''   I would strongly encourage all, all of our American citizens, next  Monday, May 29, the official observance of this year's Memorial Day, to  take your families to a local cemetery, walk around, look at those  headstones and those gravestones, explain to your children and your  grandchildren, and anyone else who may have questions, the meaning and  the significance of the many flags that fly next to those headstones.   Those folks, those comrades, sacrificed it all so we can be here  today. It is up to us to honor them, to remember them, and to carry on  to ensure that the challenges we face as a country will be defended  against and protected because of our willingness to sacrifice for the  United States of America.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 8 o'clock and 8 minutes  p.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until tomorrow,  Tuesday, May 23, 2017, at 10 a.m. for morning-hour debate.                            ____________________
