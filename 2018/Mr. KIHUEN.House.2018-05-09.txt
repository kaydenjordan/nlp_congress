 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to remember the life of Lisa  Patterson. Lisa attended the Route 91 festival in Las Vegas on October  1.  [[Page H3868]]    Lisa was very active in her community. She coached softball teams,  served as the president of the St. John Fisher's PTA and was active in  her church.   Lisa was married to her husband, Robert, for more than 20 years, and  they enjoyed running a hardwood floor business together. Lisa and  Robert had three children together--Robert, Jr.; Amber; and Brooke--and  had one dog named Holly Wolf.   Lisa was warm and caring to everyone she met. She had an infectious  energy and a fierce love for her family.   I would like to extend my condolences to Lisa Patterson's family and  friends. Please know that the city of Las Vegas, the State of Nevada,  and the entire country grieve with you.                            ____________________
