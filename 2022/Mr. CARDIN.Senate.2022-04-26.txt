 Mr. President, as Lady Bird Johnson said, ``The  environment is where we all meet, where we all have a mutual interest;  it is the one thing all of us share.''   This quote from when she served as First Lady of the United States  during President Lyndon Baines Johnson's time in office, from 1963 to  1969, still resonates with us today as we commemorate Earth Day 2022  and reflect on our relationship with nature and the world we share with  each of us every day.   April 22, 1970, marked the first annual Earth Day, which led to the  formation of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency--the Agency that  is responsible for implementing environmental regulations and  standards.   We have made great strides in protecting the environment and public  health through the Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act, and Endangered  Species Act, but the data and science surrounding the harmful effects  of climate change are alarming. Climate change is harming our  ecosystems, waterways, forests, wildlife, and our general environment.   This year's sustainable development goals theme and call to action is  ``Invest in Our Planet.'' The question for climate action is no longer  ``if'' or ``when'' but ``how much?'' if we want to have a healthy,  habitable Earth.   Strong policies that protect our water resources, fisheries, and  wildlife and address the challenges of climate change are a top  priority of mine in my role as a member of the Senate Committee on  Environment and Public Works.   I applaud President Biden for setting forth ambitious but attainable  climate-friendly goals, driven by science, to help preserve the health  and safety of our planet and the public. I applaud President Biden's  Executive actions in January of 2021 to reverse steps President Trump  took that weakened Federal protections under the Endangered Species  Act. I applaud President Biden's commitment to conserving 30 percent of  America's lands and oceans by 2030, also known as the America the  Beautiful Initiative.   With the understanding that we need to meet the moment on climate  change and preserve our planet, Congress passed the Infrastructure  Investment and Jobs Act, which President Biden signed into law last  November. This  [[Page S2141]]  historic legislation serves as a significant downpayment on our future  as we seek to strengthen resiliency and mitigation measures against  flooding and sea level rise; shift towards greener, cleaner energy and  technology; and form meaningful habits to clean up the world around us  by recycling, composting, and disposing of waste products properly.   The threat of sea level rise and warming temperatures is already  detrimental to our coastlines and ecosystems, especially along the  Chesapeake Bay. With numerous and successful restoration efforts  underway, the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act authorizes an  additional $238 million to the Chesapeake Bay Program to make even  bigger reductions in nutrient pollution to improve water quality in the  surrounding tributaries.   In partnership with local jurisdictions, stakeholders, and the U.S.  Army Corps of Engineers, the bipartisan infrastructure act will deliver  $37.5 million in Federal funding for the Mid-Chesapeake Bay Island  Ecosystem Restoration Project. The purpose of the project is to rebuild  the declining James and Barren Islands in Dorchester County and provide  a substantial increase of habitat for a variety of fish and wildlife  species by repurposing dredged material from the shipping channels for  the Port of Baltimore. This is beneficial use of dredged material to  keep our channels at the necessary depth for commerce but do it in a  way that restores our environment. Wetlands provide natural flood  control solutions as climate change brings increasingly frequent and  severe weather events.   We only have one planet, which is why every decision and every  failure to act matters.   I would like to thank our Federal workforce this Earth Day for its  efforts to maximize this window for action on climate and environmental  justice. The Biden administration has directed each Federal Agency to  take strong action when it comes to dealing with our climate and  environmental justice. Many civil servants are working around the clock  to promulgate rules, strategy documents, and much, much more. For  example, White House officials this month announced equity action plans  for more than 90 Federal Agencies designed to combat systemic barriers  to opportunities in underserved communities.   Each day of COP26 U.N. Climate Change Conference in Glasgow explored  a new topic. Our Senate delegation had an opportunity to attend on the  day that was devoted toward Nature Day. I mention that because our  nature depends upon us dealing with the climate agenda.   I would just call to my colleagues' attention the series that is  hosted by former President Barack Obama, ``Our Great National Parks.''  Take a look at how important it is in preserving our environment for  the species around us, which affects not only their ability to live but  our ability to live.   The month of April represents the opportunity to celebrate other  related environmental and nature-focused holidays, such as Arbor Day,  which falls on April 29 this year. My home State commemorated Maryland  Arbor Day at the beginning of the month, on April 9. This year, we  celebrate the 150th anniversary of Arbor Day. The goal of Arbor Day is  to celebrate nature within our communities by organizing tree planting  or trash and litter cleanups. As President Franklin Delano Roosevelt  remarked, ``A nation that destroys its soil destroys itself. Forests  are the lungs of our land, purifying the air and giving fresh strength  to our people.''   The bipartisan infrastructure law also provides $275 million grant  funding for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Post-Consumer  Materials Management Infrastructure Grant Program, which the Save Our  Seas 2.0 Act established. This program will help prevent plastic waste  from entering our environment in the first place. The program will  provide grants to States to improve local waste management systems,  including municipal recycling programs, and to improve postconsumer  materials management and infrastructure to reduce plastic waste in our  waterways and oceans, ultimately protecting our planet.   I agree with Paul Hawken, who said this in a commencement address at  the University of Portland in 2009:         At present, we are stealing the future, selling it in the       present, and calling it gross domestic product. We can just       as easily have an economy that is based on healing the future       instead of stealing it. We can either create assets for the       future or take the assets of the future. One is called       restoration and the other [is called] exploitation. And       whenever we exploit the earth we exploit people and cause       untold suffering. Working for the earth is not a way to get       rich, it is a way to be rich.    Protecting our planet is a collective and ongoing effort. While we  still have much to do, I am encouraged by the legislative and  administrative progress we have made so far. I urge my colleagues to  take the next step and pass the Build Back Better Act--transformative  legislation for a clean energy economy.   This Earth Day, let us heed Paul Hawken's comments: ``Working for the  earth is not a way to get rich, it is a way to be rich.''   With that, Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.   I yield the floor.
