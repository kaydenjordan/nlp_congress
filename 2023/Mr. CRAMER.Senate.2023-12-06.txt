 Madam President, I want to honor a very special  North Dakota resident who is turning 100 years old on December 15.  Harold Hepper was a longtime resident of McClusky and most recently has  lived in Bismarck, where he will celebrate this landmark birthday.   Harold embodies the very best of the Greatest Generation. A year  after graduating from McClusky High School in 1942, he and five buddies  were drafted into the Army and traveled to Fort Snelling, MN. Initially  rejected because of his poor eyesight, Harold returned home and begged  the Selective Service Board for another chance to serve. After  obtaining plastic glasses, he was able to train at Camp Barkeley, TX,  to be an Army medical aidman.   He shipped out from New Jersey for England and was on the frontlines  in France the summer of 1944, where he was wounded in the shoulder  during the Battle of Brest. Following his participation in the Battle  of Hurtgen Forest, that December found him in the Battle of the Bulge.  There, thousands of Americans died in what was the largest and  bloodiest U.S. battle of World War II. The first day of the battle on  December 16 brought heavy casualties on both sides. Harold and other  medics worked on the front lines for 10 days, providing nonstop medical  aid before they were relieved.   Harold was awarded the Purple Heart, Bronze Star, and other campaign  medals. Honorably discharged in November 1945, he has remained active  in veterans organizations the rest of his life. This includes 76 years  as a member of the McClusky American Legion. Returning home, Harold  worked as an insurance agent at the First National Bank of McClusky for  44 years before retiring in 1987. He joined the McClusky Fire  Department in 1954 and served there for 33 years, including one year as  fire chief. Harold and his wife, Laura, who died in 2015, raised two  daughters, Debra and Gail. They will join five grandchildren, three  great-grandchildren and other family, friends, and veterans groups in  honoring Harold on his 100th birthday.   North Dakota is home to more than 200 centenarians, and we consider  them among our most treasured residents. Their pioneer spirit, dignity,  and hard work have brought them through many challenges and personal  achievements. On behalf of all North Dakotans, I thank Harold Hepper  for his service to our country and wish him a happy 100th birthday. I  hope you enjoy continued good health and vitality.                            ____________________
