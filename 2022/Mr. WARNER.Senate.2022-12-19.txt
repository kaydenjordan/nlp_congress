 Mr. President, this explanation reflects the status of  negotiations and disposition of issues reached between the Senate  Select Committee on Intelligence and the House Permanent Select  Committee on  [[Page S7307]]  Intelligence for the Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year  2023.   The explanation shall have the same effect with respect to the  implementation of this act as if it were a joint explanatory statement  of a conference committee.   I ask unanimous consent that the explanatory statement for the  Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2023 be printed into the  Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:  Explanatory Statement on the Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal    Year 2023, Submitted by Mr. Schiff, Chairman of the House Permanent                      Select Committee on Intelligence         The following is the Explanatory Statement (the       ``Explanatory Statement'') to accompany the Intelligence       Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2023 (``the Act''), which       has been included as Division F of the National Defense       Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2023. The Explanatory       Statement reflects the result of negotiations between the       Senate Select Committee on Intelligence and the House       Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence (together, ``the       Committees''). The Explanatory Statement shall have the same       effect with respect to the implementation of the Act as if it       were a joint explanatory statement of a conference committee.        The classified nature of U.S. intelligence activities       prevents the Committees from publicly disclosing many details       concerning their final decisions regarding funding levels and       policy direction. Therefore, the Committees have prepared a       classified annex--referred to here and within the annex       itself as ``the Agreement''--that contains a classified       Schedule of Authorizations and that describes in detail the       scope and intent of the Committees' actions.        The Agreement authorizes the Intelligence Community (IC) to       obligate and expend funds as requested in the President's       budget and as modified by the classified Schedule of       Authorizations, subject to applicable reprogramming       procedures.        The classified Schedule of Authorizations is incorporated       into the Act pursuant to Section 6102 of the Act. It has the       status of law. The Agreement supplements and adds detail to       clarify the authorization levels found in the Act and in the       classified Schedule of Authorizations.        This Explanatory Statement incorporates by reference, and       the Executive Branch shall comply with, all direction       contained in the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence       Report to accompany the Intelligence Authorization Act for       Fiscal Year 2023 (S. Rept. 117-132) and in the House       Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence Report to       accompany the Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year       2023 (H. Rept. 117-546). The Agreement supersedes all       classified direction related to programs and activities       authorized by the Schedule of Authorization.        The Executive Branch is further directed as follows:   Enforcement of Cybersecurity Requirements for National Security Systems         Section 6309 is intended to codify, for the elements of the       IC, the key elements of the ``Memorandum on Improving the       Cybersecurity of National Security, Department of Defense,       and Intelligence Community Systems'' issued by the White       House on January 19, 2022, also known as NSM-08, and any       successor policy guidance. The section also requires agencies       (1) to meet the deadlines established under those       requirements and (2) to prioritize resources in a manner to       fully implement the requirements established by the       deadlines.      Intelligence Community Experts Panel on Anomalous Health Incidents         The Committees are committed to protecting and supporting       IC and other federal government personnel who have       experienced debilitating, unexplained attacks, or anomalous       health incidents, while serving their country. The Committees       are also focused on transparency in reporting by those       agencies whose personnel have been affected by anomalous       health incidents.        Therefore, the Committees direct that the Central       Intelligence Agency (CIA), as part of the reporting required       by Section 6412 of the Intelligence Authorization Act for       Fiscal Year 2023, submit a plan to implement the       recommendations of the IC Experts Panel on Anomalous Health       Incidents. The Committees further direct that the Department       of State Bureau of Intelligence and Research, as part of the       assessment required by Section 6810 of the Intelligence       Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2023, submit a plan to       implement the recommendations of the IC Experts Panel on       Anomalous Health Incidents.     Staffing of Office Supporting Central Intelligence Agency Workforce                                 Wellbeing         Section 6416 of the Act establishes an Office to support       the physical, mental, and overall wellbeing of eligible CIA       employees and certain other individuals affiliated with the       Agency. The Committees recognize the Agency's need for       appropriate flexibility and therefore did not legislatively       mandate minimum staffing levels for the Office. However,       Section 6416 does require the Director of the CIA to assign       to the Office ``a sufficient number of individuals, who shall       have no official duties other than duties related to the       Office while so assigned.'' The Committees fully expect the       Agency, consistent with the Agency's plan that was briefed to       the Committees, to staff the office with at least 10 full-      time individuals. The Committees direct the Agency to       promptly notify the Committees if the Office has less than 10       individuals assigned to the Office on a full-time basis.        Intelligence Assessment of Effects of Counterterrorism Strikes         The Committees direct the Director of the Defense       Intelligence Agency (DIA), in coordination with the       directorates of intelligence of the combatant commands, to       prepare an intelligence assessment of the effects of       counterterrorism strikes conducted by the Armed Forces on       targets outside of areas of active hostilities during the 5-      year period preceding the date of the enactment of the Act.       The assessment shall include:        (1) an analysis of the strike's short- and long-term       effects on the capability and intent of the terrorist group       to conduct external operations, particularly operations       targeting the United States, U.S. persons, or U.S.       facilities;        (2) an analysis of the strike's effects on the recruitment       of the terrorist group;        (3) an analysis of the strike's effects on local perception       of the terrorist group, the host country, and the United       States;        (4) an identification of the number and quality of finished       intelligence products that assessed the effects that a U.S.       counterterrorism strike would have, or did have, against       specific terrorist individuals or groups; and        (5) recommendations to improve the efficacy, accuracy, and       timeliness of intelligence analysis to increase the strategic       effect of counterterrorism strikes.        The Committees further direct the Director of the DIA to       submit to the congressional intelligence committees and the       congressional defense committees, within 180 days of the       enactment of the Act, a report containing both this       intelligence assessment and judgments regarding the following       questions:        (1) What percentage of counterterrorism strikes covered by       the intelligence assessment had a short-term effect on the       planned external operations of the terrorist group,       particularly operations targeting the United States, U.S.       persons, or U.S. facilities?        (2) What percentage of counterterrorism strikes covered by       the intelligence assessment had a long-term effect on the       planned external operations of the terrorist group,       particularly operations targeting the United States, U.S.       persons, or U.S. facilities?        The report may be submitted in classified form, except that       the judgments shall be in unclassified form. For purposes of       this direction, the term ``counterterrorism strikes'' means       an air strike conducted by the U.S. Armed Forces targeting a       specific individual that is not a defensive strike conducted       to reduce imminent danger to the U.S. Armed Forces or       specifically designated partner forces of the United States,       and the term ``external operations'' means violent operations       conducted outside the terrorist group's country or region of       origin.   Report on Efforts of the FBI to Identify and Promote Diverse Candidates         The Committees direct the Director of the Federal Bureau of       Investigation, within 90 days of the enactment of the Act, to       submit to the congressional intelligence committees and to       post on the public website of the Bureau a statistical report       on the status of efforts by the Bureau to identify and       promote diverse candidates over the past five fiscal years.       For Supervisory Special Agent program managers, Field       Supervisory Special Agents, Assistant Special Agents in       Charge, Special Agents in Charge, and senior executives, the       report shall include tables of figures that break down by       race and gender the following information:        (1) The total number, and the percentage, of Special Agents       who applied for such positions;        (2) The total number, and the percentage, of Special Agents       who were interviewed for such positions;        (3) The total number, and the percentage, of Special Agents       who were selected for such positions; and        (4) The average number of times a Special Agent applied for       such position before selection.        For purposes of this direction, the term ``senior       executives'' means Deputy Assistant Director, Assistant       Director, Executive Assistant Director, Associate Deputy       Director, and Deputy Director.        The Committees further direct that the report shall       include, with respect to GS-14 and GS-15 positions, tables of       figures that break down by race and gender the following       information:        (1) The total number of individuals in such positions, and       the percentage of such individuals, who retired over the past       five fiscal years; and        (2) The total number of individuals in such positions, and       the percentage of such individuals, who retired early over       the past five fiscal years.       Report on Improving Opportunities for Women and Minorities for                  Promotions in the Intelligence Community         The Committees direct the Director of National       Intelligence, in consultation with the heads of the elements       of the IC, to submit to the congressional intelligence       committees within 120 days of the enactment of the Act a       consolidated report on specific steps taken by each element       to enhance opportunities for  [[Page S7308]]       women and minorities for promotions across all mission       categories of the IC, and to reduce the gap among gender,       racial, and ethnic categories at senior levels of the IC. The       report shall contain a strategic plan from each element of       the IC on the following:        (1) Overcoming any barriers or obstacles identified in the       report;        (2) Proposing new or enhanced mentoring programs or similar       workplace forums to support women and minority officers of       the IC who are interested in or may qualify for promotion       opportunities or other career advancements;        (3) Recommending additional steps and initiatives to       achieve diversity among senior roles in the IC; and        (4) Addressing any gaps in relevant tools, resources, or       authorities.              Briefings on Intelligence Activities in Cyberspace         The Committees direct the Secretary of Defense, on a       quarterly basis, to provide to the congressional intelligence       committees and the congressional defense committees a       briefing, with respect to the covered period, on the       intelligence activities occurring in cyberspace conducted by       United States Cyber Command in support of current and future       offensive or defensive cyberspace operations.      Submission of Certain Legislative Proposals to the Congressional                          Intelligence Committees         The Committees direct the Secretary of Defense to submit to       the congressional intelligence committees any legislative       proposal that (1) is proposed by the Secretary of Defense to       Congress, (2) has been approved by the Office of Management       and Budget, and (3) involves a grant, expansion,       modification, or cessation of authority involving the       intelligence, intelligence-related, or tactical intelligence       activities of the Department of Defense. The Committees       further direct that any such legislative proposals submitted       to the congressional intelligence committees be accompanied       by a brief explanation of the proposal.                    Office of Global Competition Analysis         The Committees encourage the President to establish an       Office of Global Competition Analysis (``the Office'') to       conduct analysis relevant to United States leadership in       science, technology, and innovation sectors critical to       national security and economic prosperity relative to other       countries, and to support policy development and decision       making across the federal government to ensure United States       leadership in science, technology, and innovation sectors       critical to national security and economic prosperity       relative to other countries, particularly those countries       that are strategic competitors of the United States.        The analysis conducted by the Office should cover:        (1) United States policies that enable technological       competitiveness relative to those of other countries,       particularly with respect to countries that are strategic       competitors of the United States;        (2) United States science and technology ecosystem       elements, including regional and national research and       development capacity, technology innovation, science and       engineering education and research workforce relative to       those of other countries;        (3) United States technology development,       commercialization, and advanced manufacturing ecosystem       elements, including supply chain resiliency, scale-up       manufacturing testbeds, access to venture capital and       financing, technical and entrepreneurial workforce, and       production, relative to those of other countries;        (4) United States competitiveness in technology and       innovation sectors critical to national security and economic       prosperity relative to other countries, including the       availability and scalability of United States technology in       such sectors abroad;        (5) trends and trajectories, including rate of change in       technologies, related to technology and innovation sectors       critical to national security and economic prosperity;        (6) threats to United States national security interests as       a result of any foreign country's dependence on technologies       of strategic competitors of the United States; and        (7) threats to United States interests based on       dependencies on foreign technologies critical to national       security and economic prosperity.        The priorities of the Office should be established in       coordination with the Director of the Office of Science and       Technology Policy, the Assistant to the President for       Economic Policy, the Assistant to the President for National       Security Affairs, and such other officials as the President       considers appropriate.        In carrying out the activities of the Office, the       Committees expect:        (1) the Office will solicit input on technology and       economic trends, data, and metrics from relevant private       sector stakeholders, including entities involved in financing       technology development and commercialization, and engage with       academia to inform the analyses;        (2) the Office will acquire, access, use, and handle data       or information in a manner consistent with applicable       provisions of law and policy, including laws and policies       providing for the protection of privacy and civil liberties,       and subject to any restrictions required by the source of the       information.        (3) the Office will receive access, upon written request,       to all information, data, or reports of any Executive agency       that the Office determines necessary to carry out its       activities, to include commercially available information       that may not be publicly available; and        (4) consistent with applicable law, the heads of       departments or agencies within the Executive will detail       personnel to the Office in order to assist the Office in its       activities.        The Committees direct the President to submit to the       appropriate congressional committees, within 180 days of the       date of enactment of the Act, a report analyzing the need for       the Office, including recommendations regarding the       administrative structure of the Office, as well as a detailed       spending plan that includes administrative costs.                            ____________________
