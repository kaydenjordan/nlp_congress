 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution  5, I call up the bill (H.R. 22) to prohibit the Secretary of Energy  from sending petroleum products from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to  China, and for other purposes, and ask for its immediate consideration  in the House.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their  remarks on the legislation and to insert extraneous material on H.R.  22.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as  I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 22, the Protecting  America's Strategic Petroleum Reserve from China Act.   America is suffering through the worst energy crisis in decades.  President Biden and the Democrats' radical rush to green agenda is  making life unaffordable for people all across this country. It is  driving record inflation, straining household budgets, and weakening  our electric grid.   Under President Biden and the Democrats' control of Congress, gas  prices rose to the highest levels in history. Some were forced to pay  more than $6 per gallon. Gas prices are still 40 percent higher today.  Diesel prices are up almost $2 a gallon more than when President Biden  took office.   The Federal Government should not be in the business of picking  winners and losers, especially when it makes us more dangerously  dependent upon China for critical minerals, solar panels, and batteries  to produce our own energy and electricity, and strengthens Russia and  OPEC's grip on world oil and gas markets.   Now, to cover up his failed policies driving our energy and inflation  crisis, President Biden drained our Nation's Strategic Petroleum  Reserve at an alarming rate. America's Strategic Petroleum Reserve,  once the world's largest stockpile, has been depleted to the lowest  levels since 1983.   President Biden released an unprecedented 250 million barrels of oil  in less than 2 years, more than all former Presidents combined. As we  know, much of that oil went to China because our refineries and  pipelines are full. It now has nowhere to go here.   In April, the Biden administration sold a million barrels directly to  a state-owned Chinese company. Millions more barrels went to overseas  traders, who eventually sent it to China.   We also know that China is ramping up its purchases of crude oil from  Russia and the U.S. to boost its own reserves. China now controls the  world's largest government-controlled stockpile of oil, with almost a  billion barrels, at the expense of American taxpayers and our energy  security.   America's Strategic Petroleum Reserve is meant for true energy supply  disruptions, like those caused by hurricanes and natural disasters, not  to help China. Draining our strategic reserves for political purposes  and selling portions of it to China is a significant threat to our  national security.   The administration is not just hurting our own ability to respond to  emergencies and national security events; they are actively bolstering  the oil reserves of our most dangerous geopolitical adversary, the  Chinese Communist Party. This is unacceptable, and it must stop.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill and prohibit  the sale and export of Strategic Petroleum Reserve crude oil to China.   H.R. 22 prevents the Secretary of Energy from selling any products  from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to any entity owned by or under  the control or influence of the CCP, or selling to any other entity  that intends to export to China.   Enacting H.R. 22, preventing the Biden administration from wasting  our strategic reserves, is the first step toward flipping the switch  and unleashing American energy production.   America has led the world in reducing carbon emissions and promoting  innovation by utilizing our abundant, clean, affordable, and reliable  energy. We can restore this leadership without sacrificing our energy  security or making everyday life unaffordable for people.   That starts by enacting smart, workable, all-of-the-above strategies  that build on this legacy by lowering costs and emissions across the  country. It includes making our infrastructure and electricity grid  more resilient and unleashing innovation for cleaner natural gas,  emissions-free hydropower and nuclear power, and carbon capture  technologies.   Republicans support a level playing field with a balance of energy  sources but without handing the keys of our energy future over to the  Chinese Communist Party.   It is time to cut the red tape, expand energy production here at  home, modernize our infrastructure, invest in new technologies, and  create opportunities for jobs and economic development right here in  the United States of America.   I look forward to passage of this bill today, and I am eager to get  to work  [[Page H210]]  with my colleagues on additional solutions to make energy cleaner, more  affordable, and more reliable for all Americans.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Burgess), a leader on energy.    Mr. Speaker, we should be banning exports  to Russia, North Korea, and Iran.   I would just note that President Biden has wanted to import from  Russia and Iran.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr.  Latta).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Guthrie).    Mr. Speaker, just to correct the record.  The language is very clear, if you look at subsection two: Such  petroleum products will not be exported to the People's Republic of  China.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 45 seconds to the gentleman from Florida (Mr.  Bilirakis).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Johnson).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the  gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Bucshon).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Carter).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Duncan).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Utah (Mr. Curtis), a member of the Energy and Commerce  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Arizona (Mrs. Lesko), a member of the Energy and  Commerce Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Scalise), the House majority leader and  also a longtime member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 1\1/2\  minutes to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Joyce), a member of the  Energy and Commerce Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 1  minute to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Balderson), a leader on energy  issues and a new member of the committee.     Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 1  minute to the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Stauber).    Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 1  minute to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Weber), a new member of the  Energy and Commerce Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to  the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Van Drew).    Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 1  minute to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. De La Cruz).   Ms. De La CRUZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of American energy  independence and the oil and natural gas workers of south Texas.   This act is a crucial step to holding China accountable and  repositioning the United States as a global energy leader.   It is essential that we recover our energy independence and stand up  for Texas' workers who have unfairly suffered as a result of this  administration's misguided policies that have emboldened regimes like  China and Venezuela's narco-dictatorship.   The decision to prioritize a foreign energy over our own puts  American workers, our industries, and our country at a disadvantage.  Protecting American energy will strengthen both our economic and  national security.   I stand fully committed to fighting for all the natural gas and oil  workers in south Texas and across our Nation.                                time  1030     Mr. Speaker, I yield 45 seconds to the  gentleman from Florida (Mr. Mills).    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to how much  time is remaining?    Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Fallon).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the  gentleman from New York (Mr. Lawler).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance  of my time.   Leadership matters. American leadership matters. You can't be a  diplomatic power without being a military power. You can't be a  military power without being an economic power. You cannot be an  economic power without energy.   In order to reverse the damage to our energy security and our global  leadership, we must flip the switch and unleash American energy  production.   We need to stop the Biden administration from wasting our strategic  reserves.   It is time to cut the red tape and expand energy production here at  home, modernize our infrastructure, and create new opportunities for  jobs and economic development.   The Democrats suggested if the bill included Iran, Russia, and North  Korea that they would support it. The fact of the matter is those are  the countries this administration has gone to.   They have gone to OPEC, Iran, and Russia and actually asked them to  produce more oil.   Mr. Speaker, I look forward to the passage of this bill today, and I  am eager--I am eager--to work with my colleagues on additional  solutions to make energy more affordable, more reliable.   It is America that is leading in clean, reliable, renewable,  affordable energy, and it is so important to energy dominance.   It is important to American leadership. It is important to our  economy. It is important to every person in this country that has been  living with record-high energy prices.   Every time they go to the gas station to fill up over the last couple  of years, they have been experiencing record-high energy prices.   Mr. Speaker, we are prepared to lead. We want to unleash American  energy, unleash clean American energy jobs. This is important to our  national security. It is important to our economic security.   I urge everyone to vote ``yes.'' Pass H.R. 22. It is just the  beginning. There is more to come.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
