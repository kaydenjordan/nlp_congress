 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor Ralph  Staffins, III, for being named a member of Georgia Trend's 40 Under 40  Class of 2021.   Since receiving his master of public administration from Georgia  College & State University, Ralph has passionately served businesses  across the State of Georgia. Most recently, Ralph served as the  president and CEO of the Brunswick Golden Isles Chamber of Commerce,  working hard to maintain its status as one of the best-run chambers in  the State of Georgia.   An important aspect of the chamber's success is preparing the next  generation to be valuable members of the workforce. Serving on the  boards of directors at the Coastal Pines Technical College and the  Golden Isles College and Career Academy Foundation, Ralph is a  committed advocate of workforce education. In every role, Ralph has  worked to ensure that businesses and communities across the State  flourished.   Ralph's dedication to his community is nothing short of remarkable. I  am honored to recognize Ralph for this prestigious accomplishment, and  I am thankful for his continued service throughout Georgia's First  Congressional District.
