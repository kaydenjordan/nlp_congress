 Mr. President, today I want to honor longtime  Oregon journalist Steve Forrester.   Steve has retired as editor and publisher of the Daily Astorian. He  will remain president and chief executive officer of the EO Media  Group, which owns the Astorian, as well as several other newspapers,  including publications in eastern Oregon, but we will no longer benefit  from his day-to-day leadership at the Astorian.   I have known Steve for nearly 40 years, since he was a reporter in  Washington, DC, and I was a young Member of the House. In all that  time, Steve has never hesitated to ask the tough questions and to be  fiercely devoted to local journalism's principles and importance. The  theme running consistently throughout Steve's career has been always to  ensure local readers understand the impact of decisions and policies  made in Congress, the statehouse, and city hall.   I particularly wanted to honor Steve today because, over the Fourth  of July recess, I will be home in Oregon highlighting the foundational  freedoms of the First Amendment with events celebrating those freedoms  of religion, speech, assembly, and the press.   The Founding Fathers knew those First Amendment freedoms were core to  our country and to creating the values that have made America a  destination for all who hunger to be free of fear and liberated to  pursue their dreams. As the child of parents who fled the Nazis for  refuge in the United States, I learned early on about the importance of  these freedoms. As the son of a reporter, I also learned especially  about the importance of the freedom of the press.   Because Steve has contributed so much to a vibrant and free press in  our great State of Oregon, I will be proud to present him on July 1, in  Astoria, with a ``Go Fourth'' award. Steve's career makes him richly  deserving of this award and an inspiration for Oregon journalists for  generations to come.   I suspect Steve will exercise his self-deprecating modesty and  question why he is worthy of such attention. I know Steve would much  rather shine the spotlight on others, but the bottom line is I want  Oregon to recognize his enormous and long-lasting contributions to  making our State a better place to live and to making all of us as  Oregonians better-informed citizens.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I begin by thanking Senator Merkley.  Senator Merkley, in my view, delivered a wake-up call to the country  several weeks ago when he went to the border, and I have been very  pleased to be able to join him in this effort.   A few days ago, we visited a detention center in Sheridan, OR. We  spoke with a father who had been separated from his 18-month-old  daughter. The day before Father's Day, colleagues, Senator Merkley and  I listened to a father who had been separated from his 18-month-old  daughter and had no idea where she was and didn't know when he would  see her again. All over the country, as part of this national shame,  these stories have been breaking our hearts.   Now, the President has said, for example, that he is turning away  gang members. What Senator Merkley and I saw last Saturday was that he  is locking up innocent people who are in danger because they refused to  submit to gangs in their home countries. That is what we heard at the  Sheridan prison just a few days ago.   These stories are particularly poignant in our household. The Wydens  had the opportunity to flee the evils of Nazi Germany for the safety  and the promise of the United States. My father came as a youngster. He  barely spoke English. He studied hard, and when the war came he wanted  to wear the uniform of the United States more than anything.   He served in our propaganda arm, where his fluent native German was a  great value to the war effort because he wrote propaganda pamphlets  that we dropped on the Nazis telling them that they had no chance, that  they had no opportunity to survive. Unlike the comical efforts of our  enemies, who mangled English, the work of young immigrants like my  father, wearing the uniform of the U.S. Army, struck at the morale of  German soldiers freezing on the battlefield.   My parents were lucky to be able to make a home in our country, and  they raised my brother and me here. They did their part to add to the  fabric of the United States.   Now, the Wydens were able to come, but not everyone of their Jewish  background was so fortunate. Shiploads of Jews fleeing persecution and  violence  [[Page S4298]]  were deemed undesirable, and they were turned away from America. Let me  be clear about what happened. The rallying cry for those who wished to  keep people like my Jewish parents out of this country--those who  denied Jewish refugees safety in their moment of desperation--was  ``America first.''   What happened to those families who turned to the beacon of America  for safety and opportunity? Many were forced back to Europe, and many  of them ultimately ended up in concentration camps. People don't embark  on the harrowing journey to America, much less with kids by their side,  unless they are fleeing serious danger and deprivation.   It is with that history that I wanted to join my colleagues tonight  on this floor to talk about the heartlessness we see in the Trump zero  tolerance policy--thousands of kids, refugees, forcibly separated from  their parents. There are reports that border agents lied to mothers and  fathers, telling them that their kids were being taken away for a bath,  only to have them disappear--a terrifying scenario, colleagues, with  grim historical echoes. There are nursing babies taken from their  mothers and kids locked in cages for days, regimented like they are  criminals facing hard time.   There is a reason that the courts have barred the executive from  holding child refugees for more than 20 days. However, it appears the  President intends now to ignore the courts and hold children in jails  for the foreseeable future.   The administration has gone to great lengths to defend their policy,  but they will not stand up and defend it with honest answers. The  administration even buried a recent government report showing that  refugees are a positive economic force. I gather it is because it just  didn't fit the company line.   I will close by saying that in my view a strong leader does not rip  kids from their mothers and lock them in cages. A strong leader does  not take child hostages to use as political pawns. A strong leader does  not lie and mislead the American people about the true nature of the  policy he enacts.   In my view, these have been acts of weakness. My view is that the  national shame which we have seen over the last few weeks is going to  go down as one of the dark moments in American history. It is why it is  so important in the days ahead that we come together--Democrats and  Republicans--and we restore the greatness of America, which is that we  are better and stronger because we stand up for refugees, refugees like  the Wydens, who fled Nazi Germany decades ago.    I again thank my colleague from Oregon for his critical leadership on  this matter.   I yield the floor.
