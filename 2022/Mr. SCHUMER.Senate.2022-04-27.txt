 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, earlier today, leaders past and present  from around the world joined together to celebrate the life of  Madeleine Albright. While Secretary Albright may have been small in  stature, she was a titan in American history; she was one of a kind and  first of a kind; a mentor; a natural leader as well as a mother and  grandmother. Her brilliance and sharp wit made her a formidable  presence on the world stage, and her story inspired women and girls all  across the globe.   Today was a wonderful celebration of her life. My thoughts are with  Secretary Albright's family as our Nation remembers her life and her  great legacy.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, we have just gotten some very good  news, and that is that the Senate has confirmed the U.S. attorneys and  U.S. marshals who had been blocked for quite a long time. It is a good  thing that our Republican colleagues finally stopped their indefensible  obstruction of qualified U.S. attorneys and marshals. These nominees  are vital to keeping our communities safe and secure, and they should  never have been held up for leverage in partisan games.   The nominees are vital to keeping our communities safe and secure.  After months of waiting, communities in Georgia and Ohio and Nevada and  Minnesota and New Hampshire and other States are finally getting the  security  [[Page S2179]]  they need with confirmed U.S. attorneys. So I am very glad that this  has finally, finally happened. It took too long, but now it is done.   I yield the floor.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw the  cloture motion with respect to the Gordon nomination.    Madam President, I yield back all time.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  be in a period of morning business, with Senators permitted to speak  therein for up to 10 minutes each.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the immediate consideration of S. Con. Res. 36.    I ask unanimous consent that the concurrent resolution  be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motions to reconsider  be considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action  or debate.    Mr. President, I am just going to say a word about this  resolution.   Ulysses Grant was an amazing human being. I became acquainted with  him when I read the biography of Ulysses Grant written by Mr. Chernow,  a Brooklyn resident, who was very eager for us to pass this. One of his  crusades in life was to undo the smears against Ulysses Grant, often  perpetrated by southern historians after we won the Civil War for the  Union. And I commend to everybody Mr. Chernow's book. It is an amazing  book.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Committee on the Judiciary be discharged from further consideration and  the Senate proceed to S. Res. 588.    I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed  to, the preamble be agreed to, and that the motions to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the consideration of S. Res. 597, submitted earlier today.    I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed  to, the preamble be agreed to, and that the motions to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or  debate.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the consideration of S. Res. 598, submitted earlier today.    I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed  to, the preamble be agreed to, and that the motions to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or  debate.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the immediate consideration of S. Res. 599, which was  submitted earlier today.    I further ask unanimous consent that the resolution be  agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and that the motions to  reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no  intervening action or debate.  [[Page S2197]]     Mr. President, I understand there is a bill at the desk  that is due for a second reading.    Mr. President, in order to place the bill on the  calendar under the provisions of rule XIV, I would object to further  proceeding.    I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I return to the floor tonight with a  happy announcement on the jobs and competition bill: We have reached an  agreement with Republicans that clears the path to entering into a  conference with the House.   Tomorrow, the Senate will hold two votes: one on cloture and one to  approve our measure making the conference committee official.   Next Tuesday and Wednesday, we will then hold floor votes on 28  motions to instruct--8 from Democrats, 20 from Republicans.   Tonight's agreement is very good news for America, for good-paying  jobs in America, for economic strength in America, for investments in  the kinds of science and technology that will help us grow as a country  and provide great futures for the next generation.   This bill represents the next major step forward towards finally  sending a jobs and competition bill to the President's desk. Of course,  I wish it would have happened much sooner; but, nevertheless, the time  has come to move forward on this bill.   Let me add this: This will be the most votes on motions to instruct  of any bill in decades--a sign of both the immense good will we have  shown to our Republican colleagues and the fact that many Members on  both sides of the aisle have a stake in seeing this bill finalized.   We have a lot of work left to do, but this agreement is a big step  forward towards finally enacting the legislation to lower costs, bring  manufacturing back to America, and strengthen our supply chains so we  can keep our economy strong for decades.   I want to thank my colleagues from both sides of the aisle who worked  in good faith to reach this point.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that if a  compound motion to go forward to conference on Calendar No. 282, H.R.  4521, is agreed to and the Chair is authorized to appoint conferees,  the following Senators be permitted to make a motion to instruct, the  text of which is at the desk; that these be the only motions to  instruct in order; further, that at a time to be determined by the  majority leader, following consultation with the Republican leader, the  Senate vote in relation to the motions in the order listed; and that  the only debate with respect to these motions be 2 minutes equally  divided prior to each vote, with 60 affirmative votes required for  adoption of the Lankford motion: Paul, Barrasso, Cruz, Menendez, Risch,  Kelly, Lee, Blackburn, Cotton, Murkowski, Sullivan, Rubio, Johnson,  Sanders on warrants, Scott of Florida, Hassan, Ernst, Lankford, Sanders  on NASA, Cassidy on Mexico, Bennet, Warnock, Daines, Cassidy on college  transparency, Capito, Toomey, Scott of South Carolina, Lujan.    Mr. President, it is my understanding that the Senate  has received a message from the House of Representatives to accompany  H.R. 4521.    Mr. President, I move that the Senate insist on its  amendment to H.R. 4521, agree to the request of the House for  conference, and authorize the Chair to appoint conferees on the part of  the Senate.    Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  mandatory quorum call for the cloture motion filed today, April 27, be  waived.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 10 a.m. on  Thursday, April 28, and that following the prayer and the pledge, the  morning hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved  to date, the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later  in the day, and morning business be closed; that upon the conclusion of  morning business, the Senate resume consideration of the House message  to accompany H.R. 4521; further, that the cloture motion ripen at 12  noon; finally, that if cloture is invoked, the vote on the compound  motion to go to conference occur at 1:45 p.m.    Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned  under the previous order.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 9:11 p.m., adjourned until  Thursday, April 28, 2022, at 10 a.m.  [[Page S2198]]                                ____________________
