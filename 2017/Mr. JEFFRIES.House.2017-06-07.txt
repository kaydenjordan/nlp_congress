 Mr. Speaker, our focus should be on education and job  creation. We should invest in transportation and infrastructure; invest  in research and development; invest in technology and innovation; and  invest in working families, middle class folks, and senior citizens.   Instead, House Republicans have shortened the workweek and canceled  votes on Friday.   Why?   Apparently because James Comey is testifying tomorrow and they want  to get out of town before sundown. That is an abdication of  responsibility, a dereliction of duty, and a classic example of  legislative malpractice.   ``Where are the jobs?'' the American people are asking. House  Republicans are missing in action and the American people deserve  better.                            ____________________
