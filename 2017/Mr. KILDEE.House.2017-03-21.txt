 Mr. Speaker, thousands of my constituents have contacted  me very concerned about the Republican healthcare bill--TrumpCare-- which would mean higher costs and worse care for hardworking families.   On the campaign trail, then-candidate Trump promised that ``everyone  would be covered'' under his plan. We now know that is a broken  promise, that under TrumpCare 24 million Americans will lose their  health insurance--24 million people.   What kind of promise is that?   Then-candidate Trump promised that there would be no cuts to  Medicaid, but he will cut $880 billion from Medicaid.   What kind of promise is that? A broken promise.   Seniors overwhelmingly voted for President Trump, but he has already  forgotten them, imposing an age tax on them. If you are 50 to 64,  fasten your seatbelts. You are going to pay five times what a younger,  healthier person would pay for worse coverage.   This is a terrible bill. Democrats and Republicans should reject it.                            ____________________
