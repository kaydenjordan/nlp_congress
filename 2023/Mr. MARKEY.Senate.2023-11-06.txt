 Madam President, I was necessarily absent, but had I been  present, I would have voted yes on rollcall vote No. 291, confirmation  of Lt. Gen. Christopher J. Mahoney for appointment as Asst. Commandant  of the Marine Corps, and to be General.                            ____________________     Madam President, today I recognize Charlie Owen,  as he concludes his remarkable tenure as president of the American  Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees--AFSCME--Council  93.   Charles C. Owen, Jr., was born on January 29, 1950, a son of the  tightly knit Irish community in South Boston, MA. In 1968, he joined  the U.S. Army and was stationed in Germany before heading to Vietnam,  where he fought for his country. He returned to the United States with  an honorable discharge in 1971. In 1975, he went into the public  service, securing a job working as a mechanic in the city of Boston  Police Department, repairing police cars. He went on to serve the city  of Boston for 46 years.   Charlie almost never worked just one job. Like many people in this  country, he had to work multiple jobs to support his family. He worked  as an emergency medical technician, and for 20 years, he was a day-of- game employee for his beloved Boston Red Sox. He was a part of the Red  Sox operation not just for the storied--and curse-breaking--2004  championship season, but also for the 2007, 2013, and 2018 World Series  winning seasons. And, typical of Charlie, he didn't just work the  games. For over a decade, he ran his own charitable golf tournament,  raising hundreds of thousands of dollars for the Jimmy Fund, the Red  Sox charitable foundation that fights both childhood and adult cancer.   But it was as a city of Boston employee that Charlie really found his  niche as a union activist. He got involved in his local and eventually  became the president of AFSCME Local 804, which represents supervisors  and managers across the city of Boston. To this day, he remains a  loyal, dues-paying member of Local 804. Across decades of union  activism, Charlie learned to negotiate contracts, to stand up for his  members at work, to work with management to solve complicated workplace  problems, to figure out which political candidates would stand up for  workers, to help elect those candidates to office, and to persuade  elected officials to pass laws that would help working families. In  2011, he ran for the vice presidency of AFSCME Council 93, the umbrella  organization for all AFSCME Locals in Northern New England. He won his  election and, in 2012, ascended to the presidency of the council.   He has travelled all over New England, and indeed all over the  country, talking to workers in Tennessee, Texas, Colorado, and  elsewhere about standing together to have a voice at work. He has  spoken with elected officials at every level about the concerns of  workers--the need for a living wage, decent health insurance, and a  dignified retirement. This includes three American Presidents-- President Bill Clinton, President Barack Obama, and President Joe  Biden--as well as any number of Presidential candidates.   In short, Charlie Owen is a great American. He has served his country  from almost the moment he turned 18, as a member of the armed services,  in public service, and as a union activist. Everywhere he went,  everything he did, he looked for ways to serve others, whether those  others be his coworkers, children with cancer, or simply his fellow  Americans.   In January 2021, Charlie retired from his job at the city of Boston,  and in November of this year, his term as president of AFSCME Council  93 will end. He has dedicated over 40 years of his life in service to  his coworkers. As he ends his professional career and steps down from  decades of service to his union, we salute him. He will spend time with  his seven children, his many grandchildren, and great-grandchild, and  he will continue to travel around the country talking to people seeking  a voice at work. I thank Charlie for his unending dedication and look  forward to seeing what great things he will do next.                            ____________________
