 Madam Speaker, today I rise to honor one of Lancaster  County's most honored public servants and a true hero, former Denver  Fire Company Chief, John Weaver, who passed away on January 26.   John served our community for 50 years. He became a junior fireman  when he was just 14 years old. He later joined the Denver Fire Company  when he was 18, in 1969.   He held every officer position, including fire chief. He became a  fire instructor, and most recently, he was one of the primary drivers  for the fire department. He was a brave man who helped make the fire  department what it is today.   John was also an entrepreneur who founded a manufacturing company,  Weaver Industries. Beyond working for the fire company and saving lives  there, John was also involved in our community. He believed in giving  back and serving others.   He served on the Cocalico School Board for 12 years, and coached golf  and bowling. John found great joy in helping people and set a wonderful  example for all of us.   He leaves behind a wife, three sons, and four grandchildren. May we  remember his giving spirit and may he rest in peace.                            ____________________
