 Madam Speaker, I rise today to praise President Biden for  his work to restore our economy. The COVID-19 pandemic caused economic  issues that few experts could have predicted. It needed strong  leadership to help our Nation recover.   Thanks to President Biden's leadership, inflation has come down for  six straight months, gasoline prices are down almost $2 in a few  months, and the cost of goods are falling nationwide. These actions are  saving millions of dollars for hardworking American families across the  country.   In addition, President Biden's leadership has led to increased wages,  11 million new jobs, and the lowest unemployment in 50 years. Clearly,  President Biden's economic policies are working, and we are lucky to  have him in the White House.                            ____________________
