 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 6311, the  Increasing Access to Lower Premium Plans and Expanding Health Savings  Accounts Act.   This important bill contains a 2-year delay of the health insurance  tax, or HIT. Like the medical device tax, which the House voted  yesterday to repeal, the HIT is yet another damaging tax from  ObamaCare. It raises premiums for families, for small businesses, for  seniors, and for the disabled enrolled in Medicare Advantage. In fact,  the HIT could raise annual premiums for the typical Medicare Advantage  couple by $500 if it returns in 2020.   I am a proud original cosponsor, with Representatives Noem, Sinema,  and Bera, of H.R. 5963, which delays the HIT for 2 years, and I am  thrilled this bill we are voting for today includes it.   I look forward to the day when we can finally repeal this tax that  falls on the backs of seniors, the disabled, small businesses, and  hardworking families, but until then, I urge my colleagues to support  delaying it.
