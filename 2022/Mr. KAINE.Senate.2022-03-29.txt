 Madam President, I rise to talk about one of the Senate's  foremost constitutional duties, the advice and consent of executive  nominations.   The most senior nominees, like Cabinet Secretaries, go through a  floor process that normally takes about 4 days, if you run through all  the procedural steps by the book. Other nominees, typically people with  highly specialized expertise, go through a rigorous committee process  and are often confirmed by unanimous consent.   Any Senator can object; that is the right of the Senator. If they  feel that even one of hundreds of lower-level nominees should take up  nearly a full week of the U.S. Senate's time, they can insist upon  that.   I think Presidents are due an appropriate level of discretion in  picking their teams, and I believe this is true whether or not the  President is one I support or oppose. I believe in having the executive  branch staffed with qualified professionals. I do draw the line at  three areas: if a nominee is totally unqualified for the job, if there  is a well-justified reason to question a nominee's ethics or honesty or  impartiality, and, finally, if a nominee is so outside the mainstream  in ways that go beyond normal good-faith disagreement on matters of  policy.   I opposed a number of President Trump's nominees who met one or  multiple of these criteria, but I also supported a larger percentage of  President Trump's nominees. Even though these were not people I  expected to agree with on policy, they did not fall afoul of the three  criteria that I look at in a primary way.   I am here today because of several nominees within the jurisdiction  of multiple committees I sit on; they are being blockaded, and I would  like to focus on one just now.   Amy Loyd is nominated to be the Assistant Secretary of Education for  Career, Technical, and Adult Education.  [[Page S1819]]  Ms. Loyd designed and led programs across the United States in her  prior role at the education think tank Jobs for the Future and the  Native American educational advocacy group the Cook Inlet Tribal  Council.   She had a distinguished academic career, attending community college  first in Santa Fe, prior to a doctorate in education leadership from  Harvard Graduate School of Education. She is a lifelong professional in  the field of career and technical education, and she brings personal  life experience in the field, having begun her career at community  college. I believe she is an outstanding point person for President  Biden when it comes to matters of career and technical education.   The Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions advanced her  nomination by a voice vote, with no recorded opposition. I sit on the  HELP Committee. I am the chairman of the bipartisan Senate Career and  Technical Education Caucus. I was proud to support her.   Although I do not know Ms. Loyd personally, I do have a personal  connection to her nomination. My dad ran a welding and ironworking  shop. I grew up working in that shop with my two brothers and my  mother. I saw the power of career and technical education and the  artistry of the ironworkers who worked in my dad's business.   When I was in the middle of law school, I took a year off to go be a  missionary in Honduras, and I ran a school that taught kids to be  carpenters and welders, again seeing the power of career and technical  education. And I think that there is a bipartisan understanding in this  body and the House--really, in society at large--that we may have  undervalued career and technical education in recent generations; and  as we are contemplating things like an infrastructure bill or other  important priorities to grow the economy, we need to put more stress,  not less, on the value of career and technical education.   So, as a Senator, I am proud to have made this one of my central  policy fields: working on CTE bills with many, many colleagues on both  sides of the aisle.   There is a hold on Amy Loyd's nomination, and that is the right of  those who would hold her. But I am here specifically because I would  like to know why.   I would ask my colleagues under which of the three buckets does Ms.  Loyd's nomination fall short? Is there a perception that she is not  qualified? Is there a perception that she is not ethical? Is there a  perception that her views on career and technical education are outside  the mainstream?   You don't have to support President Biden's nominees. If she is  confirmed, part of her job will be answering tough questions from  colleagues.   But I would ask my colleagues, if you are voting against nominees of  any President from the other party not because of flaws of the kinds  that I have described, what does that get us?   The American people put Democrats for a period of time in charge of  both the executive and the legislative branches. The American public  often vote for divided government. Does that mean that any time the  White House and the Senate are controlled by different parties, the  parties just won't have anybody in their administration? What does that  get our country? I think we know the answer: dysfunction.    Clearly, Madam President, as I conclude, there are nominees who  engender significant controversy, either because of the peculiar nature  of the post to which they have been nominated or because of aspects of  their background or character. I know of no such controversy with this  nominee, either about the position or about the individual herself. And  I think if we are to succeed in the necessary project of elevating the  importance of career and technical education, we need to have Ms. Loyd  confirmed in her position.   For that reason, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate consider the  following nomination; Calendar No. 669, Amy Loyd, to be Assistant  Secretary for Career, Technical, and Adult Education, Department of  Education; that the Senate vote on the nomination without intervening  action or debate; that the motion to reconsider be considered made and  laid upon the table; and that any statements related to the nomination  be printed in the Record.    Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I rise to do a couple of things. I am  awaiting the arrival of the Senator from Missouri. I am going to make a  UC motion to bring up a very important nominee in the Secretary of  Defense Department, but before I do, I want to comment on a UC that I  made 2 hours ago. I stood here in this spot, and I sought unanimous  consent to bring forward the nomination of Amy Loyd, who is the nominee  to be Assistant Secretary of Education for Career and Technical  Education. She passed out of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions  Committee unanimously.   We knew there was a hold on her nomination. We didn't know why. So I  sought to bring forward her nomination, and the Senator from Utah, Mr.  Lee, appeared, and I asked him why he was objecting to Amy Loyd. The  good news was, he answered. He didn't have to, but he gave me an  answer, and he said that her work indicated an attachment to critical  race theory. That was his response, and he cited an article.   I went up to him after, and I asked him what the article was, and he  referred me to an article dated August 2020, titled ``Diversifying  Apprenticeship: Acknowledging Unconscious Bias to Improve Employee  Access.'' That was the reason he and, he said, on behalf of others were  opposing Ms. Loyd's nomination for a really important position focusing  on career and technical education in the country.   I went back to my office, and I got the article. The article is seven  pages long, August 2020--it is actually six pages long. It is entirely  uncontroversial. Listen to this. There is a block that says ``What Is  Unconscious Bias?'' Talk about fair and balanced language:         Unconscious biases are social stereotypes about certain       groups of people that individuals form outside their       conscious awareness.    Is that controversial? Is that controversial?   There are recommendations for diversifying apprenticeships because,  as we know, there are a lot of apprenticeships where there are not many  women in apprenticeships. Ms. Loyd is a woman. She wants to diversify  apprenticeships. That doesn't seem that unusual.   The recommendations for diversifying apprenticeships in this  controversial article where the phrase ``critical race theory'' is  never mentioned are widen the selection pool; seek out workers across  skill levels; develop transparent, detailed, and uniform criteria; get  multiple perspectives; complement selection processes with program  designs that increase access. This is just basic human resources. There  is nothing in this document about critical race theory.   When I read it thinking I was going to find some real reason to  oppose Ms. Loyd, I found this basic human resources 101--nothing about  critical race theory. But then I realized something even more amazing.  I looked at  [[Page S1825]]  the author of the article. This was being held against Ms. Loyd's  confirmation. The author of the article is Jessica Toglia, senior  program manager of JFF. Unless this is a nom de plume, Amy Loyd had  nothing to do with the article that was cited to block her confirmation  for this position.   So then I looked further. There are acknowledgements on page 7. Ms.  Toglia thanks 10 different people who gave her ideas and thoughts that  she put into these six pages. Amy Loyd's name isn't among the 10.   There are then 28 footnotes and references citing articles and other  pieces of scholarship that were written. None of them are by Amy Loyd-- none.   So in response to my request as the son of a welder that we ought to  have somebody at the Department of Education who values career and  technical education, this well-qualified individual, who got out of the  Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee by unanimous vote, is  now being sort of tarred with the ``critical race theory'' label based  upon an article that she had nothing to do with--nothing to do with.   I knew if I came back and stated this, like, well, who would listen,  and who would care? You can assert a reason. But the reason for  opposition to her nomination has nothing to do with her.    Mr. President, I respect my colleague's right to object,  obviously. But I would say that while the Senator from Missouri raises  very valid concerns, none of those concern this nominee, Christopher  Lowman, and none of his concerns are addressed or  [[Page S1826]]  enhanced by leaving the Pentagon without an Assistant Secretary of  Defense for Sustainment during a war in Europe where the U.S. military  is playing a very important role.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I have eight requests for committees to  meet during today's session of the Senate. They have the approval of  the Majority and Minority Leaders.   Pursuant to rule XXVI, paragraph 5(a), of the Standing Rules of the  Senate, the following committees are authorized to meet during today's  session of the Senate:                         committee on armed services    The Committee on Armed Services is authorized to meet during the  session of the Senate on Tuesday, March 29, 2022, at 9:30 a.m., to  conduct a hearing.
