 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize The Weather  Channel for 40 years of exceptional weather journalism, public service,  and high-quality educational content.   Since 1982, The Weather Channel has provided accurate, by-the-minute  live coverage of weather events, ranging from the mundane daily rain  shower to catastrophic hurricanes and tornadoes.   Today, The Weather Channel reaches more than 80 million households  across the United States. It has consistently been ranked the most  trustworthy cable news network in the country and has received  nationwide acclaim for its high-quality reporting and programming.  [[Page H4586]]    The Weather Channel has been instrumental in providing critical  information to the public during natural disasters and severe weather  events such as Hurricane Katrina, the 2011 tornado super outbreaks, and  the January 2014 snowpocalypse that shut down much of north Georgia.   During these events, The Weather Channel's information was  instrumental to the people in affected areas, giving them guidance on  when to seek shelter and what weather developments to expect.   Today, I am proud to co-lead, with Representative McBath, a newly  introduced resolution recognizing The Weather Channel on its 40th  anniversary for its outstanding contributions to broadcast news and  meteorology and for its role as a longstanding American institution.                            ____________________
