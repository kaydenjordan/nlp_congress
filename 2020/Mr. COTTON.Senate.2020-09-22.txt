 I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    I know of no further debate on this nomination.    Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, we are facing momentous issues in the  Senate and in Washington and in our Nation.   Today, we are debating a spending bill to keep the government funded  past the end of this month. There are ongoing negotiations to help  provide additional relief to those most affected by the coronavirus.   With the sad news of the passing of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg,  there is now a Supreme Court vacancy as well.   As momentous as these issues are, we ought not miss what is happening  on the streets of America, though, as too many in Washington missed for  years as Americans were dying by the thousands as a result of the  opioid epidemic that hit this country, from prescription pills to  heroin, to synthetic opioids like fentanyl.   Now, in recent years, Washington has gotten the news, and we have  taken action to try to stem the tide of drug overdoses around our  country.   But the fight continues, so I want to call the Senate and the  Nation's attention to a new threat: isotonitazene. It is harder to  pronounce than fentanyl, but it is equally deadly. It will kill you in  a heartbeat, and it also comes from China. Reports of iso--as this  hard-to-pronounce drug is often called on the street--are still  scattered.   A shipment was seized in Canada early last year. Now it has been  popping up in Europe, in countries as far flung as Belgium, Estonia,  Germany, Latvia, Sweden, and the United Kingdom, and, at about the same  time, iso has found its way to America as well. It has turned up in  both pill and powder form, seemingly shipped in concentrated, small  quantities that escape detection too often. Once it is here, it is  usually cut with other drugs, like heroin and cocaine, to make them  more powerful and much more deadly.   An unsuspecting drug user can inject a tainted dose or take a  counterfeit  [[Page S5791]]  prescription pill and be dead within minutes. Iso is just like fentanyl  in that regard.   According to the Drug Enforcement Agency, iso is confirmed to have  killed at least 18 Americans in 4 different States and has been  encountered in at least 48 confirmed incidents across 9 States.   However, it has likely killed many more. We don't know for sure  because tests for iso still are not widely available, given its  novelty, and overdose deaths due to a cocktail of iso mixed with  heroin, cocaine, or other drugs may be inadvertently attributed only to  the known substance.   What we do know is that iso is just the latest weapon that the  Chinese drug dealers are using in their opium war against America.  First, they developed designer fentanyl analogs, which have killed--and  continue to kill--Americans by the thousands.   However, we have taken strong action against fentanyl. Last year, we  passed my legislation, the Fentanyl Sanctions Act, to punish Chinese  drug dealers, and the President--equally important--pressured China's  leader to crack down on underground drug labs in their own country,  which sent nine fentanyl smugglers to prison.   These efforts have made a difference, but the fight is not over.  China's drug dealers have developed a new poison to send to America.   Iso has no recognized medical or industrial use. It is nothing more  and nothing less than a way to profit off of addiction and death. These  Chinese drug dealers want iso to be the new fentanyl, so we have to  take strong action to make sure they fail before more Americans are  killed.   The DEA has already taken swift action by classifying iso as a  schedule I controlled substance, its most restrictive classification.  But this is only a temporary measure that will last 2 years, at most.   Congress should, therefore, act to ensure iso stays on that list for  good. That is why I am introducing legislation to permanently classify  iso as a schedule I controlled substance. This will ensure iso receives  the strictest regulations under our drug laws, and it will help our  brave drug enforcement agents keep this deadly drug off of our streets.   Furthermore, I call upon the leaders of the Chinese Communist Party  to crack down on the production of iso in the Chinese mainland. If the  leaders of the party wish to reduce tensions, if they wish to improve  relations, they ought not to allow their own criminals to manufacture  drugs with no legitimate purpose specifically designed for smuggling  into America to poison our citizens.   I urge my colleagues and the administration to join in this effort to  stop iso before it spreads even further. This drug has already killed  too many of our fellow citizens. We need to stop it before it kills  even more.                                  ______                                         By Mr. SCHUMER:   S. 4653.
