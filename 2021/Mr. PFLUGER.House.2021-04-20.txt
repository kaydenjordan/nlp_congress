 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and  sacrifice of Mrs. JoAnne Powell, a pillar of the San Angelo community  and one of the most distinguished public servants in the U.S. House of  Representatives.   JoAnne served the constituents of the 11th District of Texas for over  35 years in the San Angelo office. During this time, she solved  thousands of cases with Federal agencies, helped thousands of people,  and was the eyes and ears of the office on the ground and throughout  our district.   Her pride and joy in mentoring hundreds of men and women who would  later go to service academies truly changed our Nation and our military  service. She trained four Congressmen over her tenure: Tom Loeffler,  Lamar Smith, Mike Conaway, and now myself. It has been a priceless  honor to have her mentorship and her guidance as I begin my journey in  Congress.   On top of her congressional service, the influence she and her  beloved husband, Colonel Powell, have had on our community cannot be  overstated. She married her childhood sweetheart, Charles Powell, in  December 1954, just months after his graduation from the U.S. Naval  Academy. Charles would go on to become a colonel in the U.S. Air Force  and the two would take a long journey and a successful journey in  service to this country before settling in San Angelo in 1980 when  Colonel Powell became the wing commander of Goodfellow.   At that time, the base was scheduled for closure. Both Colonel Powell  and  [[Page H1959]]  JoAnne were instrumental in making sure that that mission of training  our intelligence personnel in the Air Force, the Marines, the Army, and  the Navy continued to become one of the most important in the United  States.   When she settled in San Angelo, JoAnne became one of the most  involved members of the Concho Valley community and received many  honors for serving on boards and for her philanthropic and  organizational leadership. She was the epitome of service before self,  working hard and handling casework right up until the week before she  passed away.   She genuinely cared for every single person and showed Christ's love  to everybody she encountered. I cannot express how great this loss is  to our team and the entire 11th District.   JoAnne and Colonel Powell, we will miss you.                         Honoring Gregorio Gutierrez     Madam Speaker, I rise to honor the life and the service  of Gregorio Gutierrez, a man with a servant's heart, a strong faith in  God, and an unmatched ability to connect with all sorts of people.   Born in Mexico, Gregorio came to the United States in 1984; married  his wife, Araceli, in 1990; and earned his citizenship in 2000. He  followed his passion and founded Conexion San Angelo, the area's first  and only bilingual news organization. Since then he has expanded  throughout west Texas, and his operation still lives today.   He was an amazing man with a strong legacy that will live on through  his wife, Araceli; his son, Ricardo; and all who know him.   San Angelo has honored Gregorio and his family with Gregorio  Gutierrez Day which will fall every year on January 23. His family  should be proud of his amazing legacy and his service to the Spanish- speaking community, the members of San Angelo, and all of the Concho  Valley.                            Honoring J.C. Campbell     Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and legacy  of J.C. Campbell, a valued member of the Granbury community who passed  away on March 30, 2021.   He served our country admirably in the U.S. Navy during the Korean  war aboard the USS Frank E. Evans. After coming home, he met and  married Sylvia, the love of his life, at North Texas State, and they  moved to Granbury in 1960 and have called it home ever since.   He has given much of himself to our community with positions on the  Granbury City Council, the volunteer fire department, the Granbury  Masonic Lodge, the Bluff Dale Lodge, and as president of the USS Frank  E. Evans Association, helping to tell the story of the ship he once  sailed aboard.   He was an incredible friend to students and staff and a regular  fixture at school board meetings. He was a mentor to many and known as  the community's biggest cheerleader.   Madam Speaker, I know his family and friends will miss him terribly,  and his loss will be felt deeply in Granbury and throughout the 11th  District.   Thank you for your service, J.C.                   Honoring the Lipan Girls Basketball Team     Madam Speaker, I rise to honor the Lipan girls  basketball team who recently won the AA State Championship in Texas.   To Coach Amber Branson and the entire team, congratulations on yet  another victory and yet another State championship.                            ____________________
