 Mr. Speaker, I rise today not just to support the NDAA  but some other provisions that are contained therein, one of which is  very important to this country, as well, and that is the Water  Resources Development Act of 2022, or WRDA, as we know it.   Continuing the bipartisan, biennial tradition, in May, WRDA 2022  passed the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee by a voice vote.  Later in June, it passed this Chamber with an overwhelming vote of 384- 37. Since then, of course, we have been working with our Senate  colleagues to finalize this very important piece of legislation.    WRDA came together with input from Members from all across the  country and is an example of what can happen when Congress works  together to find solutions for their constituents and the American  public.   This year's WRDA authorizes several Chief's reports, studies, and  environmental infrastructure projects. It brings focus and priority to  many important projects in my home State of North Carolina and  throughout the country to better protect our communities from flooding.   The legislation also supports fundamental Corps missions, such as  navigation and storm damage reduction,  [[Page H8844]]  which in turn support our economy and help keep the supply chain  moving, literally.   I am honored to have had the opportunity to help craft this important  bill, with critical input from my colleagues on both sides of the  aisle. I especially want to thank Chairman DeFazio and Chair  Napolitano, as well as Senate Environment and Public Works Committee  Chairman Carper and Ranking Member Capito, for their leadership and  work on this vital, very commonsense legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I  appreciate their doing so.
