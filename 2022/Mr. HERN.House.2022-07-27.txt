 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4040, which will  maintain seniors' access to telehealth, or what should be more  appropriately called virtual health.   In 2020, the Trump administration eliminated bureaucratic red tape so  seniors could access healthcare virtually from the comfort of their  homes. As a result, 52 million seniors sought their medical care  virtually in 2020.   I am proud to see my bill, the Protecting Mental Health Services Act,  included in this legislation to ensure seniors have virtual access to  mental health and substance abuse treatment. My bill ensures all  Oklahomans can access high-quality care, regardless of their physical  location.   While this legislation is a step forward, it is unfortunate that it  excludes employer-sponsored healthcare from the same low-cost access to  telehealth. It is critical to provide folks on the job with the ability  to seek flexible treatment, and I look forward to working with my  colleagues on both sides of the aisle to pass this provision at a later  date.
