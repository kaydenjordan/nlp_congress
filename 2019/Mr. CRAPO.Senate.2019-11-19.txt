 Madam President, I congratulate Jay Hildebrandt,  who is retiring after more than four decades in news reporting.   Jay has worked for KIFI's Local News 8 in Idaho Falls for the past 35  years. As an anchor for the weeknight news, Jay is known for his calm,  gentle demeanor and steady role delivering the news. Originally, from  Milwaukee, WI, Jay earned a degree in communications from Brigham Young  University. Before anchoring for our local news, he anchored in Twin  Falls and Fort Wayne, IN. Thankfully, he then returned to Idaho, where  we have been blessed with Jay's reliable, professional and  compassionate reporting all these years.   His positive influence can be felt throughout our community. Jay has  made a difference in many lives through his involvement in impactful  projects and community and statewide efforts. In addition to anchoring  the weeknight news, Jay produced the weekly ``Wednesday's Child''  reports for 28 years. Through this project, he has helped elevate the  stories of area children in need of adoptive homes. He also highlighted  the hard work of remarkable high school seniors in his ``Distinguished  Student'' series. Additionally, Jay has served as an adjunct instructor  at Brigham Young University Idaho and helped lead important efforts,  including his service on the Governor's Children's Trust Fund Board,  the Region VII Health and Welfare Advisory Board, and the Safe Place  Advisory Board.   While most of us enjoyed Jay over the years on the television, there  are those who have been able to work with him personally. And without  exception, he is admired, emulated and respected by his coworkers. One  of those fortunate individuals is my current chief of staff in DC,  Susan Hawkes Wheeler. She got her start just out of college  [[Page S6667]]  working for Jay at KIFI in the mid-1980s, when Jay was already becoming  the institution that he remains in Idaho broadcasting. His gentle  leadership and kind demeanor did much to stabilize a work place that  can be very chaotic as news develops, even in small town news stations.  He was a patient teacher, an insightful editor, and a delightful  storyteller, clearly evidenced by his enjoyment of some of the special  projects he undertook like the aforementioned ``Wednesday's Child.'' My  office benefits every day from lessons Susan learned through Jay's  leadership, and I am grateful for those.   In an article about his retirement, his co-anchor of 30 years, Karole  Honas, used the words ``solid,'' ``steady,'' ``kind,'' and ``positive''  to describe Jay. Professionalism, hard work, compassion, and optimism  are his hallmarks. Thank you, Jay, for your outstanding reporting all  these years and for working to highlight the needs and the great  achievements in our community. While your reassuring and thoughtful  presence on our local news will no doubt be deeply missed, the caring  standard you have set will be ever-present. Congratulations on your  exemplary career. I wish you well on your well-earned retirement. May  it be filled with many happy times with Sally, your children,  grandchildren, and friends.                            ____________________
