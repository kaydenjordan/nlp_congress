 Mr. Speaker, today I am here to recognize the career of  a colleague whose work has always been an inspiration, not just to me,  but to countless healthcare providers, students, advocates, and  patients alike, Dr. Deborah Frank.   Dr. Frank is a woman of many talents and passions. Notably, she has  served as a professor of pediatrics at Boston University School of  Medicine.   One of Dr. Frank's most impactful community contributions began in  1984, when she founded the Grow Clinic for Children at Boston Medical  Center. The Grow Clinic is an outpatient clinic that produces  comprehensive specialty medical, nutritional, developmental, social  services, and dietary assistance to children.   She is also the founder and principal investigator of Children's  Health Watch, the Grow Clinic's outreach and research arm, which is a  network of pediatric and public health researchers who, like Dr. Frank,  are committed to improving child health in America.   The Grow Clinic serves a diverse patient population of mostly low- income families from some of Greater Boston's poorest communities. But  what made the Grow Clinic an essential part of the community is not  just its dedication to the underserved and underprivileged; it was Dr.  Frank's commitment to gaining a deeper understanding about the social  determinants of her patients' health.   Her patients knew that they could go to her for their needs beyond  physical health. She cared about whether they had housing or warm  clothing. She cared about whether they had healthy and nutritious food  to eat and whether they were getting enough of it. She even started a  food pantry at Boston Medical Center to address her patients' needs.   Dr. Frank knew that there is more to health than metrics and vitals.  It is also your environment and support system. Part of what makes Dr.  Frank's legacy remarkable is that she found a way to become part of  that support system.   She came into this line of work with a vision and purpose and, in the  process, has changed countless lives in Massachusetts and beyond.   Dr. Frank has testified many times before Congress on numerous  occasions, raising awareness on the growing problem of national hunger  and its effects on children. She has literally spoken truth to power.  Her work will continue to shape the way that healthcare professionals  and policymakers understand the correlation between children's  nutrition and health.   Whether she is teaching medical students about ``failure to thrive,''  making sure her patients have food, or advocating against the  criminalization and stigmatization of addicted mothers, Dr. Frank is a  true fighter.   She may say she retired, but, honestly, I don't believe it. Her  life's work of enriching the health and well-being of those around her  will not only continue through the organizations that she has worked in  her entire life and her entire career, but also through the lives of  the children and the families for whom she has advocated. I am sure  that she will continue to stand up for what she believes in, and I  thank her for her service to her community and to our country.   Finally, I also thank her for her friendship. She is one of my  heroes. She is an inspiration to me and to so many other people, and  she is a believer that we can change the world. With her leadership and  her inspiration, I believe we can do great things like end hunger in  this country once and for all.   So, Mr. Speaker, I want to say to Dr. Frank, on behalf of all my  colleagues, thank you for the incredible work that you have done, and  we look forward to continuing to work with you and to be guided by your  values and your passion.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I speak today for Raif Badawi, a Saudi  Arabian human rights blogger unjustly imprisoned since 2012 for  exercising his right to freedom of expression.   His supposed crime?   Criticizing Islam and the religious police.   His sentence?   Ten years in prison, 1,000 lashes, and a huge fine.   Monday, January 13, was Raif's 36th birthday--the eighth he spent in  prison away from his wife and three children.   January 9 was the fifth anniversary of the day that Raif endured the  first 50 of those 1,000 lashes. That the flogging has not continued is  a small mercy, but the prolonged imprisonment and harsh conditions is  taking a terrible physical and mental toll.   The Saudi authorities must end this egregious injustice.   Madam Speaker, I again demand the immediate and unconditional release  of prisoner of conscience, Raif Badawi.   I renew my call for a halt to all weapons sales and military aid  until the Saudi regime cleans up its human rights record which is  appalling.                            ____________________
