 Mr. President, it is my honor to represent the State of  Illinois and the city of Chicago. I cannot tell you how many times  Members of the Senate and the House in the other party have gone to the  microphones to condemn the city of Chicago and its crime rate.   Let me tell you point-blank, there is too much crime in the city of  Chicago, but it is not the only city in America that suffers from that  problem. Cities large and small have problems every single day with  violent gun crime. My hometown of East St. Louis is a tiny little town  of 20,000, 25,000 in comparison to the large metropolis of Chicago. Yet  the rate of gun violence there is even higher in East St. Louis than it  is in Chicago.   We have to do everything we can to deal with it. Let me tell you what  ``everything we can'' means. It means we have to look at the flood of  guns coming into these cities from out of State, primarily, without  background checks, that are getting into the hands of criminals, who  are turning around and killing innocent people. To ignore this flood of  guns in the United States of America and condemn crime is to basically  take a position that you are not going to look at reality. And that is  what we are faced with.   We have to have a sensible policy when it comes to background checks,  universal background checks, to make sure guns are not ending up in the  hands of people who will misuse them. When they confiscate thousands of  guns every year, which they do in Chicago, they find that they come  from the surrounding States, which have lax laws, if any, when it comes  to checking the background of purchasers. That is a critical element.  If you raise that issue on the floor of the U.S. Senate, you will have  the whole side of the aisle--the other side--coming here and waving  their arms about Second Amendment rights.   I want to tell you, we need common sense when it comes to guns and  gun safety. I want that to be part of the conversation on making our  cities safer.   The second thing I want to really raise is personal to the Senate. If  you want to stop crime in the streets of Chicago or any city--Cleveland  or Chicago, for example--one of the first things you need is a  competent, aggressive criminal prosecutor, a person known as a U.S.  attorney who works as part of the 85 U.S. attorneys across the United  States enforcing the strong Federal laws we have enacted.   So why don't we have a U.S. attorney in the city of Chicago? Why  don't we have a U.S. attorney in the city of Cleveland? Because of the  objections of one Republican Senator who has come to the floor over and  over again to stop these appointments from taking place. The nominees  have been cleared. They have gone through background checks. Both  sides, Democrats and Republicans, have approved them. They are sitting  on the calendar, and they cannot move because one Senator from the  State of Ohio, a Republican Senator, refuses to lift his hold and give  us a chance to vote on them.    So you can give all the speeches you want on the floor of the U.S.  Senate from every Member on the other side about how we have to end  crime in the city of Chicago, but do me a favor. Speak to this one  Senator and convince him that a competent, aggressive criminal  prosecutor as U.S. attorney in the city of Chicago is one step toward  that goal. To ignore that and to let him hold up this nominee is just  unfathomable and inexcusable.                            ____________________     Mr. President, another point I would like to make is that  over the weekend, we managed to avoid a government shutdown with a 45- day extension, a bipartisan continuing resolution. Keeping the lights  on is a win for the American people. It used to be considered just  normal procedure around here. Now it is a reason for celebration and  victory because we have such a discordant and dissident group heading  up Congress on both sides of the Rotunda.   I am disappointed that, unfortunately, the continuing resolution did  not include critical funding for the war in Ukraine. It is impossible  to explain to my constituency why, when the Ukrainians are in the midst  of fighting and dying every single day for their nation against the war  criminal Vladimir Putin, this Congress somehow or another managed to  pass a spending bill for 45 days and not include more funding for the  Ukrainian cause. This assistance is absolutely essential to make sure  we stop the aggression of Russia against this tiny country.   A small group of isolationists and Russian sympathizers--largely MAGA  extremists in the House--threatened to hold the entire country, the  United States, hostage over this funding despite the overwhelming  bipartisan support for Ukraine. Ronald Reagan and John McCain must be  turning over in their graves.   I am glad that after the vote on Saturday, Senators Schumer,  McConnell, Murray, Collins, Coons, and Graham released a joint,  bipartisan statement reaffirming the Senate's commitment to supporting  Ukraine and addressing the funding in the weeks ahead. I couldn't agree  more.   Let's keep this in perspective. The American people have been  generous to Ukraine, but this critical assistance that has halted and  reversed Russian aggression accounts for only about one-half of 1  percent of all the Federal spending in our country. So for a modest  investment by U.S. standards, we are keeping hope and freedom alive in  Ukraine while they are offering their lives. Our European allies have  stepped up and provided even more assistance than the United States,  and I am glad they have. It is a joint effort.   Quite simply, Putin is willing to keep sending Russian conscripts to  their death in the hopes that we in the democratic transatlantic  alliance will get tired of his war of tyranny. I hope we never do.   Putin is counting on the West, NATO, the United States to grow weary  of his Ukrainian war of attrition. We cannot let him prevail by this  approach. We have to be organized and unified in our effort.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on a separate issue, I would like to  address the announced retirement of U.S. GEN Mark Milley.   On January 17, 1961, 3 days before he was to leave office, President  Dwight Eisenhower addressed the American people. His political farewell  to the Nation surprised a lot of people. They expected him to give the  ``old soldier's speech,'' like Douglas McArthur. Instead, Eisenhower  surprised many by  [[Page S4904]]  issuing a strong warning about the dangers of the ``military-industrial  complex.'' He described that complex as a ``conjunction of an immense  military establishment and a large arms industry'' and ``[w]e must not  fail to comprehend its grave implications'' of that alliance.   His words were a warning to his successors of one of the many dangers  they could face in the coming years. The words are often quoted because  they were so surprising.   I thought of President Eisenhower's warning just last Friday when I  heard the parting words of another military leader who served our  Nation with wisdom, courage, and unwavering devotion--GEN Mark Milley,  former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. In his farewell address,  General Milley spoke of those in uniform who have died defending our  freedoms, of the many who have shed blood and sacrificed limbs in that  cause, and of brokenhearted Gold Star families who have lost loved  ones.   Then he said that the U.S. military exists for one purpose, in his  words: ``to defend democracy.'' ``Our military,'' he said, ``is unique  among the world's militaries.'' Why? Because, in General Milley's  powerful words, ``We don't take an oath to a country. We don't take an  oath to a tribe . . . to a religion . . . to a king, or queen, or a  tyrant or a dictator. And we don't take an oath to a wannabe  dictator.'' We take an oath, he said, to the Constitution, to the  ideas, ideals, and values of democracy. That, he said, is our ``moral  North Star.''   Obviously, General Milley has a sense of history. He realizes that  despite the strength of our military, the real strength of America is  written in the Constitution, which we have all sworn to uphold. He rose  to the occasion time and again, particularly under former President  Donald Trump.   I had private conversations with him over the years. The question I  had to ask him was very carefully scripted. I said to him: If you were  given a choice between Commander in Chief or the Constitution, which  one prevails? He said: That is simple--the Constitution. That was the  North Star he lived by as general of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.   He served our Nation in uniform for 43 years. He was a combat  infantryman and Green Beret. General Milley served 5 years in combat  zones, including Iraq and Afghanistan. He knows the meaning of service  and sacrifice, and he knows the value of offering your life for this  country and its Constitution.   He was appointed Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff by former  President Trump and continued in the post under President Biden. His  four years as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff were some of the  most tumultuous in recent history. They included many successes. They  included helping Ukraine to defend against Russia's illegal invasion  and helping to unite NATO. The NATO alliance has never been stronger.  And we can thank President Biden, but also General Milley and all those  in uniform who made that possible on our side of the Atlantic.   We need to make sure that that security alliance is stronger in the  years to come to stop war criminals like Vladimir Putin. There were  also grave dangers, including an armed insurrection against the  government of the United States right here in this Chamber, under  General Milley's watch.   I know he measured carefully exactly what response we could bring to  the occasion; that insurrection mob was a total surprise to so many.  But his greatest test may have been containing the impulses of a former  President who didn't understand the role of the military--and I have to  offer, I don't think he basically understands the Constitution--a  President who reportedly wanted to use troops, American soldiers, to  suppress legitimate demonstrations by the public, exercises of their  right to speech, and who prized loyalty to himself over loyalty to our  Constitution. That was the force General Milley was up against.   In recent days, that former President has told his followers that in  times past, General Milley's actions would have resulted in execution.  Can you imagine he said that, former President Trump said that of  General Milley? Once again, a thinly veiled exhortation to political  violence from the former President.   As members of this Senate, we take an oath to protect and defend not  a party or a President, but the ideals and values of our Constitution.  May we all honor that oath with the same dignity, courage, and strength  of character as General Milley. And my parting word is gratitude to his  family, to his wife Hollyanne, his son Peter, and daughter Mary. I  thank the family. How many sleepless nights must have been a part of  that household, wondering if the father and the husband would come home  safely. Well, he did, and thank God he did, because he brought America  home with him. He deserves some time off. He said he is going to try to  get some rest. But I am sure he is going to be in demand. A man of his  character and reputation deserves it.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________     I announce that the Senator from Pennsylvania (Mr.  Fetterman), the Senator from Washington (Mrs. Murray), and the Senator  from Michigan (Mrs. Stabenow) are necessarily absent.
