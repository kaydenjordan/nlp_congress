 Madam President, it is a pleasure tonight to be making the  case for Janet Yellen, former Chair of the Federal Reserve, to be the  next Secretary of the Treasury. It is an awfully easy case to make.   Chair Janet Yellen deserves to be in the Senate confirmation hall of  fame. She has already been confirmed four times for key economic  positions. Tonight, the Senate can deliver an especially important  economic judgment: Confirm Janet Yellen a fifth time and know that she  will work with every single one of us to get our workers, our small  businesses, and all Americans, from sea to shining sea, back on solid  economic footing.   Tonight, I am going to spend just a few minutes discussing several  important matters we learned from Chair Yellen's confirmation hearing.  First, Chair Yellen is an exceptional economist who has a rare gift.  She can take complicated economic theories and put them into  understandable language, all while showing a real heart for the  millions of Americans who are hurting through no fault of their own.   I asked Chair Yellen at her confirmation hearing: What will give  Americans the most bang for the economic recovery buck? And Chair  Yellen simply walked through the priorities, particularly going to bat  for our small businesses. I come from a State where we have only a  handful of big businesses. We are an overwhelmingly small business  State. At her confirmation hearing, she spoke clearly about those small  business needs, and she talked about the concerns she has for  innovative and important approaches to expanding unemployment benefits  to make sure that we are meeting the needs of our people. She also  focused on reducing hunger and approaches that will help stretch anti- hunger dollars   Second, Chair Yellen knows that it would be a big mistake for the  Congress to go small on economic relief. She is acutely aware of what  happened in 2009, when the government took its foot off the economic  gas pedal too  [[Page S120]]  soon, and recovery was compromised as a result. She also understands  that emergency economic relief, like unemployment compensation, needs  to last as long as the emergency. It cannot be tied to arbitrary  expiration dates, where potential political agendas come before human  needs. There is a reason why the Finance Committee approved her  nomination unanimously on Friday morning. I touched on some of those  factors, and I am going to amplify a little bit.   For example, nobody deserves more credit than Chair Yellen for the  longest economic expansion in American history. It lasted until the  pandemic hit. As Federal Reserve Chair, she led an important change to  the status quo in economic policy. Previously, there had been too great  a focus on inflation and deficit. Chair Yellen said: Let's zero in more  on unemployment, income, and inequality, and she believed that the  economy could run a bit hotter. The record shows that the Yellen  approach was right on. Unemployment went down, wages went up, and a lot  of people were better off than they were before. That is exactly the  kind of thinking America needs again because confronting the COVID  economy is hammering working families, in particular. Again, another  clear reason why Janet Yellen is the right pick to be the next Treasury  Secretary.   The most recent economic data shows that 1.4 million people  nationwide had filed new claims for unemployment benefits in the last  full week of the previous administration. So it is not hard to figure  out what that means. It is an economic catastrophe. It is more than  twice the highest figure from any single week in the great recession.  That means 1.4 million people--so, so many working families--are  suddenly walking on an economic tightrope every single day, balancing  the food cost against the fuel cost, the fuel cost against the rent  bill, worried about finding a new job, getting a badly needed shift at  work, falling behind on rent or the mortgage, feeding their kids,  paying the electric bill, paying medical bills--worried that the  economy is headed in reverse and worried about whether the Congress  will be gridlocked.   The country lost 140,000 jobs last month. My home State lost more  than 25,000, in part because the Senate, in something that just defied  common sense, waited around for the recovery to peter out before  passing any more relief. Thousands and thousands of neighborhood  restaurants and bars and mom-and-pop businesses have been shuttered.  Nearly 11 million workers are out of a job. Another 4 million Americans  have fallen out of the labor force entirely since this time last year.  Unless the Congress acts boldly and quickly with more relief, the  damage from the COVID economic crash will long outlast the pandemic  itself. That must not be allowed to happen.   The key, of course, is for the Senate to get down to work, and one of  the best ways you can do it is to confirm someone who is eminently  qualified, Chair Janet Yellen, to be Treasury Secretary.   As I touched on, we are looking at working with her on a host of key  economic issues. As I have said as the new chair of the Finance  Committee, my first priority will be to make sure that this Congress  does not commit again the mistake of 2009.   In 2009, the sense was, well, maybe we are getting there on economic  recovery. We will be able to come back later if maybe we didn't do  enough. Well, we all know that a missed opportunity is a missed  opportunity, and, in 2009, the Congress said, All right. We can take  our foot off the gas now. It was too early, and there wasn't any next  effort to make up for the damage. I am committed to making sure that  doesn't happen again. Suffice it to say, it took 7\1/2\ years for the  unemployment rate in Oregon to return to its prerecession levels.   This time around, the Congress has been warned. The warning I am  giving about making sure that Congress doesn't take its foot off the  economic relief pedal too soon is not the first warning. Chair Powell,  for example, made it clear that the biggest danger lies in not doing  enough.   Increasing relief checks to $2,000 is key. The Congress needs to  increase and extend unemployment benefits for the entirety of the COVID  crisis, and you do that by, in effect, tying the benefits to the real  world, to economic conditions on the ground. That has been my proposal  for some time. Other colleagues have long advanced similar ideas. It is  not a revolutionary proposition to say that emergency relief should  last as long as the emergency. Simply stated. And it should not be held  hostage by the arbitrary political agendas of Members of Congress.   If you don't do it, dysfunction and gridlock in Congress creates  still more havoc for people who have done nothing wrong and just need  help. A decade ago, that help went away too quickly because benefits  expired arbitrarily, and Congress did not keep up with extensions. The  Congress needs to do better, and I believe that should include  important upgrades as well to unemployment insurance, which was created  in the last century. I don't think it is too much to say we at least  bring this critical safety net program into the relevant century.   Now, sometimes these programs look a little rusty in the modern  economy. Sometimes it is because of outright sabotage. But workers  suffer, particularly Black and Hispanic workers. So there are steps  that need to be taken, in addition to modernizing the benefits,  increasing base benefits, bringing all workers into the system, and  ensuring it can hold up in a crisis.   Finally, Chair Yellen had some important comments on fixing America's  broken Tax Code. I will tell you, Madam President, I start with the  proposition that a nurse who is treating COVID patients and paying  taxes with every single paycheck should not find themselves in a  disadvantaged position when compared to billionaires who, in effect, do  no such thing and can postpone and postpone and postpone paying their  taxes.   Now, there is a lot of work we need to do to repair the 2017 bill.  The previous administration actually increased the incentives for  corporations to ship jobs overseas. I want to fix that mistake. I want  to work with Secretary Yellen on energy policy because so much of it  deals with the Tax Code.   Suffice it to say, those are just some of the challenges Chair Yellen  will face when, I believe, she is confirmed tonight as Treasury  Secretary. She is supremely qualified--a member, in my view, of the  Senate Confirmation hall of fame--and a proven economic policymaker.   Finally, I say to my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, it is  long past time to have a woman lead the U.S. Treasury Department. Chair  Yellen has my full support.   As colleagues come for this vote--and it is a significant economic  policy vote, make no mistake about that--I would just ask my colleagues  to reflect on the fact that Chair Yellen was approved by the Finance  Committee 26 to nothing. Sometimes I say about this place--I have  questions about whether you can get a simple decision like ordering a  sandwich decided on a 26-to-nothing. She was approved unanimously  because she gives public service a good name.   I urge my colleagues to support Janet Yellen for Secretary of the  Treasury when we vote in just a few minutes.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I have a request for one committee to meet  during today's session of the Senate. It has the approval of the  Majority and Minority leaders.   Pursuant to rule XXVI, paragraph 5(a), of the Standing Rules of the  Senate, the following committee is authorized to meet during today's  session of the Senate:  [[Page S131]]                             Committee on Foreign Relations    The Committee on Foreign Relations is authorized to meet during the  session of the Senate on Monday, January 25, 2021, at 6 p.m., to  conduct a closed hearing.                            ____________________
