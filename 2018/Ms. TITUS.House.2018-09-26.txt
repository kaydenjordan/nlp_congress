 Mr. Speaker, I am proud to stand with my colleagues on the  Transportation and Infrastructure Committee today in support of this  bill, which is the result of a lot of hard work over many years and  includes a number of important wins for my constituents in Nevada and  for users of our aviation system all around the world.   As chair of the House Travel and Tourism Caucus, I am happy to see  provisions to improve our airport infrastructure; protect air  travelers; and support our pilots, flight attendants, and aviation  professionals. In addition, I am glad the bill includes an important  extension of the work being done at the Nevada UAS Test Site, which  will allow critical research being carried out with NASA and FAA to  advance low-altitude air traffic management vital to the success of the  commercial drone industry.   As ranking member of the Economic Development Subcommittee, I am also  pleased to report that the bill includes the Bipartisan Disaster  Recovery and Reform Act. These critical reforms will help communities  become more resilient and better prepared to deal with the impacts of  global climate change.   With our neighbors in the Carolinas reeling from the impacts of  Hurricane Florence, our fellow citizens in Puerto Rico and the Virgin  Islands still rebuilding from last year's devastating hurricanes, and  numerous communities in the West facing wildfires, this can't come soon  enough.
