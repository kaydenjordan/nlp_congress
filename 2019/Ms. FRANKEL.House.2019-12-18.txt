 Madam Speaker, in 1787, at the conclusion of the  Constitutional Convention, Benjamin Franklin was asked: Do we have a  republic or a monarchy?   He responded: ``A republic, if you can keep it.''   Madam Speaker, a republic is a form of government in which the  country is considered a public matter, not the private concern or  property of the rulers.                                time  1445    In a republic, no person is above the law. In a republic, the  President may not abuse his power by withholding critical foreign  assistance for his own personal political gain nor may he stop  witnesses from talking.   I did not come to Congress to impeach a President, but I did take an  oath to keep the Republic. For our children and our grandchildren, we  should do nothing less. One day, I will tell my grandson that I stood  up for our democracy.   I will vote ``yes'' to impeach the President.
