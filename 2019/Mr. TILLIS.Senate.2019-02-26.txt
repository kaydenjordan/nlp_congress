 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Well, ladies and gentlemen, yesterday I took a position  that I think some people consider to be unpopular--particularly some of  my friends back in my State--that I thought I would come back and  explain. It has to do with the President's Executive action. It also  has to do with communicating an important and somber subject.   There is a crisis at the border. I have been there. I didn't read  about it. I didn't watch it on TV. I didn't read a tweet about it. I  invested time down  [[Page S1463]]  there, hours and hours with border security. I was on shallow draft  boats. I was on horseback. I have been on ATVs. I spent a lot of time  down at the border, and the one thing I will tell you is that the  President is absolutely right. There is a crisis on the border--and not  only on the southern border, but I will state that ranchers on the  northern border also believe they have challenges that this President  is right to address.   I also happen to agree with a good portion of how the President is  going to do it after Congress failed to do its job. Keep in mind that  over the last year, we have had on this floor Democrats and Republicans  voting for as much as $25 billion for border security--Democrats and  Republicans--and now we are fighting over a fraction of that.   The President needs to act. He got an appropriation of about $1.5  billion through the negotiated settlement a couple of weeks ago, and  now he is taking the only action he can until Congress acts, and that  is to figure out other sources of funding that he believes he can use  within current statutory limits. The way he has done that is he has  first taken the $1.3 billion that Congress did appropriate. He has  another $2.5 billion and another $600 million that I believe he is  right to reprogram, send to the southern border, and probably make some  investment in the northern border.   Here is where I have a respectful difference of opinion with the  President and the administration: It is the emergency order, that under  the emergency powers act, he is using his authority to appropriate the  remaining funds.   First off, those funds will come what we call the MILCON budget. That  is military construction. Right now, we are trying to find out what  that means--which projects we think are critical to help the readiness  of our soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines; which investments that we  were going to make, that we have already determined we should make in  military construction, are going to be put on hold while we reprogram  those dollars to go to the southern border.   The real problem I have is that this is only a fraction of what we  all know we need to secure the border.   I want to go back to the humanitarian crisis, though. My wife and I  had an interesting discussion the other night. She wasn't too happy  when I took this position originally. I am still not sure if she is  happy.   But to understand why I respectfully disagree with the President, you  have to understand, again, as I started this discussion, that there is  a crisis. There are people dying. There are millions of doses of poison  coming across the border every single year that are killing tens of  thousands of people. That is a crisis. There are thousands of people  crossing the border and dying. They have what they call coyotes, human  traffickers who will get them across the border, get people who will  pay thousands of dollars to cross the border, and then they will say:  Civilization is just an hour away.   It is an hour plane ride away. Most people don't understand the sheer  size and scale of Texas, particularly those crossing the border in the  dead of night, working with basically organized crime. You have to pay  a toll to get through the so-called plazas that run the northern border  of Mexico.   My problem right now has to do with an Executive order, the emergency  declaration that the President intends to send to Congress.   My wife and I were having a discussion. She said: You just said you  agree with the President that there is a crisis on the border; you  agree with the President that we need to send resources down to the  southern border and work on the northern border; you agree that  Congress has failed to act; and you agree that if you were President,  you would do exactly what he is doing.   I said yes.   She said: Why don't you support it?   I said: Because I am not the President. I am a Member of the U.S.  Senate. I am a Member of a coequal branch who actually believes that  this action falls within our purview. Now we are going to find out  because I am sure we are going to be challenged in the courts. But I  also worry not so much about this one--frankly, even the way this money  is going to be programmed, I agree with. What I worry about are future  Presidents and what they may do if we set this precedent going into the  future.   We actually have a Democratic candidate running for President--this  is one hypothetical. There have been some far-flung ones that I am not  sure I completely agree with, but let me give this one. It relates to  border security. We have someone who is a Member of this body who has  publicly said that their priority, if they were elected to be  President, would be to tear down borders, tear down walls, build  bridges, and open the borders. Well, if you argue that there is a  humanitarian crisis--and I have said there is already is one--what  would prevent that President from issuing an Executive order that would  divert military construction funding to tear down the walls that are  going to be built now? If we give this President--a President I support  and a President whose policies and priorities I agree with--that  authority, that could be aiding and abetting a future President and  empowering them beyond what I believe their authorities are, vested in  the Constitution in article II.   So I have come here today in part to maybe take another stab at  explaining to my wife why I have taken this position but also to  explain to the American people and folks in North Carolina and across  this country. I agree with the President. I know we have a crisis we  have to take care of. We have a national security crisis, a homeland  security crisis, and a humanitarian crisis. It is not the end; it is a  portion of the means.   I applaud the President for taking the action up here and getting  things going. I hope that over time, we can find a way to fully fund  the border strategy on a bipartisan basis and also address other  immigration issues that I believe are pressing for this Nation.   Madam President, thank you for allowing me to come to the floor and  explain my position.   If anybody in North Carolina has any questions, I know they know how  to get ahold of me because my phones are blowing up right now. But I do  want to explain it to them in a way that makes sense. I am a steward of  the U.S. Senate. I am a steward of the article I branch. That matters  to me.   Thank you, Madam President.
