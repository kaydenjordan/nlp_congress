 Mr. President, will my colleague from Texas yield for a  request, just a request. I would like to borrow his chart.    OK. My colleague, I would yield to you. I have the  floor.   Do you mind if I borrow your chart? Great. Thank you.   Now, my good colleague from Texas says 94 percent of voters said  voting was easy in 2020. So why don't we keep it that way?   Isn't it true that all of the changes that we are arguing about are  post-2020, and is it an overwhelming likelihood that this number, if  these changes are allowed to go into effect, will go way down? So, yes,  we agree. Keep the 2020 laws. Maybe we should improve them. Right now,  what we are combating is a series of legislatures--19--and 33 laws that  will make this number surely go down because it makes voting less hard.  So we agree that 2020 worked out OK. I guess my friend is saying the  Big Lie is false because Donald Trump said it was fraudulent, the  election results.   I would thank my colleague for his chart and will be using it again.    I sure would.    There is a long list of them, which I have listed in my  speeches. Let me just give one or two: one, making early voting places  and dropoff voting places many fewer; No. 2, in the largest county-- Democratic county, African-American county--in Georgia, taking away the  bipartisan ability to collect those votes; No. 3, in Georgia, making it  a crime that, if you are standing in line, you can't be fed, and the  lines, by the way, according to the reports I get, are much longer in  African-American communities than in White suburban communities, making  it much, much harder--making it a crime, rather--to give people water  or a sandwich.   So I am going to now give my remarks, but I thank my colleague for  the question, and I am going to take the floor.    The last question, yes.    If the Senator would yield, as long as there is no  fraud, if a person in a nursing home can't get to the polling place and  wants to vote and someone collects their ballot, there is nothing wrong  with that. In fact, that is good. That makes it easier for them to  vote.   With all of these things that they bring up, there has been no  evidence of fraud--none. Donald Trump has not produced any evidence of  fraud. He lost by 7 million votes. Yet he is saying he won the  election.   We all know what is motivating our colleagues on the other side of  the aisle--obeisance to Donald Trump. I would guess most of them know  that the election was not stolen, that the Big Lie doesn't take effect,  but Trump has such power over the Republican Party--such power--that  they do what he wants in the legislatures and here in the Senate.  [[Page S129]]    I would remind my good friend from Texas that his fellow Texans  George H. W. Bush and George W. Bush proudly supported an extension of  the Voting Rights Act. They proudly did that. It was bipartisan until  Donald Trump came over and, in my opinion, poisoned the Republican  Party on voting rights. We could use a little resistance to Donald  Trump. We see it from a good number of Republicans out in the country,  and we see it from a good number of Republican commentators, but we  don't see it here in the Senate, and that is unfortunate.    I am not going to yield for a further question.   Mr. President, as I begin my remarks, let me begin with the following  figure--and we will have a debate later.    Mr. President, let me begin with the following figure:  55 million people; that is the estimated number of eligible voters who  now live within States that have passed legislation restricting the  right to vote and potentially undermining the electoral process.   Today, President Biden will travel to one such State, Georgia--home  to one of the most egregious voter suppression and election subversion  laws we have seen in a long time. I believe the President will give a  strong speech and will urge that we in the Senate change the rules so  that we can prevent these awful and nasty laws from being implemented.  In an address to the Nation, he will use the bully pulpit of the  Presidency to make the case that the time has come for the Senate to  pass voting rights legislation and take whatever steps necessary to  address this Chamber's rules in order to accomplish that goal.   The Senate is going to act as soon as tomorrow. It is my intention  to, once again, bring legislation to the floor to fight back against  the threats to democracy and protect people's access to the ballot.   Once again, I urge my Republican colleagues to take up the flag of  the traditional Republican Party, not only of Lincoln but of Reagan and  H. W. Bush and W. Bush and vote yes to move forward so we can have a  debate like the debate we just had or the discussion we just had. But  if Republicans continue to hijack the rules of the Senate to prevent  voting rights from happening, if they continue paralyzing this Chamber  to the point where we are helpless to fight back against the Big Lie,  we must consider the necessary steps we can take so the Senate can  adapt and act.   For the past few months, Senate Democrats have been holding talks  within our caucus to discern how we can best move forward to restore  the function of the Senate and, more importantly, pass legislation to  defend democracy and protect voting rights. Last night, I held another  round of talks with a number of my colleagues about the path forward,  and we did so again this morning.   Over the past few days, our Republican colleagues have escalated  their attacks against our efforts to pass voting rights legislation.   Listen to this one: Last night, the Republican leader worked to place  a number of ``gotcha'' bills onto the legislative calendar as some sort  of payback for pursuing legislation to protect the sacred right to  vote. He was basically saying: Here are 18 bills that Democrats don't  like. Let's go for 50 votes on those. Well, I proposed to the  Republican leader, in a unanimous consent request, that it would be  perfectly fine with us taking votes on his bills on a simple majority  threshold if, in exchange, he agreed to do the same for the Freedom to  Vote Act and the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act. Of  course, the Republican leader immediately objected--immediately  objected--to having all of them done with 50 votes: the 18 bills he  proposed and our 2 voting rights bills.   The Republican leader made clear last night that the true worry on  the other side isn't about the rules of the Senate--rules they were  perfectly happy to change to pursue their own objectives when they were  in the majority. Republicans, in truth, are afraid of the possibility  that legislation to defend democracy, to fight the power of dark money,  and to protect voting rights could move forward in this Chamber.   As I mentioned to my colleague from Texas, that is not all  Republicans. That is not Republicans out in the country--a lot of them  want to protect voting rights--but it is the Republican Party as now  run by, and it is fair to say run by Donald Trump, who has propagated  the Big Lie that the election was stolen and that he really won, even  though he lost by 7 million votes and even though he has no evidence-- nor have the commentators to that effect. Now we have at least  Republicans in the Senate and the House and in lots of State  legislatures completely going along with this Big Lie.   The danger there is that it jaundices our democracy. If people of  color, if young people, if older people, if people in urban areas feel  that their right to vote is being diminished compared to other  people's--because they are not aiming this at everybody--democracy  begins to wither. We have not seen an assault on voting rights since  the days of the Old South, since the forties and fifties and sixties  and seventies. Why would we want to regress? Why would we want to  regress? So we must fight back.   Now, I understand our Republicans are going to continue their  opposition through a flurry of speeches, decrying any effort  by Democrats to undo these voter suppression laws and make it easier  for Americans to vote.    By the way, I would remind my colleagues that this has been the grand  tradition of America. When the Constitution was written, in most  States, you had to be a White male Protestant property owner to vote.  No one says let's go back to those days. In general, America, with our  march to freedom and our march to equality, embodied in our  Constitution and in the great minds of the Founding Fathers--the  greatest group of geniuses ever assembled--has marched forward. There  have been regressions, but we have marched forward. We Democrats want  to continue that march. We want to stop these types of laws.   The Republican leader doesn't have much to say so he has latched onto  a talking point. He said the Big Lie is actually the warnings of voter  suppression that come from Democrats, even though there are so many  laws that are, obviously, done to suppress votes, and a lot of these  Republican legislators say it openly.   So I would say to the Republican leader that his attempts to  misdirect from the danger of Donald Trump's Big Lie and to try to say  it is Democrats who are doing it is gaslighting, pure and simple. There  is no evidence--no evidence.   The leader did it again yesterday and today on the floor, implying  one more time that because the 2020 election was, indeed, successful,  somehow voter suppression doesn't exist. Now, I answered my friend from  Texas when he held up that chart. The Republican leader cherry-picked  examples to distract from the real, unmistakable changes that are  taking place in the States.   I would ask the Republican leader and the Republican Senator from  Texas and every other Republican, if the 2020 election were as  successful and secure and safe as he says it was, then why have  Republican State legislators rushed to make it harder for people to  vote in the aftermath of the 2020 election? Why can any Republican  cling to the view that the election was stolen--Donald Trump's Big  Lie--when John Cornyn, my friend from Texas, is up there, with a chart,  saying the 2020 election was successful, and the Republican leader said  the same thing?   Doesn't that rebut Donald Trump? Doesn't that rebut those who came to  the Capitol, motivated by Donald Trump's propagation of the Big Lie?  Doesn't it rebut all of the State legislators who want to make it  harder to vote if the 2020 election were successful?   Despite the Republican leader's best efforts, I have yet to hear from  my Republican colleagues as to why it is OK for States like Georgia to  make it a crime to give food and water to people who are waiting on  line at the polls when we hear that, in minority areas and in urban  areas, the lines are much longer than in rural areas.   I have yet to hear from Republicans why States like Texas and Arizona  have made it a felony--a felony--for nonpartisan election workers to  send  [[Page S130]]  unsolicited mail ballot applications to voters. What is wrong with  sending that? What is wrong with encouraging people to vote? The  participation in elections is much higher in many Western countries  than in ours.   Again, Texas didn't just prohibit nonpartisan election workers from  sending mail ballots out to voters. They made it a felony--a felony.  These States have effectively made it a crime--a crime--for election  workers to proactively help people to vote. Where is the justification?   Where is the evidence of this massive fraud that Donald Trump talks  about? No one gives any. Yet they predicate their policy moves here in  the Senate on that.   To date, I have heard no explanation from the other side why States  like Texas, Iowa, and Montana have reduced polling locations and hours.  In Iowa, early voting of any kind has been cut by 9 days. How does that  make the election more secure? Why is that in the grand tradition of  making it easier for Americans to vote?   In Georgia, according to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, the  leading newspaper of Atlanta, the number of absentee drop boxes in four  large counties in Atlanta, in the Atlanta area, will drop from 111 to  23--111 to 23. One of the justifications is that these boxes are no  longer helpful, but this ignores the fact that over 300,000 voters used  them in the last election--the last successful election, according to  my friend from Texas. Republicans know that most of the people who used  those drop boxes, of course, were Democrats. They tend to use them  more, and that is why they are cutting them off.   The examples go on and on, unfortunately. This is not just a one-off  or in one State or another. This is a massive campaign, which, if we do  nothing, will continue and get worse.   States like Texas, Florida, Kansas, Iowa, New Hampshire, and Montana  have passed laws making it harder--harder--to register to vote.   States like Alabama, Iowa, and Texas have passed laws that increase  the potential for people with disabilities.   And, again, in Georgia, one rural county, Lincoln County, is trying  to limit their polling places to just one in the whole county--just one  place to vote for an entire county--causing people to potentially drive  as many as 23 miles to cast a ballot. This wouldn't make voting easier.  It turns it into a burden.   The truth is, our Republicans can't defend these laws. They are not  going to mention them here today. Let's hear some Republicans defend  these laws and point to evidence of the massive fraud that they say  motivates them to do it. It is bunk--bunk.   The policies they have put forward have one purpose--one purpose  only: making it harder for younger, poorer, non-White, and typically  Democratic voters to access the ballot, to give Republicans a partisan  advantage at the polls by making it harder for democratic-leaning  voters to vote.   Again, in a democracy, when you lose an election, you figure out why  and try to win over the voters you lost. You don't stop the voters you  lost from voting. That is what happens in autocracies, in places like  Hungary, where Donald Trump just endorsed Orban, who is whittling away  at democracy in Hungary.   It is cynical--cynical--for our Republican colleagues to argue that  just because these voter suppression laws don't spell their intentions  out in the open, that there is nothing sinister at play. But these laws  have real impact, potentially divisive.   In Arizona, Mr. President, your State, the secretary of state has  concluded that new laws could purge as many as 200,000 voters from  their early voting list. And as you know better than me, Arizona has a  long tradition of early and mail-in voting that, I think, was set up by  Republicans, if I am not wrong.   In Georgia, over 1.3 million voters used absentee ballots in the last  election, which could now be affected by the restriction.   Senate Democrats in Iowa argue that if today's voter suppression laws  had been in effect in 2020, over 6,500 absentee ballots would not have  been counted in the last election.   This isn't all that difficult to comprehend. When you pass laws that  raise barriers to voting, fewer people end up voting. That is a fact.  So as the President will say later, we are approaching a decisive  moment for the country.   Voting rights, defending democracy have long been bipartisan issues  in this Chamber. The Voting Rights Act of 1964 is one of the crowning  achievements not only of the civil rights era but of the history of  this Chamber. It is in no way a power grab to say the Senate will pass  laws that make it easier, simpler, and safer for American citizens to  exercise their most fundamental right. That has been part of the grand  tradition of this country--usually, as I mentioned several times  before, bipartisan.   I will add: As we proceed, we cannot hang our hats on the false hopes  of inadequate or sometimes chimerical solutions.   Substituting the Electoral Count Act for the much needed reforms that  we have in the Freedom to Vote and John Lewis Voting Rights Act is  insufficient, unacceptable. Obviously, it doesn't affect the House and  Senate. Obviously, it is not immediately urgent because it affects  2024. But most importantly, scorekeeping matters little if the game is  rigged, and the game is in danger of being rigged if State Republicans  empower themselves to arbitrate the results of future elections instead  of it being arbitrated by what traditionally has happened in America by  nonpartisan election workers.   So we need to work in this Chamber to pass real solutions that go to  the heart of the problem. We need to proceed with the John Lewis Voting  Rights Act. We need to proceed with the Freedom to Vote Act.   All of us in this Chamber must make a choice about how we will do our  part to preserve our democratic Republic. We can't be satisfied in  thinking that democracy will win out in the end if we are not willing  to put in the work to defend it.   So we need to pass these bills so our democracy can long endure after  this present danger. To continue blocking these efforts is to offer an  implicit endorsement of Donald Trump's Big Lie, which, unfortunately,  is alive and well in 2022.   I yield the floor.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to legislative session and be in a period of morning business,  with Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.
