 Madam Speaker, the debt crisis that we are facing as a  Nation right now is a manufactured one. Extreme Republicans are holding  the livelihoods and the bank accounts of hardworking families hostage.   You don't have to take my word for it. This week, one of the most far  right, TV-loving Members of this Chamber said he doesn't feel like they  should negotiate with their hostage. That is a quote.   What is the ransom they are demanding?   Gutting the critical programs that those same families depend on to  make ends meet.   It is disgraceful to tell parents working two jobs that their food  assistance is being cut because Republicans are helping millionaires  cheat on their taxes.   It is shameful to tell a veteran that his rental assistance stopped  because the GOP doesn't want billion-dollar corporations paying their  fair share.   We can end this manufactured crisis today, Madam Speaker. All it  takes is five sensible, five responsible Republicans to turn their car  around and join us in this discharge petition for a clean debt limit.   Do the right thing. Do it today.                            ____________________
