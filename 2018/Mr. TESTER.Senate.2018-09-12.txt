 Mr. President, today I wish to honor my friend  Dick Brown, an extraordinary Montanan who has dedicated his life to  improving healthcare across Big Sky Country. Dick has shown incredible  leadership as president and CEO of the Montana Hospital Association for  11 years, advocating at both the State and Federal levels for healthier  families and communities.   Through his 40 years in healthcare, Dick has been on the frontlines  to bring positive change to our healthcare system. He has fought for  lower costs, better access, stronger healthcare facilities, and  improved patient outcomes. He partnered with Montanans across the  political spectrum to lead the charge for Medicaid expansion in  Montana, which has created jobs, saved the State money, and, most  importantly, provided coverage to more than 90,000 Montanans who would  have otherwise gone without.   We also worked together to host the first Rural Health Summit in  Montana, which brought together experts from across the country to  tackle the unique challenges of providing quality healthcare in  frontier communities.   Dick's positive influence on healthcare in Montana is widely felt  from Plentywood to Dillon. Dick is an adviser and friend, a moral  compass and steady hand, a wise leader and compassionate advocate.   Healthcare in Montana, and especially rural Montana, wouldn't be the  same without Dick Brown. His dedication to quality, affordable  healthcare for Montanans has been a blessing to our State, and  generations of healthier Montanans will stand as a lasting testament to  his legacy.   On behalf of Montana and this body, we wish him the best in  retirement.                            ____________________
