 Madam Speaker, I thank the chairman very much for  yielding, and I rise in support of the Senate amendment to H.R. 1868,  an act to prevent direct across-the-board spending cuts, which would  include protecting Medicare.   Madam Speaker, one of the happiest days of my life as a Member of the  United States Congress--and I have passed many legislative  initiatives--is the passing of the American Rescue Act. Just in the  time that I was in the district in the work recess, I was able to see  the smiles of so many--such as our Federally qualified health clinics  getting almost 50 million to provide vaccinations to well-deserved  communities--smiling faces about the American Rescue Act.    And so the reason why this is an important initiative is because it  retains language included by Congress in the CARES Act and subsequent  legislation to address the COVID-19 pandemic.   Medicare plans and providers are receiving payment rates at  approximately 2 percent higher than what they otherwise could have  received during this time. The pause in the operability of the  sequestration was slated to expire on March 31, 2021, but H.R. 1868  extended the suspension to December 30, 2021. We do not want any cuts  from Medicare, and Democrats will not have any cuts in Medicare.   The Senate amendment to that legislation reduced that time to the end  of the fiscal year 2021--September 30--but I know that even though it  has been reduced to that, we will extend it because we will not have  any cuts. I believe the American Rescue Plan was desperately needed-- $20 billion in vaccinations; contact tracing and testing; billions of  dollars for our schools and our teachers; dollars that would help  ensure that our unemployment is extended, and the $1,400. Vaccines in  the arms; money in people's pocket.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Kentucky  for yielding.   Madam Speaker, the American Rescue Plan will bring $16.7 billion to  the State of Texas. The lion's share of $3.3 billion will come directly  to the city of Houston and Harris County.   I thank the gentleman from Kentucky for allowing me to offer a motion  to instruct that indicated that we would not stop direct funding from  going to our local jurisdictions, which we fought. And every time I see  my mayor and local officials, they are smiling for that direct  funding--$1.4 billion to smaller jurisdictions like Jacinto City and  the Houston Independent School District getting millions of dollars.   Madam Speaker, this particular amendment is important because  Democrats don't cut Medicare. We are standing here today to make sure  that nothing happens to our seniors and Medicare.   Madam Speaker, I support this legislation.   Madam Speaker, as a senior member of the Committees on the Judiciary,  on Homeland Security, on the Budget, and as the Member of Congress for  a congressional district that has experienced the worst of the COVID-19  as a public health emergency and economic catastrophe, I rise in  support of Senate Amendment to H.R. 1868.   I do so because this legislation retains language included by  Congress in the CARES Act and subsequent legislation to address the  COVID-19 pandemic, Medicare plans and providers are receiving payment  rates that are approximately 2 percent higher than what they otherwise  would have received during this time.   This pause in the operability of sequestration was slated to expire  on March 31, 2021, but H.R. 1868 extended the suspension through  December 31, 2021; the Senate Amendment to that legislation reduced  that time to the end of fiscal year 2021, or September 30, 2021.   It is very disappointing that the provision in H.R. 1868 passed by  House excluding the budgetary effects of the American Rescue Plan Act  of 2021, from the scorecards established by the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go  (PAYGO) Act of 2010 and preventing across-the-board cuts to numerous  direct spending programs were not included in the amendment passed by  the Senate.   But as a member of the Budget Committee, I will be working tirelessly  with Chairman Yarmuth and my colleagues to ensure that Congress  designates as an emergency or otherwise excludes from the PAYGO  scorecard the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 to avert sequestration.   Madam Speaker, Congress has never permitted sequestration to affect  the Medicare trust fund and it certainly will not allow it now, just  when help is arriving under the American Rescue Plan Act to put shots  in arms, money in pockets, kids in school, and workers back on the job.   It is worthwhile to explain why the American Rescue Plan Act is the  most transformative legislation in more than a half century and easily  justifies exclusion from sequestration.   H.R. 1319, the American Rescue Plan Act, is a landmark, life-saving  legislation that will provide urgently-needed resources to defeat the  virus, put vaccines in people's arms, money into families' pockets,  children safely back into classrooms, and people back to work.   With tens of millions of Americans infected, more than half a million  lives lost, over 18 million Americans unemployed and millions more  hungry and food and housing insecure, thanks to the work of  congressional Democrats in the House and Senate and the Biden  administration, at long last the people of the United States and my  home state of Texas can be assured that ``Help Is On The Way.''   In simple terms this life-saving and life-enhancing legislation puts  vaccines in arms, puts money in people's pockets, puts children safely  back in school, and it will put workers back in jobs.   1. Put Vaccines in Arms: The plan will mount a national vaccination  program that includes setting up community vaccination sites nationwide  and addressing disparities facing communities of color. It will also  take complementary measures to combat the virus, including scaling up  testing and tracing, addressing shortages of personal protective  equipment and other critical supplies, investing in high-quality  treatments, and addressing health care disparities.   2. Put Money in People's Pockets: The plan finishes the job on the  President's promise to provide $2,000 in direct assistance to  households across America with checks of $1,400 per person, following  the $600 down payment enacted in December. The plan will also provide  direct housing assistance, nutrition assistance for 40 million  Americans, expand access to safe and reliable child care and affordable  health care, extend unemployment insurance so that 18 million American  workers can pay their bills and support 27 million children with an  expanded Child Tax Credit and more than 17 million low-wage workers  through an improved Earned Income Tax Credit.   3. Put Children Safely Back in School: The plan delivers $170 billion  for education and $45 billion for childcare providers. This includes a  $130 billion investment in K-12 school re-opening and making up for  lost time in the classroom, with funds that can be used for such things  as reducing class sizes, modifying spaces so that students and teachers  can socially distance, improving ventilation, implementing more  mitigation measures, providing personal protective equipment and  providing summer school or other support for students that help make up  lost learning time this year. The plan also provides more than $40  billion for higher education.   Here is what the American Rescue Plan Act means for the State of  Texas, Houston, and Harris County.   An estimated $16.7 billion will come to the State of Texas.   The lion's share of $3.3 billion will come directly to the City of  Houston, and Harris County will receive a similar share of $5.667  billion, thanks to a provision in the law I helped secure that created  the Coronavirus Local Fiscal Recovery Fund and appropriated $45.57  billion.   $1.4 billion in direct payments is allocated to smaller jurisdiction  like Jacinto City.   Houston Independent School District can expect to receive close to  $100 million ($993,198 million to be more precise).   The law specifically allows this funding to be used:   1. To respond to the pandemic or its negative economic impacts,  including assistance to households, small businesses, and nonprofits,  or aid to impacted industries such as tourism, travel, and hospitality;   2. For premium pay to eligible workers performing essential work (as  determined by each  [[Page H1732]]  recipient government) during the pandemic, providing up to $13 per hour  above regular wages;   3. For the provision of government services to the extent of the  reduction in revenue due to the pandemic (relative to revenues  collected in the most recent full fiscal year); and   4. To make necessary investments in water, sewer, or broadband  infrastructure.   In addition to these funds, Texas will receive $100 million out of  the newly created $10 billion Coronavirus Capital Projects Fund for  ``critical capital projects directly enabling work, education, and  health monitoring, including remote options, in response to the public  health emergency with respect to the Coronavirus Disease.   Now all that is well and good but let me tell you what the American  Rescue Plan Act means for a hard-working and hard-pressed single mother  of two children making a modest income:   Stimulus checks: $1,400 3 = $4,200,   Child tax credit: $3,600 (5-year-old) + $3,000 (9-year-old) = $6,600.  Half of that amount will be paid out periodically from late July  through December; the rest will come as a check with next year's taxes.   Enhanced unemployment: If the parent becomes unemployed in March, she  will be eligible for $300 in aid every week through the last week of  August.   Total: $10,800 from stimulus and tax credits, plus another $7,500  from 25-weeks of enhanced unemployment aid. This individual would also  receive $318 per week in state unemployment aid and thousands more from  the Earned Income Tax Credit.   Finally, let me discuss briefly the good things for the restaurant  industry that are in the American Rescue Plan Act.   The law allocates $28 billion in funds to devastated food service  establishments, including bars, and food trucks, and vendors.   Unlike the Paycheck Protection Program, which saddled restaurants  with burdensome loans if the bulk of the funds were not spent on  payroll, these restaurant relief dollars are grants, plain and simple.   Grant sizes will generally be determined by subtracting lower 2020  pandemic-era receipts from higher 2019 gross receipts.   Over $5 billion will be set aside for smaller venues whose annual  gross receipts were below $500,000, leaving $23.6 billion for everyone  else.   Grants will be capped at $10 million for restaurant groups and $5  million for individual venues.   Publicly traded companies or restaurants with more than 20 locations  will not be eligible to participate in this funding.   And, for the first 21 days, establishments owned by women, veterans,  or economically and socially disadvantaged groups will be prioritized.   This transformative legislation will also provide direct housing  assistance, nutrition assistance for 40 million Americans, expand  access to safe and reliable child care and affordable health care,  extend unemployment insurance so that 18 million American workers can  pay their bills and support 27 million children with an expanded Child  Tax Credit and more than 17 million low-wage childless workers through  an improved Earned Income Tax Credit, which will reduce the number of  children living in poverty in America by 50 percent.   I want to commend my colleagues and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi for  her leadership and President Biden for signing into law the American  Rescue Plan Act of 2021, and I urge all Members to join me in voting to  pass the bill before us, the Senate Amendment to H.R. 1868, and to  redouble our efforts to ensure the exclusion of the budgetary effects  of the American Rescue Plan Act from the scorecards established by the  Statutory Pay-As-You-Go (PAYGO) Act of 2010, thus precluding the  implementation of direct across the board cuts in spending.                                time  1915
