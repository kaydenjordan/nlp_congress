 Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues who worked diligently  to pass the advanced child tax credit, which will cut child poverty in  half in just one year. We have a responsibility to make this money  accessible to every child.   While our elder daughter, Emmy, is accounted for, our pandemic baby,  [[Page H3089]]  Caroline, is not. In my district, the IRS estimates that more than  6,000 children are unaccounted for.   My team has worked tirelessly to get relief to our constituents. I  encourage our constituents to visit the IRS website to check their  eligibility. There is even a tool for nonfilers.   The IRS is underfunded, and we need to fix that, but they have done a  phenomenal job getting this set up.   While our caseworkers are always happy to help, our constituents  shouldn't leave money on the table. So, check your eligibility and find  out what makes sense for your family.                                time  1030                     America Needs to Do the Right Thing     Mr. Speaker, our Afghan allies and friends risked their  lives, not just for their country, but for ours. They put their lives  on the line, not just for Afghanistan, but for America. And they are  not just Afghan heroes, but American heroes, too.   They risked their lives because we made a solemn promise to them: We  have your backs. Because we said that we have their backs, they now  have a target on theirs.   Today, the Biden administration has heard the call of veterans across  America who have said: Save our allies. Do the right thing by the  promise that we made.   They have heeded our calls to pursue an evacuation because there  simply is not enough time for special immigrant visas to be processed.  It is 80 days until our withdrawal. The average time to process an SIV  is 800 days.   Today is, therefore, a bright chapter in the long story of the  advocacy of veterans all over this country, Democrat and Republican,  who have called on the administration to execute a plan for evacuation.   But the story is far from over. We need to see a detailed operational  plan, including a way to collect our allies from across this war-torn  country, a way to ensure that their family members are saved as well,  and a clear plan to get them COVID vaccines so they can travel safely  to other countries, or to Guam, and not carry a risk of carrying the  disease.   We also need to see an operational commander named to lead this  effort, and we need a guarantee that this evacuation mission will  continue until it is complete.   The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Milley, said  yesterday that we have a moral obligation to fulfill this promise. I  would add that that moral obligation is not just to our Afghan friends  and allies. It is to every future young American on the ground in some  conflict overseas who needs a friend, who needs an interpreter, who  needs an ally and makes that promise once again: Come work with us.  Come risk your life for us because we have your back.                            ____________________
