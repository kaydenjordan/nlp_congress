 Will the Senator yield for a question?    I do not believe that the President nominated the best  candidate to serve as Secretary of Education. I don't believe he even  nominated a qualified candidate. Mrs. DeVos has never taught, never  worked in a school system, and has no educational degree in education  policy.   I was hoping that she would ease my concerns over her qualifications  at the confirmation hearing and prove that she was indeed up for the  job, but, instead, Mrs. DeVos failed to study, showed up unprepared,  and appeared unfamiliar with the foundational civil rights law that  guarantees every student, including those with disabilities, the right  to a quality equitable education.   I would not be here today were it not for strong public schools and  civil rights protections. Confirming her to lead the agency tasked with  educating our children and helping them develop into successful adults  would be a mistake for our children because they would have to pay for  and live with this mistake for decades to come. There is simply no way  that I can support her nomination.   I ask the Senator, how is it possible that we could have a Secretary  of Education who does not understand or even know about those Federal  protections  [[Page S820]]  for students with disabilities to have access to equitable and fair  education?    Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my debate time  to Senator Schumer.
