 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, this weekend the United States of  America passed a sad milestone--200,000 recorded deaths from COVID-19.   We are a nation in mourning. In addition to 200,000 family, friends,  and neighbors we have now lost to this brutal pandemic, America is also  mourning the loss of a historic champion of equality, a woman who spent  her entire life, every ounce of her strength and talent she was given,  in pursuit of America's highest ideal: equal justice under the law.   Jewish teaching says that those who die just before the Jewish New  Year are those whom God has held back until the last moment because  they were most needed on Earth. So it seems fitting that Ruth Bader  Ginsburg left this world as the Sun was setting last Friday, marking  the start of Rosh Hashanah.   Years before, Ruth Bader Ginsburg made history as only the second  woman ever to serve on the U.S. Supreme Court. Even at that time, she  had already earned an enduring place in American history. She has been  called the Thurgood Marshall of the gender equality movement. As a  lawyer and law professor, she was the mastermind in the 1970s behind a  legal strategy that finally began to dismantle an American legal system  that treated women in many ways as second-class citizens. Law Professor  David Cole called her strategy ``radical incrementalism.''   It is hard today for many Americans to imagine how deeply entrenched  and how commonly accepted gender discrimination was in American law-- and American society--before Ruth Bader Ginsburg began her legal  crusade to make real for women the words carved above the doors of the  U.S. Supreme Court: ``Equal Justice Under Law.'' The legal challenges  she brought changed the way the world is for women and for all  Americans.   Before she began her legal crusade, women were treated, by law,  differently than men. Hundreds of State and Federal laws and programs  restricted what women could do. Many jobs were legally closed to women.  Many basic economic, social, and legal rights that we now take for  granted were legally denied to women for no reason other than gender.   Before the legal victories achieved by Ruth Bader Ginsburg, a woman  often could not--on her own--buy a car, open a checking account, get a  credit card, sign a lease, obtain a mortgage, buy real estate, open a  business, or obtain a business loan. She needed a man to co-sign.   Before Ruth Bader Ginsburg, women could be--and were--barred from  public institutions and excluded from whole professions. They could be  demoted or fired if they became pregnant. In fact, Ruth Bader Ginsburg  herself was forced to accept a lower paying job at the Social Security  Administration when she became pregnant, at the age of 21, with her  first child.   Her legal strategy was cautious and strategic. Knowing that she  needed to persuade mostly male judges--including an all-male Supreme  Court--she chose cases that illustrated how gender discrimination can  also harm men. She took up the case of a young widower whose wife died  in childbirth. The man wanted to stay home to raise his son but was  denied Social Security survivor benefits because such benefits by law  could only go to widows.  [[Page S5726]]    Decades later, when that little boy grew up, Justice Ginsberg  officiated at his wedding at the Supreme Court Building.   Her goal was simple but compelling: to make clear that the Fourteenth  Amendment's promise of equal protection under the law covers women as  well as men. As I said, it was not only women who benefited from her  life's work. If you are a man who has been covered by your wife's  medical benefits, thank Ruth Bader Ginsburg. If you are a man who has  been able to claim Social Security survivor benefits or name a woman as  executor of your estate, thank Ruth Bader Ginsburg.   We have not erased all gender-based inequality, as Ruth Bader  Ginsburg knew well. And some of the legal victories for equal justice  are now threatened. Some have been diminished outright. She also knew  that. Her concerns about these threats to hard-won rights was the basis  for some of the most famous, fiery dissents--and why this often quiet,  soft-spoken woman took the unusual step many times of reading her  dissents from the bench. She wanted us to understand what was at stake  so that we could join her in the fight.   That is what she did in 2007, in the case of Lilly Ledbetter v.  Goodyear Tire. The Supreme Court ruled 5 to 4 that a woman who was paid  less than her male coworkers for years, doing exactly the same work,  could not sue her former employer for wage discrimination.   The woman only learned about the pay gap after she retired, but a  conservative majority on the Court ruled that she had lost her chance  at justice by failing to sue within 6 months of her first unequal  paycheck. In her dissent, Justice Ginsburg challenged Congress to  correct this injustice, and we did. The very first law signed by  President Barack Obama was the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009. A  framed copy of that signed law hung in Justice Ginsburg's Supreme Court  chambers as a gift from President Obama. He signed it with the  following inscription: ``Thanks for helping create a more equal and  just society.''   In her dissent in the 2013 Shelby County v. Holder, which gutted the  heart of the Voting Rights Act, Justice Ginsburg pointed out the awful  irony of the majority decision. She wrote that throwing out the need  for jurisdictions with histories of voter suppression to clear changes  in their voting laws before elections because the laws had already  worked was ``like throwing away your umbrella in a rainstorm because  you are not getting wet.''   She was right. Our democracy would be stronger today had just one  more Justice on the Supreme Court agreed with her. It is up to Congress  now to heed her warning by passing the John Lewis Voting Rights  Advancement Act which languishes on the desk of Senator McConnell.    Ruth Bader Ginsburg was a champion of workers' rights, of disability  rights, LGBTQ rights, and environmental justice. And she was a woman  who believed deeply that part of America's greatness is the welcome and  safety and opportunity that America has offered to immigrants and  refugees for most of our history.   Like me, Justice Ginsburg was a child of an immigrant who came to  this country partly to flee religious persecution. My mother and her  family left Russian-occupied Lithuania partly to escape anti-Catholic  persecution.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg's father left Odessa, Russia, for New York when  he was 13 to escape anti-Jewish pogroms. Her mother was born in New  York 4 months after her family moved from Austria--extended family  members later died in the Holocaust.   Justice Ginsburg's mother was like my mother in another way: They  were both very intelligent women who were denied their full education  because money was tight and because they lived during a time when  expectations about what women could achieve were so low.   Like my mother, Celia Ginsburg used to take her child to the public  library where she would check out as many books as she could read. She  saved her pennies so that her daughter could one day get the college  education she was never able to get herself. Celia Ginsburg dreamed  that her bright, young daughter might grow up, if she were lucky and  worked very hard, to become a high school teacher. Instead, Ruth Bader  Ginsburg grew up and changed history. She changed America for the  better. America is fundamentally different and fairer as a nation  because of the vision and work of Ruth Bader Ginsburg.   I recalled over the weekend, and repeated it to my wife, this amazing  statistic; that Ruth Bader Ginsburg battled cancer five times over  nearly 20 years and then, of course, lived through the death 10 years  ago of her beloved husband Marty, but she almost never missed a day on  the bench. She worked through chemo sickness, broken ribs, and terrible  pain, but, nevertheless, she persisted.   I want to read you something she said many times. I really liked  this.         What is the difference between a bookkeeper in New York's       garment district and a Supreme Court Justice? One       generation--my own life bears witness. The difference between       the opportunities available to my mother and those afforded       me.''    Ruth Bader Ginsburg did not simply take opportunities afforded to  women. More than perhaps any American in history, she helped create  those opportunities.   Loretta and I offer our deepest condolences to her friends and to her  family, especially her daughter Jane and her son James, who now calls  Chicago home, and her grandchildren and her great-granddaughter.   May her memory be a blessing and may her life be a guiding light for  all of us.    I announce that the Senator from California (Ms. Harris),  the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Sanders), the Senator from Arizona (Ms.  Sinema), and the Senator from Michigan (Ms. Stabenow) are necessarily  absent.
