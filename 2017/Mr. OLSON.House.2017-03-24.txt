 Mr. Speaker, a man loved throughout Houston, throughout  Texas, throughout America, and throughout our world, Tom Friedkin put  on his angel wings and flew to Heaven last week.   Tom was the force behind Houston's largest private company, Gulf  States Toyota. Tom put an ``open for business'' sign up in 1969. Thirty  years later, Tom was inducted into the Texas Business Hall of Fame.   Tom's brain made him a billionaire, but his heart was worth much,  much more. Tom took that heart to Tanzania to protect elephants from  being poached and killed. Tom's foundation signed a 30-year agreement  with Tanzania to make it a better country.   A legend Texans love, Bum Phillips, would say this about Tom  Friedkin: Tom, you may not be in a class by yourself, but whatever  class you are in, it don't take long to call the roll.   God bless you, Tom.                            ____________________
