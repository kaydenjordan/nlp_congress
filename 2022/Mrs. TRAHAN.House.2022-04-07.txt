 Madam Speaker, every Member of this Chamber has had the  privilege of meeting with hardworking small business owners in their  districts who overcame incredible challenges to stay open during the  pandemic.   The stories that stick with me the most are the ones from family- owned establishments--community staples like Simply Khmer in Lowell and  Terra Luna in Lawrence. These businesses accessed relief through the  Restaurant Revitalization Fund, and it helped them keep their doors  open and their employees on staff.   But for every Simply Khmer and Terra Luna, there are three or four  other restaurants who applied but didn't get the relief they needed  because the fund ran out of money. And that has left many businesses  hanging on by a thread pleading for help. Passing the Relief for  Restaurants and other Hard Hit Small Businesses Act will answer those  calls for aid.   Madam Speaker, we owe these restaurants and small businesses this  legislation. There is simply no reason anyone in Congress should oppose  it.   Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join us in passing this bill.
