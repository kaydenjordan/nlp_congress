 Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (S. 467) to modify the age requirement for the Student Incentive  Payment Program of the State maritime academies.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                   S. 467         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Changing Age-Determined       Eligibility To Student Incentive Payments Act'' or the       ``CADETS Act''.       SEC. 2. AGE REQUIREMENT FOR THE STUDENT INCENTIVE PAYMENT                     PROGRAM OF THE STATE MARITIME ACADEMIES.         Section 51509 of title 46, United States Code, is amended       by adding at the end the following:        ``(i) Age Requirement.--The Secretary may make an agreement       under this section only with a qualified student who will       meet the age requirement for enlistment or commission in the       Navy Reserve at the time of graduation from the academy.''.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and insert extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of S. 467, the CADETS  Act.   The CADETS Act was introduced earlier this year by a bipartisan group  of Senators led by Senator Peters of Michigan. It passed the Senate by  unanimous consent last month. I am the proud sponsor of the companion  legislation here in this House.   The CADETS Act will begin to help solve the problem our Nation faces  in recruiting qualified mariners to serve in the Navy Reserve and crew  our strategic sealift vessels.   Our fleet of strategic sealift vessels is critical to our ability to  project and sustain U.S. forces around the world and defend ourselves  and our allies. However, we can't do that without qualified Americans  willing and able to crew these ships.   S. 467 will incentivize Americans to serve in this critical defense  role by making those older than 25 years of age eligible for MARAD's  Student Incentive Payment Program.   The Student Incentive Payment Program provides financial assistance  to cadets who attend one of the six State maritime academies and commit  to a post-graduation service obligation in the Navy Reserve.   I am proud to represent the Great Lakes Maritime Academy in Traverse  City, Michigan, and I was honored to address the cadets at their  graduation ceremony just a few weeks ago in May.   Cadets at Great Lakes and other maritime academies can receive up to  $32,000 in incentive payments over 4 years to help offset the cost of  tuition and other education expenses. However, current law prohibits  candidates older than 25 years of age from participating in the  program. This is despite the fact that Americans between the ages of 18  and 42 can currently join the Navy Reserve and that State maritime  academies are actively seeking to enroll veterans and servicemembers,  many of whom are older than age 25.   S. 467 amends the Student Incentive Payment Program to align its  eligibility age with the age requirements for enlisting or  commissioning in the United States Navy Reserve.   This is a good bipartisan bill that will help our veterans transition  to well-paying jobs, support the great work done by our State maritime  academies, and help fill critical national security vacancies.   Madam Speaker, I urge all Members to support the bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I urge all Members to support this bill,  and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I object to the vote on the ground that a  quorum is not present and make the point of order that a quorum is not  present.
