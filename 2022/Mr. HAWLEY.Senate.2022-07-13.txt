 Madam President, following my submission yesterday, I ask  unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the next part of an  investigation directed by the U.S. Central Command concerning the Abbey  Gate bombing in Afghanistan in August 2021.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:       ACTS-SCK-DO      Subject: Findings and Recommendation--Attack Against U.S.           Forces Conducting NEO at Hamid Karzai International           Airport on 26 August 2021         (i) Throughout the NEO, USFOR-A FWD spent a significant       amount of time coordinating special evacuation requests on       behalf of the interagency, congressional representatives and       senators, and the White House (exhibits 13, 15, 18, 20, 21,       22). The USFOR-A FWD staff estimated they received over 4000       such requests during the nine days ECPs were operating       (exhibits 13, 20, 21, 22). (TEXT REDACTED) USFOR-A FWD Deputy       Commanding General, referred to these evacuees as privileged       personnel exhibit 21). USFOR-A FWD's (TEXT REDACTED) and       Embassy (TEXT REDACTED) worked with subordinate staffs to       action many of these requests. They would coordinate with the       potential evacuees for challenge and password or other       identification, visit gates, seek out the evacuees,       physically pull them from the crowd, and get them processed       through DoS and the Evacuation Control Center (ECC (exhibits       17, 20, 22, 100, 108, 122).        (ii) (TEXT REDACTED) along with members of the JTF-CR       staff, were primarily responsible for coordinating multi-      national activities and requests through the Multi-National       Coordination Cell (MNCC) (exhibits 15, 18, 20, 21, 22). The       MNCC met daily, along with other Ambassador groups, to       coordinate air and lift requirements for partner nations, and       Afghans sponsored by those nations to depart (exhibits 20,       21, 22). Many of the other nations working out of HKIA and       conducting NEO were completely dependent on the U.S. for       airlift (exhibit 21). USFOR-A FWD, with JTF-CR, formed the       International Coordination Cell (ICC), which was a broader       forum for handling the extensive privileged persons' requests       from partner nations (exhibit 21). (TEXT REDACTED) USSFOR-A       FWD Chief of Staff, and Commander. 3/10 IBCT, was responsible       for working these issues (exhibits 21, 126). The ICC also       provided a forum to synchronize bulk movement and arrival of       passport holders or cleared individuals from all nations       through South Gate (exhibit 126). This included building and       allocating movement tables and coordinating with Taliban       commanders for passage of vehicles (exhibit 126). (TEXT       REDACTED) coordinated with 1/82 IBCTs (TEXT REDACTED) to       request TF Wild Boar support for receiving these coordinated       arrivals at the various gates (exhibit 247). TF Polar Bear       was a force on the ground  [[Page S3266]]       at HKIA scheduled to conduct relief in place/transfer of       authority (RIP/TOA) with TF Wild Boar. The RIP was delayed       based on conditions, to retain both forces for the       approaching NEO (exhibit 126). After 17 August, both forces       were at HKIA and made TACON to 1/82 IBCT during the NEO       (exhibits 128,247). TF Polar Bear operated as the HKIA quick       reaction force (QRF) and had liaison officers (LNO) in the       JTF-CR Joint Operations Center (JOC) (exhibit 247). TF Wild       Boar also served as a QRF, but executed targeted recovery       missions with the MNCC and ICC when operations permitted       (exhibits 10, 126, 247).        (iii) USFOR-A FWD was responsible for coordination with       adjacent military, paramilitary, and former adversary forces       (exhibits 13, 20, 21, 22, 23). On 16 August, RADM Vasely       coordinated with other governmental agencies (OGA) for NSU       assistance with airfield security. NSU took over large swaths       of the perimeter on the South, West, and North of HKIA       (exhibits 13, 15, 181,20, 21, 22, 23). Shortly after, RADM       Vasely began coordinating with (TEXT REDACTED) the regional       Taliban Commander and Taliban-designated LNO, for Taliban       assistance with clearing the airfield and providing security       along the southern perimeter of HKIA (exhibits 13, 15, 18,       20, 21, 22, 23). Finally, RADM Vasely and his staff       coordinated with the Turkish Military to relieve them of       security and airfield operations responsibilities (exhibits       13, 15, 18, 21).        (iv) USFOR-A FWD, and subordinate units, continued to       coordinate with the Taliban throughout the NEO, however, only       USFOR-A FWD and MG Donahue had authority to release threat       reporting to the Taliban (exhibits 13, 15, 18, 20, 21, 22,       23). Prior to the Abbey Gate attack, on 25-26 August, USFOR-A       FWD was continuously updating the Taliban with information       necessary to improve their security posture and provide       effective screening for exposed forces at the gates (exhibits       13, 15, 18, 20, 21, 22, 23). USFOR-A FWD and MG Donahue       frequently provided updates in person to the Taliban at the       South Terminal and by phone (exhibits 13, 21, 23, 125).        (3) Task Force--Medical (TF MED).        (a) TF MED was initially located at Bagram Air Base and       served as the most capable US Role Ill medical facility in       Afghanistan (exhibits 14, 131). On approximately 15 June, the       facility at Bagram closed and TF MED moved to North HKIA to       continue to provide medical support to remaining U.S. Forces,       but with a reduced capability exhibits 14, 128, 131). TF MED       co-located with Norwegian medical personnel at the HKIA Role       II military treatment facility (exhibit 14, 128, 131). (TEXT       REDACTED) USAF, commanded TF MED during the period of the       move to HKIA and throughout the NEO (exhibits 14, 131). The       facility at HKIA was a Role II Enhanced (Role 11-E), with       lab, pharmacy, two operating rooms (ORs), and computed       tomography (en scan capability (exhibits 14, 128, 131).        (b) During the NEO, the capabilities of this facility       swelled, eventually supported by nine surgical teams arriving       20-23 August (exhibits 131). These teams came from various       locations and nations: one Norwegian Special Operations       Surgical Team (SOST), two U.S. SOSTs, two U.S. Forward       Resuscitative Surgical Detachments (FRSD), surgical teams       organic to TF MED, one U.K. Military surgical team, and those       organic to the 82nd, which operated from the Role II at Camp       Alvarado (exhibits 14, 128, 131, 149). In addition to       surgical teams, TF MED also had an Aeromedical Evacuation       Liaison Team (AELT), responsible for medical airlift from       HKIA rearward. Io synchronize efforts, (TEXT REDACTED)       conducted daily huddles with the various contingents to       discuss threat reporting, posturing medical assets and       supplies, and patient flow (exhibits 131, 149). TF MED       created and exercised a mass casualty (MASCAL) plan for       medical response in June 2021, which included Norwegian       capabiltties and participation (exhibits 14, 131). During the       NEO, (TEXT REDACTED) made the decision to consolidate higher-      level medical care at the Role II-E an not push any assets to       the gates (exhibit 131). The units at the gates had medics/      corpsmen and the Role I capability had already pushed forward       (exhibits 66, 100, 104).        (c) On 25-26 August, Role II-E personnel were aware of       increased credible reporting for a vehicle-borne improvised       explosive device (VBIED) or suicide vest IED (SVIED) at a       gate (exhibits 14, 131). The USFOR-A FWD (TEXT REDACTED)       contacted approximately 26 August and warned him a MASCAL       event was imminent exhibit 131). (TEXT REDACTED) placed       medics and surgical teams on stand-by until 1700, and then       released them on immediate recall (exhibit 14, 131). At the       time of the blast (TEXT REDACTED) was in the Joint Operations       Center (JOC) and a Role I facility reported significant       numbers of casualties, which triggered the MASCAL response       (exhibit 131). (TEXT REDACTED) Trauma Team Leader, was in the       emergency room (ER) and did not hear the blast, but was       notified within minutes to prepare for a MASCAL (exhibit       128). TF MED received its first patient within 12 minutes and       treated patients for the next 10-12 hours (exhibits 14, 128       131, 149). The most seriously wounded patients arrived first,       a result of proper triage at the Role I facilities and       casualty collection points (CCPs) (exhibits 14, 128, 131       14Q). The Role II-E expanded its operating room to       accommodate four patients at a time and used hallway space to       provide additional required care (exhibits 128, 131, 149).       Patients with less severe injuries, not requiring immediate       care, were staged outsde or in ambulances with medics to       stabilize injuries (exhibits 14, 128, 131, 149). Of the 13       killed in action (KIA), every medical professional       interviewed concluded that no amount of additional measures,       equipment, or treatment could have saved their lives       (exhibits 14, 128, 131, 149). By approximately 0700 on 27       August, the Role II-E was empty of patients, with three       flights taking personnel to Qatar or Germany, to include 19       U.S. causalities (exhibit 14, 131, 236). The Role II-E had a       small morgue, capable of handling only eight deceased       (exhibits 68, 131). Because the MASCAL overwhelmed the       hospital morgue capacity, the KIA were moved to a pre-      coordinated refrigerated shipping container for preparation       and movement back to continental U.S. (CONUS) (exhibit 68,       131).        (4) JTF-CR.        (a) JTF-CR is a command and control organization derived       from a joint manning document, manned by TF 51/5th Marine       Expeditionary Brigade (MEB) personnel, stationed in Bahrain,       and augmented with personnel from the CENTCOM area of       responsibility (AOR) (exhibits 15, 17, 18). TF 51/5th MEB       began initial planning in April for the potential NEO,       convened two operational planning teams, coordinated with       USFOR-A, CENTCOM, and MARCENT, and attended operations and       intelligence updates with USFOR-A FWD (exhibits 15, 17, 18).       JTF-CR activated in May and was TACON to USFOR-A FWD for NEO       planning (exhibits 15, 17, 18). In May and June, JTF-CR       conducted a pre-deployment site survey (POSS) to Afghanistan       to assess possible evacuation sites and coordinate with       stakeholders, specifically USEK (exhibits 15, 17, 18).       Initial planning accounted for two aerial ports of       embarkation (APOEs), HKIA and Bagram Air Base. In early June,       Bagram transitioned to ANDSF control and was no longer       considered for planning (exhibits 15, 17, 18). JTF-CR       deployed three LNOs forward in May, along with a small three       person quartering party to HKIA in late May to set       conditions for a possible NEO (exhibit 15, 18).        (b) JTF-CR deployed to HKIA on 19 July, starting with the       Early Entry Assistance Team (EEAT), followed by the JTF-CR       staff as a robust quartering party (exhibit 15. The staff       continued to coordinate with USEK while in Afghanistan, in an       attempt to plan the NEO, but to little effect (exhibit 18).       With the fall of Afghanistan districts to the Taliban       throughout July and August, the JTF-CR continuously took       steps to prepare HKIA for NEO, such as building supply stocks       on HKIA to handle evacuees' basic needs (exhibit 18). During       early August, DoS began processing Special Immigrant Visas       (SIVs) and sending out evacuees by commercial air. They       evacuated approximately 750 before the NEO was called on 13       August (exhibits 18, 8, 24).        (c) During execution of the NEO, JTF-CR had initial       responsibility for securing HKIA and processing evacuees       designated eligible by DoS (exhibits 15, 17, 18). In the       early morning hours of 14 August, 24th MEU arrived with       nearly 200 personnel that included some of the headquarters       staff, snipers, ECC personnel, and a single rifle company       (exhibits 15, 100, 102, 104). At this time, elements of TF       Polar Bear and TF Wild Boar, who were subordinate elements of       3/10 IBCT providing security for USEK and HKIA, arrived to       HKIA (exhibits 15, 126, 247). 24th MEU later closed       additional capability during 14 August, with a similar mix of       personnel as the first lift (exhibits 15, 100, 102, 104). The       Turkish Military was providing security on North HKIA, with       approximately 400 troops, and the ANDSF were securing the       southern perimeter of HKIA, specifically the routes into the       commercial terminals (exhibit 15). Approximately a battalion       of U.K. Forces was also facilitating their own evacuation       operations out of the airport (exhibits 15, 18, 126). U.S.       Air Force C-17s were slow to arrive throughout 14-15 August       (exhibit 15). By the end of 14 August, there were       approximately 1600 U.S. and coalition forces at HKIA       (exhibits 13, 15, 18).        (i) On 15 August, Afghanistan's President Ghani departed       Kabul in a helicopter, abandoning the capital and the       government. Soon after, ANDSF leaders also fled (exhibits 13,       15, 18, 20, 21, 22, 23). This precipitated the dissolution of       the ANDSF, leaving the southern perimeter of the airport       unsecured. Simultaneously, USEK was evacuating personnel to       HKIA (exhibits 13, 15, 18, 20, 21, 22, 23). Ghani's departure       and the Embassy evacuation created a panic in the Kabul       population, and civilians began to rush the airfield in an       attempt to board departing or stationary aircraft (exhibits       13, 15, 18, 20, 21, 22, 23). On three separate occasions, on       15 August and into the hours of darkness of 16 August, large       crowds pushed across the HKIA flight line and near the North       HKIA footprint, forcing JTF-CR to empty their operations       center of personnel to push back the crowds (exhibits 15,       18). The presence of large crowds of civilians on the runways       halted air operations continuously throughout 16 August.        (ii) Three solutions to the airfield security problem       manifested during the next 24-48 hours. 1/82 IBCT forces       arrived on C-17s during the hours of darkness on 15-16       August, and JTF-CR immediately tasked them with airfield       security (exhibit 15). On 16 August, an OGA offered to bring       the NSU's approximately 1200-1300 personnel to provide       security at HKIA (on the condition of evacuating NSU       families) (exhibits 13, 15, 18, 21, 23).  [[Page S3267]]       Later on 16 August, the Taliban offered to help remove       civilians from the airfield. RADM Vasely accepted the       Taliban's offer, and Taliban forces began clearing and       securing the airfield (exhibits 15, 18, 21, 23). The addition       of these three forces was sufficient to clear the runway and       resume flight operations (exhibits 15, 18).        (iii) Once the perimeter was reestablished on 16 and 17       August, the Taliban took the South, the NSU took the North       and West, and 1/82nd took the West and overall security       responsibilities (exhibits 15, 18, 53, 103). JTF-CR continued       to manage the flow of combat forces into HKIA and into the       line to hold the tenuous status quo (exhibits 15, 18, 53,       103). Force flow over the next two days delivered the       remainder of the 1/82 IBCT, all of the 24th MEU Command       Element, the remainder of 1/8 Marines, the MEU Combat       Logistics Battalion (CLB), 2/1 Marines with enablers from the       CENTCOM SPMAGTF, and the TAC of the 82nd Airborne Division       (exhibits 15, 18, 53, 100, 102, 104, 121, 125). JTF-CR had       TACON of all forces providing security of HKIA until 17       August, when Gen McKenzie, CENTCOM Commander, tasked the 82nd       Airborne Division with security of HKIA (exhibits 8, 10, 11,       13, 15, 18, 21, 238). The JTF-CR retained sole responsibility       of NEO tasks and duties (exhibits 10, 11, 15, 18, 138, 238).        (d) During the execution of NEO, the JTF-CR managed three       critical tasks at the JTF level or through its subordinate       units: Gate Operations, ECC, and the Multi-National       Coordination Cell (exhibits 15, 17, 18).        (i) After being relieved of airfield security duties, 1/8       Marines (24th MEU) occupied North and East Gates, and 2/1       Marines (SPMAGTF) occupied Abbey Gate (exhibits 53, 103).       From 19-26 August, these gates were used to process and       screen tens of thousands of civilian evacuees (exhibits 15,       18). Commanders at each gate exercised their authority to       open or close their respective gates, as they deemed       appropriate, according to the situation on the ground       (exhibits 15, 53, 103). The JTF-CR Commander retained the       authority to reopen a gate if the gate commander had closed       it due to the threat environment or possible attack (exhibits       15, 18, 103). However, there was tremendous pressure from the       strategic level (Combatant Command (CCMD), Joint Staff (JS),       White House) to continue to process and evacuate civilians to       the maximum extent possible, so gate closures were done       rarely, locally, and temporarily (exhibits 15, 18, 53, 56,       77, 103, 121). For example, Abbey Gate did not physically       close until the night of 26 August (exhibit 53). JTF-CR's       management of gate operations also entailed reacting to the       overwhelming number of special requests to secure specific       evacuees from gates (exhibits 13, 15, 17, 20, 21, 22).       Members of the USFOR-A FWD, JTF-CR, MEU, 1/8, and 2/1 staffs       were constantly engaged in retrieving specially requested       individuals from the gates, with the lower echelons doing so       on behalf of JTF-CR (exhibits 13, 15, 18, 20, 21, 22, 23, 76,       108, 122).        (ii) The JTF-CR Commander was responsible for deciding when       to close Abbey Gate to facilitate the Joint Tactical       Exfiltration (JTE) (exhibits 13, 15, 17, 18, 22). Initially,       the JTF-CR sought to close the gate on the evening of 25       August (exhibits 18, 53, 77, 89, 126). However, U.K. Forces       were still operating at the Barron Hotel and could not meet       this timeline (exhibits 15, 18, 53, 77, 89, 126.). If the       JTF-CR Commander decided to close Abbey Gate while U.K.       Forces were still processing evacuees, it would have isolated       them at the Barron Hotel. This would have affected the JTE,       as the JTF-CR Commander estimated it would take 24-48 hours       to clear the outer corridor and facilitate U.K. Forces'       passage of lines into HKIA (exhibits 15, 18). Additionally,       if the JTF-CR closed Abbey Gate early, the crowds likely       would have breached the airfield, which posed a significant       risk to mission and risk to force (exhibits 15, 18).        (iii) The 24th MEU established the ECC at the passenger       (PAX) Terminal in North HKIA (exhibits 15, 18, 100, 101,       102). Evacuees waiting for flights consistently saturated       this area, creating a security concern (exhibits 100, 101).       As a result, JTF-CR tasked subordinate units to provide       security forces at the PAX Terminal to ensure evacuees did       not attempt to board the wrong flights or move into the       compounds on North HKIA (exhibits 15, 18, 101).        (iv) As the lead for NEO, JTF-CR hosted the MNCC (exhibits       18, 21, 145). At the MNCC, JTF-CR coordinated the       requirements of the multi-national partners to evacuate       personnel (exhibits 18, 21). This usually included       manifesting flights and coordinating appropriate arrival       destinations based on the status of evacuees (exhibits 18,       21).                            ____________________
