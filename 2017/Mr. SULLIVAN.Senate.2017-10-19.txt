 Mr. President, I know the Presiding Officer and all of  our colleagues and those watching today know that we have been focused  on the budget resolution. It is a very important document for the  country, for the Senate, and for the Congress. There are a lot of big  issues that we are all focused on, but there is one I wish to talk  about this morning that relates to the budget document. Actually, to be  perfectly frank, it relates to a number of the speeches made by my  colleagues on the other side of the aisle. They have been coming down  to the floor and talking about issues related to energy, which is  really important for America, the environment, which is also very  important to America, and--a little bit to my surprise, from all of  these experts coming to the floor--Alaska, which is my State.   I am going to say a little bit more about what some of my colleagues  have been talking about--my State. There seems to be a few experts on  Alaska from States like Massachusetts and Oregon. I just want to put  things in perspective from a Senator who is actually from the State and  not these other Senators who, to be honest, don't know much about what  they are talking about.   The one thing you are seeing is that it is for sure that you know  there is kind of an issue in the debate on the floor when you see  talking points that are just stale--talking points that, if you took a  speech from 30 or 40 years ago, are the same talking points. They are  stale talking points from the other side of the aisle that have been  used for decades, that haven't been updated or that don't reflect what  has really been happening in the country in terms of technological  advances, environmental standards, and one of the most important things  that has happened in America over the last decade, and that is the  American energy renaissance--the American energy renaissance.   I know some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle don't  even like to talk about it. They don't like to acknowledge it: As to  energy, we don't produce that in America. Yes, we do. Yes, we do. We  are doing it really, really well, and it is benefiting millions and  millions and millions of Americans in every State in the country.   The budget resolution that we are debating has a provision in it that  is really simple. I bet if you polled it with every American--Democrat,  Republican, people watching on TV--it probably has a 90-percent  approval.   There is a simple instruction in the budget resolution that says that  Congress needs to look at ways to increase Federal revenues by  increasing American energy production. What could be wrong with  increasing American energy production?   That provision that we are actually debating right now should be very  bipartisan. Who is against that? Who could be against that? Why is this  so important? Why is the American energy renaissance so important?   Well, as the Presiding Officer knows, because his State is certainly  involved in it, the energy renaissance that is happening in the United  States right now is a win, win, win, win, win on almost every category  you can imagine.   What do I mean by the energy renaissance? Right now in our great  Nation with our resources, we are producing more oil, more natural gas,  and more renewables than any other place in the world. That is really  good for the country. That is the renaissance. That is really a  revolution in energy production. It is something that you would think  on the Senate floor should be completely bipartisan. Unfortunately, it  isn't.   Let me talk a little bit about how this energy renaissance and what  is in the budget resolution will produce more energy for America by  Americans, which is good for the country. Let's count the ways. When I  said win, win, win, win, win, I wasn't joking. The wins are all on the  board.   First, there is energy security. For our Nation, it is lower cost  energy. With the increase in natural gas, we are seeing the drop in the  prices of natural gas for homes and manufacturers and increasing  manufacturing. These are enormously important for our Nation.   There is economic growth and jobs. In the energy sector, these are  good jobs. The Presiding Officer has a lot of these jobs in his State.  I have a lot of these jobs in my State. These are really important  jobs. When you look at  [[Page S6597]]  the weak economic growth in the United States over the last 10 years,  the one sector that is actually driving growth has been the energy  sector.   How about the trade deficit? It is a big problem. Everybody has  talked about it. The President is very focused on it. We are now  starting to export oil and export natural gas. My State has been  exporting natural gas for over four decades. That helps our trade  deficit.   Then, when you look at the Federal budget deficit, energy is a huge  positive impact on the Federal budget deficit. That is what the budget  resolution asks Congress to do in terms of policy: Let's produce more  energy so we can produce more revenue for the Federal Government. That  is a good idea. Nobody should be opposed to that.   Mr. President, as you know, when we are the world's energy  superpower, as we are, that really helps our national security. It  really helps our foreign policy. A lot of Americans have been concerned  for decades that we have troops in the Middle East, that we have troops  in areas where energy is really important. Well, let's produce it here.   I was in a meeting last year at the Munich Security Conference with  the great Senator from Arizona and many of my colleagues. It was  bipartisan. Senator McCain led that codel to the Munich Security  Conference in Germany. We met with a very prominent Russian dissident  who has been fighting and battling with Vladimir Putin. At the very end  of the meeting, we asked a simple question: What more can we do in the  United States to help somebody like you, who is battling against a  dictator who doesn't have our interest at heart? Do you know what this  very smart Russian official, a courageous man, said? He said: America  needs to produce more energy. That is how you take down the leadership  in the Kremlin--more energy.   This is national security.   Let me say one more thing that doesn't get talked about a lot. It is  not just helpful in all of these areas. When the United States of  America is producing energy, it helps the global environment. Some  people say: Well, wait a minute. A lot of the colleagues on the other  side of the aisle come to the floor and kind of insinuate that when our  country produces energy, it actually hurts the environment. That is not  the case. When the United States produces energy, it actually helps the  global environment.   Why is that the case? Let me just pause for a minute because, like I  said, a lot of my colleagues are coming to the floor and talking about  Alaska, energy, and the environment. Again, it is not with a lot of  knowledge. They are stale talking points, yes. They have been using  them for 40 years. Literally, I think one of my colleagues has been in  the Congress plus or minus 40 years and has been using the same talking  points on this.   As somebody who came to the Senate previously from a job as attorney  general and a commissioner of natural resources and energy in Alaska, I  know a little bit about this topic. I can tell you two important  points.   My colleagues talk a little bit about Alaska, the environment, and  energy. First, Senator Murkowski and I care a lot more about the  environment, the wildlife, the pristine wilderness in our great,  amazing State than any other Member in this body. I don't need Senators  coming down from places like Massachusetts, Oregon, Washington,  Vermont, and Rhode Island talking about Alaska's environment. OK?  Thanks. I don't need it. I care way more than any of them. With all due  respect, I know a heck of a lot more about it than any of them.   I also know this. In my State--and, I believe, in most of the  country, but particularly in Alaska--Democrats, Republicans, Alaskan  Natives, and non-Natives certainly support the highest standards on the  environment, but we also support responsible resource development. Here  is the key issue: We know we can do both. You can protect the pristine,  amazing Alaskan environment, and you can responsibly develop our  resources.   Let's talk about how we do this. Let's talk about how this applies to  Alaska and how this applies to the rest of the country in general.   As I mentioned, this is a really important point. We have the highest  standards on developing our resources and our energy than anywhere in  the world, and we have some of the most technologically advanced and  sustainable ways to develop resources in the energy sector. That allows  us to do what I just mentioned, which is to protect the environment and  to develop our resources.   Here is a really important point that a lot of my colleagues on the  other side of the aisle miss. They come down here, and this is what  they talk about--by the way, they were in alliance with the last  administration: How do we shut down energy development? How do we make  it harder? How do we delay it?   As I mentioned, I was attorney general and the DNR commissioner in  Alaska for almost 6 years of the Obama administration. It was all about  how to shut it down in Alaska, how to delay it in Alaska, and how to  shut it down in America. This is not what the country wants. This is  not what the country needs, and, certainly, it is one issue that is  often overlooked. This doesn't help the global environment, as they  claim. It doesn't. Why is that? Because when you chase away investment  in places like Alaska, with the highest standards on the environment in  the world, what does that do? That drives capital and that drives  investment to places like Russia, Iran, and Brazil, whose standards are  so much lower than ours.   Russians on the tundra in the Arctic don't care anything about their  environment. In my State and in the rest of America, we do.   I don't need to remind people that Russia and Iran right now are  certainly our adversaries. Yet the policies that some of my colleagues  like to promote, and certainly the last administration promoted, are to  drive away investment, drive away energy production in America, with  the highest standards in the world, so the Russians and the Iranians  can take the capital and produce energy. They do not have high  standards on the environment, and they are our adversaries. It makes no  sense--no sense.    So how do we do this in Alaska? What are the environmental standards  that almost no other place in the world--maybe Norway, maybe, to some  degree, Canada--uses? What is the technology that enables us to produce  American energy, with American jobs, with the American people, with the  highest standards in the world? Let me provide a few examples. First,  what I want everybody here to be aware of is, do not believe these  doomsday scenarios. Don't believe the misinformed commentary. When my  Democratic colleagues come to the floor, with very little knowledge  about what is really happening in this sector, don't believe it. When  they come to the floor and talk about a State like mine--Alaska--about  which they know next to nothing, don't believe it.   Let me give one infamous example. In the 1970s, we were debating in  the Senate--and I think one of my colleagues was maybe here then,  probably using the same talking points--the Trans-Alaska Pipeline  System, one of the greatest energy infrastructure projects in the  history of the world: 800 miles, 16 billion barrels of oil; at one  point, 2 million barrels a day, from Americans, in America.   The people who were against it came to the floor and said: Oh, no.  The Central Arctic caribou herd is going to be decimated if you do  this--these beautiful animals that we care so much about in Alaska.  Those were the arguments right on this floor. So what happened to the  Central Arctic caribou? Again, we care about these animals way more  than anybody else does in this body. In 1975, we had about 5,000  caribou; today, 66,000. I don't think the herd was decimated. We  haven't heard that from anybody because they don't know, but that is  the kind of doomsday scenario we heard from people with no knowledge,  and then, when it doesn't happen, we don't hear them on the Senate  floor saying: Oh, we were wrong about that.   Let me talk just briefly about some of what we do to make sure we do  this in the most responsible way in the world. First, in the energy  business, one thing we do is we explore. Again, in Alaska we have the  highest standards in the world. A lot of other places in the United  States have these standards. In the Arctic, we have what is called no  impact exploration. What does that mean? It means we literally do  everything to make sure there is no  [[Page S6598]]  impact on these great species like the polar bear. Again, we care a lot  more about our animals than my colleagues on the other side of the  aisle.   What does no impact exploration mean? Well, we undertake exploration  required by State standards--these are not Federal standards--where we  essentially have what are called ice roads and ice pads. Let me show my  colleagues what that means. We only allow for exploration in the winter  on the tundra. When an exploration crew comes out, they have to build  an ice road--it is a road made of ice--over the tundra. This photograph  is an example of an ice road. Then they do exploration on an ice pad.  They have drills, and they do all this work on the ice, on the tundra.  They have about 4 months to do it and then they are done and then they  leave.   What does the tundra look like after that exploration on ice? Right  here. This is just one capped exploration well. It is as though nobody  was even there--literally zero impact. These are Alaska standards, the  highest in the world. They are expensive, yes, but we do it because we  care so much about the environment. That is the exploration phase.   How about the production phase? What has happened in the production  phase? The innovations in technology, many of which have occurred in my  State, have made it so the surface footprint--when we actually put  together a production pad--has shrunk dramatically. When we look at  this chart, we see Prudhoe Bay in the 1970s. The other developments in  Alaska include Kuparuk, Alpine, and Liberty. What happens is, the  surface footprint has shrunk dramatically to 11, 12 acres now. Yet the  ability to horizontally drill extends the reach of these wells  underneath the ground, where we can reach resources in an incredibly  vast manner without impacting the environment at all.   If a rig was placed right here on the Capitol Building, in terms of  horizontal drilling, it could extend out to Andrews Air Force Base in  Southeast, Silver Spring, MD, to the north, and well into Fairfax  County--miles and miles and miles. Yet the surface footprint--the  impact on the environment--is minimal.   That is what we do. We don't hear about it from the other side of the  aisle, but it is really important, as we debate these issues, that all  Americans know this. More energy for the country is really positive.   In conclusion, tonight the budget resolution is not just going to be  a vehicle for tax reform, but there is also, as I mentioned, going to  be an instruction for increased revenues for the country for more  American energy production. It is a simple instruction.   As I mentioned, this should be very noncontroversial. What could be  wrong with more energy production, particularly in a State like mine,  where the standards are the highest in the world, and the technology is  the most advanced in the world. What could be controversial about more  energy production? More energy production means more American jobs,  more American economic growth, more American national security, more  American energy security, decreased Federal budgets and trade deficits,  and a more sustainable global environment because no one in the world  produces energy more responsibly than Americans, especially Alaskans.   Nevertheless, some of my Democratic colleagues will be putting forth  an amendment that does just the opposite. Think about that, an  amendment that says let's kill energy production, thereby undermining  American job growth, good jobs, American economic growth, American  national security and energy security, while increasing our budget and  trade deficits and harming the global environment. That is a lose-lose- lose scenario to me, but that is what is at stake tonight.   Later this afternoon, when we debate that amendment--and I certainly  ask all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to reject any  attempts to not take advantage of this incredible opportunity in  America--the American energy renaissance that we need to continue--and  this afternoon we are going to have an opportunity to do that.   Thank you.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.                         Nuclear Agreement With Iran
