 Madam Speaker, title X family planning services are an  essential lifeline for Mainers who need access to high-quality  preventive and reproductive care, from cancer screenings to STI  testings, to birth control. The resolution we are debating today  threatens access to these critical services.   Every year, Maine's network of title X providers serves more than  22,000 individuals in nearly every county, including some of the most  rural and underserved communities in our State. Sixty-five percent of  last year's patients had outcomes that qualified them for free or  reduced-cost services.   Family planning health centers often end up being their patients'  primary source of health care. Providers are trusted members of the  community. The care they deliver is high quality, and often they are  the only affordable local option. Without title X funds, thousands of  women and men throughout Maine would struggle to access and afford  alternative primary care.   At a time when Republicans want to repeal the Affordable Care Act  without a replacement plan, it is more important than ever to preserve  title X as a cornerstone of our safety-net healthcare system.
