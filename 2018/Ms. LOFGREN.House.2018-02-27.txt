 Mr. Chairman, section 230 of the Communications Decency  Act has been an important element of the law. It has allowed the  internet to flourish. We support that.   But we never intended section 230 to protect people who are  trafficking in human beings, who are abusing children, who are  prostituting children. Really, modern slavery. It is an outrage.   And when we saw the court cases about Backpage where they basically  used the CDA as a shield for action that was absolutely criminal, in my  judgment, those guys belong in prison, as far as I am concerned. The  good news is that the bill drafted by Representative Wagner actually  fixes this problem.   We just got a letter from the U.S. Department of Justice. I just  received it. This is what they say: ``Every day, trafficking victims in  America appear in online advertisements that are used to sell them for  sex. The Department works diligently to hold traffickers accountable  for their crimes but faces serious challenges.''   It goes on to say that the ``high evidentiary standard needed'' is a  problem; but it also says that that bill, as drafted and reported from  the Judiciary Committee, addresses the issues that are preventing  prosecution, and it ``would take meaningful steps to end the industry  of advertising trafficking victims for commercial sex.''   I would just like to say thanks to the authors of the bill, as well  as the Judiciary Committee, on which I serve. We worked together on a  bipartisan basis to make adjustments. We had hearings so that we could  have this bill that the Department of Justice says will allow them to  successfully go after these guys who are trafficking these children and  other victims.   A word of caution, however, and I will talk about this later when the  amendment comes up, on the Walters amendment.   The Justice Department says in this letter that they believe ``any  revision . . . to define `participation in a venture' is unnecessary,''  and, in fact, that the ``new language would impact prosecutions by  effectively creating additional elements.'' In fact, they say the  amendment will make it harder to prosecute.   We get told in law school that bad cases make bad law. One of the  ways to avoid that is to have the committee process work through it.  That did not happen in the case of the amendment that will be offered  later.   So based on the Justice Department's admonition, I am grateful to  their celebration of the underlying bill, and I am mindful of their  warning that the amendment could undo all of the good work that we have  done on a bipartisan basis.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition.    Mr. Chairman, section 230 of the Communications Decency  Act stands for a very simple, powerful idea: a website should not be  liable for the actions of its users.   Because of section 230, we have the internet as we know it today.  Also, because of section 230, the vast majority of websites can safely  and effectively report and coordinate with law enforcement on various  crimes, including sex trafficking, child pornography, and the like.   Unfortunately, section 230 has been utilized by bad actors, including  a notorious one, Backpage, to traffic in children and to exploit  victims. Really, they are slavery victims. The underlying bill, H.R.  1865, puts a stop to that. As the Department of Justice has noted, it  will allow for the prosecution of people who are trafficking in victims  online.   The Walters amendment, however, for the first time, would carve a  hole in section 230 and make it actually more difficult than the  underlying bill to prosecute traffickers online. By creating potential  liability for ``knowing'' that a user is using their website for  facilitating sex trafficking, the Walters amendment would create what  legal experts call the moderator's dilemma.   There is no obligation under law to moderate your website. In fact,  if you  [[Page H1303]]  have 2 million users or 10 million users, you really don't know what is  being posted by your users. But under this amendment, if you made any  effort to try and find out what was happening among your users--as many  websites do today, especially for child pornography, but also for  trafficking--you would incur liability because you would then have a  reason to know.                                time  1515    Other laws that deal with intermediary liability, such as a  requirement to report child pornography or copyright safe harbors of  the DMCA, have very clear and specific provisions on when a website has  sufficient knowledge and what express actions it should take. The  Walters amendment has none of these. There is no case law on it either.   So the amendment really would put web owners in a very weird place.  If you do anything to moderate, you are risking liability. The safe  incentive would be to not monitor at all. That would be tragic and it  would be a gain for child predators, although I know that that is not  the intention. You can't stop moderating just for trafficking. You  either moderate or you don't moderate.   We do know that there have been tremendous advances for machine- operated filters to find child pornography. Actually, that is one of  the easiest things to find, using filters, and it is very important  that websites cooperate with law enforcement to catch those bad guys.   Under the Walters amendment, the disincentive would be huge not to do  that. I think that is why the Department of Justice does not support  the Walters amendment.   As I said earlier--and the chairman put the letter into the Record-- the Department believes that any revision to define participation in a  venture is unnecessary. They say that, while well-intentioned, this new  language would impact prosecutions by effectively creating additional  elements that prosecutors would have to prove at trial.   That is why it is a bad idea to adopt this amendment. As the chairman  of the committee has said, section 4 of the amendment also violates the  ex-post facto clause of the Constitution by attaching criminal  liability to actions that preceded the enactment of the bill. This is  clearly unconstitutional.   Although I don't have any doubt as to the good intentions behind the  offering of this amendment, it would actually impair the ability to  protect victims. It would make it more difficult to prosecute, as the  Department of Justice has pointed out.   It didn't go through the Judiciary Committee. I think that is a major  fault. One of the things we were able to do in the committee--and we  did this together, on a bipartisan basis--was to sort through the  unintended consequences of seemingly simple language.   Nothing in writing law is simple. Certainly, nobody wants a provision  that is going to negatively impact prosecutions; have unintended  consequences for State actions, as the Department of Justice has  pointed out; and would provide a disincentive for people to moderate  activities to try and catch bad guys and to work with law enforcement.   So, although the intentions are good, the amendment is flawed. I hope  we vote ``no'' on it, and then I hope we give a resounding unanimous  vote ``yes'' for the underlying bill.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.
