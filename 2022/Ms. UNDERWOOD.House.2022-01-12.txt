 Mr. Speaker, I rise to urge the Senate to protect our  fundamental right to vote.   Communities of color are disproportionately targeted by the wave of  voter suppression laws we have seen across America. These attacks are  just the latest battle in the centuries-long, racially fueled war on  voting rights in our country.   But the right to vote is foundational to our democracy. Without it,  we would cease to be a government of, by, and for the people.   This is a life-and-death issue for America itself. The late  Congressman John Lewis wrote that ``Democracy is not a state. It is an  act.''   I urge my colleagues in the Senate to act, to prioritize democracy  and ensure access to the ballot box is not undermined. I urge them to  send voting rights legislation to President Biden's desk to be signed  into law.                            ____________________
