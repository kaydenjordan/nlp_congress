 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr.  Reschenthaler) for yielding.   I rise to oppose the previous question so that we can immediately  consider Representative French Hill's H.R. 8589 to prohibit the  Securities and Exchange Commission from trading its independence and  statutory authority away in the name of alarmist climate advocacy.   The proposed climate change rule from the Securities and Exchange  Commission will further crush our fragile economy, and struggling  families will ultimately pay the price.   Mr. Speaker, yesterday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics released the  Consumer Price Index numbers for the month of August. As has been  mentioned already today, CPI surged to 8.3 percent, above projections,  still a 40-year high, showing that this inflation crisis is not going  away anytime soon.  [[Page H7808]]  Americans are paying more for everything, and rising prices continue to  wreak havoc on farmers, middle-class families, and small businesses  struggling to stay afloat all across America.   Of course, Democrats' overspending for the last year and a half has  produced excess demand, pushing up prices, but no amount of Fed  tightening can fix the inflationary supply-demand mismatch without also  addressing the supply side.   At the heart of this inflation crisis is the Biden administration's  war on American energy production. This policy of deliberately  constraining the supply of energy is taking its toll on the American  people. According to a Penn Wharton study, inflation reduced the  purchasing power of American households by approximately $6,000 last  year. That is like taking an entire paycheck away for an entire month  for every American household.   Real earnings, hourly earnings, dropped 2.8 percent over the year in  August. Wages are down because of this inflation crisis. Credit card  debt is up. It hit an all-time high last month.   One in six American households are now behind paying their  electricity bills and in danger of losing their utility services  altogether, with natural gas prices up 30 percent since last July.  Effectively, electricity prices are now up 15 percent, a 14-year high.   When Joe Biden took office, the average price of gasoline was $2.36  per gallon. Today, the average gas price in America is $3.72 per  gallon, and stubbornly, diesel prices are much, much higher. That goes  into everything: transportation, manufacturing, farmers having to fill  up the tank on their tractors. All of that is passed on at the retail  point of sale. In less than 2 years, America has gone from energy  dominant to energy desperate.   Mr. Speaker, ground zero for the Biden administration's war on  American energy is the weaponization of financial regulation and the  politicization of access to capital.   What do I mean by this? We all know that the Biden administration  killed the Keystone XL pipeline and other critical energy  infrastructure projects. We know that they are frustrating the  construction of new refineries. We know that they have held up 4,400  drilling permits. But ground zero is the weaponization of financial  regulation to deny American energy the access to the capital that they  need to invest in a very capital-intensive business.   Throughout the executive branch, at the Treasury Department, the  Securities and Exchange Commission, the Federal Reserve, the OCC, and  other financial regulators, Biden has installed or nominated unelected  climate alarmists and given them free rein to attack American energy  businesses, all in the name of climate change.   The sad irony, Mr. Speaker, is that if we want to innovate and  actually solve climate change, we wouldn't be denying American energy  companies and the scientists there access to financing. We would be  giving them more financing to innovate and to solve the problem the  American way, through free enterprise and innovation. One of these  radical nominees even called for bankrupting American fossil fuel  companies.   Perhaps the most dangerous regulation issued by the Biden  administration to destroy American energy is the SEC's climate risk  disclosure rule proposed in March. This 534-page monstrosity marks the  transformation of the SEC from an independent agency dedicated to  investor protection to an unaccountable and politicized bureaucracy  intent on advancing radical environmental and social policy over which  it has neither expertise nor jurisdiction.   This proposed rule is totally disconnected from the longstanding  investor-driven materiality standard and will politicize the agency and  reduce its credibility by hurting investors, elevating nonpecuniary  factors above financial returns, and steering retail investors into  lower performing, higher fee, and less-diversified ESG investments.   As a reminder, Mr. Speaker, the statutory mission of the SEC is to  protect investors; maintain fair, orderly, and efficient markets; and  facilitate capital formation. This is not about protecting investors.  It is about hurting investors. It is not about capital formation. It is  about capital destruction. It is definitively not to reduce carbon  emissions or solve climate change, but the SEC is wading into  environmental policy debates like climate change with its top-down,  government-directed, one-size-fits-all mandatory environmental, social,  and governance disclosure regulation, or ESG.   SEC Chair Gary Gensler claims that the requirements in the proposal  are material because institutional investors are demanding this  information. But according to a study conducted by the University of  Chicago and FINRA, only 21 percent of surveyed retail investors in this  country even knew what ESG stands for.   The fact of the matter is, retail investors are not demanding this  information. They want returns, not politics, guiding their retirement  and college savings.    What do retail investors really care about? Yesterday's bloodbath in  the stock market when the Dow plummeted by over 1,000 points in a  single day, the worst drop since June 2020.   That tells me what investors actually want, Mr. Speaker, and it is  returns. They need returns. They don't need an inflationary environment  that is eating away their purchasing power and rising interest rates  because of it that result in turmoil in the financial markets,  destroying retirement savings.   ESG funds are hurting American investors. They are tech-heavy, and in  a market where tech stocks are in a massive sell-off and are vastly  underperforming non-ESG funds that contain investments in energy, who  are the losers? Retail investors who are unwittingly invested in and  overexposed to ESG. On top of that, ESG funds charge 43 percent higher  fees than non-ESG funds.   In short, the government is redirecting capital away from energy, and  it is costing retail investors, which include teachers, police  officers, and other ordinary Americans saving for retirement,  extraordinary amounts of money.   But, today, Congress can actually do something to protect investors.  I am leading this previous question that would amend the rule to  immediately consider H.R. 8589, legislation offered by the gentleman  from Arkansas (Mr. Hill), my friend, to stop this SEC rule in its  tracks before it causes more damage to retail investors and to  Americans struggling to keep up with unsustainable energy prices.   Mr. Speaker, House Republicans will keep pushing for America to get  back to basics. We need to deliver economic relief to the American  people to alleviate the pain of inflation. To do that, we need to  unleash the supply side. That means more, not less, financing of  American energy to lower the price at the pump, to reduce the cost of  heating your home.   Yes, Mr. Speaker, we need financial advisers to get back to the  basics of investing. That means diversified portfolios that include  American energy, not just tech, because the point of investing your  hard-earned money isn't to further a political agenda or some far-left  view of America that some woke asset manager on Wall Street thinks.  Instead, it is to generate a financial return that will enable you to  send your kid to college, ensure you can live a comfortable life in  retirement, or pursue some other aspect of your American Dream.   Yes, Mr. Speaker, it is about capital formation. It is about giving  heroic American energy companies access to the capital and the  financing that they need, not only to make energy affordable and  reliable for the American people but to make America competitive in the  global economy.   It is for all of these reasons, Mr. Speaker, that I urge my  colleagues on the other side of the aisle to join me in supporting this  previous question.                                time  1330     Mr. Speaker, let me respond to my friend from Maryland on  some of the specific points that he made in rebuttal to my opposition  to the previous question.   The gentleman says that we don't want to talk about the underlying  bills.   What Republicans want to talk about is what the American people are  worried about, which is rising prices. What we are focused on is  opposing a previous question so that we could actually go and consider  legislation that would actually help improve the record inflation, 40- year-high inflation that Americans are suffering with.   What we are talking about is how we are going to lower the pain at  the pump and lower the cost of heating your home, which is at a 15-year  high in America right now. That is what Republicans want to talk about;  what the American people actually care about right now.   The gentleman says that, Oh, unemployment is down.   Let me tell you the statistic that matters.   It is the fact that we have 12 million unfilled jobs in America  because the Democrats' spending spree has paid Americans to not go to  work, because employers in my district and every district around the  country can't find labor.   The supply-demand mismatch that has produced this inflation crisis is  the result of fiscal policy errors. It is the result of a war on  American energy constraining the supply of energy. It is because of  excessive spending that has discouraged people to return to the labor  force.   So we have excess demand from overspending, and we have constrained  labor supply and constrained energy supply, which is impounded into  everything and results in higher retail prices.   The gentleman says that, Oh, don't look here; don't look at us; don't  look at the Biden administration's war on energy and labor supply. No,  it is not that. It is not the Fed that continued to keep interest rates  too low for too long and flooded our money supply at a time when all of  these fiscal policy errors were going on. No, it is not that. It is  global inflation.   Well, why is it, then, in March of 2021, at the precise time that  this Congress passed the American recovery plan, $2 trillion of unpaid- for spending, why is it then that U.S. inflation rates became  untethered from global price increases? That is what happened, in  synchronicity with their legislation.   Mr. Speaker, finally, he blames Vladimir Putin.   Gas prices on the day Vladimir Putin invaded Ukraine were the highest  in 40 years. Inflation was over 8 percent on the CPI, the highest in 40  years, the highest since 1981 on the day Vladimir Putin invaded  Ukraine.   This is not about Vladimir Putin. It is about Americans not producing  energy anymore.   And why do we want this particular legislation, the legislation to  block the SEC's climate disclosure rule? Because we need more financing  of American energy.    Mr. Speaker, I would argue to my friend from Maryland, also, if the  obsession on the other side with the climate, if that is the concern,  if that is why we have this SEC rule, if that is why we have weaponized  financial regulators to go after the American energy sector and  redirect capital and financing away from the American energy sector, if  that is the solution to climate change, I want the gentleman to explain  that to me. Because the best scientists in the world working on the  issue of carbon capturing, carbon sequestration, and harnessing the  carbon cycle, they work at American energy companies.   The answer to climate change is not to centralize power in Washington  and add a thousand pages to the Federal Register. That will not change  the weather. What will solve climate change is to solve that problem  the American way. The American way is through innovation, technology,  and science, and that means robust, free enterprise. That means more,  not less capital formation. That means more financing of American  energy, more financing of innovation. That is the Republican solution  to climate.   It is also the Republican solution to our energy crisis and our  inflation crisis. That is what we are focused on, not these bills that  the American people don't care about.   We are focused on lowering prices at the grocery store and at the  pump and financing American competitiveness, American innovation, and  American know-how.   That is what we want to do.                                time  1345     We may have found a point of bipartisan agreement that we  all dislike Vladimir Putin. But one of the main reasons why Vladimir  Putin was able to invade Ukraine was the removal of deterrence:  unilaterally waiving sanctions on Nord Stream 2, refusing to respond  for a full year of a buildup, inviting aggression by retreating from  Afghanistan, and signaling to our allies that we are not coming to help  you. That might be one of the reasons why we have a problem with  Vladimir Putin right now.   To the gentleman from Maryland's argument that we are just purporting  to speak for all Americans, we are the Representatives of the American  people, and we are their only voice in this Chamber. I am not  purporting to speak for Americans. I am telling you what my  constituents in Kentucky are telling me.   Charlie from Fleming County says that he can't afford to fill up his  tractor as a farmer because diesel prices are where they are. He says:  I don't know where they get their numbers in Washington, Congressman,  but it feels three times 8 percent on the CPI.   Lorna from Mount Sterling, Kentucky, owns a floral business, a Main  Street small business, and everything costs more. She said: This is not  the America I know.   Then, Jamie, who is a mom of two kids, she goes to get baby formula.  She goes to the grocery, and she can't afford groceries. She tries to  fill up her car to take her kids on errands, and she can't afford it.   This is not purporting to speak for the American people. These are  the American people, and they are suffering because this administration  will not fix the supply side.  [[Page H7812]]    They raise taxes on businesses, which discourages business investment  and capital expenditures that we need to fix the supply bottlenecks.  They raise prices at the pump by declaring war on American energy  production by weaponizing financial regulation. They refuse to take  actions that actually will solve the supply problem by encouraging  people to go back to work.   We don't need to be discouraging people from going back to work. We  need to fill those 12 million unfilled jobs right now by encouraging  productivity and American people going back to work.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to defeat the previous question so  that we can go to some legislation that would actually help lower  prices, what the American people do care about, not what they purport  to care about, what they tell us they care about, and that is lowering  prices.   This bill would help us do that because it would unlock the financing  we need to make America energy dominant once again and lower prices  across the board.
