 Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to be recognized to  address you here on the floor of the United States House of  Representatives.   I come to the floor today to raise the issue and be thankful of the  progress that we have made with regard to trade. We have been through a  year and a half or more of intense trade negotiations. I have watched  as our markets took a hard hit and tailspinned down for a couple of  days, down the limit awhile back, and slowly creep back in again.   We produce a lot of corn, soybeans, cattle, hogs, eggs, and renewable  energy in the Fourth Congressional District of Iowa. In fact, it is the  number one egg-producing congressional district in all of America.   We saw a publication on the part of Bloomberg that when the tariffs  were put onto Chinese goods coming into the United States by President  Trump, the Chinese retaliated with tariffs on products like pork and  soybeans. Bloomberg just showed a map of the United States where that  hit the hardest and it happened to hit exactly over the red counties in  America that produce a lot of corn and soybeans, and you could add to  that the other products I mentioned, Mr. Speaker.   The situation that we are dealing with now is that we have gotten a  long way through these trade negotiations, and we are coming around to  the other side of it with China. In spite of all of this difficulty in  all these markets that have been suppressed over this period of time,  we found some new trade outlets.   For one thing, instead of having one big pipe going to China, we have  got multiple, smaller pipes going to other locations in the world. And  today the President signed phase 1 of the trade agreement that will  increase by about $16 billion a year our egg product exports to China.  That includes a lot of soybeans, it includes a lot of pork, and it  fixes that component.   It also addresses the intellectual property issue that has been a big  barrier for the trade negotiations with China. The value of U.S.  intellectual property--the creation that comes out of the minds of  Americans--is pirated by the Chinese somewhere between $500 and $600  billion a year. That gets addressed to a degree in this agreement and  it gets addressed again in the next phase of the agreement.   U.S. Trade Representative Lighthizer has spoken on that issue to me,  and he seems to be, I will say, fairly confident that we are going to  get at least a reasonable beginning to something that is awfully hard  to fix.    I would add also that it isn't just China. We are waiting now for the  U.S. Senate to pass the USMCA Agreement. It is only the impeachment  trial that stands in the way of getting that done. That will happen  soon, within about a month or so, or perhaps less.   Further we have Japan, we have South Korea, and by the end of this  month the United Kingdom will be out of the E.U., and the door is open  for a bilateral trade agreement with the British.   If we could get that all done, as I said to the President the other  day, we may find ourselves in the very best position we have ever been  in, at least in our lifetime, with regard to trade in multiple  locations, so that we are diversified in our markets so that we can  send out to multiple countries and at the same time have a strong  relationship with China and other countries.   We are moving into an excellent position here. We have got a strong  economy, and we have got a strong Dow. This really is a great time to  make investments in America, and they are doing that from around the  world.   Mr. Speaker, I congratulate the President today.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, it is my privilege and honor to  address you here on the floor of the House of Representatives. And  given that we have had some serious discussion here this evening, I  really appreciate my colleagues, Chris Smith and others, who have spent  an hour addressing the life issue here.   As we come up on the anniversary of Roe v. Wade, January 22--I  believe that is a date that will live in infamy--America is becoming a  more and more pro-life country. And as we watch the transition that is  taking place in this country, that has to do with the March for Life  that comes out here every year, when thousands of people, many, many  young people ride from my neighborhood about 18 or 20 hours on a bus to  get here, and they gather on The Mall for the events and the speeches  and the rally and then march to the Supreme Court building. We often  host them here with some hot chocolate.   Each of these years that go by, I meet more and more young people  that have become part of the pro-life network. So the network that is  here, it strengthens people. They look around and they see that they  are not alone. They come from churches; they come from schools; they  come from families; they come from neighborhoods; and they understand  that they are not alone, that there is a patchwork of people that are  active across this country that is emerging into the majority in  America.   I will submit that we are now a majority pro-life nation, and that  would be consistent with polling, the Barna poll that we did about, I  suppose, a year and a half ago or a little more that showed that, just  on the Heartbeat bill alone, which I happen to be the author of, H.R.  490, that we saw 61 percent support for the Heartbeat bill, without  exceptions. Republicans were up at about 85 or 86 percent; independents  were around in the 60th percentile; and Democrats are even in support  of it, in the majority, at 59 percent of Democrats.   So it may have been that America was a little bit ignorant about the  beginning of life and the science of life and the moment that life  begins, but we all knew that in our hearts when, in 1973, it was one  thing, and it was a political agenda that was driven.   And Norma McCorvey regretted that she happened to be Jane Roe. So she  actually didn't get an abortion, and she became pro-life in her later  years and became a pro-life activist.   So it didn't serve her, and it surely didn't serve America. But some  number of over 61 million American babies have been aborted since that  period of time.   And there have been struggles in this city. There have been women  that come to this city and march for abortion, and so many women who  come and march for life.   But here is what I see. In 1976, Mr. Speaker, our firstborn child  came into the world; and, of course I anticipated that with eager and  nervous anticipation.   But when that little boy--actually, not so little. He was almost 9  pounds. When he went into my hands and my arms and I looked at him and  I held him in awe at the miracle that he was and is today, it was just  stunning to me that, from my wife, Marilyn, and I came this little  baby, this miracle.   To look at him, to look in his eyes, to see his dark hair, and he  turned out to be a blue-eyed, dark-haired little guy, and he had a lot  of hair on his head, and it was just such a miracle to see and count  the fingers and toes and look how perfectly they were formed.                                time  1945    As he lay in his crib, I would sit and look at him, and there was an  aura about that little baby boy. There was an aura about him. And you  could have convinced me that he was the second coming of Jesus Christ,  that is how strong that was to me, that little boy miracle.   As I looked at that, I thought this little guy here, how could  anybody take his life now in these first minutes of his life or how  could someone take his life the minute before he was born or the hour  before or the day before he was born or the week or the month or the  trimester, the first, second, or third trimester?   And I just thought that through as I held that little miracle in my  hands, and I knew that this life was precious and a miracle the moment  that I could hold him and touch him and see him and feel that warmth  and smell that fresh baby smell on him. And within minutes I went back  through this process of development of this miracle from the moment of  conception until birth.   And at that moment I knew that you couldn't take that little baby's  life at any point in this stage. I knew that his life began at the  moment of conception. And from that moment on this miracle and millions  and millions of other miracles needed to be protected from that moment  on, that life begins at the moment of conception. That was 1976.   Twenty years later I went out to San Diego to the Republican National  Convention, and certainly I had all of my colors on and all the things  that are attached to your lapels and your delegation credentials that  are out there. And on a Thursday afternoon at 3:00 I see on the tri- fold schedule there that said Christian Women for Choice are gathering  there in San Diego at a location about a block and a half away from the  convention center.   Something called me internally and said, you have to go down there  and see what is going on. I was curious. What scripture would be quoted  to me from Christian Women for Choice? I took a friend with me and we  went down and found this area. It was about an acre, I suppose, in  size, maybe a little less, chain-link fence all the way around, stage  in the middle, big old speakers up there and microphones. There were  people still milling around, but there wasn't a program going on on the  stage at that point.   I went to an individual that looked like he was at least associated  with somebody in charge and I asked him who was the leader of this and  who is the head of the Christian Women for Choice. And he said, that is  my wife, and he pointed to her and took me over and introduced me. We  ended up on the stage. And as that conversation began, it became a  debate.   And I remember there in San Diego, for every delegate--I remember the  number they told me--there was as many as 15,000 press in that city to  cover the convention.   So we had quite a lot of press in that protest zone where they would  be looking for controversy. So the leader of Christian Women for Choice  and I went at it in kind of a no-holds barred debate that just clashed  back and forth between us. And several of the others would chime in for  her, and every once in a while her husband would put his chin up over  her shoulder, and he would bark some things at me, too.   Mr. Speaker, I was far enough from home and convicted enough, having  enough conviction for those that don't understand what that means, that  I could just unload all of the things that needed to be said in the  middle of that debate.   She began to demand that we go out and collect the billions of  dollars in child support that is owed by deadbeat dads is what she  called them. And I said, I am happy to do that. I think they need to  pay their child support, and I will be working to do that--it turned  out in the Iowa Senate for starters--but you can't make that  [[Page H292]]  claim because that father doesn't have anything to say about whether  that child is going to be born or not. If the mother is the only one  that has anything to say, then when that child is born you don't have  the claim that the father needs to pay the child support. Save the  baby's life, protect this baby, and then we can hold the father to  this. I am happy to do that. You don't have any claim to that, because  you don't give the father any say in whether that baby is going to be  born or not.   And what I didn't hear anybody say here in this pro-life discussion  that we had is the pain that a father goes through when the mother  decides to abort the baby. I know people who have gone through that  pain and that agony, and they were helpless to do anything about it.  They want the baby. They say, I will raise the baby. It is mine. This  is my flesh and blood. Give birth to this baby and I will take care of  this baby for life. And when the mother says no, sometimes it is even a  spiteful act. And I have had that happen close enough to me that I know  that to be fact as well, Mr. Speaker.   But in that debate with the head of Christian Women for Choice in San  Diego in 1996 two things came out of that. Sometimes when you are  tested under fire you get to a place where the principles are tempered  to a point where they are no longer negotiable and they are as rock  solid as they can be.   Now I stand in auditoriums in schools K through 12, wherever the  situation might be, and I will say to them, ``One day in your lives you  will have this question come up around you, whether it is you asking  the question or whether it is a friend of yours, acquaintance, or a  relation, and it will be the question of abortion. Here are the two  things you need to know''--and I will ask this question first, I will  say, ``Is human life sacred in all of its forms?'' And they look a  little bit slightly confused about what does ``all of its forms'' mean.  And I say, ``Look at the person next to you. You are sitting next to  one of your friends. Is that person's life sacred?'' And they are  looking at you, Is your life sacred? And they will nod their heads and  say, ``Yes, our lives are sacred.'' I say, ``So if you believe that  human life is sacred, then is there any form of human life that is not  sacred?'' How about someone that is a paraplegic, a quadriplegic,  someone who is incapable of functioning verbally or getting up and  moving in any way; is that person's life sacred? I say, yes, and so do  they. They recognize that we have to have passion and compassion for  all human beings.    And so then once you establish that human life is sacred in all of  its forms, then I say to them: Now you only have to ask one other  question and that is, at what moment does life begin? Does it begin a  week after birth? Does it begin the day after birth? Does it begin the  minute after birth? That doesn't make sense to anybody in that  gymnasium. These are young people, but they understand some things that  seem to be confused over here some days, Mr. Speaker.   I say to them, ``What about that baby a minute before the baby is  born, is that life?'' And some of them might look a little confused,  but most of them know it is life. But I will say, But how about the  week before? How about the month before? How about if that baby is born  by cesarean, when does that baby become alive? Is it the moment the  mother is opened up by the surgeon in cesarean and that baby is brought  forward? How could that be?   We take it back to the moment of conception. We say even more  accurately, the moment of fertilization, but the moment of conception.   We get to this place where most every young person in that gathering  understands human life is sacred in all of its forms. It has to be the  highest value that we have, and that it begins at a moment and the only  moment that exists is the moment of conception. From there on out it is  a matter of continuum and continual growth and continual cell division,  continual metabolism getting to the point where that baby is in a  condition to be able to live outside the womb. And then we nurture that  baby, up on that baby's feet, we nurture that baby all the way through  until that baby is in a condition where they can take care of  themselves and eventually take care of their own parents and their own  children. That is life. It is precious.   If you sit around in a household in a family, especially when we go  through the holidays that we have gone through, Thanksgiving,  Christmas, and New Year's, where families gather together and you watch  with joy as they interact with each other, and you know there might be  in some of these homes--you know there are--there is grandpa's empty  chair over in the corner, he is gone now. He is missed. There is a  vacancy in the chair and there is a vacuum in the family because maybe  grandpa or grandma has been such a big part of that family, but they  still cherish the joy that they have shared. They don't often lay an  empty cradle there in the living room for that baby that was aborted,  but that is also the soul and the spirit that is not there to share in  that family joy as well.   This Nation has aborted 61-plus million babies. The back of the  envelope calculation says that if half of them were girls and you look  at the frequency of abortion going back to 1973 in the years that these  women would be having babies you can easily get to the place where we  are not just missing 61 million--I say that; it sounds odd even as I  say it--we are not missing 61 million, as appalling and as ghastly as  that is, we are probably missing another 61 million of the babies that  were never born because their mothers were aborted. Add it up. Call it  120 million. Round it back to 100 million.   Here we are in this country, we have aborted a workforce of 100  million. And I hear over here, well, we have to import people into  America. We have to have cheap foreign labor because, after all, the  total fertility rate is low enough in America. We are not replacing  ourselves, and we are not raising enough workers to fill the gap.   I recall in the Iowa Senate there was a bill to require each health  insurance policy to cover contraceptives and the female State Senators  made this argument--back then we were at a full employment workforce as  well, Mr. Speaker, as full as it is right now. Right now we are kind of  knocking on the door of the lowest unemployment we have had in Iowa.  Well, we had that back in about 1997 or 1998, as well. Some of the  State Senators went off to the women's State legislators gathering, and  they came back with this idea that was going to spread all over the  country: every health insurance policy has to cover contraceptives.  Here is the argument they made: They said, with this short workforce  that we have, this full employment economy we have, we can't afford to  have women missing work because they are pregnant and having babies and  taking care of babies. And back then I said, Who is going to do the  work in the next generation or two if we don't have babies being born  now? How do you fill that gap? It seemed to me to be a simple equation  that I had raised, but yet their agenda worked opposite it.   We need to remember, this Nation has sinned, and this sin of abortion  weighs on the conscience of a country, a country that could well have  100 million more American babies born here, raised here, learning our  civilization, learning our culture, learning our history, learning our  language, sharing and growing an even greater Nation than we are today.  And the recovery of that is heavy.   Even when we end this ghastly practice of aborting babies, innocent,  unborn human life, we have a long way to go to ever get back to where  nature would have had us if we hadn't interfered with abortion.   It troubles me a great deal. And one of the things I have done is  drafted and introduced the Heartbeat Protection Act. That is H.R. 490.  What it does is it protects any baby with a heartbeat. In fact, it says  this: If a heartbeat can be detected, the baby is protected. It is  really that simple. And so it requires that if an abortionist is  preparing to perform his trade, he must first do an ultrasound. If that  ultrasound produces a heartbeat, then that is the first certain  physical sign of life in the womb, a heartbeat, and that is about 6  weeks into pregnancy. We don't punish the mother. We do punish the so- called physician, the abortionist. If a heartbeat can be detected, the  baby is protected. And in the last Congress we took it to 174  cosponsors.   Mr. Speaker, it protects every baby because it is innocent, unborn  human  [[Page H293]]  life. These sacred souls, and I believe that God places a soul in that  little baby at the moment of conception. But their sacred, little  souls, we protect all of them.    There has been some discussion here in this Congress and around the  country about exceptions for rape and incest. This bill doesn't have  exceptions for rape and incest. We had the votes to pass it off the  floor of the House in the previous Congress a little more than a year  ago, and we had the votes to sustain it going through the Judiciary  Committee in the previous Congress a little more than a year ago. We  didn't get this to the markup in Judiciary. We had a hearing, we didn't  get it to markup, and therefore, we didn't get it to the floor. I fear  that we have failed an opportunity that we could have sent a very  strong message over to the Senate, which likely would not have taken it  up.   But to the rest of America, that having exceptions for rape or incest  says that those babies are not precious. I argue that they are as  precious to God as my own grandchildren are precious to me. There  cannot be a legal distinction between a baby that is born as a result  of conception that comes from rape or that comes from incest. In fact,  they are as precious as any others.   In this legislation, H.R. 490, if we were to incorporate exceptions  for rape and incest what we would have instead would be exceptions that  the Court could look at and say, Just a minute. What about equal  protection under the law? If there is going to be equal protections for  all persons, whether born or unborn, then if there are exceptions for  unborn persons that are the result of the act of rape or incest, then  doesn't the Court look at that and conclude that we are inconsistent  and that the equal protection clause really doesn't apply and that  Congress didn't apply the equal protection clause to all of the unborn?                                time  2000    We must protect all of them, Mr. Speaker.   From a moral standpoint, it is the right thing to do. From a legal  and analytical standpoint, and with an anticipation of a court that  would one day see this legislation--I would never sue on this, but you  know the other side will--we have to make sure that we are consistent  and that we are legally sound without exceptions for rape and incest.   Furthermore, if you have incest that is taking place in a family, if  you allow abortions for incest, that means that the family member that  is perpetrating incest on usually the innocent young girl gets a pass  each time there is an abortion because there is not evidence of his  crime.   But if you prohibit abortions for the sake of incest, you are likely  to uncover the crime of the family member that is abusing, generally,  the young lady within the family.   So I am grateful for my colleagues, that they came here and each one  of them spoke up with passion for innocent, unborn human life.   We will get there one day. Just like Dr. Martin Luther King said: I  may not get there with you, but we are going to get there.   We will be a pro-life nation by law, and we will recognize these  lives from the moment they are conceived within the womb.   Mr. Speaker, I will conclude the component of this discussion on the  life issue. Again, I thank my colleagues for the work that they do.                       Correct the Congressional Record     Mr. Speaker, I just wanted to make a short comment  here on another circumstance that has taken place in this Congress, and  it works out like this, that a year ago last week, an unprecedented  action took place in this Congress, and that was I did an interview  with The New York Times, and I was misquoted in The New York Times.   That quote, some people would say that, well, it was an organic,  spontaneous eruption of social media and print media. I say, instead,  no, it was an organized effort to set this up and create a railroaded  firestorm against me.   I knew that that was going to take place, and I will tell you, Mr.  Speaker, why I know that. And that is, even though there was a nearly  perfect storm created against me in the previous election, and we  emerged from that with a victory, after the election and before  Christmas of 2018, a very highly placed and respected political  operative said to me they are going to try again. They have chosen a  messenger to go to the President, and this messenger has the  President's ear.   The messenger is to convince the President to send out a negative  tweet on me, and that negative tweet is supposedly going to trigger the  worst firestorm of media assault on me that could possibly be  unleashed, and that they would make that try again in that way.   Well, I preempted that at the White House to the extent I could, and  I believe that was successful. In fact, I have no doubt that that was  successful.   Then, by January 8 of last year, I was able to get a meeting with  that messenger, who said, ``I would never do that to you, Steve,'' but  that also let the messenger know that I knew what the strategy was and  what the attempt would be. I let them know that I am going to blow this  thing wide open and tell the public what was going on if they made that  effort.   That was on January 8. That sent the message through, perhaps, to any  planners and strategists that I knew what was up.   The very next day, a State senator announced that he would challenge  me in a primary. That was at 11:23 a.m. He had no media planned. He had  no website. He had no activities or any kind of evidence that he was  planning to run that was at least on paper. Still, he announced by  Twitter that he was going to run against me.   He was also scheduled to swear in to the next General Assembly, the  Iowa General Assembly, on the following Monday, about 4 days later. The  most improbable time for anyone to announce they are going to run in a  primary against a seated Member of Congress was that day, but he did  that that day anyway.   I let the messenger know I knew what was up. The next day, I get a  primary opponent. The following day, The New York Times story came out,  and the rest is history, Mr. Speaker, The New York Times with the  misquote in it.   There is no tape. It is his word against mine. He has notes, he says.  He admits there is no tape. He has notes, he says, but he won't divulge  even the question that he would say that he asked me.   So I made the point here on the floor, that if I had uttered those  words, it would have been in repetition to a question he asked me. But  I often defend Western civilization. I never have uttered those words,  those two odious ideologies. One of them is on this chart right here.   When I gave the answer that questioned the definition here of what is  this, white nationalism, what is it, I said: It might have meant  something different 1 or 2 or 3 years ago, but today it implies racist.   Well, what did it mean before that? We went back to the year 2000,  LexisNexis, and it was virtually unused. You can see all the way along  here.   Mr. Speaker, I will describe it because you can't actually see it,  but I can.   All the way along here, you can see that it is virtually unused until  you get to 2016, and then this term was used 10,000-plus times, then  30,000. It is still up at 20,000 times, so 2016, 2017, and 2018.   I could not have been more accurate when I said: It might have meant  something different 1, 2, or 3 years ago.   This is in 2018: 1, 2, or 3 years ago. What did it mean here, when  nobody was using it? That is a hard definition to come up with because  it is not in this big dictionary over here. You can't look up two words  together and find out what they mean by looking in a dictionary.   That is the annual records, Mr. Speaker. So we looked into 2016 and  asked the question: When did this jump up? Well, it jumped up right  here in the month of November and then up there pretty high yet in  December 2016.   What happened in November? Two things: Donald Trump was elected  President and the Democrats gathered at the Mandarin Occidental Hotel  to plan a strategy and what they were going to do to prevent him from  being an effective President.  [[Page H294]]    Then we broke the month down, and here is what we have. November 14  and 15, the time that George Soros and the Democratic leaders were in  the Mandarin Occidental Hotel planning a strategy. Well, was it a  weaponization strategy of the term ``white nationalism''? You bet,  right there.   That is what happened, Mr. Speaker. So they launched that as a  weaponization, and they used it as a weapon against me.   When I stated those words here on the floor of the House of  Representatives, I said there is a pause between the two odious  ideologies and ``Western civilization.'' I made that case, and then I  demonstrated that significant pause.   Even though we have the best stenographers, I believe, in the world  here, and they have been great for me to work with, it came out with  exactly the same mispunctuation that The New York Times had.   So I have introduced the bill called H. Res. 789 to correct the  Congressional Record to at least reflect what the C-SPAN video shows  that I said.   Now, it also demonstrates that if these excellent people here can end  up with that punctuation, it is pretty easy to explain what happened to  The New York Times.   Meanwhile, there have been only four people in the history of the  United States Congress who have been removed from their committees.  Three of them are either Federal felons or confessed Federal--they have  been convicted of Federal felonies or confessed to Federal felonies,  three of them.   And me? There is not even a rule that I violated. It is just simply  the will and the whim and the bloodlust of a political lynch mob, and  that has been going on for over a year now today. And it is going to  end, and I am not going to wait until this next year goes by and have  to win another election and make a case.   Furthermore, the term ``white nationalist'' had never been  consciously even uttered on the floor of the House of Representatives  since 1789 all the way up until the time that Donald Trump was elected  President or George Soros led this situation at the Mandarin Occidental  Hotel.   So this resolution, H. Res. 789, is filed and cosponsors are signing  on to it.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record an article from Politico.                       [From POLITICO, Nov. 14, 2016]         Soros Bands With Donors To Resist Trump, `Take Back Power'                           (By Kenneth P. Vogel)    Major liberal funders huddle behind closed doors with Pelosi, Warren,            Ellison, and union bosses to lick wounds, retrench.         George Soros and other rich liberals who spent tens of       millions of dollars trying to elect Hillary Clinton are       gathering in Washington for a three-day, closed door meeting       to retool the big-money left to fight back against Donald       Trump.        The conference, which kicked off Sunday night at       Washington's pricey Mandarin Oriental hotel, is sponsored by       the influential Democracy Alliance donor club, and will       include appearances by leaders of most leading unions and       liberal groups, as well as darlings of the left such as House       Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi, Sen. Elizabeth Warren and       Congressional Progressive Caucus co-chairman Keith Ellison,       according to an agenda and other documents obtained by       POLITICO.        The meeting is the first major gathering of the       institutional left since Trump's shocking victory over       Hillary Clinton in last week's presidential election, and, if       the agenda is any indication, liberals plan full-on trench       warfare against Trump from Day One. Some sessions deal with       gearing up for 2017 and 2018 elections, while others focus on       thwarting President-elect Trump's 100-day plan, which the       agenda calls ``a terrifying assault on President Obama's       achievements--and our progressive vision for an equitable and       just nation.''        Yet the meeting also comes as many liberals are reassessing       their approach to politics--and the role of the Democracy       Alliance, or DA, as the club is known in Democratic finance       circles. The DA, its donors and beneficiary groups over the       last decade have had a major hand in shaping the institutions       of the left, including by orienting some of its key       organizations around Clinton, and by basing their strategy       around the idea that minorities and women constituted a so-      called ``rising American electorate'' that could tip       elections to Democrats.        That didn't happen in the presidential election, where       Trump won largely on the strength of his support from       working-class whites. Additionally, exit polls suggested that       issues like fighting climate change and the role of money in       politics--which the DA's beneficiary groups have used to try       to turn out voters--didn't resonate as much with the voters       who carried Trump to victory.        ``The DA itself should be called into question,'' said one       Democratic strategist who has been active in the group and is       attending the meeting. ``You can make a very good case it's       nothing more than a social club for a handful wealthy white       donors and labor union officials to drink wine and read       memos, as the Democratic Party burns down around them.''        Another liberal operative who has been active in the DA       since its founding rejected the notion that the group--or the       left, more generally--needed to completely retool its       approach to politics.        ``We should not learn the wrong lesson from this       election,'' said the operative, pointing out that Clinton is       on track to win the popular vote and that Trump got fewer       votes than the last GOP presidential nominee, Mitt Romney.       ``We need our people to vote in greater numbers. For that to       happen, we need candidates who inspire them to go to the       polls on Election Day.''        But Gara LaMarche, the president of the DA, on Sunday       evening told donors gathered at the Mandarin for a welcome       dinner that some reassessment was in order. According to       prepared remarks he provided to POLITICO, he said, ``You       don't lose an election you were supposed to win, with so much       at stake, without making some big mistakes, in assumptions,       strategy and tactics.''        LaMarche added that the reassessment ``must take place       without recrimination and fingerpointing, whatever       frustration and anger some of us feel about our own allies in       these efforts,'' and he said ``It is a process we should not       rush, even as we gear up to resist the Trump       administration.''        LaMarche emailed the donors last week that the meeting       would begin the process of assessing ``what steps we will       take together to resist the assaults that are coming and take       back power, beginning in the states in 2017 and 2018.''        In addition to sessions focusing on protecting Obamacare       and other pillars of Obama's legacy against dismantling by       President-elect Trump, the agenda includes panels on       rethinking polling and the left's approach to winning the       working-class vote, as well as sessions stressing the       importance of channeling cash to state legislative policy       battles and races, where Republicans won big victories last       week.        Democrats need to invest more in training officials and       developing policies in the states, argued Rep. Ellison (D-      Minn.) on a Friday afternoon donor conference call, according       to someone on the call. The call was organized by a DA-      endorsed group called the State Innovation Exchange (or SiX),       which Ellison urged the donors to support.        Ellison, who is scheduled to speak on a Monday afternoon       panel at the DA meeting on the challenge Democrats face in       winning working-class votes, has been a leading liberal voice       for a form of economic populism that Trump at times channeled       more than Clinton.        As liberals look to rebuild the post-Clinton Democratic       Party on a more aggressively liberal bearing, Ellison has       emerged as a top candidate to take over the Democratic       National Committee, and he figures to be in high demand at       the DA meeting. An Ellison spokesman did not immediately       respond to a request for comment on Sunday evening. Nor did a       Trump spokesman.        Raj Goyle, a New York Democratic activist who previously       served in the Kansas state legislature and now sits on SiX's       board, argued that many liberal activists and donors are       ``disconnected from working class voters' concerns'' because       they're cluster in coastal cities. ``And that hurt us this       election,'' said Goyle, who is involved in the DA, and said       its donors would do well to steer more cash to groups on the       ground in landlocked states. ``Progressive donors and       organizations need to immediately correct the lack of       investment in state and local strategies.''        The Democracy Alliance was launched after the 2004 election       by Soros, the late insurance mogul Peter Lewis, and a handful       of fellow Democratic mega-donors who had combined to spend       tens of millions trying to boost then-Sen. John Kerry's       ultimately unsuccessful challenge to then-President George W.       Bush.        The donors' goal was to seed a set of advocacy groups and       think tanks outside the Democratic Party that could push the       party and its politicians to the left while also defending       them against attack from the right.        The group requires its members--a group that now numbers       more than 100 and includes finance titans like Soros, Tom       Steyer and Donald Sussman, as well as major labor unions and       liberal foundations--to contribute a total of at least       $200,000 a year to recommended groups. Members also pay       annual dues of $30,000 to fund the DA staff and its meetings,       which include catered meals and entertainment (on Sunday,       interested donors were treated to a VIP tour of the recently       opened National Museum of African American History and       Culture).        Since its inception in 2005, the DA has steered upward of       $500 million to a range of groups, including pillars of the       political left such as the watchdog group Media Matters, the       policy advocacy outfit Center for American Progress and the       data firm Catalist--all of which are run by Clinton allies       who are expected to send representatives to the DA meeting.        The degree to which those groups will be able to adapt to       the post-Clinton Democratic Party is not entirely clear,       though some of the key DA donors have given generously to       them for years.  [[Page H295]]         That includes Soros, who, after stepping back a bit from       campaign-related giving in recent years, had committed or       donated $25 million to boosting Clinton and other Democratic       candidates and causes in 2016. During the presidential       primaries, Soros had argued that Trump and his GOP rival Ted       Cruz were ``doing the work of ISIS.''        A Soros spokesman declined to comment for this story.        But, given that the billionaire financier only periodically       attends DA meetings and is seldom a part of the formal       proceedings, his scheduled Tuesday morning appearance as a       speaker suggests that he's committed to investing in opposing       President Trump.        The agenda item for a Tuesday morning ``conversation with       George Soros'' invokes Soros' personal experience living       through the Holocaust and Soviet Communism in the context of       preparing for a Trump presidency. The agenda notes that the       billionaire currency trader, who grew up in Hungary, ``has       lived through Nazism and Communism, and has devoted his       foundations to protecting the kinds of open societies around       the world that are now threatened in the United States       itself.''        LaMarche, who for years worked for Soros's Open Society       foundations, told POLITICO that the references to Nazism and       Communism are ``part of his standard bio.''        LaMarche, who is set to moderate the discussion with Soros,       said the donor ``does not plan to compare whatever we face       under Trump to Nazism, I can tell you that.'' LaMarche he       also said, ``I don't think there is anyone who has looked at       Trump, including many respected conservatives, who doesn't       think the experience of authoritarian states would not be       important to learn from here. And to the extent that Soros       and his foundations have experience with xenophobia in       Europe, Brexit, etc., we want to learn from that as well.''        The Soros conversation was added to the agenda after       Election Day. It was just one of many changes made on the fly       to adjust for last week's jarring result and the stark new       reality facing liberals, who went from discussing ways to       push an incoming President Clinton leftward, to instead       discussing how to play defense.        A pre-election working draft of the DA's agenda, obtained       by POLITICO, featured a session on Clinton's first 100 days       and another on ``moving a progressive national policy agenda       in 2017.'' Those sessions were rebranded so that the first       instead will examine ``what happened'' on the ``cataclysm of       Election Day,'' while the second will focus on ``combating       the massive threats from Trump and Congress in 2017.''        A session that before the election had been titled ``Can       Our Elections Be Hacked,'' after the election was renamed       ``Was the 2016 Election Hacked''--a theory that has       percolated without evidence on the left to explain the       surprising result.        In his post-election emails to donors and operatives,       LaMarche acknowledged the group had to ``scrap many of the       original plans for the conference,'' explaining ``while we       made no explicit assumptions about the outcome, the       conference we planned, and the agenda you have seen, made       more sense in the event of a Hillary Clinton victory.''     Mr. Speaker, I will conclude my remarks, and I  yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 8 o'clock and 9 minutes  p.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until tomorrow,  Thursday, January 16, 2020, at 9 a.m.                            ____________________
