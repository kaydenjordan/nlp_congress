 Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak in favor of the 2017 Defense  Appropriations bill, a bill providing vital funding for the United  States military and intelligence communities who continue to be engaged  in responding, engaging, and destroying threats around the world.   Mr. Speaker, I have the honor and the great responsibility of  representing the largest concentration of Active-Duty military and  veterans of any congressional district in the Nation. Who are they?  Fathers, mothers, sisters, brothers, sons, daughters, soccer coaches,  neighbors.   Our district has thousands of the less than 1 percent of the Nation  that has gone forth over and over to fight for us; the best among us,  fighting the worst in the world.   In our district, Mr. Speaker, we have the largest naval base in the  world, NASA, SEAL teams, Marines, Army soldiers, Air Force Combat  Command, coastguardsmen, Oceana Naval Master Jet Base, national  guardsmen, and many, many more.   Mr. Speaker, we are moving toward the smallest Army since World War  II, the smallest Air Force ever, Navy ships not being properly  maintained due to budget, Marine planes not combat-ready. This is  unacceptable. Our Nation requires a military, but our force is  voluntary. We owe them more.   We must take up this 2017 Defense Appropriations bill to help  maintain a technological advantage. If we must send our men and women  into harm's way, let us always send these warfighters with an unfair  advantage.   This bill provides essential equipment, platforms, and upgrades. We  must give our force and our industrial base predictability and  stability, the right equipment, the right training, and the right  military superiority.   This bill not only supports the warfighters, but their families as  well  [[Page H1610]]  who, Mr. Speaker, are the very backbone of our forces and an integral  part of the tremendous sacrifice that has taken place for our Nation.  This bill provides important investments in traumatic brain injury,  suicide prevention, sexual assault prevention, and much more.    Mr. Speaker, this bill gives a well-deserved pay raise,  enhances health care, and eases the burden our Nation demands on  military families moving forward. I urge all of my colleagues on both  sides of the aisle to vote in support of this bill.
