 Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Haiti Criminal Collusion  Transparency Act introduced by my friend, the ranking member, Mr. Meeks  of New York, to place international pressure on elites in Haiti who  have exacerbated and benefited from widespread instability of violence  in that turbulent country.   Nearly one-half of the country's population, close to 5 million  Haitians, face acute hunger today. Haitians face drastic food, fuel,  and medical equipment shortages. Cholera outbreaks are now widespread  not far from our shore, and gangs dominate the Haitian economy and  daily life through corruption, extortion, and brutal violence.   In fact, the Haitian National Police and Haitian politicians are so  compromised by gangs that lawlessness and instability are the new norm.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Meeks for keeping our attention  on Haiti. The situation is, as he said, dire. The only way we will  start helping Haiti root out corruption is to create a cost for those  among the Haitian elite who benefit from crime and corruption.   A little over a century ago, U.S. soldiers landed on Haiti's shores  to stabilize a country in upheaval following the assassination of a  Haitian President.   With the country now, once again, destabilized following the  assassination of another Haitian President, the United States must work  with allies and partners to give the Haitian people a voice and to  allow for them to take their country back from the gangs and the  instability rampant in Haiti today.   This time we must do so with an appreciation for our Nation's sordid  history in Haiti, mistakes we have made, and how we can do better by  the Haitian people this time. We have a chance to redeem our own  history.   Mr. Speaker, again, I thank the ranking member, Mr. Meeks, for  keeping our attention focused on Haiti, as it should be, and for  bringing this important piece of legislation to the floor, and I urge  all of our colleagues to support it.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3203, the Stop  Chinese Fentanyl Act of 2023, and I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   On both sides of the aisle, we recognize the devastating impact the  opioid crisis has had on our families and communities. There has been  too much tragic loss of life and too many families torn apart.  Challenging problems require our working together to find solutions.   Here at home, we need expanded education programs for students so  that they understand the deadly risks associated with fentanyl  consumption and better funded rehab programs to help people get clean.  We need law enforcement and prosecutors to target major trafficking  networks, but we should be careful not to repeat the excesses and  inequities that undermined the war on drugs previously.   In the international context, we need to incentivize countries to  work with us, but we also need to demonstrate there are consequences  for actions that increase the supply of these dangerous drugs with  impunity. This bill takes the latter approach. It will beef up  sanctions on major Chinese fentanyl traffickers that aid and abet  opioid traffickers. The legislation bolsters reporting requirements on  fentanyl trafficking under the national emergency declared by the  President and includes reforms to the International Economic Emergency  Powers Act.   I want to be clear: We can't sanction our way out of this fentanyl  crisis alone. Sanctions are an important tool, but we will also need  cooperation, as well.   If we want countries to limit the export of fentanyl precursors and  work with us to prevent such substances from entering our country and  poisoning our people, we will need the cooperation of law enforcement  in other nations like China and Mexico. That is a simple fact.   Tough talk and asset freezes have their role, and I support them, but  diplomacy and law enforcement cooperation are also part of the picture  we need if we are going to conquer this problem.   I thank Mr. Barr, my friend from Kentucky, and Chairman McCaul for  their advocacy on this important issue and bringing this legislation  forward.   Congress works on behalf of the American people best when we can  collaborate, when we can support each other, when we work together.  Both sides worked in good faith to get this deal done, and I salute the  gentleman from Kentucky for his leadership.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I  reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1630     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to  close.   Again, this is a scourge that has cost way too many lives. Educating  our young people about its dangers but also cracking down on those who,  with abandon, are willing to poison our young people and damage our  country is an important step.   I support Mr. Barr's effort. I support this legislation, and I urge  my colleagues to support this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I echo the gentleman from Kentucky's fervent desire that  we merit unanimous support for this piece of legislation.   I rise in support of the Taiwan International Solidarity Act which I  authored with the gentleman from Utah (Mr. Curtis), my friend, to stand  up for Taiwan's participation in international organizations against  the backdrop of an ever-bellicose People's Republic of China.   Our bill responds to Beijing's aggression by strengthening the TAIPEI  Act of 2019 to clarify that U.N. General Assembly Resolution 2758 does  not--does not--preclude the United States from using its vote, voice,  and influence to resist the reckless campaign against Taiwan's rightful  place on the world stage.   The Taiwan International Solidarity Act amends the TAIPEI Act of  2019, a bill that passed by a unified bipartisan vote of 415-0. It  instructs the U.S. to use its voice, vote, and influence to resist  Beijing's efforts to distort the decisions, language, policies, or  procedures of international organizations regarding Taiwan. It  encourages the U.S. to work with allies and partners to oppose the  People's Republic of China's efforts to undermine Taiwan's diplomatic  relationships and partnerships globally. It expands reporting  requirements to include information relating to any prior or ongoing  attempts by the People's Republic of China to undermine Taiwan's  participation in international organizations as well as its ties and  relationships with other countries.   Over the past decade, the People's Republic of China has successfully  weaponized a distorted interpretation of United Nations General  Assembly Resolution 2758, which recognized the People's Republic of  China as China's representative to that body in 1971.   Since then, it is no secret that the People's Republic of China has  leveraged its growing influence in the United Nations and international  organizations to make sure that they could exclude Taiwan's meaningful  participation in the international arena and preclude its technical and  scientific expertise, as we saw in the pandemic, from which the world  can benefit.    Delegates from Taiwan attended the World Health Assembly as nonvoting  observers from 2009 to 2016, but in 2016, the PRC successfully bullied  enough member states to rescind that invitation.   The denial of Taiwan's participation at the International Civil  Aviation Organization poses a direct threat to aviation safety, and  without member status at INTERPOL, Taiwan is denied access to crucial  information that could be used to fight international criminal activity  and, I might add, the drug trade we just talked about.   We face unprecedented health and security threats here in the United  States and abroad, and Taiwan's distinct capabilities, public health  expertise, democratic governance, and advanced technology underscore  the need for this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, the People's Republic of China has made its intentions  crystal clear:   They have encroached on the territorial waters and airspace of their  neighbors.   They have made ludicrous claims of sovereignty over the entire South  China Sea.   They have engaged in, or threatened, kinetic activity on the Indian  border, the Vietnamese border, and, of course, across the Taiwan  Strait.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to make clear that any decision by the PRC to  intimidate, bully, and exclude Taiwan will not be condoned or tolerated  by the United States of America and certainly not by this Congress.   The United States, in the spirit of the Taiwan Relations Act, must  continue to reject any unilateral aggression against Taiwan, including  within international organizations and bodies.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to heed the advice of the gentleman  from Kentucky and pass this bill unanimously. I reserve the balance of  my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Lieu).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Again, I thank my friend from Kentucky (Mr. Barr) for his leadership  and cosponsorship, and my partner, Mr. Curtis, for his enormous effort  in trying to bring this bill before our committee for markup and to the  floor.   Mr. Speaker, acting on this bill is not a nice thing to do to  recognize an allied partner, but it is actually for practical reasons.  There are consequences when Taiwan, with independent capability, and  enormous scientific and technical expertise, cannot participate in  deliberations about world public health during a pandemic.   There are consequences when it cannot participate in INTERPOL and  help us in that fentanyl drug trafficking coming from the big country  just to its north, China.   There are consequences when we deny Taiwan its legitimate place and  voice in international deliberations.   Mr. Speaker, passing this bill, I hope, will have positive and  practical consequences. It will remind our friends and allies and our  adversaries that this Congress believes Taiwan is entitled to its voice  and its seat at the table in important international organizations that  are operational and that have consequences, good and bad, for the  world's population.   Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the bill, and I yield back the  balance of my time.
