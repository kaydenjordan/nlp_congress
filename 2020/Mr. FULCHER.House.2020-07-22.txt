 Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this legislation.  While I understand the merits of the bill and while some of my  colleagues support it, I still have concerns.   I spent a lot of time in the rural counties of Idaho. Residents and  local governments, understandably, have serious concerns regarding  additional Federal land acquisition, especially at a time when Federal  resources are stretched so thin.   The Federal Government doesn't have the resources to manage the land  and are often prevented from allowing local involvement. Translation:  More Federal land equals less land being intelligently managed and,  often, more wildlife.   Currently, about two-thirds of Idaho's land mass is controlled by the  Federal Government. That means less property tax, more D.C.  bureaucracy, reliance on grant programs like Secure Rural Schools,  Payments in Lieu of Taxes, and the ramifications of associated strings  inevitably attached.   I am also concerned about our growing national debt, now over $24  trillion. And while I appreciate that this bill utilizes revenue  streams from future oil and gas receipts, it is still ultimately  taxpayer money. That authorizes permanent funding, and any time there  is permanent funding, that also raises a red flag.   Mr. Speaker, to be a wise steward of the people's money, Congress  should regularly reevaluate programs that it funds, not automatically  renew appropriations.
