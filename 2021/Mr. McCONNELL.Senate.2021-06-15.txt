 Mr. President, 1 week ago today, the personal  financial information of several prominent Americans was made public in  only the latest leak of sensitive data from the Internal Revenue  Service. To put it another way, it appears that an anonymous source  committed a felony by releasing the confidential information of  American citizens, which a media outlet then published. Now, the way  this leak has been covered in the press may not suggest it, but the  most alarming part isn't whose information was involved; it is how it  was allowed to happen at all--at all.   The American people know that having the personal information they  give to the IRS made public isn't just a fear reserved for the highest  earners. On multiple occasions in the last decade, individuals and  organizations alike have had to watch as their filing details wander  far from the IRS's databases. And it goes beyond pay stubs. The IRS  holds massive storage of sensitive details, from healthcare expenses,  to retirement savings, to charitable contributions. They hold  addresses, information about dependents, and associations with  organizations that may not be tax-deductible.   Needless to say, there are good arguments for paring back the scope  of what information this Agency is allowed to collect in the first  place. But here is the bottom line: American taxpayers are required by  law to comply with invasive disclosure requirements, and they are doing  it with less and less confidence that the Federal Government will honor  their trust.   A fundamental piece of our Nation's social contract is fraying, but  just how worried you should be about it apparently depends on your  personal politics. The precise circumstances of this latest leak have  not yet been made clear, but the recent history of IRS negligence and  outright political targeting tells conservatives to be especially  worried.   As our colleagues remember all too well, years ago, the State of  California's database of private donor data for over 1,000 nonprofit  organizations was made public illegally. A few years later,  confidential IRS donor information from a conservative organization's  tax filings was published. To no one's surprise, that information made  its way into the hands of liberal groups with opposite views on key  issues. Of course, we are talking about the same IRS that made slow- walking requests and filings from conservative organizations a matter  of internal policy under the last Democratic administration.   So these situations all have two things in common: first, a blatant  political agenda aimed at advancing the cause of the political left,  and second, the utter absence of criminal charges against the leakers-- no charges against the leakers.   So let's be clear. As soon as sensitive personal information is  leaked, the damage is already done. The genie can't be put back in the  bottle, and the Federal Government has proven far too often that it is  at best, incapable and at worse, unwilling to protect taxpayers' data  from misuse by the political left. That is why I have been outspoken in  support of efforts to reduce taxpayers' exposure to unnecessary IRS  collection in the first place.   But every time a leak goes without serious investigation and criminal  prosecution, basic public trust in our tax system suffers, and that  fraying trust may eventually be irreparable. That is why I joined  Ranking Member Grassley and Ranking Member Crapo to demand that the  Department of Justice and the FBI immediately investigate last week's  leak and aggressively pursue criminal charges against those who are  responsible--actual consequences as a matter of justice and as a  practical deterrent. The Federal Government owes taxpayers nothing  less.   Unfortunately, thus far, the Biden administration hasn't just  neglected to aggressively prosecute overt discrimination; in some  cases, it is actually trying to promote it.   Take the massive spending package Democrats rammed through in the  name of COVID relief. The spending bill was billed as urgent, but its  authors apparently had time to bake in a provision directing relief  funds to restaurants on the basis of race and sex  [[Page S4525]]  and another directing funds to farmers on the basis of race. So we are  talking about blatantly unconstitutional discrimination.   Fortunately, the independent judiciary has stepped in to stop it.  Over the last few weeks, multiple Federal courts have struck down these  provisions, including an appeals panel led by Judge Amul Thapar from my  home State of Kentucky. But these are hardly the only instances in  which Washington Democrats have tried to impose their own radical  preferences on ordinary Americans                            ____________________     Mr. President, later today, the Senate will vote on  the nomination of Kiran Ahuja, President Biden's choice to serve as  head of the Office of Personnel Management. This is the position  responsible for making hiring, payroll, and training decisions that  affect literally millions of Federal employees.   The President's nominee has made statements expressing sympathy for  the discredited, ahistorical claims about our Nation's origins that  form the backbone of so-called critical race theory. One major  organization of Federal employees expressed its concern about the  nominee's capacity for ``neutrality, fairness, and impartiality.'' I  share those concerns, and I will be voting against this nomination.   Still elsewhere in the Biden administration, efforts to subvert the  basic understanding of our founding principles are already well  underway. The Department of Education's latest ``proposed priorities''  run roughshod over existing history and civic programs--established  with bipartisan support--in order to push critical race theory on  public school students and keep pace with ``woke'' sensibilities.   American students deserve a rock-solid civics education grounded in  actual facts, not divisive propaganda that tells them they are little  more than a product of their racial background. That is the basis of  new legislation I was proud to help introduce this week. Schools that  choose to trade in fact-based curricula for activist propaganda like  the 1619 Project forfeit their right to receive Federal education grant  funding for those teachings.   The current administration came to power on the promise to unify a  divided nation. It will be judged closely and carefully on how that  power is used.                            ____________________     I suggest the absence of a quorum.
