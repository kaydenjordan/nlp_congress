 Madam Speaker, May is National Drug Court  Month, and I rise to recognize these remarkable facilities on their  30th anniversary. Since 1989, drug courts have provided countless  addicted Americans referral to treatment and a lifesaving alternative  to incarceration.   When I first started Operation UNITE in my district in 2003, there  were only five drug courts in the whole district of 30 counties. Today,  we have one in all 30 counties, and those volunteer judges are changing  more lives than ever before.   At this moment, drug courts are providing a new lease on life to  144,000 Americans around the country. Thank you to the countless  professionals who make up our 3,000 drug courts. We have got a long  road ahead, but I look forward to ensuring drug courts remain a central  part of that journey.                            ____________________
