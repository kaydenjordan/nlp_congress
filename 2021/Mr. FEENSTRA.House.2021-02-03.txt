 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to the H. Con.  Res. 11, which paves the way for our national deficit to increase by  $2.1 trillion.   Our current debt is $28 trillion. Let's put that in perspective. This  budget that we are looking at here will never balance. It will push our  national debt to $41 trillion by the end of its forecast. Let me say  that again: $41 trillion by the end of its forecast.    This out-of-control spending is jeopardizing the very future of  Social Security and Medicare. Every senior should be deeply concerned  about the possibility of losing Social Security based on this out-of- control spending by the Democrats.   Currently, our country pays about 2 percent on the debt that we have.  It will not stay at 2 percent because 2 percent is currently low. If  our interest rate increases, we are going to struggle to try to fund  our discretionary programs like defense and infrastructure because the  money will go toward interest. This is dangerous, fiscally  irresponsible, and reprehensible.   Just like a business or a family, when the credit card bill comes due  and there is not enough money, you have to cut. The Democrats have put  our Nation in a perilous situation with this out-of-control spending.   We must take our growing national debt crisis seriously and not look  at this laundry list of progressive ideas put forth by the Democrats.   We are saddling our children and their grandchildren with this debt,  focusing on the politics of today, and not worrying about our Nation's  future. This budget must be stopped.
