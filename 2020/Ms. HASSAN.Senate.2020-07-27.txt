 Mr. President, today I would like to congratulate  Mr. John ``Mike'' Croteau of Newbury, NH, on his retirement from the  Newbury Fire Department after a remarkable 75 years of service.   Mike's father, George, was a long-time member and chief of the  Newbury Fire Department, and in 1945, 15-year-old Mike, joined the  department too. At first, Mike helped put out brush fires caused by  trains that ran from Boston to Newbury Station. When Mike was 18, he  fought the fire on Mount Sunapee that claimed 1,700 acres. Hundreds of  firefighters worked for 7 days straight to battle the fast-moving fire  during one of the worst fire seasons ever recorded in New Hampshire  history.   Beyond his work at the fire department, Mike was an engineer for the  New Hampshire Department of Transportation for 33 years, and the Town  of Newbury often called upon his expertise for site work and design.  While working for the State, he continued to serve the fire department,  serving as the fire chief, as well as forest fire warden.   Mike has dedicated many hours of his time to the Newbury Fire  Department in addition to firefighting by helping with fundraising  efforts, including the annual bingo nights and auctions. His dedication  to his community also went beyond his exemplary fire department  service; he also volunteered for many town groups, boards, and  activities and has always stepped up when something needs to be done.   In 2012, Governor John Lynch commended Mike for 67 years of service  as a firefighter, and in 2015, he received the Fire Service Lifetime  Achievement Award from the New Hampshire Police, Fire, and EMS  Foundation.   Mike's commitment to his community and the Newbury Fire Department is  a shining example of the spirit of New Hampshire, and he serves as a  role model for all Granite Staters. He has been a critical part of the  department for 75 years, and he has put himself at risk day after day  to protect his fellow citizens. His town, State, and country are better  because of his dedicated efforts.   I hope you will join me in honoring an exemplary Granite Stater, Mike  Croteau.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I am proud to honor Carter Manson  of Manchester as July's Granite Stater of the Month. Carter's efforts  to encourage Granite Staters and all Americans to get outside and help  clean up their communities has made a true difference in a difficult  time.   Carter, who is only 5 years old, has wanted to be a garbage man since  he was 3. For Halloween last year, he even dressed up as a trash  collector to show his appreciation for his heroes. Now, due in part to  the COVID-19 pandemic, Carter has taken his passion for garbage  collection one step further.   One day in April while the stay-at-home orders for New Hampshire were  in place, Carter asked his mom, Kelly, if he could go outside and pick  up some trash. Kelly obliged and took some photos of her young son  cleaning up his neighborhood and posted them on her Facebook page.   Much to her surprise, the photos Kelly posted of Carter's efforts  received a lot of attention from her friends and family. In response,  she decided to build on the momentum Carter had inspired by creating a  group called Carter's Clean Up Crew.   The ``Crew'' now has nearly 800 members from across the United States  and Canada. The group has also received support from 22 businesses and  raised $1,400 to help get members of the group the supplies that they  need to clean up their communities, including trash grabbers and  gloves.   The Crew is planning their first big cleanup day at the end of  August, and Carter and Kelly have been rallying members of their  community to join them in Manchester for the big day.   In the meantime, Carter has been diligent in his clean up regimen and  goes out with his mom at least once a week to pick up 5 gallons of  trash in neighborhoods across Manchester.   Carter's passion for cleaning up his environment and encouraging  others to do the same represents the best of our State and our all- hands-on-deck spirit. It also represents how eager people are to  strengthen and improve their communities even during this pandemic. I  applaud Carter for his efforts and look forward to seeing what he  accomplishes next.                            ____________________
