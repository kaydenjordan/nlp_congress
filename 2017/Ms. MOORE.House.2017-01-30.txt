 Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from Fort Worth  for yielding this time to me.   I could just tell you that it is deja vu all over again. When  President George W. Bush lost the election in 2000, he engaged in a  lengthy investigation over so-called voter fraud to deflect from the  fact that he, in fact, lost the popular vote, as did President Donald  Trump. These allegations of voter fraud do nothing but to continue to  bankrupt the Treasury. When, as the gentleman from New Jersey just  pointed out, Loyola Law School did an extensive study, they found 31  cases of voter impersonation out of 1 billion votes cast in the last 14  years. We don't have enough time for me to do the math on that, but it  is de minimis.   I can tell you that real voter fraud is voter suppression. 2016 was  the very first Presidential election in 50 years, gentlewoman from the  Virgin Islands, that we didn't have the full protection of voting  rights in 14 States, and it showed, including in my own swing State of  Wisconsin. Brand-new voting ID restrictions disproportionately  suppressed African American, low-income citizens' votes.   According to a Federal Court, nearly 300,000 registered voters in  Wisconsin--in my State--could not obtain the voter ID required by the  imposition of these new laws. Throughout the country, we saw 868 fewer  polling places. We saw these voter ID laws, and we saw just a  reinvention of these painful and unjust poll taxes and remnants of poll  taxes and literacy tests imposed upon African Americans.   I can tell you, if there is any voter suppression, it is voter denial  in this country; and I would call for, instead of spending taxpayer  dollars to find 5 million votes that President Trump claimed voted for  Hillary Clinton, I would rather spend that money investigating the  Russian hacks into our election.
