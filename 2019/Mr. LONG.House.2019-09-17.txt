 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, unfortunately, I have personal knowledge of this type of  situation. Just within the last 30 days, a friend of mine lost a 3- year-old grandchild due to one of these situations. There can be  nothing worse than losing a child. To have a vibrant 3-year-old child  one minute and a deceased 3-year-old the next is not acceptable.   This bill directs the Consumer Product Safety Commission to issue a  consumer product safety standard for clothing storage units, to prevent  them from tipping over onto children.   In the spirit of bipartisanship, we support this bill moving forward  with the House passage today.   I thank my friend Ms. Schakowsky for her efforts in this endeavor. I  urge  [[Page H7721]]  my colleagues to support H.R. 2211, and I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I encourage our colleagues to vote for H.R.  2211. I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, unfortunately, once again, I can relate to what this  bill is trying to address. I was an auctioneer for over 30 years before  I came to this body, and there was a college professor who attended  hundreds of my auctions over the years. He was quite a toy collector,  and he was also a professor at Missouri State University in my hometown  of Springfield. Very tragically, within the last couple of years, he  and his wife both succumbed to carbon monoxide poisoning.   It is a silent killer. It can happen anywhere. There is no warning-- any time, any place. Anything we can do to augment a solution here  would be very, very good.   H.R. 1618 directs the Consumer Product Safety Commission to establish  a grant program for States to purchase and install carbon monoxide  alarms in dwelling units of low-income families; for the elderly;  facilities that commonly serve children or the elderly, including  childcare facilities, public schools, and senior centers; or dwelling  units owned by public universities; and to assist in enforcement and  education efforts related to carbon monoxide poisoning.   Carbon monoxide poisoning can happen anywhere in the United States,  regardless of location or other external factors. It is an issue that  is much more frequent than many realize.   According to the CDC, 50,000 people a year in the United States  experience carbon monoxide poisoning. Of those, at least 430 people die  from accidental carbon monoxide poisoning.   These grants will go a long way to carrying out carbon monoxide  poisoning prevention actions, as they can be used for everything from  installing alarms in these units of elderly individuals to training  officials in the installation of such alarms.   I am pleased to support passage of this bill today. It will improve  safety and provide the tools and resources needed to combat this issue.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 1618, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close.   When we go home, people say: Well, can't you all agree on anything up  there in Washington, because all you all do is fight? Why can't you  work in a bipartisan fashion?''   I will admit, sometimes it seems like we can't agree to the fact that  the Sun is going to come up in the east tomorrow, but on this bill,  there is bipartisan support. We agree.   Mr. Speaker, I want to urge my colleagues to support H.R. 1618, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, this bill directs the Consumer Product Safety Commission  to issue a consumer product safety rule to require flame mitigation  devices on portable fuel containers. Furthermore, it directs CPSC to  conduct an education campaign to alert consumers to the dangers of  using or storing portable fuel containers near ignition sources and to  report to Congress on the campaign.   In addition, it amends the Children's Gasoline Burn Prevention Act to  expand existing child-resistance requirements for closures for portable  gasoline containers to include portable kerosene and diesel fuel  containers and component parts.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Margrett Lewis for her tireless efforts  to help get this bill across the House floor today. She turned her  personal tragedy into passionate advocacy in an effort to prevent  others from facing a similar incident.   I thank everybody for their work on this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I congratulate Mr. Thompson and his bipartisan group of  cosponsors, and I am pleased to support addressing this important  safety issue.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 806, and I reserve  the balance of my time.                                time  1630     Mr. Speaker, in closing, I urge my colleagues to support  H.R. 806, and I yield back the balance of my time.
