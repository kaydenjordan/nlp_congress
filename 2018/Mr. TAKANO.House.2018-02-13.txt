 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support H.R. 4533, which designates the  healthcare system of the Department of Veterans Affairs in Lexington,  Kentucky, as the Lexington VA Health Care System.   However, it is two other designations in this bill that I wish to  highlight because they honor the memories of two extraordinary Greatest  Generation heroes from Kentucky: Troy Bowling and Franklin R. Sousley.  H.R. 4533 names two campuses in the Lexington, Kentucky, healthcare  system after these brave marines.   Seventy-three years ago this month, United States Marines landed on  the Pacific island of Iwo Jima and engaged the Japanese forces in some  of the most intense and costly fighting of World War II. Among them  were Troy Bowling and Franklin R. Sousley, just teenagers at the time.   Bowling's unit was among the first to arrive on Iwo Jima. On the  second day, he was critically wounded by mortars and eventually  evacuated to the beach, where he received lifesaving care and witnessed  the raising of the American flag atop Mount Suribachi. Lying wounded on  that beach, Mr. Bowling made a deal with God that, if he survived, he  would spend his life in the service of others.   He kept that promise over the next 72 years through more than 78,000  hours of volunteer service at the Lexington VA Medical Center. In his  work with the Disabled American Veterans, he has held nearly  every position possible, including state commander, among others; and  he is the recipient of the Lifetime Service Achievement Award from the  Department of Veterans Affairs.    Now, upon his arrival on the island of Iwo Jima, Private Sousley was  also involved in intense, concentrated fighting. Eventually, as we all  know, American forces prevailed. Private Sousley was among the six  marines proudly hoisting that flag. Tragically, less than a month  later, he would be killed in action. Highly decorated for bravery,  Private Sousley is now buried in the Elizaville Cemetery in Fleming  County, Kentucky.   These two men are the personification of duty, patriotism, and self- sacrifice. It is entirely appropriate that the two campuses of the  Lexington VA Health Care System be named in their honor.  [[Page H1083]]    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I urge my  colleagues to join me in passing this meaningful piece of legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                                time  1545
