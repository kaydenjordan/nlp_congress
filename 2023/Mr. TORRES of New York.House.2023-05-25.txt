 Madam Speaker, the failed wars in Afghanistan  and Iraq added trillions of dollars to the debt and both began under a  Republican President. The 2001, 2003, and 2017 tax cuts added trillions  to the debt and each one began under a Republican President. The great  recessions of 2008 and 2020 added trillions to the debt and each one  began under a Republican President.   The Trump administration alone accounted for one-fourth of all the  debt accumulated since 2000. The Republican Party is like an arsonist  who burns down your home and then blames you for the fire while  lecturing you on fire safety.   The fiscal responsibility of House Republicans is as fictional as  George Santos. The House GOP is threatening to default on America  unless it can extract draconian budget cuts against our seniors,  veterans, essential workers, and families with children.   Madam Speaker, that is not a negotiation. That is an extortion of the  American people. That is, in the words of Matt Gaetz, ``a hostage  taking.'' It is a hostage taking that will threaten to transform a  Republican-made debt problem into a Republican-made debt crisis.                            ____________________
