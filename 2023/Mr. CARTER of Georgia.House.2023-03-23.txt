 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and  honor my good friend Dr. William Clark on his birthday.   Bill is a resident of Waycross, Georgia, where he practices as an  ophthalmologist at the Clark Eye Clinic.   He followed in his father's footsteps, returning to southeast Georgia  after graduating from the Medical College of Georgia at Augusta  University. He has since been one of the most highly sought-after  ophthalmologists in the entire State.   Bill is more than just a physician. He is a leader in our community  and our district. He has served as the chair of the Okefenokee Swamp  Park Board of Trustees, chair of the Waycross-Ware County Industrial  Development Authority, chair of the Waycross Convention and Visitors  Bureau, and executive committee member of the Georgia Chamber of  Commerce.   Dr. Clark's impact on ophthalmology in the First District will be  felt for generations to come.   I won't embarrass Dr. Clark and mention his age, but I will say he is  much older than I am.   Happy birthday, Bill. Thank you for all you do for our district.                            ____________________
