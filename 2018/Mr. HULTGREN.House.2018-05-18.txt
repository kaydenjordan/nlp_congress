 Mr. Speaker, I rise today during National Police Week  to honor those serving and remember those who have served in the ranks  of our Nation's law enforcement.   Our brave law enforcement officers at all levels--Federal, State, and  local--run towards danger knowing the serious risks involved.   Just 2 weeks ago, a Federal law enforcement officer working with  Chicago police was shot in the face as he worked to get illegally  trafficked guns out of the hands of criminal gangs. We hope and pray  for his quick recovery.   Stories like these are a grim reminder of the inherent danger of  their job. It is why we take time this week and every week to show our  support for their work and their service.   To our friends in blue everywhere, we simply say: Thank you. Thank  you for all that you do to keep us safe. Thank you for your service.  Thank you for your sacrifice. We are with you, and we are grateful.                            ____________________
