 Mr. President, today I wish to recognize and celebrate the  centennial of Indianapolis' Frederick Douglass Park.   In the early 20th century, recreational opportunities for Black  Americans in Indianapolis were separate and unequal. There were no  public swings or slides for children to play on, no designated green  spaces for communities to gather in. When the city's government took  notice of the polluted and dangerous swimming holes and streams in  which citizens cooled off, it constructed sanitary swimming pools, in  White neighborhoods only.   There were, thankfully, Hoosiers who recognized these injustices and  resolved to right them: the physician and city council member Sumner  Furniss and journalist Marcus Stewart, who both lobbied for the  creation of a park to accommodate the city's growing Black population.  And the family of local entrepreneur Edward Claypool, who donated the  land on which to build it.   Because of their efforts, in the summer of 1921, a new park opened on  the northeast side of Indianapolis where African Americans were  welcome. It was fittingly named for the great champion of freedom,  Frederick Douglass.   A year later, a large swimming pool filled with clean water opened.  There were slides, swings, and merry-go-rounds too. Next came the  adjoining Douglass Park Golf Course. Originally six tomato cans in a  cow pasture, it later grew to nine holes and par 34 and is one of the  only golf courses in the Nation named after an African American. Tennis  courts, basketball hoops, and baseball diamonds were added as well.   When the doors to other communal gathering places across Indianapolis  were closed and locked, Frederick Douglass Park didn't just provide an  alternative, it created a beloved institution that brought people  together.   Thousands of Hoosiers spent their weekends and holidays here. It was  the site of civic gatherings, political rallies, family reunions,  basketball tournaments, little league championships, and jazz concerts.  Across the park on a typical summer night the thump of basketballs on  pavement competed with the echoes of brass instruments. It was not  uncommon to see the likes of champion boxer Joe Louis playing a round  of golf or future basketball legends Mel Daniels or George McGinnis  working on their game.   One hundred years later, Frederick Douglass Park continues to play an  important role in the civic life of our capital city and bring joy to  those who call it home. It is exactly the type of public place where  Americans have always engaged, interacted, and found common ground.   I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing this milestone.                            ____________________
