 Mr. Speaker, today I want to recognize the famed  Bluebonnet Belle C-47 Skytrain in Burnet, Texas, that I represent.   The Bluebonnet Belle was designed and built in 1944. It flew more  than 75 missions during World War II to carry cargo, passengers, and  evacuate casualties.   The Highland Lakes Squadron Commemorative Air Force purchased the  Belle in 2002 where it then made its way to Burnet, Texas, and has  called the Lone Star State home ever since.   As recently as last year, this aircraft was used to transport food  and supplies to the good people of Texas who suffered from Hurricane  Harvey. It logged 13.6 flight hours going back and forth, which is  incredible for a plane of this age.   Unfortunately, on Saturday, June 21, as the plane headed for the  Oshkosh Air Show in Wisconsin, it crashed upon takeoff before catching  fire and eventually exploding.   By the grace of God, all 13 crew members and passengers aboard the  aircraft survived and are now in good spirits and safe.   I am thankful for the first responders who tended the aircrew and to  those who helped contain the fire. I am sad to say that the Bluebonnet  Belle will not be able to be restored. It is a huge loss for Burnet and  for Texas 25. We will always remember this plane and all it  accomplished across the United States and the world. It was a treasure  that cannot be replaced.   In God we trust.                            ____________________
