 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 860, I call up  the bill (H.R. 1836) to amend title 38, United States Code, to ensure  that the time during which members of the Armed Forces serve on active  duty for training qualifies for educational assistance under the Post- 9/11 Educational Assistance Program of the Department of Veterans  Affairs, and for other purposes, and ask for its immediate  consideration in the House.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  insert extraneous material on H.R. 1836, as amended.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1836, as amended,  Representative Levin's Guard and Reserve GI Bill Parity Act of 2021.   This bill is a long-needed fix to the unequal treatment of members of  the Guard and Reserve for GI Bill purposes. Under current law, guard  and reservists do not accrue education benefits the same as their  Active-Duty counterparts, even when they are carrying out the same  duties and taking on the same risks.   We live in a new age of national defense where we utilize the total  force concept with an operational reserve, not a Strategic Reserve. We  rely each day on guard and reservists to protect and defend our  country. As we observed the anniversary of the January 6 attack on the  Capitol, we were reminded of the brave Guard and Reserve troops who  deployed to protect Congress, our staffs, and the foundation of our  democracy.   We continue to rely on our Reserve components throughout the COVID-19  pandemic to activate and support public health response efforts across  the country. The National Guard has been utilized at unprecedented  levels in recent years.   Over the past 2 years, our Reserve components have fought wildfires,  responded to protests, assisted with the withdrawal from Afghanistan,  and even helped Afghan refugees settle in the United States.   It is time the Guard and Reserve benefits reflect the key work they  are doing and the need for equity across the total force. It is time  for every day in uniform to count.   The cadence of activations for guard and reservists has increased  significantly over the last 5 years, and with that comes the need to  meet mission readiness standards.   To prepare for the critical role they fulfill in our national  defense, guard and reservists must frequently train, which means more  days in uniform, more days away from their civilian life, and more days  away from their families.                                time  1245    The GI Bill is both a recruitment and transition benefit to help  servicemembers transition into civilian life and close the opportunity  gap with their civilian peers.   Now, the Guard and Reserves need this more than ever as they are  constantly transitioning between military, civilian employment, and  family life, facing continuous disruptions.   This legislation rectifies the disparity and ensures that members of  our Reserve forces know that every day they commit to our Nation  counts, and that they will have the education benefits waiting for them  when they fulfill their commitment.   In both this and the 116th Congress, we reformed and updated the  Post-9/11 GI Bill to ensure students who are eligible have easy access  to a high-quality education.   We have implemented strong student protections and we are holding bad  acting institutions accountable when they fail to meet standards we set  for veteran education.   Now, if servicemembers can step up and do their part day in and day  out  [[Page H51]]  while holding down civilian jobs and squeezing in time to take care of  their families, then the least we can do here in Congress is to get out  of the way of the solution.   Now, there are troubling reports of upticks in suicide among our  guard and reservists.   One of the best ways we can address veteran health, mental health,  and ultimate veteran suicide is by providing veterans with support and  a pathway to a successful civilian life.   H.R. 1836, as amended, will give guard and reservists access to the  opportunities that post-secondary education and training provide and  improve their reintegration into civilian life.   This legislation is fully paid for and uses loan fee provisions that  this Congress and prior Congresses have supported. In addition, even  the Republican substitute uses the same offsets.   Besides just being the right thing to do, investing in equitable GI  Bill benefits for guard and reservists will provide more than a tenfold  return to our country.   Who are we to stand in the way of an educational benefit that will  not only make our country stronger, but will benefit our military by  having military servicemembers and our guard and reservists who are  even more able to do their jobs on behalf of our national defense? I  can't wait to see what our servicemembers will do with this  opportunity, and I know it will make our country a better country.   This legislation is endorsed by numerous VSOs, including the American  Legion, the VFW, the Student Veterans of America, the National Guard  Association of the United States, Enlisted Association of the National  Guard of the United States, and Reserve Officers of America.   Mr. Speaker, I insert in the Record letters of support and statements  from the American Legion, the Veterans of Foreign Wars, the National  Guard Association of the United States, Military-Veterans Advocacy, and  the Reserve Officers of America.                                             The American Legion,                                                     Washington, DC.        Tomorrow we are expecting the House to take votes on H.R.       1836, the Guard and Reserve GI Bill Parity Act. The American       Legion supports this bill as our signature education priority       for 2022, and we strongly urge Representative Valadao to       stand for DC's National Guard troops and support its passage.        All 50 states have activated components of their National       Guard in response to unforeseen challenges over the past two       years. From protecting borders to delivering pandemic aid and       supporting local law enforcement our National Guard and       Reserve troops have responded to new challenges like never       before. Often, they are leaving both their families and       civilian employers for an extended amount of time sometimes       taking a sizeable pay cut with them. Yet despite all we ask       of them, too often they are denied a cornerstone benefit for       our nation's veterans: the GI Bill.        This is because servicemembers are activated under non-DNE       title 32 orders which VA statutes currently don't recognize       as valid ``active duty'' time. H.R. 1836 would fix this       disparity by expanding access to the Post-9/11 GI Bill for       servicemembers activated under Title 32 orders towards       benefits eligibility.        The American Legion urges support for H.R. 1836.        Thank you and happy to answer any questions.                                                        John Kamin,      Legislative Associate, Legislative Division.                                   ____                                          Veterans of Foreign Wars               Do the Right Thing for Guard and Reserve Members         Now is the time for Congress to pass legislation to allow       National Guard and Reserve members to rightfully earn GI Bill       benefits for their time served. National Guard and Reserve       members serve alongside active duty service members and       consistently make sacrifices without always earning VA       education benefits. Congress must act to expand eligibility       to allow the increasingly frequent activations of these       service members to count toward Post-9/11 GI Bill       eligibility.        The VFW strongly supports H.R. 1836, Guard and Reserve GI       Bill Parity Act of 2021, to ensure equity of benefits for       Reserve component service members. This bill would allow any       day in uniform receiving military pay to count toward Post-9/      11 GI Bill eligibility, allowing activated National Guard and       Reserve members to earn this education benefit and achieve       upward mobility. For years, the sacrifices of these service       members have been overlooked in achieving GI Bill       eligibility. These inequities have been further highlighted       through the COVID-19 pandemic as National Guard and Reserve       members stood on the front lines administering relief and       health services. The time is now for parity with all the       armed forces in earning their VA education benefits.        Contact your representatives today and tell them to support       the Guard and Reserve GI Bill Parity Act of 2021. Congress       must pass this crucially needed legislation now. National       Guard and Reserve members have been waiting long enough!                                   ____                                          National Guard Association                                            of the United States,                                                     Washington, DC.        Good Morning, I am writing to express the National Guard       Association's strong support for H.R. 1836--the bipartisan       Guard and Reserve GI Bill Parity Act, that will be considered       this week on the House floor. This bill caps a years-long       effort to recognize the service and sacrifice of our National       Guard. In addition to acknowledging the service of our Guard       Soldiers and Airmen, this bill will prove a hugely       significant recruiting and retention tool as we continually       deploy Guard units to contingencies both at home and abroad.        While we understand the concerns relating to costs in the       out years, we ask that you vote NO on the Substitute       amendment (H.R. 2047). While this amendment would reduce long       term costs, it significantly reduces the reach and impact of       the legislative change and eliminates the central goal of       parity in benefit as it relates to training H.R. 1836 is       trying to accomplish.        The bipartisan H.R. 1836 will prove to be the most       significant Post-9/11 G.I. Bill change specifically for the       Reserve Component since the creation of the program itself       and we are excited for the prospect of this bill passing the       House of Representatives. Additionally, we look forward to       continued bipartisan discussions with your Senate colleagues       as we work towards final language on this critical issue to       your National Guard servicemembers.        Thanks for your consideration, please feel free to reach       out for any additional information.            Best,                                                  Julian Cardinale,      Joint Legislative Affairs Manager.                                   ____                                 Military-Veterans Advocacy, Inc.,                               Slidell, Louisiana, January 10, 2022.      Hon. Mike Levin,      Member of Congress,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative Levin, On behalf of Military-Veterans       Advocacy  (MVATM), we would like to pledge our       support for HR 1836.        This bill will ensure that the time during which members of       the Armed Forces serve on active duty for training qualifies       for educational assistance under the Post-9/11 Educational       Assistance Program of the Department of Veterans Affairs.       Specifically, the bill adjusts the type of service that       entitles a member of the Armed Forces, reserves, or National       Guard to such assistance. Under the bill, service by a       reservist or National Guard member that is entitled to pay       counts toward benefit eligibility. Such service includes       training, active military service, inactive training, and       general duty for which basic pay is warranted.        You may use this letter as evidence of our support for this       bill. Feel free to use it in Committee or in press releases.            Sincerely,                                                     John B. Wells,      Chairman of the Board.                                   ____                                                               ROA                       Reserve Strength Reserve Life             Action Center--Vote for HR 1836, GI Bill Parity Act         Floor vote today on H.R. 1836! This bill expands       eligibility for Post-9/11 GI Bill educational assistance to       include all paid points days for National Guard and Reserve       service members. This means that service members can earn GI       Bill eligibility days for training, active military service,       inactive training, and general duty for which basic pay is       warranted. Active duty earns benefits when training, and this       bill would allow the Guard and Reserve to earn the same       benefit.     Mr. Speaker, I thank Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Leader  Steny Hoyer for considering this legislation today, and I urge the rest  of my colleagues to support this legislation to ensure every day a  guard or reservist spends in uniform counts toward earning vital GI  Bill benefits.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Before I yield to my distinguished colleague, I am going to make a  few remarks in reference to what the ranking member said.   I will first say that the bill has been in the public for more than 2  years. In fact, the committee held a Guard-and-Reserve-only benefits  hearing just over a year ago to review the disparity in these benefits,  and we have worked closely with the stakeholders, as evidenced by the  numerous numbers of VSOs whose support letters I entered into the  Record earlier. And we also worked with the minority to ensure that  this bill achieves the aims that we intend.   We have also worked closely with the Department of Defense and VA to  ensure all Guard and Reserve members are covered.   The VSOs have been asking for this reform, and that is why we stand  with them in support of H.R. 1836.   Now, moreover, it is not accurate to say that before the Rules  Committee yesterday I characterized the $2 billion cost of this bill,  which is paid for, as insignificant. I merely compared it to the idea  that we should use this bill as part of an offset for the $300 billion  or so that we are going to need for toxic exposure. And I thank the  ranking member for joining together in trying to find a solution for  our toxic-exposed veterans.   However, that $300 billion, I know we are going to figure out how to  take care of that. It is really not a choice; it is a moral obligation  we have to those veterans that were exposed to burn pits. It is not a  choice. It is a cost of war, and we have got to rise together as a  body. We found $30 billion willy-nilly to add to the National Defense  Authorization Act. We will find the $300 billion. We don't need to be  nickel and diming our reservists and our Guard units and deny them the  days that should count toward their GI Bill benefits because they are  doing every bit the same sort of readiness training that our Active- Duty servicemembers are doing.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr.  Levin), my good friend and chairman of the Subcommittee on Economic  Opportunity who is also the author of this very impressive bill.    Mr. Speaker, there are plenty of instances where training  time and readiness training has counted towards the GI Bill. We talk  about the basic training that reservists and Guard unit members go  through. That has counted toward the GI Bill. And if there is a worry  about the Federalization, Federal dollars already pay for the training  days that we are seeking for the Guard unit members and the reservists  to get credit for.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Indiana (Mr.  Mrvan),  [[Page H54]]  my good friend, member of the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs and  the Chairman of the Subcommittee on Technology and Modernization.    Mr. Speaker, how much time is remaining?    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Ohio (Ms. Kaptur), a member of the committee who also serves as the  chair of our Subcommittee on Energy and Water Development, and Related  Agencies in Appropriations.    Mr. Speaker, there has been an honest reckoning and an  honest assessment by the CBO, and this bill is paid for according to  the rules, the same rules that my Republican counterparts observe.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Green), a member of the Financial Services Committee, where he is  chairman of the Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from New  York (Mr. Bowman), my good friend who serves on the Education and Labor  Committee with myself and the Science, Space, and Technology Committee.    Mr. Speaker, it is my esteemed honor and privilege to  yield 1 minute to a champion and staunch advocate who is unparalleled  in her support for our Nation's 22 million veterans. This Congress with  her support we have continued to preserve the sacred trust of our men  and women in uniform and the 200,000 servicemembers who become veterans  each year.   Mr. Speaker, of course, I am referring to the Speaker of this great  House from the great State of California, my own State.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from California (Ms.  Pelosi).    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   The issue of how servicemembers are disciplined for refusing to take  the vaccine has already been addressed in the National Defense  Authorization Act. It already states plainly that there could be a  general discharge, or an other-than-honorable discharge, or an  honorable discharge. So there is, it seems to me, an irrelevance or it  is unnecessary, this proposed MTR. So we already have a solution that  has been agreed to in the Armed Services space and jurisdiction.   That being said, I do not have any further speakers, I am prepared to  close. I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I will, in closing, say that the minority has not raised a  substantive argument, a serious argument against the substance of this  bill. This is a good, good piece of legislation, one that is agreed to  and supported by numerous veterans service organizations.   To the issue of and to the objection raised by the minority over a  lack of process and a lack of regular order, this is simply not true.  We have had ample opportunity for the minority to have input in  numerous hearings related to this topic.    And as to the concern over recruitment and retention of our Active- Duty Forces, I will remind my esteemed ranking member, or the esteemed  ranking member, for whom I have great admiration for his own service  and the service of his family in the military, that we turned to the  Guard and Reserve in greater and greater dependence in the post-9/11  era. And because we were able to turn to them, we did not have to have  discussions about a draft.   We had issues recruiting folks for our military in the early aughts  to the numbers that we needed, and we had to turn to the Reserve and  the Guard. So we need good incentives and great retention incentives  for our Guard units and our Reserve units all across this country  because we aren't going to depend on them less. In fact, we are going  to depend on them more.   And the tempo of the training, all we are saying is that the  readiness training they undergo is no less than the readiness training  of our Active-Duty troops. Regardless of whether they knew or didn't  know at the beginning when they signed up as reservists or guardsmen,  they deserve to have every day count.   Now is the time for Congress and this House to say that every day of  readiness training should count toward GI bill eligibility.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the Ross, Gonzalez- Colon, Moore, and Bowman amendment, and I thank the gentlewoman for  yielding.   Madam Speaker, there is no way better way to connect veterans with  medical care and services than first making sure that they are aware of  the care that they have earned with their service.   The Ross amendment makes sure that VA informs our veterans of this  care they have earned just as they are entering civilian life.   The first months are crucial in a veteran's transition out of the  military, and the Ross amendment ensures that veterans are aware of  what kind of care and support they can access and how they can access  it.   I urge all of my colleagues to support the Ross amendment.    Madam Speaker, I claim time in opposition to the  amendment.    Madam Speaker, I would like to take a moment to highlight  for the sponsor of this amendment, Representative Moore, and all  Members, just how severely this amendment would harm National Guard and  reservists from their States and districts.   Congressman Moore represents the great State of Alabama. Despite  being the 24th most populous State in the Union, Alabama has the 12th  largest National Guard in the Nation by number of servicemembers. Among  the units in the Alabama National Guard that the Moore amendment would  shortchange by eliminating training days--and I say training days are  also readiness days--is the Alabama 20th Special Forces Group.   Members from this group, and units like it, must complete roughly 2  full years of training, from basic training to completion of the  arduous and highly competitive Special Forces Qualification Course,  just to be qualified as Special Forces Green Berets.   In order to maintain a high level of readiness and be ready to deploy  when our Nation calls on them, these servicemembers must constantly  attend additional training to maintain certifications and proficiencies  critical to their jobs as reservists.   To be clear, this training is conducted at Active-Duty schools right  alongside their Active-Duty counterparts, yet guard and reservists  don't receive the same credit for the days they are in uniform, despite  maintaining the exact same readiness requirements.   Readiness matters. Consider this: In 2013, reservists spent 87,000  days on title 32 orders, which is how the Reserve Force assists with  floods, hurricanes, and other significant events. However, in 2021,  that number had grown to 9.5 million days.   This amendment would continue to uphold this unequal policy and  prevent members of the Alabama 20th Group from accruing days of service  for training. Training is another word for readiness.   Some States and servicemembers from units like Alabama's 20th Group  carry a heavier burden, but this example is not unique to Alabama. All  across the country, Guard and Reserve members from every State put  their civilian lives on hold in defense of our Nation. They give much  of themselves, their sweat, blood, and sometimes even the ultimate  sacrifice in service. Whether during training or deployment, they  deserve the same benefits for their days in service. They have earned  it.   Finally, I would also note that the Moore amendment uses the same  IRRRL rate change found in H.R. 1836, which we agree is a fair update  to the IRRRL program.   Let's be clear: A vote for this amendment is a direct statement to  our Guard and Reserve servicemembers that you don't think their days in  service are equal to those of their Active Duty counterparts.   Representative Moore served in the National Guard, and I thank and  commend him for that service. Now, I know that he is a humble man, like  most of our servicemembers, but I think his days in service should be  honored and given their due credit. I know he may have participated in  ROTC, but if his education wasn't fully paid for by that program, then  I think he should be given credit for his National Guard service for GI  Bill eligibility.    Madam Speaker, I urge Representative Moore to reconsider his  submission of this amendment, and I urge all Members to oppose the  Moore amendment.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, may I inquire as to how much time is  remaining?    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Madam Speaker, let me just say there is nothing commonsense about  this amendment. Injustice to our reservists and our Guard units is not  common sense. Unfairness to our guard and reservists is not common  sense.   To say that this is a fiscal burden to our Nation, who depends on our  guard and reservists in natural disasters and who our Nation will rely  on even more in the future, that is not common sense.   Madam Speaker, it is time to make every day of readiness training  that our reservists and our Guard unit members perform count toward  their GI Bill eligibility.   The GI Bill, as Speaker Pelosi has said, did amazing things for this  Nation in the post-World War II era. That same amazing contribution of  our reservists and our guardsmen will continue.   Madam Speaker, I urge all Members to vote against this amendment, and  I yield back the balance of my time.
