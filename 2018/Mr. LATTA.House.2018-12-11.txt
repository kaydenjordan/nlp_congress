 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the McComb High  School football team for winning the Ohio State Division VII  Championship. The Panthers won their second title in school history  with a 28-3 victory over Glouster Trimble.   McComb showed great fortitude in reeling off eight straight wins on  their way to the title. Including freshmen, the Panthers dressed 27  players, about half the number of most of their opponents.   The Panthers' success can be tied to their stout defense which didn't  surrender a single touchdown in the championship game. These student  athletes gave it their all and had the backing of the entire school  district. They exemplified the best of Ohio small-town football.   I know what the title means to McComb, as my dad played for McComb in  the late 1930s. It is great to see the fans rally around these players.   Once again, congratulations to Coach Kris Alge and the rest of the  McComb High School football team on a job well done.                            ____________________
