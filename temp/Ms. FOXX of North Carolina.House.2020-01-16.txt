 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as  I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to H.J. Res. 76, the latest  attempt by House Democrats to undermine the Trump administration. It  seems these attempts will never end.   Specifically, the resolution would undo the Education Department's  efforts to assist students who have been defrauded by colleges and  universities while also protecting taxpayer interest.   Any school that has taken advantage of students must be held  accountable. Students who have been lied to and suffered financial harm  are entitled to relief and forgiveness. We can and should have  bipartisan agreement on these points.   Sadly, Democrats have a long track record of pursuing radical  ideological objectives at the expense of taxpayers, students, and  schools. Today it is clear that my colleagues on the other side of the  aisle are more interested in tearing down the Trump administration than  providing real solutions.   Before I touch upon the advantages of the Trump administration's new  rule, I would like to provide some context on the previous  administration's  [[Page H306]]  so-called borrower defense rule and its many shortcomings.   The Obama administration's overzealous political actions created a  dangerous domino effect. In 2016, during the final months of his  Presidency, President Obama implemented a borrower defense regulation  that was irresponsible, drastically exceeded the scope of current  practice, and came with the shocking price tag for the American  taxpayer of $42 billion.   The Obama regulations blurred the line between fraud and inadvertent  mistakes made by schools. The difference between the two is critical,  Mr. Speaker, because the Education Department can levy significant  financial penalties on institutions found to engage in fraud which can  cause a school to have to close despite no intentional wrongdoing. Most  schools do not have a reckless disregard for the truth.    With this flawed rule in place, many schools could face harsh  financial penalties forcing them to close leaving millions of students  without access to their higher education opportunity. In fact, several  historically Black colleges and universities, HBCUs, wrote to President  Obama's Education Secretary John King, Jr., with concerns about Obama's  defense rule. Their letter stated:         In fact, the proposed regulation language could undermine       the financial viability of a number of academic institutions       and could possibly bankrupt less financially secured colleges       and universities.    In the end, the Obama regulations created more chaos than clarity and  encouraged tens of thousands of borrowers, whether they were harmed or  not, to apply to have their loans forgiven. This was nothing more than  a political move by the left to provide a backdoor scheme to hand out  free education. So it is not surprising that claim filings for loan  forgiveness went from 59 in the first 20 years to roughly 300,000  claims submitted in the last 5 years.   President Trump realized quickly that placing a $42 billion burden on  the backs of taxpayers was not the answer, and his administration made  it a priority to halt the Obama-era regulation from going into effect.  The Trump administration worked to instill some common sense into the  rulemaking process.   As a result, the administration produced a rule with clearer  standards for borrower defense and increased transparency for both  students and institutions.   Among other benefits, the new rule makes sure students who have been  lied to and suffered financial harm receive relief; reduces the cost of  the 2016 Obama-era regulation by $11 billion because it helps students  complete their education rather than indiscriminately closing schools;  holds all institutions, not just for-profit colleges, accountable for  misrepresentation instead of picking winners and losers at considerable  cost to taxpayers; ensures due process for all parties; extends the  look-back window to qualify for closed school loan discharges from 120  to 180 days, so when schools close more students are eligible for  forgiveness; and allows for arbitration which could result in  borrowers' recovering resources not provided by the Education  Department such as cash payments or other expenses.   The bottom line is this: the Trump administration's borrower defense  rule protects student borrowers, holds all higher education  institutions accountable, and saves taxpayers $11 billion.   The American people sent us to Washington to work together and solve  important issues. Our constituents would be far better served if the  Democrat majority used its time to find real solutions to our Nation's  issues instead of continuing to lament the 2016 election results.   Republicans stand ready to provide relief to students who have been  harmed by fraud, and the borrower defense rules issued by the Trump  administration are the answer.   I encourage my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to do away  with the political blame game so we can move forward and work in a  bipartisan manner to address issues facing America.   Mr. Speaker, I strongly recommend a ``no'' vote on H.J. Res. 76, and  I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Walberg).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as  I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from Mr. Johnny Taylor  at the Society for Human Resource Management, SHRM.                                          Society for Human Resource                                                      Management,                                   Alexandria, VA, January 15, 2020.      Hon. Susan Davis,      Chairman, U.S. House Education Subcommittee on Higher           Education and Workforce Investment, Washington, DC.      Hon. Lloyd Smucker,      Ranking Member, U.S. House Education Subcommittee on Higher           Education and Workforce Investment, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Davis and Ranking Member Smucker: Every new       rule comes with the risk of unintended negative impact even       when the best of intentions exists on both sides. This is       particularly prevalent in higher education--a space I know       well following seven years as the President and CEO of the       Thurgood Marshall College Fund and having served as a Trustee       for the University of Miami, Drake University and the Cooper       Union. It is with this lens and my current lens as President       and CEO of the Society for Human Resource Management, Chair       of the President's Board of Advisors on HBCUs, and member of       the White House American Workforce Policy Advisory Board that       I feel compelled to provide perspective on the U.S.       Department of Education's updated rule governing borrower       defense to repayment.        It's important to take a step back. Three and a half years       ago, the Department unveiled proposed revisions to the       borrower defense to repayment rule. During the comment period       many constituencies, including the HBCU community, asserted       that certain elements of the revisions had the potential to       be ``injurious and burdensome'' and could cause many schools       financial harm. These concerns referred mainly to the       standard by which institutions would be judged to have       misrepresented the conditions of a borrower's loan,       broadening of the definition of ``misrepresentation,'' and       the basis for potential administrative action by the       Secretary--including fines or termination from participation       in Title IV programs under the Higher Education Act (HEA).        One of Secretary DeVos's first actions was to postpone the       effective date for the proposed borrower defense rules. She       then reconvened the negotiated rulemaking committees to       address, among other things, the concerns raised by HBCUs and       other Minority Serving Institutions that primarily serve       first-generation, low-income students. The Secretary       encouraged all parties to take a step back and find a       solution that would be fairer to students and schools and       relieve taxpayers of significant costs.        A year later, having not reached consensus about the best       way forward, the Department of Education published its own       revised rules clarifying who is eligible for relief, the       maximum amount of said relief, and how long a borrower can       bring a claim. More importantly, the Department made a       commitment to consumer education for students and their       families prior to them enrolling in college instead of having       them litigate poor college choice decisions after-the-fact       when they've poured significant amounts of time and money       into earning a degree without any reasonable hope of       achieving a fair return on their investment. I'm of the       opinion that the Department's new borrower defense rules       protect individual borrowers from fraud, ensures       accountability across institutions of higher education, and       protects taxpayers.        While the resulting new rules are not perfect, they go a       long way toward addressing the challenges of students and       colleges. The HBCU Community had major concerns about the       initial 2016 revisions because they placed all of the       accountability on the schools and had a low threshold for       punitive action. In addition, many college leaders disagreed       with the ``triggers'' for administrative action. The new       rules provide flexibility for schools to make changes to       their course offerings and graduation requirements based on       costs, student interest and employer needs without being       characterized as fraudulent. Now that nearly all of the major       concerns raised by the HBCU Community were addressed by the       Secretary, it is time to pass the rules so we can put our       collective energy into educating America's diverse future       workforce.        America has a talent shortage--one that will only get worse       in the foreseeable future due to our low birth rate. Adding       insult to injury, we have a workforce in critical need of re-      skilling with a very large percentage of Americans sitting on       the sidelines as a result and not participating in the labor       force. As borrowers and schools move forward, both groups       should be laser-focused on addressing this issue and       improving the employability of the U.S. workforce.        On the front end, borrowers should select schools and       programs that lead to good jobs and whose costs are       commensurate with salaries for their industry of choice. Then       colleges, having enrolled the right students in the right       programs, must proactively develop relationships with       employers to co-design relevant curricula that meet our       country's need for skilled workers.        All parties must put aside petty partisan differences to       arm our country with a highly-skilled future U.S. workforce       sans unnecessarily burdensome student loan debt. Supporting       the new borrower defense rules proposed by the Department of       Education is an important first step.            Sincerely,                                          Johnny C. Taylor, Jr.,                                                    President & CEO.     Mr. Speaker, I would like to share some  quotes from the letter.   ``This is particularly prevalent in higher education--a space I know  well following 7 years as the president and CEO of the Thurgood  Marshall College Fund and having served as trustee for the University  of Miami, Drake University, and the Cooper Union.

Supporting the new borrower defense rules  proposed by the Department of Education is an important first step.''   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as  I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, let me be clear. All institutions, regardless of their  tax status, must be held accountable for fraudulent behavior, and that  is exactly what the 2019 borrower defense regulation accomplishes.   I am very interested in the way our colleagues are using the term and  the way the Obama administration categorizes the schools we call for- profits. They are called predatory. Why is that?   It is very interesting to me that I have always thought that what  makes this country great is our capitalistic system, yet our colleagues  think that anybody that makes a profit is predatory. That is so counter  to the American theme, the American way of life, but that is what they  call them, predatory. It is really, really unfair to do that.   Republicans care about all students, all institutions, and all  taxpayers. It is a shame my friends across the aisle feel otherwise.   Back in 2016, the previous administration let ``selective, regionally  accredited liberal arts schools'' off the hook from facing consequences  for inflating data in marketing materials.   Students who filed a borrower defense claim in this situation would  be denied relief. Why? Because President Obama's administration  believed this theoretical school and the education the student  subsequently received is somehow superior to other institutions.  Justice was not served in this example.   Before my colleagues argue that this example is theoretical and  rarely happens, let me list a few examples, without naming names.   A public flagship university gave U.S. News incorrect information  about alumni contributions from 1999 to 2019.   Last year, five schools were unranked from U.S. News & World Report  after all five of those schools--two public and three private not-for- profits--acknowledged they provided incorrect information.   In 2018, a public university admitted, over the course of several  years, that it intentionally--intentionally--submitted false data to  boost the rankings of its online MBA program.   Other examples in the past decade include prominent institutions  fudging acceptance rates, SAT scores, high school GPAs, and graduation  rates.   The Trump administration recognizes the borrower defense to repayment  process must be fair to students, taxpayers, and institutions. I am  glad they struck a balance that gives due process to all parties  involved.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose H.J. Res. 76, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Guthrie).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Keller).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as  I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, we have to make sure the American people understand the  truth, and it is especially important when we are on the floor of the  House.   What has been happening here this morning is that apples and oranges  are being compared, and it is very important that that not happen here  because that can mislead the public.   I think most of us learned this in school. When laws are passed and  rules are passed, they go forward, not backward, Mr. Speaker. The new  rules go forward. They apply in the future. They don't go backward.  They don't affect the people who were in school in some of these  schools that closed before.   Those students, unfortunately for those students, are under the  previous rule, the Obama rule, and that is how they are being handled.  That is the major problem here.   Our colleagues are saying many of these people didn't know what the  rules were. That is not the fault of the Federal Government, Mr.  Speaker. It is up to the students to understand the rules.   And, yes, many of them are having difficult times because the rule is  so bad. That is exactly what the new rule is trying to fix. It is  trying to bring clarity and help these students understand when they  will be able to apply.   But the students who were at Corinthian and ITT are being handled  under the Obama-era rule, and that is exactly why they are having  problems. We have been pointing that out over and over and over again,  yet our colleagues refuse to acknowledge that that is the nub of the  problem.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as  I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, when I have had the privilege of being in that chair, I  have often been reminded to ask Members to refrain from making comments  about the President or Members of the Cabinet. I am not hearing that  being said this morning, and I would just like to call it to the  Speaker's attention.   I would also like to say that as long as people are getting up on the  floor and misrepresenting what is happening in this administration, I  will continue to remind them that the rule that is being enforced is  the Obama-era rule, and any students who are being harmed are being  harmed as a result of that.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1000     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as  I may consume.   The taxpayers ought not pay the tab for a student who files a claim  that says I didn't like the president of this school; therefore, my  loan should be forgiven. Those are the claims being filed by some of  the students.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as  I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, the 2016 borrower defense regulation does a great  disservice to our Nation's students and institutions of post-secondary  education because the previous administration did not design the  borrower defense rule to improve post-secondary education.   Let me explain. The Higher Education Act establishes that a borrower  can receive loan forgiveness if he or she attends an institution that  engages in an act or omission which led the individual to borrow a  loan. An example of an act or omission could be an institution lying  about its graduation rates in order to lure more students to enroll in  that program. That seems fair.   It is important to note that in the 2019 rule, students who suffer  financial harm from fraudulent institutions are eligible and will  receive loan relief. But where the Obama administration went haywire  was when they blurred the distinction between what acts or omissions  constitute fraud versus an inadvertent mistake.   Many institutions, including HBCUs and public flagship universities,  were concerned that a single marketing error could set off a domino  effect of borrowers seeking and receiving forgiveness.   For example, in a New York Times article published in 2018, Henry N.  Tisdale, the President of the small campus of Claflin University in  Orangeburg, South Carolina, expressed concern over the Obama-era  regulation. Mr. Tisdale said, ``A small mistake or error at a college  like Claflin could put us out of business. We don't have the resources  ready to respond to frivolous claims.''   Claflin University is just one of the many small, nonprofit  institutions that serve low-income, minority, and first-generation  students that have become at risk due to the Obama-era rules.  Institutions like these would be on the hook for debt and could close  due to financial pressures. This would deny students their education,  act as an economic drain on the community benefiting from the  institution's business, and harm taxpayers who may ultimately be  responsible to pay off the loans.   It is reasonable to conclude that the Obama administration's borrower  defense rule could be the deciding factor in colleges prematurely  closing. In fact, the Obama administration estimated it would have the  effect of closing many institutions, which is why their rule is  projected to cost over $40 billion in 10 years. Luckily, the Trump  administration acted quickly to correct the rule.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3\1/2\ minutes to  the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Smucker).    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, we have no further people to  testify. We are ready to close.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as  I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, let me say again, the Secretary has been faithfully  executing the law. The problem is that our colleagues don't like the  law as it is, and so we need to change the law if they don't like what  the Secretary is executing. However, that is not where we are today.   Students who have been harmed by fraudulent practices deserve relief,  period. There is no disagreement on that issue, Mr. Speaker.   Sadly, President Obama's overzealous and flawed borrower defense  regulation abandoned due process and limited student choice. So the  Trump administration acted quickly to reverse this struggling  regulation.   In 2019, the Education Department issued a new borrower defense rule  to better protect borrowers and taxpayers. The rule is the result of  more than 2 years of deliberations, public hearings, negotiations with  the higher education stakeholders, and considering, incorporating, and  responding to public comments on the issues.   To hear our colleagues speak about it, it is something that came  straight off of Secretary DeVos' desk. Not true.   Thanks to this regulatory reset, all colleges and universities will  be held accountable, defrauded students will see relief, and taxpayer  dollars will be better protected.   Today's resolution would repeal the Trump administration's rule and  go back to Obama regulations that harm students and taxpayers. That is  unreasonable to think about, that our colleagues want to do that. They  want to actually harm the students they claim they want to help.  Students deserve better.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this misguided  resolution, and I yield back the balance of my time.
