 Madam President, I rise today to honor the life of a dear  friend and a former colleague of mine, Jerry Ellig.   Some 2 weeks ago, at just 58 years old, Jerry passed away. Jerry and  I met in June of 2001. We were both working in the George W. Bush  administration. We were working together at the Federal Trade  Commission. I had just been hired, at all of 30 years old, to run the  Policy Planning Office, and Jerry was my Deputy.   I hadn't met Jerry. Our boss Tim Muris, the Chairman, had brought  Jerry in beforehand. It is always a dangerous thing when somebody else  hires your Deputy, but in this case, Tim did me an enormous favor.  Jerry was a colleague of Tim's from George Mason University, a Ph.D.  economist, a brilliant man, a lover of liberty. And Jerry and I, for  the next 2 years, ran the Policy Planning Office together, and we  became dear friends.   I don't know that I ever saw Jerry without a smile, without a twinkle  in his eye. He always had a joyful spirit, a mischievous grin. And he  believed in the power of truth. He became an economist because, I  think, Jerry was born to be an economist. I have no doubt playing with  his LEGOs as a child, he  [[Page S294]]  thought about supply and demand and price elasticity. And he believed  in the power of free markets.   One of the things that the Policy Planning Office did was something  called competition advocacy. Now, the FTC statutory mandate is to  defend the competition. There are some 75 Ph.D. economists on the full- time staff at the FTC. And Jerry and I, together, when various State  legislatures or State regulatory bodies across the country were  considering a particular bill that would have potentially anti- competitive effects--if those State legislatures or regulators asked  for our input, the FTC would analyze the proposed bill, and we would  file testimony, written testimony, oral testimony. Both Jerry and I  testified multiple places. In fact, I went to my office and pulled out  the binder of all the competition advocacy that we filed in our time  together at the FTC on topic after topic after topic.   You know, there are a lot of bad ideas that government considers, bad  ideas that come from special pleaders--someone who will benefit--but  the harm to consumers is usually diffuse, harder to see, and much  greater.   And what the FTC would do in competition advocacy is simply quantify  the harm, simply provide truth and light and sunshine. It was  incredible that when we would be asked to come in and present that  testimony over and over and over again, the decision makers would  choose not to adopt bad policies, simply when they understood, through  careful empirical analysis, how that would hurt the consumers.   One area, in particular, that Jerry and I worked on quite a bit was  e-commerce. We started an e-commerce task force. This was 20 years ago.  E-commerce was in a much more nascent stage 20 years ago than it is  today. We examined 10 different industries, every one of which there  were barriers to entry. The existing bricks and mortar suppliers would  go to their State regulators and seek to erect barriers to entry to  stop new e-commerce entrants from competing and driving down prices.   Actually, much of the impetus for the entire e-commerce task force  came from a white paper that the Presiding Officer will be interested  to know where this white paper came from. It was the Democratic  Leadership Council, a centrist Democrat group that had written a white  paper entitled ``Revenge of the Dissenter Mediated.'' And it talked  about all these industries where e-commerce was benefiting consumers  but entrenched interests were fighting against it.   Jerry and I, together at the FTC, we convened 3 days of public  hearings of 10 different industries--contact lenses, telemedicine,  education, funerals and caskets, wine.   It was interesting. At the end of the hearings, we prepared a series  of reports. Every single industry panel--all 10 of the ones who  testified--at least 1 of the witnesses said some variance of the  following: You know, I have looked at the anti-competitive restraints  in these other nine industries, and those are terrible. Those are  clearly hurting consumers, but our industry is different.   One of the industries we looked at that Jerry took a particular  passion for was wine. There were, at the time, extensive restrictions  on direct shipment of wine--shipment across State lines, shipment to  your home. It was heavily, heavily regulated, and the wholesalers did  not want to see that change. We began studying and working on what  would become a wine report. It is over 100 pages long of empirical  study on what that was doing. We concluded that for consumers, it was  driving up costs dramatically, not just a little bit but dramatically.   I will tell you, Jerry took great joy in traveling through Northern  Virginia, going to wineries, sampling the wine--I will say, he enjoyed  that process of it as well--but collecting empirical price data.   At the time, numerous arguments were raised as to why you should not  allow the direct shipping of wine. One was that it would lead to minors  drinking too much. I have to admit, Jerry and I laughed about that  because I don't know that I have ever known a 15-year-old who wanted a  nice, perky chardonnay. If you were dealing with home keg deliveries,  that I will concede would raise an issue, but wine connoisseurs does  not match any teenagers I have known.   But we decided, well, rather than argue about it theoretically, let's  find out. So we sent a letter to the alcohol control boards in each of  the States that allowed direct shipment. We asked them a very simple  question: Have you seen any problem? Have you encountered any problems  with underage drinking as a result of this policy? And lo and behold,  they all wrote back and said: No, we haven't seen it at all. It hasn't  produced any of that. All that cam together in a report detailing the  harm to consumers that came from these restrictions.    I will tell you, just a couple of years later, the U.S. Supreme Court  took up a case challenging those restrictions on the interstate sale of  wine, striking them down, so that now you or I, if we want to order a  bottle of wine for our home, we can go and do it on our phone and get  it delivered at our home. The Supreme Court decision striking that down  cited that wine report that Jerry and I had done more than a dozen  times. As I said, Jerry believed in the power of truth, the power of  facts, simply shining a light: This is hurting people.   Jerry also took joy in that project. You know, Jerry was a fan of  tiki cocktails and mixology and all of tiki culture, for that matter.  He would proudly wear Hawaiian shirts--loud Hawaiian shirts that his  daughter Kat had picked out for him. And he would wear them with the  smile and joy he brought every day.   He also made some of his own wine. For several years, Heidi and I  enjoyed a bottle of cherry port that Jerry had made. He wasn't at risk  of suddenly going into the winery business, but it was still,  nonetheless, an enjoyable bottle of cherry port.   Another project Jerry undertook at the FTC was examining education  and school choice. I sat down with Jerry and another Ph.D. economist at  the FTC, and we talked about school choice. And I asked the two of  them, Jerry and Ken, I said: Let's examine the arguments that are  raised against school choice. The most significant argument raised  against school choice is that school choice will destroy the public  schools; that it will harm the public schools if you give low-income  kids access to scholarships. We sat down and said: All right, let's  treat that argument seriously. Let's not dismiss that out of hand.  Let's treat it seriously because if it were true, I would oppose school  choice. That is a serious reason to oppose it. Let's find out if it is  true.   Jerry and Ken, as economists are want to do, they framed the problem  more broadly. They said: What is the impact in a regulated monopoly or  oligopoly when competition is introduced and, in particular, what is  the impact on quality for the customers who remain with the incumbent  providers, not the folks who go to the new entrants but the customers  that just remain with the incumbent provider? They went through and  they examined multiple other industries that had been regulated  monopolies or oligopolies and for which there were abundant data.   They looked at telecom; they looked at airlines; they looked at  surface freight transportation. And as they detailed in each instance,  when competition came in, quality went up. Competition was good. They  then examined every empirical study that had been done to date of  school choice programs that had been implemented across the country.  They found that, unsurprisingly, again, that competition was good-- something we have seen in the two decades since; that when kids get  options and competition is brought in and scholarships are available,  that the quality of education in struggling public schools gets better  and better and better. That article was published: ``Competition and  quality in deregulated industries: Lessons for the education debate.''  It is another example of how Jerry recognized that facts, that reason  can be powerful.   When I left the FTC, Jerry went on to take over the Office of Policy  Planning. He led that office of lawyers and economists who loved Jerry,  loved his principles, loved his drive, loved his warmth, loved his  humor. He was a professor for decades, beloved by his students.   He spent decades at Mercatus studying regulations, studying the  impact of  [[Page S295]]  overregulation, analyzing it. He just finished his tenure as the Chief  Economist at the Federal Communications Commission. He was a brilliant  guy.   When he passed 2 weeks ago--an untimely death--talented economists  from governments and the academy mourned Jerry, writing touching words.  And in Discourse Magazine, published by the Mercatus Center, Ajit Pai,  Chairman of the FTC, for whom Jerry worked as Chief Economist, wrote  that he would always remember Jerry's warm smile.         Jerry would always start off the conversation with a warm       smile, which would put everyone at ease. He would then       explain in a collegial tone how he thought we should       proceed--wisdom that always informed our ultimate decisions.       Smiling and speaking gently are small things, perhaps; but at       a time when the currency of public policy discourse is too       often pounding the table, Jerry's approach was memorable.    He loved his work. He loved economics. He loved free markets. And he  loved his family. Jerry was blessed with an incredible wife Sandy, who  is a dear friend as well; their daughter Kat, whom they adore--an  incredible loving, fun family. You know, when they were on road trips,  Jerry would eat grilled cheese sandwiches made by his daughter in a  toaster oven in the car because he loved Kat so much.   Jerry, like myself, is also a big fan of the movie ``The Princess  Bride.'' Jerry's death so early is inconceivable.   God bless the memory of Dr. Jerry Ellig. God bless the Ellig family.   In Heaven, the lion lies down with the lamb and, Jerry, may there be  no transaction costs and may the Coase theorem fully operate.   We love you, and we miss you, Jerry. God bless you.   I yield the floor.
