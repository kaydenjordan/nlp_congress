 Mr. Speaker, on September 5, 2017, President Trump  terminated the DACA program, disrupting the lives of nearly 800,000  hardworking DACA recipients. On that same day, the administration  decided to no longer allow DACA recipients to travel abroad under the  authority of advance parole.   In the past, DACA recipients have been allowed to take short trips  out of the country for humanitarian, educational, or employment  purposes. This is no longer the case, and the consequences have been  devastating.   In January of this year, the father of my constituent, Mayra--a  college student and Dreamer--died in Mexico. She immediately gathered  the necessary paperwork, including her father's death certificate, and  applied for advance parole. Her request was denied, and then denied  again.   Mayra was unable to pay her last respects to her beloved father due  to the unconscionable decisions made by this irresponsible and  heartless administration.   Mr. Speaker, I urge the administration to immediately reverse this  harmful directive.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Maryland for  yielding.   When we talk about SNAP, I often think about my own childhood. When I  was a kid, I remember my parents needing some assistance. We would get  a bag of groceries that had block yellow cheese in it; it had things we  could use to make some food. It was temporary. It was to get us through  a tough time.   SNAP is our Nation's cornerstone antihunger program, providing  millions of American households with access to food assistance.  Children living in these households are also eligible to receive free  school meals, ensuring that they are not worried about going hungry  when they should be free to focus on their academics.   In California alone, 4.1 million people rely upon SNAP, with 74  percent of participants being part of families with children and half  of participants already being part of working families. In my district,  California's 44th Congressional District that covers areas like  Compton, Watts, and San Pedro, 17 percent of households depend upon  SNAP to assist them in feeding their families. SNAP not only provides  families in need with vital nutritional assistance; it also helps to  stimulate local economies. For every dollar invested in SNAP, nearly $2  are generated in economic activity.  [[Page H3871]]    That is why the current efforts to ``reform'' SNAP are so misguided.  These include the recent Harvest Box proposal, which would reduce or  eliminate a SNAP recipient's access to nutritious products like fresh  produce and meats, taking away their right to choose how best to  fulfill their family's specific nutritional needs. Additionally, the  recently unveiled farm bill expands work requirements for SNAP. This  would make it harder for our most vulnerable to access food assistance,  knocking them back down when we should be offering them a hand up.   I am proud to support SNAP, and I will continue fighting with my  colleagues to ensure that no American has to struggle to put food on  their table.
