 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize and honor a  dynamic leader from Iowa's First Congressional District, Dr. Liang Chee  Wee.   Dr. Wee is retiring after serving as the president of Northeast Iowa  Community College for nearly 13 years. His passion for inclusivity  ensured that everyone who stepped foot on the NICC campus, students,  educators, employees, and members of the community all felt at home.   Under his leadership, NICC became a space for addressing challenges  in the community, and the college has made great strides in promoting  growth for minority-owned businesses in the area.   Dr. Wee always has a smile and a kind word of encouragement for  everyone that he meets. His authentic servant leadership will be missed  at NICC, but I know that his work to improve our community is far from  over.   So thank you, Dr. Wee, and congratulations on this exciting new  chapter in your retirement.                            ____________________
