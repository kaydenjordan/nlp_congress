 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, the Access to Congressionally Mandated Reports Act, long  championed by my colleague, Mr.   Mike Quigley, represents an honest  effort to modernize Congress and improve the Article I power of the  legislative branch.   The bill does this by bolstering the ability of Congress to access  and understand the thousands of legally mandated reports compiled by  the executive branch and sent to Congress each year.   It is estimated that Federal agencies write and send to Congress over  4,000 written reports every 2 years. That is a lot of valuable  information for the American people and their representatives in the  U.S. House.   These mandated reports contain insights into activities of Federal  agencies. Insights like the status of an agency establishing a new  program or updates on efforts to combat waste, fraud, and abuse.  However, there is currently no central inventory for congressional  Members or our staff to access these reports.   Most reports are sent over via email and can get lost in the shuffle  of an ever-changing and evolving Congress, or they are only sent to  specific committees which prevents the rest of Congress and the public  from viewing them. This bill fixes that problem.   H.R. 2485 establishes a central and publicly available portal of  these reports at the Government Publishing Office. Congress and members  of the public will be able to fully search, sort, and download reports  from this website. This gives the whole of Congress and America's  citizens convenient access to all executive agency reports submitted to  Congress. These are reports that the taxpayers paid for.   This bill also includes protections for classified and sensitive  information in keeping with the principles of the Freedom of  Information Act.   In summary, once Congress can get a handle on all the mandated  reports, we can take actions to reduce any unnecessary agency reporting  burdens.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague, Mr.   Mike Quigley, for working  together with the House Oversight and Reform Committee's ranking  member,   James Comer, on this good government bill, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Comer).     Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 272, the Congressional Budget  Justification Transparency Act.   The Congressional Budget Justification Transparency Act is a long  overdue reform that would ensure Congress and the Nation's taxpayers  can understand the full scope and context of the annual Federal budget.   I would like to thank Congressman   Mike Quigley for working together  with House Oversight and Reform Committee Ranking Member Comer to pass  the nearly identical companion bill, H.R. 22, through the House at the  beginning of this year.   Last year, more than $6.8 trillion was spent to fight the COVID-19  pandemic.   Public spending transparency resources like USAspending.gov and  PandemicOversight.gov, helped the public track agency spending, but  they are not enough.   Annual Federal agency budget justifications provide detailed and  plain language explanations of how agencies plan to spend  congressionally appropriated funds.                                time  1600    However, these necessary justification materials are scattered across  agency websites and often difficult to find. This bipartisan  legislation will ensure the American people and Congress can easily  access these important budget justification materials to review  proposed agency spending.   The bill requires every agency to make their annual budget  justification materials publicly available on a single website. To do  this, the bill requires the Office of Management and Budget to issue a  full listing of agency budget justifications and the individual agency  web pages where they are posted.   Thanks to another law produced by the House Oversight and Reform  Committee, the 2018 Good Accounting Obligation in Government Act,  congressional budget justifications also now list unimplemented  Inspector General audit and GAO report recommendations. This means the  bill will also help Congress and the public annually track open IG and  GAO oversight recommendations.   The Congressional Budget Justification Transparency Act makes the  executive branch annual budget process truly open to the American  people and provides needed transparency of each agency's detailed  budget justifications.   The American public and their congressional Representatives deserve  full access to agency plans to spend their hard-earned tax dollars.  America's tax dollars must be used wisely, and I encourage my  colleagues to support this bipartisan bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Comer).    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I am  prepared to close.   Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge my colleagues to support this  commonsense transparency bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3533, the Federal Career  Opportunities in Computer Science Work Act.   In a world that increasingly relies on digital technologies, the  Federal Government needs to be able to hire and attract the right  talent; therefore, the ability to recruit and retain qualified software  and data professionals is important, particularly as our government and  private sector must withstand more frequent and sophisticated  cybersecurity threats.   The National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence released  their final report earlier this year and found that ``Digitally  talented people should be able to reasonably expect to spend a career  performing meaningful work focused on their field of expertise in  government.''   The report goes on to recommend that new Federal career fields in  digital technologies be established by creating new civilian  occupational series for software development, software engineering,  knowledge management, and data science.   The bill under consideration requires the Office of Personnel  Management to either update existing occupational series or create new  ones in the fields of software development, software engineering, data  management, and data science. This will ensure that the Federal  workforce represents current specialized fields necessary to bringing  America's Government into the 21st century.   The bill also enables the Federal Government to better target  recruiting and retain qualified professionals in these essential  fields.   I appreciate Congressman Obernolte's and Congressman Welch's  leadership on this issue. I encourage my colleagues to support this  smart government modernization bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1615     Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from California (Mr. Obernolte), the sponsor of this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I am  prepared to close.   Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan  legislation that will help improve the technical skills of our Federal  workforce and, ultimately, modernize our government.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, the Federal Government has significant work to do on the  cybersecurity front. My colleagues, Representatives Khanna and Mace,  recognized this harsh reality when crafting their bill to improve our  Federal workforce's cybersecurity and IT expertise.   We face many challenges, including adequately securing IT  infrastructure from cyber intrusions, supply chain hacks, and  ransomware, each the subject of recent front-page news.   Our cyber readiness depends, in part, upon our ability to maintain a  prepared and capable Federal workforce to defend our Nation's  government from a relentless onslaught of cyberattacks.   Toward that end, the Federal Rotational Cyber Workforce Program Act  continues efforts created and implemented during the Trump  administration to promote cyber rotational details throughout Federal  agencies so that our valuable Federal cyber experts continue to sharpen  their skills.   This bill seeks to codify an additional rotational opportunity for  cyber-focused professionals throughout the Federal Government.   Former President Trump's executive order, ``America's Cybersecurity  Workforce,'' established a mechanism for Federal employees to be  detailed to  [[Page H3877]]  other agencies through a cybersecurity rotational assignment program.  The Federal Rotational Cyber Workforce Program Act places management of  a similar type of program under the Office of Personnel Management.   Importantly, for oversight purposes, the bill establishes  requirements for a detailed operational plan and a report from the  Government Accountability Office to enable congressional oversight.  This will help Congress evaluate whether the rotational program is  running as intended and meaningfully addressing both personnel and  agency needs.   If this new rotational program is not providing the intended value to  the Federal Government, then Congress will have the opportunity to  decline reauthorizing the program after it sunsets in 5 years. This is  a valuable safety valve to the expansion of the Federal Government,  which I am glad to see included in this bill.   I thank my colleagues for their work on this bipartisan bill, which  builds upon the cyber workforce efforts of the prior administration.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to the  gentlewoman from South Carolina (Ms. Mace).    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I am  prepared to close.   Mr. Speaker, it is important to improve the readiness of our Nation's  cyber workforce through the expansion of cyber rotations between our  Federal agencies. I encourage my colleagues to support this important  legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, the chief financial officer plays an essential role in  managing the District of Columbia's financial challenges and should be  properly compensated for such efforts.   I understand some of my colleagues may be concerned about the  financial health of the District of Columbia, and I share many of those  concerns. But that is why we need to ensure the best people are  selected to fill the CFO position.   One way to attract the best candidates in a job search is by paying  professionals a competitive salary. The CFO is responsible for the  District's financial operations, including more than 1,700 staff  members in the district's multi-billion-dollar budget.   If the District believes that it needs to adjust the rate of pay for  this position to recruit a more qualified senior financial management  official, then Congress should support such efforts.   I believe compensation for local executives is a matter best handled  at the local level, and I believe this bill balances local autonomy  with a commonsense solution for attracting talent to the District.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, because I believe this is sensible  legislation and good for the financial health of the District of  Columbia, I will vote in support of this sensible bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to express sincere condolences to the  family of Mr. Suthammanont.   The global COVID-19 pandemic has meant painful losses for many  families across America.   I want to thank my colleague, Mr. Connolly, for his work on this  bill.   Discussing this legislation is a reminder as to how precious life is.  Every loss impacts a community and the surviving family members.   Over the past year-and-a-half, the COVID-19 pandemic has  extraordinarily challenged our Nation. For example, the pandemic  presented unprecedented workforce challenges for the Federal  Government. Every State and territory were under a historically  unprecedented emergency declaration and sought assistance from Federal  agencies.   Both the Trump and Biden administrations have issued numerous  guidance materials to Federal agencies to ensure the vital work of  America's Government could continue in a safe manner.   This bill is well intentioned, and I support government-wide  transparency to the American people and the Federal workforce. But the  reality is, I feel that this bill is creating unnecessary and  duplicative paperwork requirements.   Both the Trump and Biden administrations publicly released much of  the information this bill seeks to obtain, and the Biden administration  continues to require the current planning the bill seeks.   Further, putting restrictive reporting requirements on agencies may  hinder the new administration's ability to bring the Federal workforce  back to work rapidly as it is determined safe to do so. I have concerns  that it may be duplicating existing efforts of the Federal Government.   We hope to continue working together with our colleagues across the  aisle to make sure the Federal Government is effectively delivering  necessary resources and services to the American people in a safe  manner.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I am  prepared to close.   Mr. Speaker, I do not intend to request a roll call vote on this  bill, but I am concerned that it may be duplicating existing efforts of  the Federal Government. I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, the Performance Enhancement Reform Act would require  proper agency collaboration with annual agency performance planning.   This bill directly addresses a problem where Federal agency  technology and data resources sometimes struggle to support agency  operational workflow and programmatic goals.   It recognizes the reality that agency leadership must directly  involve their technology and data leaders in strategic planning.   Under the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 and the  Government Performance and Results Modernization Act of 2010, Federal  agencies are required to create annual performance plans.   The Performance Enhancement Reform Act puts the agency chief  performance improvement officers in charge of coordinating the annual  agency performance goals.   The bill will also make sure that the agency's performance planning  process considers the resources necessary to support operations and  achieve mission success.   Such resources include information technology capabilities,  supporting data assets, and human workforce capacity and skills.   It also directly ensures that during this annual planning, the agency  chief information officers, chief data officers, and chief financial  officers are consulted on whether the performance goals are realistic  and proper resources exist.   I want to recognize my colleagues, Mr. Connolly and Mr. Hice, for  their work crafting this smart legislation in the House Oversight  Committee.   Agencies should be committing to goals that have a real chance of  succeeding, and this legislation requires the proper coordination to  make that happen.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I am  prepared to close.   Mr. Speaker, this bill would ensure the creation of more realistic  capability- and resource-based agency performance goals.   I urge my colleagues to support this smart government reform bill,  and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, the National Cyber Director, or NCD, is a recently  congressionally authorized position for coordinating our Nation's cyber  infrastructure and activities located within the Executive Office of  the President. According to the Biden administration's statutory  interpretation of the NCD's authorizing statute, Chris Inglis, the  newly designated National Cyber Director, cannot staff his office with  qualified talent on loan from other Federal agencies.   The administration has determined that the NCD's authorizing statute  does not provide the necessary authority to accept nonreimbursable  detailees from other Federal agencies. Congress intended the NCD to be  able to use details to staff his office.   The NCD's authorizing statute gives power to the Director to utilize,  with their consent, the services, personnel, and facilities of other  Federal agencies, even voluntary and uncompensated services. But the  administration is preventing the NCD from accepting Federal details  while congressional appropriations are also pending.   S. 2382 will help clarify the NCD's authority to accept Federal  details for a period not to exceed 3 years, and will help this new  office properly staff itself in the immediate months ahead.   We recognize the importance of helping this new office stand up its  operations during a time when the Nation deals with cyberattacks. I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
