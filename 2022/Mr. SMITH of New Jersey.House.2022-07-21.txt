 Madam Speaker, several pro-abortion policies  are embedded in this bill, including section 4(b)(1), which states that  ``any healthcare providers who provide contraceptives may not be  singled out through any limitation or requirement.''   What does that language mean? Simply put, any Federal or State policy  that ensures that taxpayer-funded family planning clinics are not  colocated with abortion clinics would now be absolutely prohibited  under the bill.   In 2019, President Trump promulgated the protect life rule,  reestablishing Ronald Reagan's Title X rule that prohibited taxpayer  funding of the hundreds of family planning clinics that were colocated  with abortion clinics. All funds were then redirected to family  planning clinics that were not taking the lives of unborn babies.   The original Title X statute of 1970 made clear that voluntary family  planning projects should not be in a program where abortion is a method  of family planning. President Reagan issued that rule in 1988. It was  upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court in Rust v. Sullivan.   Any future President now, if this legislation is enacted, would be  precluded by law from reestablishing the protect life rule or any  similar policy. Madam Speaker, Title X was intended to be about family  planning, not abortion promotion.
