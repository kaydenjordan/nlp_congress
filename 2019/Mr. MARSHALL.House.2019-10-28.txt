 Mr. Speaker, last week the biggest news in Congress was  overshadowed by an impeachment circus. The Republican Study Committee  and our task force introduced a framework for personalized, affordable  healthcare.   Mr. Speaker, our current healthcare system is broken. It is simply  not working. Healthcare costs are out of control, and it is time we  modernize it.   We promise to all of America that we will deliver personalized  healthcare where you and your doctor will remain in control of your  healthcare. This is phase one of a two-phase plan which will protect  vulnerable Americans with preexisting conditions, chronic illnesses,  and serious health issues while reducing premiums, deductibles, and  overall healthcare costs.   Personally, I can't wait to continue working on these important  issues to improve the lives of Kansans and deliver for America.                           National FFA Convention     Mr. Speaker, today dozens of Kansas FFA members, Future  Farmers of America, are in Indianapolis, Indiana, for the start of the  2009 National FFA Convention. They will be joining students from  Pennsylvania to California and more than a dozen high school students  from my own district will be competing in various competitions,  including Clay Center, Kansas, FFA member Garrett Craig who will be  competing for a position as a national FFA officer.   Good luck to you, Garrett.   While it is known for agriculture education, Kansas FFA chapters are  thriving in rural America as well as urban school districts and have  introduced thousands of new students to agriculture and ag-related  career opportunities.   I want to wish all Kansas FFA students participating in Indianapolis  this week the best of luck and trust that Kansas will continue its long  legacy of  [[Page H8464]]  premier FFA leadership and achievement.                                    USMCA     Mr. Speaker, this morning I want to applaud the efforts  of my colleagues across the aisle on their efforts and the United  States trade team for getting closer to approving the USMCA trade  agreement. I remain very optimistic that we can get this passed in  Congress and that we can get this done this fall.   It is time to deliver the USMCA agreement for Kansas. We have waited  over a year, and it is now time to pass this agreement. This agreement  will mean thousands of jobs and hundreds of millions of dollars of  increased exports for Kansas.   Today I want to remind the Speaker of the importance of the USMCA  deal and to please bring it to the floor where we can vote on it and  deliver for America.                               China Trade War     Mr. Speaker, I want to applaud the administration's  effort on the China trade war. I want to applaud President Trump and  his trade team led by Ambassador Bob Lighthizer for all their hard  work. It seems like just yesterday they signed an agreement with Japan.  But they didn't rest on their laurels and have quickly moved on to the  significance of a Chinese trade agreement.   There seems to be more good news coming out of the White House every  day, and we continue to encourage the White House and the Chinese  leadership to develop this agreement and allow more agriculture  products into China. We look forward to future engagements with our  Chinese counterparts in the near future as well and continue to hope  that we can work toward a strong agreement yet this fall.                         Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi Mission     Mr. Speaker, I would like to stop and congratulate  President Trump and the intelligence officers and the U.S. Special  Forces who risked their lives in a daring raid this weekend where the  leader of ISIS died by detonating a suicide vest killing himself and,  very sadly, his three children after he was cornered in a tunnel.   Mr. Speaker, I have to stop and ask the question: What type of a  person would sacrifice his own children?   ISIS is among the most depraved organizations in history. They have  committed genocidal mass murder and enslaved, tortured, and beheaded  innocent civilians.   Americans can all be encouraged by President Trump's Syria policy. He  has destroyed ISIS, and he has kept American troops out of harm's way.  President Trump continues to support the Kurds in eastern Syria where  he sent a military convoy on Saturday.   President Trump is keeping his promises: leading American foreign  policy abroad through strength and showing our enemies there is nowhere  for them to hide.                                 Rural Energy     Mr. Speaker, this morning I want to stop and say thanks  to Mother Nature for all the blessings she has given Kansas, in  particular the fact that we are an energy rich State. She has given us  oil, natural gas, ethanol, wind, and solar production.   We want to stop and applaud the efforts of what the USDA and the  Department of Energy formally did last week as they began working  together to facilitate energy-related investments in America's rural  communities to encourage investments in our new and improved rural  energy production and infrastructure.   Additional focus on cybersecurity and grid improvements to secure our  rural energy networks are also happening. This work builds upon  President Trump's energy task force on agriculture and rural  prosperity.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the President so much for making rural America  stronger today.                            ____________________
