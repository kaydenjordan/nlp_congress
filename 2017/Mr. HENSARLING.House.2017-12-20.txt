Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and submit  extraneous material on the bill under consideration.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Texas?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 4015, the Corporate  Governance Reform and Transparency Act of 2017, and I thank the sponsor  of this legislation, the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Duffy), the  chairman of the Housing and Insurance Subcommittee of our committee,  for offering this bill.   Each year, Mr. Speaker, public companies hold shareholder meetings  wherein shareholders vote for the companies' directors and on other  significant corporate actions that require shareholder approval.   Mr. Speaker, the Securities and Exchange Commission requires that,  before these annual shareholder meetings take place, public companies  must provide shareholders with proxy statements that include all  important facts about matters to be voted on at a shareholder meeting.  Many shareholders and investment advisers rely on information provided  by proxy advisory firms to guide their votes on these matters.   H.R. 4015 would enhance transparency in the shareholder proxy system  by requiring proxy advisory firms to register with the SEC, disclose  potential conflicts of interest and codes of ethics, and make their  methodologies public.   Mr. Speaker, this is a pure disclosure bill, nothing more, nothing  less. Proxy firms play an outsized role in the U.S. economy in shaping  corporate governance. They counsel pension plans, mutual funds, and  other institutional investors about how to vote the shares of  corporations that they own.   With respect to institutional investors, Mr. Speaker, the share of  institutional investor ownership was roughly 46 percent as recently as  1987, but today, that figure is more than 75 percent; in other words,  the volume of proxy votes for which investors are responsible has grown  into the billions.   In 2003, the SEC adopted a rule under the Investment Advisers Act  that requires an investment adviser to vote in  [[Page H10316]]  the best interest of their clients' own proxies. A series of SEC no- action letters give the investment adviser a fundamental safe harbor  from liability if they use a proxy adviser.   As a result, institutional investors have increasingly relied on  proxy advisory firms to help them decide how to vote their shares.  However, regulators, market participants, and academic observers have  highlighted potential conflicts of interest that are inherent in the  business models and activities of proxy advisory firms.   The committee, for example, is aware of numerous instances whereby  the two largest proxy advisory firms have issued vote recommendations  to shareholders that include errors, misstatements of facts, and  incomplete analysis.   For example, in one instance, a company reported that, even though  the total shareholder return the company actually had generated for its  shareholders was 64 percent, a proxy advisory firm, Glass Lewis,  erroneously reported this calculation to be 26 percent.   Another company reported that ISS erroneously reported that the  company's long-term cash awards will vest and pay out their maximum  opportunity in the event of a change in control. Well, this was  reported even though the company's plan had been amended and approved  by the shareholders years earlier in a manner that would pay out at  target upon change in control, and there are many other examples.   Some proxy advisory firms' recommendations have been made without any  contact to the public company at all, and then these same proxy  advisory firms encourage companies to join their service in order to  have the privilege to ``influence'' an advisory firm's recommendations.  I suspect, for many people, this simply does not pass the smell test.   An industrial company told its shareholders, Mr. Speaker: ``ISS'  negative recommendation was based on flawed analysis of our  compensation programs that did not appropriately take into account the  significant declines in our CEO's pay in 2015 or the performance-based  nature of our annual and long-term incentive compensation programs.''   A pharmaceutical company responded to a proxy advisory firm's  recommendations with this statement: ``For the second year in a row,  Glass Lewis did not include its full pay for performance analysis in  this report. For shareholders who rely only on Glass Lewis materials to  make voting decisions, there is no discussion of the company's  industry-leading performance over this time period.''   Again, Mr. Speaker, there are many, many more examples like these.   So another concern that many people have, Mr. Speaker, is that the  two largest proxy advisory firms collectively--collectively--make up 97  percent of the proxy advisory industry--97 percent. This monopolization  and the lack of transparency regarding proxy advisory firms means that  the writings, analysis, reports, and voting recommendations of these  two firms have a disproportionate effect on fundamental corporate  transactions like mergers or acquisitions, the approval of corporate  directors, and shareholder proposals. In other words, these two firms  have a huge impact on our economy.   The bill of the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Duffy) helps address  these concerns by setting up a new regulatory regime for proxy advisory  firms that looks out for the interest of investors, shareholders, by  ensuring they receive complete information through the proxy process  and can better vote in a manner consistent with shareholder interest as  opposed to the potential conflicted interest of a proxy firm.   Mr. Duffy's bill also helps ensure that shareholders and their  proxies have access to accurate information regarding companies by  allowing companies to provide input on proxy recommendations. This is  especially important for emerging growth companies that rely heavily on  investors.   A bad proxy recommendation in which emerging growth companies cannot  refute the recommendation can be devastating to those emerging growth  companies and, thus, have a harmful impact on our economy.   In a letter to our committee, the Biotechnology Innovation  Organization wrote: ``Small business innovators operate in a unique  industry that values a strong relationship with investors. Yet they are  often held to standards that are not applicable to their company and  forced to engage in proxy fights over issues that do not add value to  shareholders.''   H.R. 4015 would provide for SEC oversight of proxy advisory firms,  ensuring that they operate within appropriate boundaries and can be  held accountable to regulators and the public.   To be clear, Mr. Speaker, nothing in this bill permits companies to  rewrite a proxy firm's report or forces a proxy firm to change its  recommendation based on feedback received from the company.   In summary, H.R. 4015 will improve transparency in the proxy system  and enhance shareholder access to information by ensuring that proxy  advisory firms are registered with the SEC, disclose potential  conflicts of interest and codes of ethics, and make publicly available  their methodologies for forming proxy recommendations and analysis. For  every Member who believes in investor protection and supports a  healthier economy, they should support H.R. 4015.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1315    Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 4015, the so-called Corporate Governance Reform and  Transparency Act, would create an untested, inappropriate, and  burdensome regulatory framework for proxy advisory firms, making it  much more difficult for shareholders to obtain unbiased research used  to make well-informed voting decisions about the companies they own.   Institutional investors, like pension funds and mutual funds,  typically invest money on behalf of hardworking Americans in a large  number of public companies. In exchange for their investment, companies  provide investors with shares of ownership and a say on important  proposed changes to how the companies are run.   These proposals may relate to who sits on the board of directors, how  much executives are paid, environmental practices, employee minimum  wage, and nondiscrimination policies.   Shareholders often hire independent researchers called proxy advisory  firms to help inform their voting decisions on the many proposals they  consider each year.   H.R. 4015 contains numerous provisions that would undermine proxy  advisory firms and the shareholders that rely on them for unbiased  advice.   First, H.R. 4015 would essentially fulfill the wishes of corporate  management by regulating proxy advisory firms out of existence. The  bill requires proxy advisory firms to register with the Securities and  Exchange Commission and authorizes the SEC to deny applications on a  whim.   Additionally, H.R. 4015 would force proxy advisers to publicly  disclose their internal proprietary research methodologies and voting  policies, which firms invest time and money into developing.   The bill would also require proxy advisers to hire a sort of  compliance department dedicated entirely to the grievances of corporate  management rather than the adviser's own shareholder clients.   These burdensome requirements would deter new proxy advisers from  entering the market and squeeze out smaller, cost-sensitive firms. As a  result, shareholders would be faced with ever-increasing fees to obtain  research from a shrinking universe of advisers.   Second, H.R. 4015 would grant corporate management the right to  review and weigh in on a proxy adviser's draft recommendations before  the shareholder-clients, who pay for the recommendations, get to see a  final report. If management raises a complaint that the adviser  disagrees with, the bill allows management to get the last word by  publishing its dissenting opinion in the adviser's final report. In  other words, the bill is the equivalent of requiring that a teacher  clear a report card with a student before sending it to his or her  parents.   Finally, H.R. 4015 is unnecessary in light of existing Federal  securities  [[Page H10317]]  laws. For example, some proxy advisers, such as the largest firm,  Institutional Shareholder Services, are already registered and  regulated as investment advisers under the Investment Advisers Act of  1940. As such, they already owe heightened obligations to their  customers; must make regular, comprehensive disclosures to regulators  and the public; and are subject to periodic compliance examinations,  among other legal responsibilities. Additionally, the SEC has already  provided guidance on due diligence and oversight related to proxy  advisers.   H.R. 4015 would replace this well-understood guidance with a harmful  and inappropriate regulatory regime that undermines investors' ability  to simply exercise their shareholder rights.   Tellingly, nothing in H.R. 4015 advances the bill's purported goals  of ``fostering accountability, transparency, responsiveness, and  competition in the proxy advisory firm industry.''   Shareholders hold corporations and their management accountable by  casting well-informed votes on important issues of corporate  governance, including issues of diversity. For example, a recent study  by Ernst & Young found that corporate board diversity and gender pay  equity were key themes in the 2017 proxy season. Specifically, Ernst &  Young found that over half of the investors it interviewed included  diversity as a board priority in 2017, and ``proposals asking boards to  report on and increase their board diversity are among the top  shareholder proposals submitted this year.''   H.R. 4015 would render these important accountability efforts  ineffective, as the institutional shareholders driving governance  changes would be less able to obtain the research needed to inform  voting decisions.   Now, I can imagine that Americans listening to this debate may get  confused that Republicans, who have been singularly focused on  repealing important safeguards and protections for America's consumers  and investors, are now claiming that they are seeking to protect  investors with these new rules, but, Mr. Speaker, if this bill truly  helped investors, why have so many from all over America written  letters to Congress opposing H.R. 4015?   To name a few, the bill's opponents include public pension funds and  government officials from California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida,  Illinois, New York, Ohio, Oregon, and Washington. These investors  joined a letter from Council of Institutional Investors stating that  H.R. 4015 ``would weaken corporate governance in the United States;  undercut proxy advisory firms' ability to uphold their fiduciary  obligation to their investor clients; and reorient any surviving firms  to serve companies rather than investors.''   Proponents of effective corporate governance, including Americans for  Financial Reform, Consumer Federation of America, Public Citizen, and  Principles for Responsible Investment, have similarly written to oppose  this bill. For example, the Consumer Federation of America wrote that  H.R. 4015 ``would empower companies to bully proxy advisory firms into  dropping their objections to management proposals or watering down  their recommendations.''   Private institutional investors also agree that H.R. 4015 would leave  shareholders reliant on biased information tilted toward the interests  of company management. Sound corporate governance requires shareholders  to have access to impartial information when voting on key corporate  issues.    If our Nation's investors, who provide the capital for businesses to  grow jobs and our economy, are unable to hold corporations accountable,  they will be increasingly reluctant to invest. H.R. 4015 would,  thereby, hurt the very businesses it purports to assist.   Mr. Speaker, for these reasons, I urge my colleagues to join me in  opposing H.R. 4015.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 10 seconds.   Mr. Speaker, it is a historic day in America. Republicans deliver  historic tax relief for working Americans and small businesses.   The ranking member has articulated concern over burdensome  requirements. I look forward to working with her now on reducing the  burdensome requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr.  Huizenga), the chairman of the Committee on Financial Services'  Subcommittee on Capital Markets, Securities, and Investments.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Huizenga).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Huizenga).

[[Page H10321]]         Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  North Carolina (Mr. Budd).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  North Carolina (Mr. Budd).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 10 seconds just to say  that, if the gentleman is so busy he can't read a 100-page proxy  statement, perhaps he could read a 20-page bill and he would realize  that his comments have almost absolutely nothing to do with the bill  whatsoever.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr.  Duffy), the sponsor of the legislation and the chairman of the  Financial Services Subcommittee on Housing and Insurance.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentleman from Wisconsin.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentleman from Wisconsin.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentleman from Wisconsin.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.   Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to  the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee.)   Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from California  for yielding.   It is certainly my pleasure to be on the side of the gentlewoman from  California. Every time we have got in these fights to attack Dodd- Frank, she has been on the right side of the issue.   So let me clearly, though my voice is a little raspy, speak on behalf  of those, as my colleagues have spoken about, of us who certainly have  a degree of education and receive those long statements where there are  big fights and the print is so small.   I will tell you that the proxy advisers are representing not us, but  those vulnerable pensioners who put everything they have ever had in  that pot, and those advisers give those public pension funds the  counsel and advice that is necessary.   First of all, this bill is entirely impractical. Pension plans and  other institutional investors often hold shares in thousands of public  companies. The bill will require proxy advisory firms, who provide  voting recommendations to these shareholders, to provide the management  with more than 4,000 public companies with the opportunity to present  detailed comments on the firm's draft recommendations before paying  shareholders receive a final report.    It also wants to burden them with all kinds of extra trinkets that  they have to give information about, an unprecedented right to weigh in  by the corporations on voting recommendations, executive compensation,  nondiscrimination policies. Again, the proxy advisers work with the  public pension funds.   Who are they?   They are the coal miners and the bus drivers. They are, in fact,  those teachers, firemen, and policemen. They are Americans who depend  upon their pensions.   Mr. Speaker, the reason that I wanted to stand on this floor today  is, just a few minutes ago, we again voted for this catastrophic tax  bill. I wanted to tie this to, as I heard my good friend from Texas,  jumping up and celebrating. I assume they will run to the White House  when this bill is passed in one way or the other.  [[Page H10324]]    Let me describe to you what I believe is the scenario on the tax  bill. We all like cliffhanger movies. Cliffhanger movies always get the  family together to be able to tell the story or to sit in the movie and  look at the cliffhanger because it is always the heroes that win on a  cliffhanger. You are waiting for the hero to launch down and save  everyone.   Here is the Republican cliffhanger: it is this tax bill, and the  cliffhanger is you are going up a mountain. As you go up the mountain,  here are the Republicans and this tax bill that is going to take away  millions of dollars from Medicaid.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.   Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional  30 seconds to the gentlewoman from Texas.   Ms. JACKSON LEE. They are throwing over the cliff the Medicaid  recipients, people with dementia. My good friend who has ALS, who is in  a wheelchair, thrown over the cliff. They are throwing over teachers.  They are throwing over individuals who are believing them that they are  going to get jobs, but they are getting no jobs. They are throwing over  families, working class families, 86 million of them--throwing them  over the cliff.   It is not a good ending. It is a tragic ending, and they are standing  one by one by one and throwing them over this cliff with this phony tax  bill. They are not going to be able to do what is right for those who  are truly in need. The benefits for those who are working Americans is  temporary, and those of corporations is forever.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.   Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record letters from the California  Public Employees' Retirement System, the California State Teachers'  Retirement System, the Ohio Public Employees Retirement System, and the  National Conference on Public Employee Retirement Systems.           California Public Employees' Retirement System Executive             Office,                                 Sacramento, CA, December 18, 2017.      Subject H.R. 4015, The ``Corporate Governance Reform and           Transparency Act of 2017''.       Hon. Kevin McCarthy,      Majority Leader, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Minority Leader, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Leaders McCarthy and Pelosi: On behalf of the       California Public Employees' Retirement System (CalPERS), I       write to express our opposition to H.R. 4015, the ``Corporate       Governance Reform and Transparency Act of 2017,'' which is       scheduled to be considered by the full House this week.        CalPERS is the largest public, defined benefit pension plan       in the United States, with approximately $346.13 billion in       global assets, as of market close December 13, 2017. CalPERS       manages investment assets on behalf of more than 1.8 million       public employees, retirees, and beneficiaries. As a global,       institutional investor that invests in more than 11,000       public companies worldwide, we rely on the integrity and       efficiency of our financial markets to furnish the long-term       sustainable, risk-adjusted returns that allow us to meet our       liabilities.        Although we support the House Financial Services       Committee's focus on bipartisan ways to foster a system that       promotes capital formation and maximizes shareowner value, we       have several substantive concerns about H.R. 4015. Given the       large number of public companies in which CalPERS holds       voting shares, we use proxy advisory firms and other data       providers to assist us with analysis of management and       shareowner proposals and director elections. In providing       these services to CalPERS, these firms are guided by our       Governance and Sustainability Principles and proxy voting       policies to efficiently provide independent research and       analysis that helps to inform our voting decisions. While we       are certainly in favor of ensuring that proxy advisory firms       are well-regulated and transparent, we oppose efforts to       create an unduly burdensome regulatory regime in this area.        H.R. 4015 would create such a regulatory regime by       establishing conflict of interest management requirements       that are duplicative of existing Securities and Exchange       Commission (SEC) authority. Currently, shareowners pay proxy       advisory firms through contractual arrangements, and this       provision of H.R. 4015 appears designed to fix a problem that       does not exist among contracting parties.        In addition, the bill would establish a process by which       corporations have preliminary access to the proxy information       that investors pay for under contracts with proxy advisory       firms. At the same time, corporations that do not provide       early access to their consultants' positions on items subject       to shareowner votes would not be required to register with       the SEC. The bill would also significantly increase proxy       voting costs for investors and create additional barriers to       entry for new proxy advisory firms. Finally, the bill's       definition of ``proxy advisory firm'' makes it unclear       whether the intent is to regulate the thousands of entities       that provide advice to institutional investors or only the       three or so that would be considered proxy advisory firms       under this definition.        Considering the SEC's limited resources and ever-increasing       responsibilities for addressing a broad range of emerging       challenges in our securities markets, it would be imprudent       to impose unnecessary requirements on the agency. As an       institutional investor that uses proxy advisory services, we       oppose H.R. 4015.        Thank you for your consideration of these views. Please do       not hesitate to contact me if we can be of any assistance.            Sincerely,                                                      Marcie Frost,      Chief Executive Officer.                                   ____                                          California State Teachers'                                               Retirement System,                             West Sacramento, CA, December 14, 2017.      Hon. Maxine Waters,      Washington, DC.      Re H.R. 4015.         To The Honorable Maxine Waters: CalSTRS was established       more than 100 years ago to provide retirement benefits for       California's public school teachers and is the largest       educator-only pension fund in the world. The CalSTRS       portfolio is currently valued at approximately $215 billion,       which we carefully invest, as patient capital with a long-      term investment horizon, to meet the retirement needs of more       than 900,000 plan participants and their families.        We are writing to express our opposition to H.R. 4015,       which would impose new regulatory burdens and restrictions on       proxy advisors. As a large institutional investor, we use       proxy advisors to help inform our proxy voting at portfolio       companies. Investors such as CalSTRS are the main clients of       the services of proxy advisory firms. Proxy advisory firms       provide useful research regarding the governance and finances       at these companies to supplement our own due diligence and       research, and they play an important and helpful role in       enabling cost-effective proxy voting with respect to the more       than 7,000 companies in our investment portfolio. We do not       outsource our proxy voting to these proxy advisors. Rather,       our Investment staff, in consultation with our governing       Teachers' Retirement Board, develops carefully thought-out       proxy voting guidelines, and then we vote our own proxies       based on those well-established guidelines.        H.R. 4015 would establish a new federal regulatory scheme       for proxy advisory firms that would (1) grant companies the       right to review the proxy advisory firms' research reports       before the paying customer--investors--receive the reports;       (2) mandate that proxy advisory firms hire an ombudsman to       receive and resolve company complaints; and (3) if the       ombudsman is unable to resolve the complaints, and if the       company submits a written request, require proxy advisory       firms to publish the company management's dissenting       statement. While the stated goal of the proposed legislation       is the ``protection of investors'', we believe H.R. 4015 is       unnecessary, overly burdensome and counterproductive.       Furthermore, we believe the proposed requirements on the       industry could weaken the governance of public companies in       the U.S. and do not reflect the needs of proxy advisory firm       customers who are primarily institutional investors, such as       CalSTRS.        While we understand some funds may utilize proxy advisory       firms to assist them in executing their proxy voting       responsibilities, the SEC has taken steps to make sure       investors are properly carrying out their due diligence       obligations. In fact as recently as 2014, the SEC       acknowledged the important role proxy advisors play in the       oversight of proxy voting of fund fiduciaries and, in 2014,       issued updated regulatory guidance on the responsibilities of       Investment Advisers who utilize proxy advisory firms in their       proxy voting. In addition, the SEC has authority under       current law to address any conflicts at these proxy advisory       firms and has taken steps to require additional disclosure of       these conflicts by proxy advisors. Accordingly, we believe       that the existing SEC regulatory regime already protects our       interests with respect to proxy advisory firms and that H.R.       4015 is both unnecessary and counter-productive.        The proposed legislation would result in higher costs for       pension plans, like CalSTRS, and other institutional       investors. H.R. 4015 would give companies the right to review       reports and lobby the advisory firms prior to the reports       being distributed to their customers and require firms to       establish an ombudsman to address issues raised by the       companies. Given the already short time period between when       companies issue their proxy materials and the shareholder       meeting date, the review and lobby process would severely       limit CalSTRS ability to review and vote proxies in a timely       manner. This multi-layered review would substantially raise       costs in order to meet deadlines and maintain the current       level of scrutiny and due diligence  [[Page H10325]]       over proxy voting. Moreover, the proposed legislation is       likely to limit competition by reducing the current number of       proxy advisors and imposing additional barriers to entry for       potential new firms--again raising costs for investors.        Thank you for considering our views on this very important       matter. We would be happy to discuss our perspectives with       you or your staff at your convenience. Should you have any       immediate questions or wish to discuss our concerns, please       contact Aeisha Mastagni, Portfolio Manager.            Sincerely,                                                      Anne Sheehan,      Director of Corporate Governance.                                   ____                                               Ohio Public Employees                                               Retirement System,                                  Columbus, Ohio, December 15, 2017.        Dear Representative: We are writing on behalf of the Ohio       Public Employees Retirement System (OPERS) to oppose HR 4015,       the Corporate Governance Reform and Transparency Act of 2017       (Act), a bill that could significantly and negatively impact       OPERS' ability to effectively and efficiently vote its       proxies and fulfill its fiduciary obligations.        OPERS is the 12th largest public retirement system in the       country, with more than one million active, inactive, and       retired members, which means that almost one out of every 12       Ohioans has some connection to our System. In order to       provide secure retirement benefits for our members, OPERS has       invested more than $78 billion in capital markets around the       world, including holdings in more than 10,000 public       companies. As a fiduciary, OPERS is required to act in the       best interests of its members, and this responsibility       extends to the prudent management of the investments we make       with our members' retirement contributions. We believe it is       our duty to engage with, participate in, and exercise our       voting rights for each of public companies in which we are       invested in an effort to ensure that those companies continue       to generate value for their shareholders.        However, with limited time and resources, it is difficult       for an investor, even one as sophisticated as OPERS, to fully       research every proxy and follow every issue. That is why we       have engaged the services of proxy advisory firms--they       perform the research and analyses that we cannot, and provide       us with impartial voting recommendations that we consider       against our own proxy voting guidelines. Without timely       access to the reports provided by our proxy advisory firms,       it would be significantly more difficult to meet our       obligations to our members.        We are aware of the criticisms that have been leveled at       proxy advisory firms, namely that they wield undue influence       over the proxy voting decisions of their clients, but OPERS       has taken steps to ensure that this is not the case. Our       Board of Trustees has adopted proxy voting guidelines to       govern our voting decisions as shareholders. To the extent       that a proxy advisory firm report or recommendation conflicts       with our proxy voting guidelines, OPERS Corporate Governance       staff will closely scrutinize the discrepancies and the       firm's recommendations can be disregarded.        Given the sheer necessity of proxy advisory firms and the       services they provide, it is troubling that the House of       Representatives is considering changes that would erode       investor confidence in the impartiality and independence of       proxy advisory firm reports. If enacted, the Act would make       it harder--perhaps impossible--for OPERS to effectively vote       each of the thousands of proxies it receives during any given       proxy season. In our view, this constitutes a violation of       our duty to our members and the people of Ohio, and is       therefore unacceptable        We urge you to oppose the Corporate Governance and       Transparency Act of 2017.        Thank you for your continued support of Ohio's public       retirement systems.

Hon. Paul Ryan,      Speaker of the House of Representatives,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Minority Leader,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Ryan and Leader Pelosi: On behalf of the       National Conference on Public Employee Retirement Systems       (NCPERS), I am writing to relay our serious concerns with,       and opposition to, H.R. 4015, the ``Corporate Governance       Reform and Transparency Act of 2017,'' which was reported out       of the House Financial Services Committee on November 15.        The legislation is riddled with worrisome provisions,       premised on false assumptions, that undercut the ability of       pension plans to receive independent, unbiased corporate       governance research, introducing new costs and burdens to       pension plans and undermining their ability to effectively       exercise their fiduciary responsibilities. We are alarmed by       the precedent this legislation would set.        NCPERS is the largest national, nonprofit public pension       advocate, representing more than 500 funds that manage more       than $3 trillion in pension assets. We strive to protect the       autonomy and independence of state and local government       retirement systems. H.R. 4015 would undermine this very       principle.        Many pension plan administrators employ proxy advisory       firms to provide them with unbiased and independent data and       analytical research to help them formulate their corporate       governance and proxy voting policies. In addition, in some       instances our members ask the proxy advisory firms to       implement their proxy voting instructions on their behalf       following a plan's guidelines. The use of proxy research       reports prepared by proxy advisory firms is one important way       that our members exercise their due diligence to make       independent, well-informed decisions. H.R.4015 would (1)       grant corporations the ``right to review'' these reports       before the pension plan receives the report; (2) mandate that       proxy advisory firms hire an ombudsman--a cost that pension       funds would ultimately pay--to receive and resolve       corporations' complaints; and (3) if the ombudsman is unable       to resolve the complaints, and if the corporation submits a       written request, proxy advisory firms would be required to       publish the corporation's dissenting statement. This would       effectively allow corporations the privilege to make the       ``final cut'' on a report that is requested and paid for by       the pension plan. Such corporate interference in the affairs       of its shareholders is unprecedented and would dilute the       independence of the proxy firms' reports and ultimately the       independence of pension plans.        Additionally, the regulatory regime proposed under H.R.4015       is part-inappropriate and part-unnecessary, and would       needlessly drive up costs for public pension plans while       reducing market choice. While NCPERS welcomes the opportunity       to protect public pensions, we are puzzled by the need to       impose a new federal regulatory regime that is largely       duplicative of existing SEC requirements that are designed to       protect investors, including those for registered investment       advisers under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. Other       provisions of H.R. 4015 propose to bypass free-market       principles by authorizing the SEC to pre-qualify industry       entrants based on a set of vague and highly subjective       standards. We believe that contrary to the sponsors' stated       intent, namely to increase competition and protect investors,       the heavy-handed regime would result in fewer market       participants, would enhance barriers to new entrants and       could potentially lead smaller proxy advisory firms to exit       the industry altogether, reducing market choice for our       members. In the end, H.R.4015 would increase costs, perhaps       significantly increase costs, to pension plans administrators       and beneficiaries while providing no additional benefits.        Public pensions play an important role in the local, state       and national economies. We ask that you consider the       detrimental impact that H.R. 4015 would have on the       independence and financial wellbeing of public pension plans,       and urge you to oppose this and any similar legislation.        NCPERS greatly appreciates your time and consideration. If       there is any additional information I can provide that would       assist you, please do not hesitate to contact me.            Sincerely,                                                    Hank Kim, Esq.,                                      Executive Director & Counsel.    Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, they are frightened,  absolutely frightened, that we could possibly be on the floor today  negotiating with the opposite side of the aisle about investment  advisers.   They can't understand why it is that we have Members of Congress who  do not understand how important it is to have someone protecting the  interest of middle class workers all over America.   You have heard the reference to the teachers, firefighters, garbage  collectors, and on and on and on. These people work every day. They  invest in their retirement and they expect their retirement to be taken  care of, honored, and not to be basically undermined by corporate  interests. So these investment advisers are extremely important to the  investors of these retirement systems.   Having said that, Mr. Speaker, H.R. 4015 is simply the latest effort  by Republicans to check off every item on the corporate wish list  before the holidays. The bill would empower corporate management at the  expense of institutional shareholders, like our Nation's public pension  plans, by allowing corporations to unfairly influence proxy voting  recommendations.   Because of the size of their portfolios, public pension plans who may  hold shares in thousands of companies must rely on proxy advisers to  provide independent research and voting recommendations on the merits  of proposals. Without the work of proxy advisers, institutional  investors would, in practical terms, be left voiceless on corporate  matters that are important to them, including governance, board  [[Page H10326]]  compensation, executive pay, and environmental sustainability.   H.R. 4015 would give corporate management the unprecedented right to  interfere in the relationship between institutional investors and the  proxy advisers they hire.   At its core, the bill is based on the false premise that shareholders  blindly follow the recommendations of proxy advisers who themselves are  beholden to activist interests. This belief is directly contradicted by  reality.   For example, in 2017, the largest proxy advisory firm recommended  ``no'' votes on less than 12 percent of say-on-pay proposals, which are  nonbinding votes on executive compensation practices required under the  Dodd-Frank Act. That means they sided with company management 88  percent of the time.   When it comes to director elections, the largest proxy firm voted  ``yes''--``yes'' votes for 90 out of 100 directors. Proxy advisers  understand that the vast majority of companies' proposals are good for  shareholders, but not for all.   Mr. Speaker, I ask for a ``no'' vote on this misdirected bill, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time I have  remaining?   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Texas has 2 minutes  remaining.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, while I was fascinated to hear so many of my friends on  the other side of the aisle exclaim how much they care about working  Americans, it just makes we wonder why now twice--twice--in the last 24  hours they have voted against giving the average working American a  $2,059 tax cut. Twice now they have voted to deny working Americans tax  relief in order to bolster their paychecks. I wonder about that.   I also wonder, as I listened to this litany of groups whose letters  were entered into the Record, how often I heard labor union; government  pension; Washington, D.C.; and special interest group.   What I didn't hear about is average working Americans who have their  investment in trying to save to buy a home, trying to perhaps fund a  small business, or send a kid to college. It is their interest that we  are trying to stand up for.   So what we know is that the SEC--the Securities and Exchange  Commission--have, for all intents and purposes, required investment  advisers to use one of two proxy advisory firms, one of which, as my  colleague, the author of the bill pointed out, is owned by a foreign  labor union. Yet the SEC requires us to use them.   So here is the radical nature of the bill: the bill, H.R. 4015,  simply says that we ought to have transparency--something apparently my  friends across the other side of the aisle are against.   We say they have to register with the SEC--something my friends on  the other side of the aisle are against.   They have to disclose potential conflicts of interest. Apparently my  friends on the other side are against that.   They have to disclose codes of ethics. Apparently my friends on the  other side of the aisle are against that, as well as making their  methodologies public.   This is a disclosure bill to help investors, pure and simple. We  ought to vote in favor of H.R. 4015.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.   Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record  the following letters:                                 Americans for Financial Reform,                                  Washington, DC, December 18, 2017.        Dear Representative: On behalf of Americans for Financial       Reform (AFR), we are writing to urge you to vote against H.R.       4015, the ``Corporate Governance Reform and Transparency Act       of 2017'', which will be considered on the House floor this       week. By placing an excessive and unnecessary regulatory       burden on proxy advisory firms, this bill would unfairly       disadvantage shareholders as compared to firm management, and       raise serious First Amendment concerns as well. AFR joins       major representatives of shareholders such as the Council of       Institutional Investors (CII) and the California Public       Employee Retirement System (CALPERS) in opposing this bill.        H.R. 4015 would establish a new Federal regulatory scheme       for proxy advisory firms. These firms provide institutional       investors, including pension funds, with the research and       information they need in order to exercise their voting       rights as shareholders. The regulations proposed in H.R. 4015       would require proxy advisory firms to provide the management       of public companies with detailed voting recommendations       relevant to their firms before these recommendations were       shown to shareholders who paid for proxy advisory services.       Advisory firms would also be required to resolve any       complaints from firm management, and employ an ombudsman to       ensure that such complaints were addressed. If complaints       were not resolved to the satisfaction of firm management,       then the full text of complaints from companies would be       included next to voting recommendations in proxy advisory       reports. Regulations would also mandate extensive disclosure       requirements for the details of proxy advisory methodologies,       reducing incentives to invest in developing such       methodologies. The costs of this regulatory regime would be       passed on to investors and pension funds that use proxy       advisory services.        The regulatory scheme is a transparent attempt to weaken if       not eliminate the independence of proxy advisory firms from       firm management by placing sharp restrictions on their       expression of opinions which differ from those of firm       management. Besides raising First Amendment issues, this       improperly restricts the ability of shareholders to obtain       independent views on how they should exercise their voting       rights.        This legislation cannot be justified, as some have       attempted to do, by any analogy to the regulation of credit       rating agencies. Proxy advisory services do not face a       fundamental conflict of interest in their business model       because they are not paid by securities issuers while       providing certification of securities quality to securities       investors. They also have not been implicated in massive       fraudulent behavior that contributed directly to a global       financial crisis. Further, proxy advisory services are       clearly recognized as providing opinions regarding voting       decisions, in a context where many other such opinions are       available, rather than being entities that certify the       quality of securities.        Any concerns about the independence of proxy advisory       services can be addressed by simply requiring such services       to register as investment advisors under the Investment       Advisors Act. The radical regulatory scheme laid out in H.R.       4015 goes far beyond anything even mentioned in the recent       Treasury Department report on capital markets, which examined       the issue of proxy advisory firms and recommended only that       regulators engage in ``further study and evaluation of proxy       advisory firms, including regulatory responses to promote       free market principles if appropriate.'' The regulatory       scheme in H.R. 4015, besides being misguided in other ways,       certainly does not promote free market principles.        The effort in H.R. 4015 to eliminate the independent voice       of proxy advisory services should be rejected. We urge you to       vote against it.        For more information please contact AFR's Policy Director,       Marcus Stanley.            Sincerely,      Americans for Financial Reform.                                   ____                                            Council of Institutional                                                       Investors,                                   Washington, DC, November 9, 2017.      Re Proposed Legislation Relating to Proxy Advisory Firms.       Hon. Jeb Hensarling,      Chairman, Committee on Financial Services, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Maxine Waters,      Ranking Member, Committee on Financial Services, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Chairman and Ranking Member Waters: On behalf of       the Council of Institutional Investors (CII or the Council)       and the undersigned 45 investors and investor organizations,       we are writing to express our opposition to legislation that       has recently been introduced and is pending in the Committee       on Financial Services related to proxy advisory firms.        CII is a nonpartisan, nonprofit association of public,       corporate and union employee benefit funds, other employee       benefit plans, state and local entities charged with       investing public assets, and foundations and endowments with       combined assets under management exceeding $3 trillion. CII's       member funds include major long-term shareowners with a duty       to protect the retirement savings of millions of workers and       their families.        H.R. 4015, the ``Corporate Governance Reform and       Transparency Act of 2017,'' and similar language which was       incorporated in Subtitle Q of Title IV of H.R. 10, ``the       Financial CHOICE Act,'' would require, as a matter of federal       law, that proxy advisory firms share their research reports       and proxy voting recommendations with the companies about       whom they are writing before they are shared with the       institutional investors who are their clients. In essence,       while the stated goal of the proposed legislation is the       ``protection of investors,'' as the primary customer of proxy       advisory firm research, institutional investors believe that       adding the new proposed requirements to the industry is       unnecessary, overly burdensome and counter-productive.        The proposed legislation appears to be based on several       false premises, including  [[Page H10327]]       the erroneous conclusion that proxy advisory firms dictate       proxy voting results and that institutional investors do not       drive or form their own voting decisions. Indeed, many       pension funds and other institutional investors contract with       proxy advisory firms to review their research, but most large       holders have adopted their own policies and employ the proxy       advisory firms to help administer the voting of proxies       during challenging proxy seasons.        In short, most large institutional investors vote their       proxies according to their own guidelines. While large       institutional investors rely on proxy advisors to manage the       analysis of issues presented in the proxy statements       accompanying over 38,000 meetings annually, and to help       administer proxy voting, this does not mean that they       abdicate their responsibility for their own voting decisions.        The independence that shareowners exercise when voting       their proxies is evident in the statistics related to ``say       on pay'' proposals and director elections. Although       Institutional Shareholder Services Inc. (ISS), the largest       proxy advisory firm, recommended against say on pay proposals       at 11.92 percent of Russell 3000 companies in 2017, only 1.28       percent of those proposals received less than majority       support from shareowners. Similarly, although ISS recommended       votes in opposition to the election of 10.43 percent of       director-nominees during the most recent proxy season, just       0.185 percent failed to obtain majority support.        We believe the pending legislation (both Subtitle Q of       Title IV of H.R. 10 and H.R. 4015, which was introduced last       month) would weaken corporate governance in the United       States; undercut proxy advisory firms' ability to uphold       their fiduciary obligation to their investor clients; and       reorient any surviving firms to serve companies rather than       investors. The system of corporate governance that has       evolved in the United States relies on the accountability of       boards of directors to shareowners, and proxy voting is a       critical means by which shareowners hold boards to account.       Currently, proxy advisors provide equity holders of U.S.       corporations with independent advice. The proposed bills       threaten to abrogate that very independence, which is a       hallmark of ownership and accountability.        Proxy advisory firms, while imperfect, play an important       and useful role in enabling effective and cost-efficient       independent research, analysis and informed proxy voting       advice for large institutional shareholders, particularly       since many funds hold thousands of companies in their       investment portfolio. In our view, the proposed legislation       would undermine proxy advisory firms' ability to provide a       valuable service to pension funds and other institutional       investors.        We are particularly concerned that, if enacted, H.R. 10 and       H.R. 4015 would:        Require that proxy advisory firms: 1) provide companies       early review of their recommendations and most elements of       the research informing their reports; 2) give companies an       opportunity to review and lobby the firms to change their       independent recommendations; 3) mandate a heavy-handed       ``ombudsman'' construct to address issues that companies       raise.        Under H.R 10, the company could essentially veto the proxy       advisor's report and prevent its publication, while H.R. 4015       would require proxy advisors to publish a company's statement       ``detailing its complaints'' in the proxy advisory firms'       final reports to their clients, if the ombudsman is unable to       resolve these complaints and if the companies make the       request in writing.        Giving corporate issuers the ``right to review'' the proxy       advisors' work product BEFORE the reports go to the paying       customers would not only give corporate management       substantial undue influence over proxy advisory firms'       reports, but could compromise the very fiduciary duties that       large institutional investors have to their own clients,       beneficiaries and shareowners. We believe the objective of       the bills is to bias proxy advisory firm recommendations in       favor of corporate management, creating a dynamic that would       encourage the firms to view management as their clients,       rather than the investors who contract for this research.       This approach would award a privileged position to high-      powered CEOs and other executives to talk proxy advisory       firms out of criticizing management on subjects such as       CEO pay, without providing the same pre-publication right       to others. Another concern is that such forced pre-      publication review may not be consistent with First       Amendment rights to freedom of speech. Regardless, the       attempt by government fiat to interpose corporate       management between investors and those investors hire to       provide them with independent research is highly       questionable as a matter of public policy.        Further, the additional regulatory hurdles imposed would       surely: increase the complexity of the challenges faced by       the proxy advisory firms; impose even more severe time       constraints on the production of reports; and, without doubt,       add significant resource burdens that would increase the cost       of their services. In short, H.R. 4015 would add no value but       would add an unnecessary drag to institutional investors'       portfolios. This is not constructive regulatory ``reform,''       and is not supported by institutional investors.        Under both bills, pension funds and other institutional       investors would have less time to analyze the advisor's       reports and recommendations in the context of their own       adopted proxy voting guidelines to arrive at informed voting       decisions. Time is already tight, particularly in the highly       concentrated spring ``proxy season,'' due to the limited       period between a company's publication of the annual meeting       proxy materials and annual meeting dates.        Moreover, the proposed legislation does not appear to       contemplate a parallel requirement that dissidents in a proxy       fight or proponents of shareowner proposals also receive the       recommendations and research in advance. This would violate       an underlying tenet of U.S. corporate governance that where       matters are contested in corporate elections, management and       shareowner advocates should operate on a level playing field.        Require the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to       assess the ability of proxy advisory firms to perform their       duties and to assess the adequacy of proxy advisory firms'       ``financial and managerial resources.''        The entities that are in the best position to make       assessments about the ability of proxy advisory firms to       perform their contractual duties are the pension funds and       other institutional investors that choose to purchase and use       the proxy advisory firms' reports and recommendations. These       are sophisticated consumers who make choices based on free-      market principles.        In 2014, the SEC staff issued guidance reaffirming that       investment advisors have a duty to maintain sufficient       oversight of proxy advisory firms and other third-party       voting agents: We publicly supported that guidance. We are       unaware of any compelling empirical evidence indicating that       the guidance is not being followed or that the burdensome       federal regulatory scheme contemplated by the proposed       legislation is needed.        Increase costs for institutional investors with no clear       benefits.        If enacted, the proposed legislation is likely to result in       higher costs for pension plans and other institutional       investors--potentially much higher costs if investors seek to       maintain current levels of scrutiny and due diligence around       proxy voting amid the exit of some or all proxy advisory       firms from the business. The proposed legislation is highly       likely to limit competition, by reducing the current number       of proxy advisory firms in the U.S. market and imposing       serious barriers to entry for potential new firms.        We believe that the cost estimate provided by the       Congressional Budget Office to the House Financial Services       Committee in September 2016 on substantially similar       legislation in the 114th Congress (that is, that private       sector costs would be less than $154 million) underestimates       the costs that this bill would impose through private-sector       mandates. The CBO should analyze the probable effects of the       proposal on competition, and the costs to investors if (a)       competition is reduced and the pricing power of a surviving       proxy advisory firm is enhanced, and (b) if all present firms       exit the market and the services they provided are no longer       available, forcing individual investors to use internal       resources not subject to the new regulatory mandate.        Finally, we note that in recent months the United States       Department of Treasury (Treasury) performed outreach to       identify views on proxy advisory firms in connection with its       recently issued report to the President on ``A Financial       System that Creates Economic Opportunities, Capital       Markets.'' In that report, the Treasury found that       ``institutional investors, who pay for proxy advice and are       responsible for voting decisions, find the services valuable,       especially in sorting through the lengthy and significant       disclosures contained in proxy statements.'' More       importantly, the Treasury did not recommend any legislative       changes governing the proxy advisory firm industry.        Thank you for considering these views. CH would be very       happy to discuss its perspective in more detail.

Re H.R. 4015.       Hon. Paul Ryan,      Speaker of the House of Representatives,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Minority Leader, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Speaker and Minority Leader Pelosi: On behalf of       the Council of Institutional Investors (CII or Council), we       are writing to express our opposition to H.R. 4015, which we       understand will soon be voted on by the United States House       of Representatives.        CII is a nonpartisan, nonprofit association of public,       corporate and union employee benefit funds, other employee       benefit plans, state and local entities charged with       investing public assets, and foundations and endowments with       combined assets under management exceeding $3 trillion. CII's       member funds include major long-term shareowners with a duty       to protect the retirement savings of millions of workers and       their families. The Council's associate members include a       range of asset managers with more than $20 trillion in assets       under management.        Many of our members and other institutional investors       voluntary contract with proxy advisory firms to obtain       research reports to assist the funds in voting their proxies       according to the funds' own proxy voting guidelines. This       contractual relationship provides investors a cost-efficient       means of obtaining supplemental research on proxy voting       issues, which is particularly beneficial since many funds       hold thousands of companies in their investment portfolios.        H.R. 4015 would establish a new federal regulatory scheme       for proxy advisory firms that would (I) grant ``companies,''       apparently meaning corporate management, the right to review       the proxy advisory firms research reports before the paying       customers--investors--receive the reports; (2) mandate that       the proxy advisory firms hire an ombudsman to receive and       resolve corporation's complaints; and (3) if the ombudsman to       unable to resolve the complaints, and if the company       management submits a written request, proxy advisory firms       would be required to publish company management's dissenting       statement. These provisions would result in the federal       government interposing corporate management between investors       and those proxy advisory firms that investors hire to provide       them with research on issues, such as executive compensation,       in which corporate management can have its own interests,       sometimes in conflict with investors and with the corporate       entity.        Setting aside whether the provisions of H.R. 4015 are       consistent with First Amendment rights of freedom of speech,       the provisions are not practical. The provisions would       require proxy advisory firms to provide the management teams       of more than 4,000 corporations the opportunity to present       detailed comments on the firm's reports in a matter of weeks       before the reports are provided to investors. Thus, investors       would have limited time to analyze the reports in the context       of their own proxy voting guidelines to arrive at informed       voting decisions. Time is already tight, particularly in the       spring ``proxy season,'' due to the limited period between a       corporations' publication of the annual meeting proxy       materials and the date in which investors are permitted to       vote on proxy issues.        In addition, the provisions of H.R. 4015 would likely       result in fewer market participants in the proxy advisory       firm industry. The provisions would add significant costs       increasing barriers to new entrants and potentially leading       some existing firms to exit the industry altogether.        We also note that the United States Department of Treasury       recently performed extensive outreach to identify views of       company management teams and other market participants on       proxy advisory firms in connection with its recently issued       report to President Trump on ``A Financial System that       Creates Economic Opportunities, Capital Markets.'' In its       report the Treasury found that ``institutional investors, who       pay for proxy advice and are responsible for voting       decisions, fmd the [proxy advisory firm] services valuable,       especially in sorting through the lengthy and significant       disclosures contained in proxy statements.'' More       significantly, the Treasury did not call for legislation of       the proxy advisory firm industry.        Finally, we have attached for your information and review a       November 9, 2017 letter signed by 45 investors and investor       organizations describing in more detail the basis for their       strong opposition to H.R. 4015.        Thank you for considering our views. We would welcome the       opportunity to discuss our perspective on this important       issue with you or your staff in more detail.            Sincerely,                                                Jeffrey P. Mahoney,                                                   General Counsel.                                time  1415    The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for debate has expired.   Pursuant to House Resolution 657, the previous question is ordered on  the bill, as amended.   The question is on the engrossment and third reading of the bill.   The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, and was  read the third time.                              Motion to Recommit     Mr. Speaker, I claim the time in opposition.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5  minutes.    Mr. Speaker, I listened carefully. I didn't hear  anything about labor union political campaign contributions, known  political allies of the Democratic Party.   This is yet one more assault on the First Amendment's freedom of  speech by my friends on the other side of the aisle. Mr. Speaker, it  ought to be rejected, and I yield back the balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, the previous question is  ordered on the motion to recommit.   There was no objection.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion to recommit.   The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that  the noes appeared to have it.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. This will be a 5-minute vote.
