 Madam Speaker, the Biden administration, through the  Department of Energy, is making life harder for Americans and  jeopardizing our energy security.   Through gradually increasing efficiency standards, rebate programs,  and other regulatory carrot-and-stick measures, this administration is  determined to take perfectly reliable, affordable, and efficient  appliances off the market and out of reach for ordinary Americans.   The regulatory agenda being carried out at the Biden Department of  Energy is a death-by-a-thousand-cuts strategy that will leave Americans  sincerely worried about how they will be able to afford to heat their  homes in the coming years.   From gas stoves and furnaces to air-conditioners, the Biden  administration is forcing Americans away from appliances and  technologies that genuinely work and pushing them toward more expensive  and less available options.   Time and again, the left tells us that this hardship is the price we  all must pay for a so-called greener and cleaner future. In fact, these  draconian measures do little to achieve that future while depriving  Americans of a quality of life we once took for granted.   Madam Speaker, I am proud to support the underlying legislation, H.R.  4394, because it will put the brakes on the out-of-control, out-of- touch regulatory state that has been unleashed on the American people  by the Biden administration.   This legislation rescinds billions of dollars in wasteful spending  from the poorly named Inflation Reduction Act that was intended to  force Americans away from affordable and reliable appliances toward  more expensive and less reliable options.   Madam Speaker, I strongly encourage my colleagues to support this  rule and this underlying legislation today.
