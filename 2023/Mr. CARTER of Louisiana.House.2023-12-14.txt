 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the  life of Amos E. Pierce, Jr., a World War  [[Page H6965]]  II hero and father of my dear friend and acclaimed actor, Wendell  Pierce. His life, spanning 98 years, was a testament to resilience,  courage, and the pursuit of justice.   Amos served as an Army corporal with the 24th Infantry Regiment  during the battle of Saipan in 1944. Though he faced racial  discrimination, his commitment to country and values remained  unwavering. Despite losing his home to Hurricane Katrina in 2005, Amos  and his family triumphed over diversity.   Wendell Pierce's dedication and courage to rebuilding Pontchartrain  Park and founding Pontchartrain Park Community Development Corporation  was a testament to the leadership he learned at an early age from his  father and reflects the family commitment to legacy and community.   Amos' enduring spirit, active involvement in church, and unwavering  support for his son's artistic pursuit, define a life rich in love and  a profound sense of purpose.   As a World War II veteran, father, and community pillar, Amos leaves  behind an enduring legacy.   To my friends, Wendell and Ron, your father was an inspiration to me  and so many others.   Our prayers are with you and your entire family. May he rest in  peace. God bless you all.                            ____________________
