 Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, there is an eclectic attraction in my district  in northwest Florida. It is called Crab Island but is actually not an  island at all. It is a sandbar where people go and enjoy swimming,  snorkeling, fishing, maybe a refreshment or even a hot dog or boiled  peanuts.   Right now, we have a system with our local governments and our State  government working in concert to manage Crab Island. It is all going  really well, and my amendment would prohibit the Department of the  Interior from playing, perhaps an excessive role, in the management of  commercial services. It is a wonderful place, and as we say in the  south, y'all come.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I appreciate the gentlewoman's great interest  in what is going on in Florida. Though we don't know each other well, I  can only assume that if there were a small patch of land in Maine, I  would be highly deferential as to what a local community in that  congressional district might think about it.   I would inform the House that I have a resolution from the City of  Destin where they speak to some of these concerns, but instead reflect  on the value of the existing State and local cooperation to achieve  those safer objectives.   With all due respect to the Concessions Act of 1998, which I am sure  we would never want to violate the sanctity of, the result of what the  Department of the Interior is trying to do in my community is going to  put a lot of mom-and-pop local businesses out of business, and instead,  it is going to constrain this to a Federal contracting requirement that  no one in our community believes is going to enhance safety, but  instead is going to limit the ability of folks to be able to enjoy the  park in the manner in which they are doing safely now. So that is why I  would ask for adoption of the amendment.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
