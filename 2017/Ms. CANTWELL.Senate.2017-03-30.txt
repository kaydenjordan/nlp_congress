 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I rise to join my colleagues here on the  Senate floor, and I thank the Senator from Washington for her  leadership on this issue. I rise to join my colleagues in voicing  strong opposition and deep concern on H.J. Res. 43, a resolution of  disapproval we are considering today in the U.S. Senate.   This resolution will threaten access to healthcare for thousands of  women and families in the State of Washington and millions of people  across the Nation.   H.J. Res. 43 would make it easier for States to discriminate against  healthcare providers who serve low-income and vulnerable patients under  title X of the Public Health Services Act.   Title X is the only Federal funding program dedicated to supporting  the family planning safety net, and it was widely supported by the  public when it was enacted with strong bipartisan support. So despite  what my colleagues say on the other side of the aisle, this issue is  something where all my colleagues should make sure we are not taking  away access to healthcare.   My colleagues on the other side of the aisle in the House--and I know  my colleague, the senior Senator from Washington, can testify to this,  have on many occasions tried to de-fund Planned Parenthood. They have  used Planned Parenthood as a bargaining chip in a litany of high-stakes  legislative negotiations. They even tried to shut down the Federal  Government because they didn't want to fund Planned Parenthood.  Moreover, during the 114th Congress, Republicans voted 22 times to  undermine women's health. Today, they are continuing the same thing.   These health centers are an essential part of communities' delivery  systems. They provide preventive services. They help prevent deadly  disease. They save taxpayers money. They help families with their  healthcare. Time and again, constituents in our States tell us how  access to these high quality care centers translates into economic  empowerment, independence, and the ability to thrive in their lives and  careers. In short, these health centers don't just  [[Page S2136]]  provide good healthcare for America. They provide a good economic  strategy for America.   In our State, 34 Planned Parenthood centers provide contraceptive  care, breast cancer screening, and STD and HIV screening and treatment,  and they have prevented thousands of unintended pregnancies thanks to  their efforts and outreach. In the very isolated communities of  Pullman, Moses Lake, and Shelton, and many more, they are oftentimes  the only family provider that will furnish care to low-income  individuals. Major medical organizations--representing obstetricians,  gynecologists, family physicians, and pediatricians--have also made it  clear that this resolution is divorced from medical science and will  hurt patients.   I urge my colleagues to resist continuing their senseless political  crusade. I hope they will be smart enough to understand that a  healthcare strategy is an economic strategy. I hope they will defeat  this resolution.                               Gonzaga Bulldogs    Mr. President, what a great moment--my colleague from Washington is  here, and my colleague from Nevada is here as well. I just want to  clarify something. We definitely want to cheer on the Gonzaga Bulldogs  in Saturday's game. But so many people say: Where is Gonzaga? It is in  Spokane, WA, and we are very proud of Spokane. It is a city that hosts  Hoopfest, a three-on-three basketball game that many people attend, and  an enormous Bloomsday race that so many people come to from across the  country right on the first of May. I think somewhere around 60,000  people are in that race. But we are also so proud that we also have a  Gonzaga School of Law graduate here on the Senate floor--the Senator  from Nevada. Gonzaga also produces great academic minds.   So for everybody from Spokane, congratulations and good luck on  Saturday's big game.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, today I wish to pay tribute to a  dear friend, honorable servicemember, and dedicated public servant. On  March 3, Gary Petersen retired from over a half-century career of  private and public service supporting scientific achievement and  advocacy for the people of my home State of Washington. Gary has worked  tirelessly to support the Hanford cleanup and the Pacific Northwest  National Laboratory, PNNL, and has undoubtedly bolstered our Nation's  security during the 52 years that he has lived and worked in the Tri- Cities.   Gary and I have collaborated closely many times over the years on  many projects. Most recently, he played a key role in organizing the  energy workforce roundtable held at PNNL with Department of Energy  Secretary Moniz in August of last year. Gary has been a steadfast  advocate for cleaning up the Hanford site, funding for the world-class  research and development at PNNL, and for the continued growth of the  Volpentest HAMMER Training Center at the Hanford site. I am confident  that Washington State, and especially the Tri-Cities, would not be as  well positioned to tackle our Nation's future energy challenges if not  for over 50 years of Gary Petersen's tireless work.   Originally from Omak, a small city located in Okanogan County, Gary  joined the Army and was stationed in the Tri-Cities in January 1960.  After a duty station transfer to Korea, Gary returned and graduated  with a communications degree from Washington State University. Shortly  after graduation, Gary started with Battelle, a company that had a  contract for a research and development lab located at Hanford. That  lab provided crucial services during the Cold War and is now known as  PNNL. Gary went on to work for Westinghouse on the Fast Flux Test  Facility, the Washington Public Power Supply System, and spent time  with the International Nuclear Safety Program, a cooperative nuclear  energy safety effort between the U.S. and Soviet Union. After retiring  from Battelle in 2002, Gary served on the Tri-City Development Council,  TRIDEC, an organization dedicated to improving the economic health of  the Tri-Cities area.   During his 14 years at TRIDEC, Gary has been a relentless supporter  for DOE's missions at Hanford and PNNL and a champion for the larger  Tri-City community and our State by ensuring important projects  received needed Federal resources. Gary is the type of constituent  every member hopes to have in their communities back home--a very  involved citizen. He has been a strong advocate for the issues that  matter to the people of Washington while also understanding the  importance of communicating with his political representatives. My  relationship with Gary has been invaluable, and he has been  instrumental in many of my proudest career accomplishments.   Gary shares my vision for why establishing the Manhattan Project  National Historical Park was so important. We worked together for many  years to champion and ultimately see the creation of the Manhattan  Project National Historical Park. The legislation I authored preserved  the central landmark of the Hanford site and the park, the B Reactor,  the first full-scale plutonium production nuclear reactor ever built  and a tremendous technological achievement for its time. The park also  includes the Bruggemann Agricultural Warehouse, the White Bluffs Bank,  the historic Hanford High School, and the Hanford Irrigation District's  Allard Pump House. Visitors from 70 countries have already visited the  B Reactor, demonstrating the uniqueness of the park and the curiosity  people have about this chapter of American and world history. We all  owe Gary a debt of gratitude for the establishment of this park.   Today the Tri-Cities is home to a vibrant agricultural industry, some  of the best healthcare available, two colleges that are training  workers to meet the varied needs of the region's businesses, increasing  wine tourism, and a newly expanded airport. Gary has touched all of  these projects and many more.   I am incredibly proud to have worked with Gary and to call him a  friend. Gary, thank you for all of your years of advocacy for the Tri- Cities. I join Washingtonians in thanking him for his longstanding  service and wish him and his wife, Margaret, all the best in the  future.                            ____________________
