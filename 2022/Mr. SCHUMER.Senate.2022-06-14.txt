 Mr. President, as we speak, the U.S. Senate is working  on something not seen since the time we passed the Brady bill I  authored nearly three decades ago: a bipartisan effort to draft  meaningful gun safety legislation.   For decades, the rhythms of the gun debate in Congress have followed  a dispiriting pattern: a mass shooting takes place somewhere in  America, innocent people are slaughtered, families grieve and demand  action, but gridlock takes over, and nothing--nothing--gets done. This  was the cycle of inaction after Sandy Hook, Las Vegas, Orlando,  Charleston, Parkland, El Paso, Atlanta, Pittsburgh, and so many others.  But after Uvalde and Buffalo, perhaps--perhaps--this time could be  different.   To many Senators on both sides, this debate certainly feels  different. With Sunday's announcement of a bipartisan framework for gun  legislation, we are further down the road to gun safety reform than we  have been in a long time.   I spoke with Senators Cornyn and Murphy this morning, and they  updated me on their progress. They are working with the urgency the  situation demands, and they are hopeful the legislative text can be  finalized in the coming days.   I have assured my colleagues that once we get legislative text to a  gun safety bill, I will move to hold a vote on the Senate floor as soon  as possible.   I hope that in the very near future, Democrats and Republicans can  take the real momentum of the past few weeks and translate it into  something that has escaped this Chamber for decades: voting on and  passing long-sought gun safety reform.   It is a rare opportunity for the Senate. So in order to reach our  goal, we have to keep working with the same urgency and good faith that  has carried us this far.   For sure, the bipartisan framework is far from perfect, but if  passed, it will unquestionably save lives and would be the most  significant action on guns that the Senate has taken in nearly  [[Page S2920]]  three decades. If passed, it would enhance background checks for those  under 21. It will help States with their red flag laws, preventing  shootings before they happen. It will make it harder for domestic  abusers to acquire a weapon by closing the boyfriend loophole.   Significantly, this framework also calls for new punishment for gun  traffickers. We all know one of the biggest weaknesses in our country's  gun laws as they are today is that anyone can buy a gun in one State  and then simply smuggle it into another. We could begin to fight  against that with stiffer penalties on gun trafficking.   Of course, this framework will help lower crime and reduce gun  violence in our neighborhoods by increasing funding for mental health  as well. And even on its own, funding for mental health with great  increases in mental health problems that we see after COVID is very  much needed.    Taken together, the policies outlined by the bipartisan framework  would be an important first step to saving lives. It would lay the  foundation for a more sensible approach to gun safety in the future. It  certainly is not everything Democrats want, but if we can save even one  life--one life--our efforts will have been worth it.   I hope that very soon the Senate can break the cycle of violence,  grieving, and gridlock that has held firm for far too long. This is the  best chance we have had in years to finally tell the American people  that, yes, after the horrifying tragedies of Uvalde and Buffalo, this  time--this time--will be different.   We have more work to do so I urge my colleagues not to let this  precious opportunity slip away.                                  H.R. 3967    Mr. President, now on the PACT Act, today, the Senate will continue  consideration of the Honoring Our PACT Act--the most ambitious and  important expansion of veteran healthcare benefits that we have seen in  decades.   Yesterday, we invoked cloture on the substitute amendment to the PACT  Act with a very strong bipartisan vote, 78 to 17. Seventy-eight votes,  a clear indication that both sides want this bill passed through the  Senate. There is no reason to delay that outcome.   Today, we will continue working with our Republican colleagues to see  if we can speed up consideration of this legislation. With Republican  cooperation, we could be done with the PACT Act as soon as tomorrow.   We need to pass the PACT Act ASAP because our veterans have waited  long enough for their healthcare benefits to treat complications from  toxic exposure. Over the last two decades, an estimated 3.5 million  servicemembers were exposed to dangerous chemicals while in the line of  duty while risking their lives for us.   Burn pits were a common method of eliminating all sorts of waste  throughout Iraq and Afghanistan, from everyday trash to hazardous and  poisonous materials. After returning home, many veterans developed  terrible diseases because of their exposure to these toxic waste dumps.  But even so, nearly 80 percent of all disability claims related to burn  pits have been denied by the Veterans' Administration. What an  indignity. What an injustice. No veteran should ever have to carry the  burden of treating complications from toxic exposure alone, and we can  change that with this bill.   There is every reason in the world to get the PACT Act done quickly.  Both parties want it, our veterans deserve it, and the time is long  past for us to make a change at the VA.                          Ocean Shipping Reform Act    Mr. President, on shipping, last night, finally, the House  overwhelmingly approved the Senate's Ocean Shipping Reform Act--the  most significant maritime reform law passed by Congress in years.   The inflation-fighting shipping bill now goes to the President's desk  for signature, finally providing relief to American exporters and  consumers alike.   Shipping reform is exactly the kind of bill that can make a  difference to the American people: It fights inflation. It relieves our  supply chains. It helps small businesses and consumers alike. Not too  much has been written about this bill because, sadly, the way our world  and media work, if there is not a big conflict, they don't write much  about it. But this is very important.   If high prices are our No. 1 nemesis, one of the main reasons is the  ships piled up at our ports. We have all seen the pictures outside the  ports of L.A. and Seattle and Savannah and Norfolk and New York, New  Jersey. This is causing people to pay more. It is no one's fault. It is  COVID-related, and now there is a big rush to make up for the delays  that COVID caused.   We have to do something about it, and we have. There are many  frustrating reasons why prices are going up right now, but one of the  main ones is abuses from ocean carriers.   Over the course of the pandemic--listen to this, folks. Over the  course of the pandemic, unfair shipping practices led carriers to  increase prices by as much as 1,000 percent--1,000-percent increase in  prices in shipping. And who is paying that? The average family in  America and the average exporting business.   Even worse, foreign carriers oftentimes refuse to even transport U.S.  goods overseas. And by now we are seeing the results: backlogs at the  ports of L.A. and Seattle and Georgia and New York and New Jersey and  other major hubs.   This is not just a problem for the coasts. When backlog occurs at the  ports in Los Angeles, it hurts farmers in Minnesota or Wisconsin. It  hurts truckers and tech companies and manufacturers in mom-and-pop  shops all over the country. And most of all, it hurts American  consumers.   Our shipping reform bill will fix this by making it harder for ocean  carriers to unreasonably refuse American goods at our ports, while  strengthening the Federal Maritime Commission's powers to stop abusive  practices by foreign carriers.   I want to thank Speaker Pelosi and my House colleagues who worked to  pass this bill. And special thanks goes to Senators Klobuchar and Thune  for authoring the legislation, as well Chairman Cantwell who used her  legislative skills, which are indeed very, very fine. She shepherded  the bill through this Chamber. Because of the hard work of these folks,  shipping reform will now become law. American consumers will soon feel  the benefit.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
