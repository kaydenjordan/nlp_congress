 Mr. Speaker, this April, the House  Agriculture Committee hosted an important hearing on one of America's  most pressing issues, broadband connectivity.   For years, the digital divide has left many Americans unable to  access reliable high-speed internet service, resulting in lost  opportunities to expand businesses, learn new skills, or even  participate in daily activities.   I see this cost and frustration every day. I am fortunate to live in  the service territory of a rural electric cooperative which offers  quality internet services to my home. But, just a few miles away, my  neighbors are on the wrong side of the digital divide.   I represent 14 counties in rural Pennsylvania, and I can tell you, it  is like  [[Page H3012]]  this all across my district, with digital haves and have-nots just down  the road from one another. It is a checkerboard of connectivity.   In the height of the pandemic, I heard one too many home-schooling  horror stories that were a result of not having reliable access to the  internet. A number of families were driving to the nearest local  library, sitting in the parking lot, and connecting to the public WiFi  in hopes of completing assignments.    COVID-19 laid bare the urgency of rural broadband, but the  connectivity struggles in rural communities predate this pandemic, and  they will not ease as we return to normal. As more of American life is  being put online, more of it is being put out of reach of Americans  without high-speed internet access, and those without are falling  further behind.   Despite years of efforts and billions of dollars spent, too many  communities are being left behind.   Broadband is not just needed for our homes; it is desperately needed  on our farms as well. The demands of a 21st century farm economy  depends on reliable connectivity.   The Agriculture Committee has done tremendous work on a bipartisan  basis to address the digital divide, most recently with the broadband  provisions in the 2018 farm bill. Those changes reflected 2 years of  work to develop policies and design programs which meet the unique  challenges of rural communities. That farm bill became law with broad  bipartisan support in both the House and the Senate.   Unfortunately, those policies and programs are languishing. Changes  and improvements championed by Members of both parties regarding  eligible areas, long-term network viability, assistance for our most  rural communities, program integrity, and more, remain unfunded and  unimplemented more than 2 years after they were signed into law.   This is unacceptable. That is why I recently introduced the Broadband  for Rural America Act. This bill is the responsible path forward to  bridging the digital divide. It prioritizes the needs of rural  communities and is a step in the right direction as we begin to rebound  into a resurgent post-COVID economy. I urge my colleagues to join me on  this critical piece of legislation.   The one issue that unites rural Members on both sides of the aisle is  the need to address the digital divide. This critical infrastructure  void has been exacerbated by the challenges faced by rural families and  businesses during the pandemic.   I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the  aisle to tell the story of the 2018 farm bill and the improvements we  made and continue to fight for broadband investments so desperately  needed in our rural communities.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize  Religious Freedom Week. Religious Freedom Week began on Monday and runs  through June 29.   Freedom of religion is a fundamental human right. Our Founding  Fathers made sure it would always be protected. The First Amendment  protects freedom of religion along with the freedom of speech and the  freedom of the press.   This assurance of freedom gives us all the opportunity to openly  practice and speak our beliefs. It allows me to speak on the House  floor right now.   The United States is a place where all faiths can be peacefully  practiced free from the fear of persecution.   The very foundation of our Nation, a place of freedom and liberty for  all, was conceived by individuals in search of religious freedom.   Mr. Speaker, the United States of America will always be a beacon of  light in the world, and we will always protect our fundamental, unified  commitment of religious freedom because no person should live in fear  for their beliefs.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank my brother  firefighter for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to address the importance of the Hyde  amendment.   In the Declaration of Independence, Thomas Jefferson penned three  unalienable rights: life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.   As Members of Congress, it is our job to uphold those rights, and  that can start with protecting the Hyde amendment. For over 40 years,  the Hyde amendment has maintained bipartisan support and passed through  Congress. Even President Joe Biden, then-Senator Joe Biden, supported  this amendment.   The Hyde amendment ensures that Americans are not forced to pay for  abortions with their tax dollars. But this year, the Hyde amendment is  under attack. The current administration budget proposal calls for the  Hyde amendment to be removed from the fiscal year 2022 budget. This is  radical, even for Democrats.   The Hyde amendment saves lives. Since its original introduction,  nearly 2.5 million lives have been saved from abortion. With nearly 60  percent of Americans agreeing that taxpayer dollars should not be used  to fund abortions, we must keep the Hyde amendment in the fiscal year  2022 budget and beyond.   For these reasons, I am proud to be an original cosponsor of H.R. 18,  the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act. This bill would make the Hyde  amendment permanent and governmentwide. Mr. Speaker, we know life  begins at conception. That is why we must stand up and continue to  fight for the unborn.
