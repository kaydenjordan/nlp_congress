 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize Liz Dunbar for  her many years of transformative public service on behalf of folks in  my region.   As executive director of Tacoma Community House, Liz has been an  unyielding advocate for social justice. Liz has lived a life of  service. She spent 25 years at the Washington State Department of  Social and Health Services, where she worked in several capacities,  including State refugee coordinator, diversity director, assistant  secretary for economic services, and, ultimately, as the deputy  secretary of the department for 6 years.   But 10 years ago, Liz stepped into her role at Tacoma Community  House, an extraordinary 100-year-old organization dedicated to  empowering immigrants and ensuring that all people in the greater Puget  Sound region can live with dignity and achieve their personal and  professional goals.   Each year, Tacoma Community House serves approximately 3,500 clients  from more than 100 different countries through its four core programs  of employment, education, immigration, and advocacy.   Madam Speaker, Liz Dunbar has made a difference. She has helped  thousands of people get the chance to realize the American Dream.   So I rise today on behalf of our community to thank Liz and to  recognize her for a career well spent in public service.                               ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this bill, which will  restore funding for the Department of the Interior, for the Forest  Service, and for the Environmental Protection Agency, because it is  simply wrong for Federal workers to be held hostage. It is wrong for  people who depend on these agencies to be held hostage as a negotiating  tactic on a completely unrelated policy issue.   The region I represent has more than 600,000 acres of Federal  forests. It is the home to Olympic National Park, one of the crown  jewels of the National Park System. And it overlooks the iconic Puget  Sound. So I am speaking today on behalf of the hundreds of Federal  workers who protect and manage these natural resources, from park  rangers to timber sale specialists to water quality monitors, who have  gone unpaid for almost 3 weeks.   But this isn't just about those Federal workers who have lost their  pay. I am also here to speak on behalf of the communities that depend  on these Federal resources, gateway communities like my hometown where  I grew up, Port Angeles, Washington, where the economy depends on park  visitors who come in and eat at local restaurants, stay in local  hotels, and gas up their cars; remote towns like Forks that count on  the Forest Service to maintain roads; Tribal communities like Taholah  that rely on resources from the Indian Health Service to support their  local health clinic; and cities like Tacoma that trust the  Environmental Protection Agency to protect the quality of their air and  their water.   Congress should end this shutdown now so that Federal workers can  receive the pay that they have earned for serving us and so that our  communities can again count on the government to provide taxpayers with  the services that they fund, services that belong to everyone in this  country.   This bill is a responsible way forward. It has already passed the  Senate with the support of 92 Senators, including Majority Leader  McConnell. Congress should not wait another day to pass this bill and  reopen these agencies, so I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes.''
