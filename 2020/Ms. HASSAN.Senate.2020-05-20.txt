 Mr. President, I am proud to recognize Kearsarge  High School's student group, Students Working on Community Outreach,  SWOCO, for continuing to lift up their fellow classmates and support  community members--even from a distance--amid the COVID-19 pandemic.   Even before the pandemic, SWOCO members worked hard to make a  difference in their community. One of their most impressive  accomplishments was hosting a conference for neighboring school  districts on how students could become stronger leaders in their  communities. The group also partnered with the National Honor Society  to organize blanket drives and food drives for Liberty House, a  veterans homeless shelter.   Like so many Granite Staters, these students have needed to adjust to  the new realities of this pandemic, including finding ways to organize  without being in the same physical space. Among other things, the  students, who are now meeting over conference calls, organized both a  student and teacher Zoom talent show in an effort to keep their  classmates engaged with their school community during this challenging  time.   The members of SWOCO also started a Little Free Pantry project in  Kearsarge, which is a grassroots movement to help members of the  community who are food insecure access essentials, such as food and  personal care items. The members are coordinating all of the food  pantries throughout the school district and have encouraged various  student organizations to sign up to help stock the shelves.   The COVID-19 pandemic has caused Granite Staters to face  unprecedented challenges, but even in the face of this crisis, they are  coming together to support one another. For the members of SWOCO, this  pandemic may have changed how they operate, but it did not change their  mission or commitment to their community and fellow citizens. Their  commitment to forging ahead in difficult times to help people from all  walks of life and to support their community exemplifies New Hampshire  at its best. I am, above all else, grateful for their hard work and  look forward to seeing what they accomplish next.                            ____________________
