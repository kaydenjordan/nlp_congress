 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding to me.   And to the colleague from New York, to all of the people you  referenced in the middle class, I say: Hell yes, they are going to be  helped by this bill.   And do you know what it is going to do? It is going to let them keep  the money in their pocket that they earned, the $1,600, for the average  resident in my district.   And what it is also going to do, Mr. Speaker, is it is going to  create jobs.   And what does a job do for a person?   I will tell you what it does. It not only puts money in their  pockets, Mr. Speaker, but we are going to have a new wave of optimism.  We are going to have a new wave of opportunity, where people will be  able to go to work, soil their hands, and earn their livelihood, which  gives them dignity, which gives them pride, and gives them honor.   This is a new day in America. And with tax reform and tax cuts  coming, I say to all of my colleagues: Join us to stand for those  hardworking Americans, give them their money, and allow us to give hope  and opportunity to all of them going forward.                                time  1300
