 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Aree Mikki  McCampbell of 13th District Strong. She was a guiding light for her  family and for all those who knew and loved her.   Mrs. McCampbell was also a loving mother to Denzel McCampbell,  Shawanna, and Kanita, and an incredible grandmother to Tyrone and  Serina.   Mr. Speaker, you can tell a lot about a parent based on their child.  I did not know Mrs. McCampbell personally, but I know the type of love  she shared with the world because of her son, Denzel McCampbell.   Mrs. McCampbell hailed from Safford, Alabama, and studied at both  Selma University and Wayne State University in Detroit. She instilled a  love of humanity in her family. And 13 District Strong is forever  grateful to her for the mark that she has left on this world.   My heart goes out to the McCampbell family. I hope knowing that she  is in Heaven watching out for all those lives she has touched can bring  some peace to those who are remembering and celebrating her life.
