 Mr. President, I offer today what should be considered a  friendly amendment to the broadband section of this infrastructure  bill.   Why is it a friendly amendment?   Because by using the Administrative Procedure Act, which my amendment  would provide, it would save billions of dollars in broadband build-out  funds. It would provide for consumer input, stakeholder input, local  and State government input into NTIA--the Agency that will be in charge  of this broadband build-out. And also because it will not delay the  broadband build-out in any way.   Now, as written today, the broadband section waives the  Administrative Procedure Act. The Wicker amendment would simply strike  that waive and make the Administrative Procedure Act apply to the  broadband section as it applies to so many big programs that are  enacted.   If we pass this amendment, here will be the timeline: Let's assume  the President doesn't get around to signing this bill until October 1.  I would expect the President would sign it earlier than that, but let's  assume that he does that. There will be 30 days of notice, 30 days of  public comment after the notice is published, a review of those  comments, which could take 30 to 40 days. At that point the regulations  are published and, after 30 days, they go into effect.   So by my calculations, assuming the President is very, very late in  signing the bill, the act and the regulations under the Administrative  Procedure Act would be done by February 7.   Now, what we all know--what everyone in this Chamber knows--is that  we have to wait on the FCC maps, and they will not be ready until the  earliest--until the earliest--by spring of next year, and that is--that  is very, very optimistic.   So we have time to do it right, to get public input, to have people  who have already experienced this come to the Agency and say: You might  want to do it this way; or: You might want to avoid doing it that way  because here is our experience.   We did this one time before, and it was only $4.7 billion. This is  $42 billion. That was the BTOP program, which was enacted in 2009.   We skipped this. We gave it to an Agency which is going to have it  this time, the NTIA--a staff of only 157 people--to monitor back then  $4.7 billion; this time it is $42 billion.   Here is what we learned about the BTOP program, which is an awful lot  like this one: When Congress asked NTIA to administer this, the results  were deeply troubling.   Let me quote the inspector general, let me quote the Stanford  Institute for Economic Policy, and the Phoenix Center. Their own  inspector general found that the Agency faced significant challenges in  managing the size and complexity of the program. It is a program a  tenth the size of what we are talking about today.   The Stanford Institute said NTIA's mechanism for selecting projects  was incoherent. NTIA, had they adopted more a reasonable framework,  many more households could have been connected with the same money, or  the same number of connections could have been realized for a fraction  of the cost, because they didn't do what I am advocating today.   The Phoenix Center, an independent think tank, said they found no  positive effect on home broadband adoption from the BTOP program.   My fellow colleagues, years from now, when someone realizes we have  wasted billions of dollars on this build-out, I would want, and I think  my colleagues would want, to say: Well, I voted yes on the Wicker  amendment to take the extra 130, 140 days to hear what went right and  what went wrong in the past and to make sure we get it right.   No Senator has worked harder than I have on broadband build-out. I  want this program to succeed. This is a way to make sure we spend the  money correctly, to make sure we do it right.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record  an article dated August 3, just yesterday, from the National Journal.   It says: ``How $65 billion for broadband infrastructure could fall  short.''   I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record at this  point   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:  [[Page S5802]]                      [From the National Journal, Aug. 3, 2021]       How $65 Billion for Broadband Infrastructure Could Fall Short                           (By Brendan Bordelon)         The $65 billion set aside for high-speed internet in the       Senate's bipartisan infrastructure deal is just a small piece       of the bill's $550 billion in new spending. But don't call       the plan unambitious.        ``It's the biggest broadband bill in the history of the       country,'' said Gigi Sohn, a fellow at the Georgetown Law       Institute for Technology Law & Policy and a former Democratic       official at the Federal Communications Commission.        ``Would I have preferred more money for deployment? Yeah,''       said Sohn. ``I would like to see $100 billion rather than $65       billion. But this is a bipartisan bill, and I think that is       super important to remember and appreciate.''        Some of those billions are earmarked for a tribal       connectivity fund, `middle-mile' broadband deployments rural       telemedicine, distance learning, and other discrete       provisions. But the heart of the Senate's broadband       infrastructure deal is a $42 billion pot of money for state       and territorial governments, which will have to convince       Washington that their plan to build out high-speed internet       to rural and underserved regions will work before receiving       federal grants.        But there's a catch. While that money will be set aside       immediately after the legislation is signed into law, the       bill stipulates that no funds can be sent to states until       after the FCC fixes its much-maligned set of national       broadband maps showing where coverage exists and where it       doesn't.        The latest FCC estimate suggests that around 14.5 million       Americans now live in regions without access to broadband.       But other estimates have come in much higher, and the       persistence of inaccurate maps means no one really knows for       sure.        Lawmakers and policy experts alike had mulled whether it       made sense to move ahead on broadband funding despite not       knowing how much money is needed or where to put it. In the       end, however, the increasing importance of high-speed-      internet access in a pandemic-stricken world--and the       unlikely chance that Congress can summon the energy and       bipartisanship needed to address the question at a later       date--pushed the Senate to act.        ``To wait would make the perfect be the enemy of the very       good,'' said John Horrigan, a senior fellow at the Benton       Institute for Broadband and Society. ``If you're going to not       act until you have the best data, it's going to take a long       time for you to act.''        The FCC will not say when it expects to finish the new,       more accurate maps. But so far the commission hasn't even       completed the necessary procurement and contracting efforts.       And most telecom experts believe the maps won't be ready for       prime time until next year at the earliest.        ``It's going to be a couple of years before really       substantial amounts of money start being dug into the ground       and strung up on telephone poles,'' said Doug Brake, the       director of broadband and spectrum policy at the Information       Technology and Innovation Foundation.        A lack of accurate maps could further slow broadband       deployment by making it hard for states to formulate their       own plans. Even once the FCC maps are completed, it will take       time for state governments to digest their findings,       determine where and how to spend federal dollars, and submit       those plans to Washington for approval.        Some states are taking matters into their own hands. In       2020, Georgia partnered with LightBox, a commercial real-      estate-data provider, to publish their own statewide       broadband map. And there's a surge of interest from other       states--Pennsylvania and Maine are already working on their       own maps, and Caroline Stoll, the head of sales and strategic       partnership at LightBox, said the company is in talks with       several more states looking to replicate Georgia's map.        ``It is a very, very good use of time and resources by the       states to develop their own map,'' said Sohn.        Beyond a lack of maps, there are other potential pitfalls       in the Senate's plan to fund broadband infrastructure. Recent       efforts by the federal government to finance high-speed-      internet projects have been conducted through reverse       auctions run by the FCC. The new plan puts individual states       in charge of their buildouts, allowing for greater       experimentation with funding structures and broadband       technologies--states can decide whether to pursue primarily       wired or wireless options, for example. But it could also       open the door to overbuilding and waste.        Scott Wallsten, the president of the Technology Policy       Institute, said the decision to put states in the driver's       seat ``is going to tremendously reduce the efficiency of the       program.''        ``The most efficient way to allocate the money--the way you       get the biggest bang for the buck--is a reverse auction,''       said Wallsten.        Gregory Rosston, the director of the public-policy program       at Stanford University and a former FCC economist, said he       expects state efforts will be spotty, with some doing a good       job of planning buildouts while others fall short. He also       worried that state broadband plans will be ``much more       subjective and subject to influence than a more centralized,       transparent system.''        And Brake has issues with the $100 million minimum that       each state is slated to receive for high-speed internet. He       said that smaller, denser states like Connecticut may not       need that much money to provide complete coverage to its       citizens.        ``To get something through the Senate, that's kind of the       price of doing business,'' said Brake. ``Everyone's got to       get something.'' Still, Brake said the Senate's       infrastructure deal is a marked improvement from recent       proposals like the BRIDGE Act, which would've ignored the       lack of broadband maps and divvied up federal funds through       imprecise metrics like raw population and the percentage of       rural or low-income citizens.        ``I think it could be potentially more efficient if this       was sort of run through a single process within the federal       government,'' Brake said. ``[But] it's improved a lot in this       new version.''     Mr. President, I don't want this program to fall short; I  want it to succeed. This amendment gives us a chance to get the money  right, to take the extra time that we are going to have to take anyway  to get the maps right. It is a good government amendment, a friendly  amendment, and I urge bipartisan adoption of it.    Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.    Madam President, I do appreciate the Senator from  Maryland joining on this. Everything he said about the committee action  today in the Commerce Committee is exactly correct. I subscribe to  every statement that he made. I couldn't improve on it. I urge a  ``yes'' vote, and I am indeed hopeful we can vitiate the rollcall vote  and save some time by voicing this one.   I yield the floor.    Hear! Hear!    Mr. President, I, too, rise in support of this amendment.  It is in response to a tragic automobile accident that affected a  number of families.   I want to thank Senator Schumer's staff for working with me, the  ranking member, and the chair of the Commerce Committee to get this  language correct. It is in good shape. I entirely agree with the junior  Senator from New York.                          Vote on Amendment No. 2570
