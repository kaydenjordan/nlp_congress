 Madam Speaker, I rise today on behalf of  Federal employees in my district and around the Nation.   For over a month now, 800,000 coastguardsmen, TSA agents, and air  traffic controllers have been held hostage by President Trump's  shutdown, a shutdown with far-reaching consequences.   Due to staffing shortages at Dallas' two major airports, shortages  that have resulted from the TSA agents being forced to live the last 34  days without pay, aviation experts have warned that flying today is  less safe than over a month ago.   Madam Speaker, since President Trump irresponsibly shut government  down, I have heard from countless TSA agents and the national air  traffic controllers in my district. They have all indicated that, while  they are committed to their duties, they are also suffering financially  and need the government reopened now.   I stand with them. Every member of our Caucus is standing together,  calling on the White House to open the government now.                            ____________________
