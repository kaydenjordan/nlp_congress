 Madam President, I come to the floor this Monday afternoon  to speak about the importance of  [[Page S1924]]  our committee, a committee that the Presiding Officer serves on, and  the importance of passing toxic exposure legislation to deliver the  right care and the right benefits to the right veterans in the most  veteran-friendly way possible--to deliver the right benefits to the  right veterans in the most veteran-friendly way possible.   Our military men and women are willing to sacrifice much for our  country. We must match that level of commitment by crafting thoughtful  and effective solutions to make certain we provide the best outcomes,  care and treatment, and benefits for those who have served our Nation.   In the past 2 years, I have heard testimony from nearly every veteran  service organization emphasizing the importance of fixing the process  the VA uses to provide healthcare and benefits to toxic-exposed  veterans and the need to grow our knowledge to help care for the toxic  wounds of war.   There have been calls for Congress to act more quickly, and I respect  those calls. Our committee hears those calls. We are in lockstep on the  challenge here and the need for a solution that is veteran centric.  There is bipartisan consensus on the Committee on Veterans' Affairs  that a phased approach--delivering healthcare now and reforming the  benefits system next, in fact, as we go now--is the most effective  pathway forward.   The Senate has already acted on the first step, and we are actively  participating and partnering with the Department of Veterans Affairs on  the second.   Senator Tester, the chair of the Senate Committee on Veterans'  Affairs, and I have been working together to craft a fair and  transparent process for toxic-exposed veterans, beginning with the  Health Care for Burn Pit Veterans Act, which unanimously passed the  Senate and was sent to the House in February. This bill remains the  quickest way to make certain that sick veterans who are suffering from  the effects of exposure to toxic substances are immediately eligible  for lifesaving healthcare.   For 6 weeks--for 6 weeks--this bill has sat in the House of  Representatives rather than being sent to the President's desk to start  making an impact on those sick and ailing veterans.   President Biden has called in March--I think it is March 12--called  for the House to pass this legislation and is committed to signing it  into law.   This legislation was cosponsored by every single member of the Senate  Committee on Veterans' Affairs, and each of my Senate colleagues showed  their support of this legislation by voting yes. This legislation was  crafted by the efforts between Senator Tester and I and members of the  Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs. The VA Secretary has stated this  bill would deliver outcomes that he cannot achieve without  congressional action.   Again, the President called for this bill to be sent to his desk, so  he can sign it, and last week, at a hearing before our committee,  Secretary McDonough reiterated both of these facts, underscoring the  need for action. However, the House has yet to take up this important  piece of legislation and, rather, sent us the PACT Act. While the PACT  Act includes the critical Health Care for Burn Pit Veterans Act,  signaling broad support--again, signaling broad support in the House  for this legislation, it also includes late additions that lack  adequate review and provisions that will stretch the VA beyond its  operational capacity, making it uncertain that veterans will be able to  quickly access the benefits.   The PACT Act needs to be amended. Secretary McDonough said as much  before our committee last week. During that testimony, I learned about  ways the PACT Act needed to be amended, and I heard about the  importance of incorporating the results of the VA's ongoing pilot  model, designed to determine how to better address the healthcare needs  and benefits of our veterans.   If Congress acts too hastily and legislates prematurely--again, it is  hard to envision a Congress ever acting too hastily. We are slow in  what we do, and I again understand the need for quick action, but if we  do legislate prematurely, we could end up with a situation similar to  what veteran caregivers are now experiencing.   In the MISSION Act, we passed legislation giving veteran caregivers  greater opportunities to care for those family members, but that  system, as we saw in a hearing just a few weeks ago, is not working for  veterans, and witness testimony before our committee is among the most  compelling that we have ever had about the faults of the way that  legislation is being implemented by the Department of Veterans Affairs.   A caregiver of a post-9/11 Army vet stated about the Comprehensive  Assistance for Family Caregivers program.         The program should have been a blessing. However, the       program has become unpredictable, stressful, and, frankly,       dehumanizing.    I invite those who did not view this hearing to find it and watch to  see a glimpse of the future we are seeking to avoid by making certain  we get this right.   The VA developed its pilot model last year to evaluate and implement  presumptions for service-connection resulting in the establishment of  12 presumptions for respiratory ailments thus far. The Secretary has  cited the collaboration among the best scientists to devise and execute  this model.   Its potential has been demonstrated, and we should continue to review  it in its entirety and allow for the process to conclude, which is to  happen very shortly. The legislation we pass should not fail to take  into account the work that is going on at the Department of Veterans  Affairs utilizing input from veterans and the science and medical  expertise of others.   The VA concluded this pilot last week, and I look forward to  examining this pilot in depth to help improve legislation while  mitigating disruptions to the VA's work in caring for all of our  veterans. Whether statutory or regulatory, reform must establish a  consistent threshold of scientific evidence, and the decision-making  process must be transparent for all who were involved in the care of  veterans.    Veterans who are sick and suffering have waited long enough, and they  should be able to access healthcare without further delay. And when the  Department completes its ongoing work, Congress can then meet the needs  of veterans with the benefits they deserve.   When our men and women suffer the consequences of military service,  it is our responsibility--it is our responsibility--to see that they  receive the healthcare and benefits they earned. It is the right thing  to do, and it is the cost of going to war. We have no option.   I highlight this for my colleagues, ask the House to proceed in  passage of the legislation we sent them with unanimous consent, and I  look forward to an expeditious resolution of the process the Department  of Veterans Affairs is going through to make sure we know all the facts  so that the legislation is right and we avoid pitfalls we have seen in  other circumstances.   And with that, I yield the floor.
