 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, we talked a lot in recent weeks about  the importance of a transatlantic political and military alliance  between our country and many other nations. In celebrating NATO's 70th  anniversary in Washington a few months ago and the 75th anniversary of  D-day in Europe, there has been a common theme, and that common theme  has been security cooperation. The common theme has been a need to  strengthen our response to threats that continue to arise around the  globe.   I believe energy security is a critical part of our shared defense.  That is why I just introduced legislation to help our NATO allies  escape Russian bullying by improving European energy security. My bill  imposes sanctions on Russia's Nord Stream 2 pipeline. It also speeds up  U.S. natural gas exports to our NATO allies.   For years I have raised concerns about Russia's energy export  pipeline project. Nord Stream 2 would carry added Russian natural gas  supplies to Germany via the Baltic Sea. It would do it along the  existing Nord Stream 1 route. This pipeline will fuel Russian  aggression as well as regional instability. For our sake and the sake  of our allies, we must stop it.   Nord Stream 2 makes Europe and our NATO allies more dependent on  Russia and so more prone to Russian influence. It also means a massive  money transfer from our allies straight into the Kremlin's pockets.  That is new money that Russia can use to fund their military.   As we know, Russian President Vladimir Putin is no friend. He is a  dangerous foe, and he has plans to divide Europe and destroy NATO.  Putin uses Russia's military and economy as tools of intimidation. One  of Russia's biggest economic levers, of course, is its gas monopoly in  Europe. In fact, Putin has a history of using his Russian energy  resources as a geopolitical weapon.   Russia literally threatens to turn off the gas if its demands are not  met. Putin did cut off natural gas supplies to Ukraine in 2006, again  in 2009, and most recently in 2014. Of course, 2014 was the year that  Russia invaded Ukraine and Crimea. Currently, most Russian gas exports  to Europe must cross Ukraine, but by using Nord Stream 2 to bypass this  route, Russia can freely undermine Ukraine's economy.   Putin threatens not just Ukraine but also our NATO ally Poland. Just  last week Poland's President was here in Washington meeting with  President Trump to discuss security issues. Unlike Germany, Poland is  working to free itself from Russian energy reliance. Poland has signed  a deal to buy an additional $8 billion of abundant reliable American  natural gas, and this is on top of the $25 billion already under  contract.   At the meeting last week, President Trump said he is considering Nord  Stream 2 sanctions. He also warned Germany to end its dependence on  Moscow. President Trump rightly noted: ``We're protecting Germany from  Russia and Russia is getting billions and billions of dollars from  Germany.''   The President is right. He went on to add: ``Reliance on a single  foreign supplier of energy leaves nations totally vulnerable to  coercion and extortion.''   The Economist magazine calls Nord Stream 2 ``a Russian trap''--one  that Germany has fallen into. I agree with the President and I agree  with the Economist. Nord Stream 2 will completely undermine the  European Union's efforts to diversify energy sources, suppliers, and  routes.   Already, Russia supplies nearly 40 percent of European Union gas  imports, and European demand for natural gas is expected to continue to  grow rapidly. Many of our NATO allies, especially Germany, are becoming  addicted to Russian gas. It is time for American intervention.  [[Page S3813]]    The bill I just introduced will help our allies to escape Putin's  trap. The bill is actually called the ESCAPE Act. It stands for the  Energy Security Cooperation with Allied Partners in Europe Act. It  mandates sanctions on Nord Stream 2, as well as other Russian pipeline  projects. At the same time, it speeds up U.S. gas exports to NATO  allies. The bill also creates a transatlantic energy security strategy,  and it directs our NATO representative to help our allies and our  partners improve their own energy security.   The ESCAPE Act builds on previous action in Congress. The Countering  America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act, which Congress passed in  2017, authorizes but does not require sanctions on Russian energy  pipelines.   In March of 2018, I led a bipartisan group of 39 Senators in sending  a letter to key administration officials opposing Nord Stream 2.  President Trump has made clear time after time that he believes  Europe's reliance on Russian gas undermines regional security. The  United States, especially Wyoming, has been blessed with abundant  natural gas resources and supplies. We have more than enough gas to  meet America's needs, as well as exporting gas to other countries. So  why shouldn't we use some of these energy resources to help our friends  in Europe, as well as our own energy workers here at home.   Last summer I published an op-ed in the Washington Post saying:         We made clear that we want to roll back Russia's energy       invasion of Europe. Now Congress should take the next step       and mandate sanctions.    Freeing Europe from Russian energy dependence will strengthen both  our allies and our NATO alliance. It is time to shut off Putin's  pipeline valve and open Europe's escape valve. It is time to pass the  ESCAPE Act.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.    I ask for the yeas and nays.
