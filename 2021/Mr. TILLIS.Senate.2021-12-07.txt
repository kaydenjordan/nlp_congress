 Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Betty Emerson,  who is retiring as the congressional liaison for North Carolina's  Disability Determination Services. Ms. Emerson has served the North  Carolina Department of Health and Human Services for over 32 years, and  her service to North Carolina is greatly appreciated.   Ms. Emerson began her career at the North Carolina Department of  Health and Human Services as a unit office assistant. She then served  as a backup to the medical and congressional liaison, and finally, as  the congressional liaison for the North Carolina Disability  Determination Services. She has consistently gone above and beyond the  call of duty to assist North Carolina's citizens.   During her 12 years as congressional liaison, Ms. Emerson developed  incredibly strong relationships across the State. Her career  exemplified the highest standard of excellence, and I am incredibly  grateful for the exceptional service she consistently provided to the  staff in my North Carolina offices on behalf of our citizens.   I wish Ms. Emerson all the best for happiness and good health in the  years ahead.                            ____________________
