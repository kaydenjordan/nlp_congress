 Madam Speaker, in 1994, then-Senator Joe Biden said:  ``Those of us who are opposed to abortion should not be compelled to  pay for them.''   Well, Mr. President, I certainly agree.   For more than four decades, the Hyde amendment has ensured the  American people are not forced to fund abortion on-demand, a procedure  at great odds with so many of our personal and religious beliefs, and  an injustice that leaves an irreversible mark on so many lives.   Since 1976, the Hyde amendment has had bipartisan support from  Congress, has been signed into law by both Republican and Democrat  Presidents, and has been supported by the majority of the American  people.                                time  1300    It has saved the lives of millions. But President Biden and the  Democrats want to end those protections, forcing the American people to  fund a procedure that is at such serious odds with our personal,  religious, and moral beliefs.   There is no more vulnerable person than a child in the womb. Do they  not deserve our care and our protection? Does that life not also have  value, just like the lives of you and me, Mr. Speaker?   Mr. Speaker, I will say it again: We are treading in dangerous  territory. Instead of working toward a government that builds all  people up for the common good, we are choosing to subsidize the deaths  of unborn babies.   I believe that is appalling, and I urge my colleagues to reconsider  their positions. We must pass H.R. 18 and respect the wishes of the  American people: Tax dollars should not be used to fund abortions.   Mr. Speaker, I urge ``no'' on the previous question.
