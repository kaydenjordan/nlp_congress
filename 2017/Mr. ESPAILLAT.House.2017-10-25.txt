 Mr. Speaker, imagine waking up with no lights, imagine  waking up with no running water, you cannot bathe yourself, you cannot  feed your children, you get so desperate that you break into chemically  contaminated water, into untreated sewage water, you are on dialysis,  Mr. Speaker, and there is still no electricity, or you are running out  of medication and supplies in hospitals that are very low.   What I am describing to you, Mr. Speaker, is not a dream. It is a  living nightmare, and it has been a living nightmare in Puerto Rico for  over a month. For over 4 weeks, while we now begin to focus and speak  about tax reform and how this Congress attempts to assist the 1  percent--the wealthiest, the well-heeled--with a handsome tax break,  with the elimination of the estate tax, when we attempt to shelve, to  forget, to turn our head on this nightmare unfolded in Puerto Rico, it  continues to be a living nightmare.   That doesn't stop there, Mr. Speaker. Puerto Rico could lose funding  also for thousands of low-income housing units if power to the island  isn't restored soon. The Department of Housing and Urban Development,  which subsidizes 203 housing projects on the island, is prohibited by  law from providing Section 8 assistance to buildings that are not  decent, safe, and sanitary.   Every day that Puerto Rico goes without resources, potable water,  medication, and electricity, the situation becomes more dangerous and  the death tolls continue to go up. This has now become, Mr. Speaker,  our Caribbean Katrina.   The official death toll reported by the government increased today to  49 deaths, but many folks fear that it is much higher than that, after  confirming a death due to leptospirosis. According to the CDC,  leptospirosis is a bacterial disease that affects humans and animals.  Without treatment, this disease can lead to kidney damage, meningitis,  liver failure, respiratory distress, and even death. To date, the  island has reported 76 possible cases of the disease. Investigative  reporting from various sources have tallied up deaths to potentially  north of 450 people. As of Friday, October 6, at least 14 people have  committed suicide in Puerto Rico. They are traumatized and in distress.  This is our Caribbean Katrina. A list of 113 people remain missing  after Maria's passage.   I was just in Puerto Rico for the second time this past week with  Congressman Luis Gutierrez. The Congressman and I helped distribute  supplies and necessities to Comerio, a small town in a remote part of  Puerto Rico.   Puerto Rico continues to need help. It needs to be woken up from this  living nightmare. S.O.S. S.O.S. Get resources to them now. It is our  Caribbean Katrina. Let's own it. Let's resolve it.  [[Page H8150]]                                ____________________     Mr. Speaker, yesterday I was joined by many of our  colleagues to echo the pleas of over 100 women who came dressed as  brides here to D.C. to put a face on the brutal murder of Gladys  Ricart, a victim of domestic violence who was killed in 1999. Yesterday  I said that I was Gladys Ricart and that we were all Gladys Ricart.   While this was happening, Mr. Speaker, I am distressed to inform you  that a woman in my district in Inwood was fatally stabbed to death and  beaten with a dumbbell by her long-time boyfriend. Police officers  found Claudina Cruz dead, with multiple stab wounds to the torso and  head trauma.   She is also Gladys Ricart. We are all Gladys Ricart.   I ask my colleagues to join me in denouncing domestic violence for  Gladys, Claudina, and every victim of domestic violence across the  country. Congress must reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act when  it comes before us next year.                            ____________________
