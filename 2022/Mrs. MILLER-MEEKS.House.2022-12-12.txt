 Madam Speaker, I rise today to applaud Brennik  Sapp of Liberty Elementary School for his commitment to helping his  community.   When Brennik was an infant, he spent 12 days at the University of  Iowa Stead Family Children's Hospital in Iowa City when he was  diagnosed at birth with Hirschsprung's disease. This is an intestinal  disease that is present at birth and that can lead to death.   Thanks to the excellent doctors at the hospital, Brennik's life was  saved, but he will always have to manage life with the disease.   Brennik did not let this disease deter him. Rather, he made it his  mission to help other children who have chronic illnesses.   Last year alone, Brennik raised over $2,000 for the University of  Iowa Stead Family Children's Hospital in Iowa City. This money was used  to buy books for children who are undergoing hospitalization and  treatment.   Brennik's selflessness did not go unnoticed by his community. The  American Legion recently awarded Brennik with the Good Deed Award,  which is gifted to youth who serve as an inspiration for their  community.   I thank Brennik for everything that he is doing for children across  Iowa. I am proud to represent youth who are making a difference in  their community.                            ____________________
