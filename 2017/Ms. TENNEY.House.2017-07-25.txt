 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.J. Res. 111.   Mr. Speaker, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau finalized a  rule forbidding financial service firms from including a mandatory  arbitration clause in contracts with consumers. The rule is not only  bad for consumers, it highlights the need for accountability in  Washington.   Unelected bureaucrats wield too much power with too little oversight,  and this rule would force consumer class actions and eliminate  arbitration options. As an attorney, I know that many class action  lawsuits are all too often more about cash for plaintiffs' trial  lawyers than protection for consumers. In fact, the CFPB's own study  even admitted that arbitration is faster, less expensive, and pays out  consumers much higher compared to the class action lawsuit.   Of course, many trial lawyers oppose arbitration because it denies  them of exorbitant class action lawsuit fees. It is an inexpensive  alternative to courtroom litigation.   If consumers are lucky enough to be part of the successful class  action, the average individual payment is, as my colleague just pointed  out, only about $32. Remarkably, the trial lawyers raked in $425  million in class action fees between 2010 and 2013, according to a  study by Forbes.   Of the arbitrations reviewed by the CFPB in which consumers were  victorious, the average individual payout was $5,389. Why would the  Consumer Financial Protection Bureau want to take a fair and elective  alternative for resolving disputes away from consumers when they  benefit from them?   The consumers have the option to do as they please, but I believe the  CFPB's antiarbitration rule would do nothing but harm consumers, line  the pocket of trial lawyers, and literally take money out of the hands  of consumers.
