 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         Page 889, line 6, after the dollar amount, insert the       following: ``(reduced by $12,000,000)''.        Page 1140, line 23, after the dollar amount, insert the       following: ``(increased by $12,000,000)''.    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 500, the gentleman  from Wisconsin (Mr. Grothman) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Wisconsin.    Mr. Chair, yesterday, we voted $8 billion for the  tragedies in the Gulf Coast. I wake up this morning and I find out we  are supposed to vote for another $8 billion, which is fine. But I  think, as a result, we should also look extra hard to find ways to see  if, in the bill as it passed out of the Appropriations Committee, maybe  we can spend a little less somewhere.   I have a very modest suggestion for cutting a little bit of spending  here. I would like a 1 percent reduction in the Economic Support Fund.  This was in the Trump budget, combined with another fund, and subject  to a 40 percent cut, I think because President Trump wanted to make  good on his promise to put America first.   I realize political reality is such that we will not get the 40  percent cut that President Trump wanted, but I ask for a small,  approximately 1 percent, cut of $12 million.   Part of the money of the Economic Support Fund goes for universities  abroad. Sometimes these universities have, like our own universities, a  little bit of an anti-American, perhaps anti-Israeli bent; and for that  reason, I think there is no question but that we should eagerly look  forward to the chance to cut the spending in the Economic Support Fund  by 1 percent, particularly in light of the fact that we have now a $20  trillion debt and, particularly, because later today, I bet, after  spending $8 billion yesterday, we are going to go for another $8  billion today.   Mr. Chair, I would like to ask for support for this amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1645     Mr. Chair, we love the chairman. We just feel that we  are kind of broke here, and a 1 percent cut on something going for  programs abroad would not be out of line.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.   The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further  proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Wisconsin  will be postponed.                   Amendment No. 101 Offered by Mr. Paulsen    The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 101  printed in part B of House Report 115-295.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         At the end of division A (before the short title), insert       the following:        Sec. __.  None of the funds made available by this Act may       be used to implement, administer, or enforce the rule       entitled ``National Ambient Air Quality Standards for Ozone''       published by the Environmental Protection Agency in the       Federal Register on October 26, 2015 (80 Fed. Reg. 65292).    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 504, the gentleman  from Wisconsin (Mr. Grothman) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Wisconsin.    Mr. Chair, I rise in support of my amendment to H.R.  3354. The purpose of my amendment is to prohibit use of funds made  available by this act to implement, administer, and enforce the EPA's  National Ambient Air Quality Standards for Ozone rule, which was  originally published on October 26, 2015.   This rule will make the standards more stringent in other places, in  the State of Wisconsin, up and down Lake Michigan, including counties  such as Sheboygan County. As you make these standards more stringent-- first of all, it makes no sense because they don't take in the fact  that there are areas like mine in which the ozone is coming from  outside my district.   For example, Sheboygan County, whatever they do, I don't think they  could ever meet those standards because there is so much ozone coming  up from the Chicago area. But there is an effect to these standards as  well.   The standards make it more difficult for industry along Lake Michigan  to operate, to comply with the standards, putting us at a competitive  disadvantage not only with other parts around the country, but a  competitive disadvantage compared to other areas around the world with  much more pollution than we have. Right now our ozone is much less than  it was when I was a child. Quite frankly, when I was a child, nobody  complained anyway.   Another thing about these ozone standards, it is something that  people who are looking out for that not particularly wealthy people  should pay attention to. When you aren't meeting the standards, it  creates a situation in which your owners of automobiles have to have  their cars tested every year. And sometimes these cars have to go  through very expensive repairs to meet the standards.   Now, there are people who are going to think that is no big deal  because they are maybe wealthy Congressmen and they need to buy a car  every 3 or 4 years and they don't have a problem. But if you are  somebody who has a 10- or 15-year-old car, maybe you can only afford to  spend $500, $1,000 on a car, and then once a year you have to get the  car tested. You flunk the test and you have to put $1,000 or $1,500  into it. No wonder we have some people in this country who can't get  ahead as long as the environmental extremists are running the EPA.   So, in any event, I think it would be good if we don't spend any more  money implementing this new rule. Give the EPA more time to reconsider  this rule and come up with something a little bit more reasonable.  [[Page H7178]]    Mr. Chairman, I encourage my colleagues to support this amendment,  and I yield back the balance of my time.
