 Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of this commonsense hydropower  streamlining process for modernizing the way we permit in order to  bolster the process for over 400 existing hydropower projects in the  United States. It is very important in my area as well.   Hydropower delivers clean, reliable, and renewable power 24 hours a  day, unlike other renewable power sources which fluctuate with time of  day, weather, sun or wind, or lack thereof.   California has a long history of hydropower generation. In 2014,  California, alone, produced 14,000 megawatts of electricity from  hydropower facilities--again, clean, renewable, and reliable. You turn  on the switch, hydroelectric power.   My district in northern California is home to two of the largest  facilities in the country: Oroville Dam and Shasta Dam. Each of these  facilities delivers cost-efficient power, provides flood control, and  generates significant local economic activity for the community via  stored water and recreation.   With local input, which is very important, we need to address the  streamlining of this process and expanding renewable hydropower  production in this country to pave the way for new jobs and affordable  power to consumers everywhere.   Relicensing permits ought not be a wish list for every special  interest, but, indeed, on measures of the power that can be generated.   Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the time, and I wholeheartedly support and  urge this House to support H.R. 3043.    Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight to recognize and thank our  veterans. We will all be doing that this coming Saturday on Veterans  Day. They sacrificed so much and we are so glad to have them here to be  able to celebrate and thank them.   I recommend that everybody please take part in the events that you  have in your community. Go to the parades, go to the barbecues, and  take a minute to thank a veteran.   Things we can do around here as legislators are like we did this week  with several pieces of legislation, helping veterans with VA so that  they would have more access for telemedicine, which makes technology  more available and provides better doctors for diagnosing veterans and  giving them what they need.  [[Page H8646]]    The VICTOR Act considers the travel veterans have to take to go for  transplants. Wouldn't it be better for them to be closer to home  instead of traveling long distances so they and their families can get  the care they need and have the access they need locally?   Lastly, I will mention the Veterans Crisis Line Study Act. When a  veteran is in crisis, when a veteran is contemplating suicide, as  happens so much these days--20, 22 veterans per day giving up--we need  to have the Veterans Crisis Line Study Act in place to better modify  the crisis line to be effective for them; so that there is someone  there so they can have immediate help to get through that time.   These are some of the things we can do for veterans as we wish them a  happy Veterans Day and thank them for their service. God bless them.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague from Pennsylvania,  Mr. Thompson, for yielding. I appreciate his efforts tonight in  pointing out the nuances of the SNAP program and what it means in a  disaster situation, such as what we have had all over the country in  hurricanes, and even in my own backyard with the wildfires that we have  been hearing about in the West in general, in my own district, where  several have affected us very negatively, and adjacent areas of  northern California and the wine country, indeed in southern California  as well.   So the flexibility that has been needed, as we found in the SNAP  programs through what is known as D-SNAP, which is Disaster and  Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, has been very helpful to  many in northern California and even southern California counties as  well.   So when the California Department of Social Services requested the D- SNAP to be put in place, the Food and Nutrition Service did, indeed,  grant that in several instances, including October, and more so in  northern California, but in other instances as well in this case,  indeed, as Mr. Thompson so well explained earlier in tonight's Special  Order.   Due to power outages from the fires knocking out power, we have food  loss and spoilage due to those power outages, as well as other  instances, and even the ability for people to buy food. Maybe their  home is okay, but they wouldn't have the markets available to them in  their community to buy food that they need locally. So the D-SNAP  program has given the flexibility and the ability to source it and have  it available after these families have suffered losses, including the  waiver for some folks who don't have the ability to produce and prepare  hot food, where, in that case, families can have fairly normal meals in  a time of crisis that is, indeed, a comfort for them and a positive  that the flexibility of the program has made available for them.   So, indeed, destroyed homes due to fire, the power outages that have  extended to so many areas and for so long have, indeed, caused these  crises for families here. The flexibility of this program, as Mr.  Thompson has pointed out here tonight, has been very helpful in that  time of disaster and relief that is needed, and the compassion that  comes from people helping each other in these times and these instances  where we have had so much volunteerism, people stepping forward to help  others in times of crisis, but you need that little extra push  sometimes that this program can be helpful for.   So I appreciate the FNS stepping forward and approving what the  California Department of Social Services has looked at as, indeed,  worthy disaster relief that has been needed in these areas.                                time  1900    It wouldn't just apply to wildfires as well, where we have had so  much hitting California this year, northern California especially. We  had the issue of a possible flood and the crisis at Oroville Dam, when  the spillway broke and 188,000 people had to be evacuated due to great  concerns about additional failure of the dam.   So the ability to have this available, should the timing be right,  and the qualifications for it being deemed that type of disaster,  indeed is a comfort for a community when basic needs like putting food  on the table during crisis after a disaster come into play; whether it  is fire, as was declared here, or it could be possible flood and  evacuations, things of that nature, that make this a good part of an  integral part of keeping a community fed and together.   So I appreciate Mr. Thompson allowing me to speak here tonight and to  be able to point out how this has worked in northern California during  just this last month in these horrendous wildfire situations we have  seen in so many counties. I thank the gentleman for leading this  tonight and for his attention to this.
