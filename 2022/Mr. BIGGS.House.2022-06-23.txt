 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Madam Speaker, today we have heard impassioned arguments from House  Democrats about the need to gather better data on the American  population. In fact, the majority leader just said: Obviously, we take  information to better provide services to Americans. That is what he  said.   As required by the Constitution, the decennial Census is carried out  every 10 years to conduct an actual enumeration ``in such manner as  Congress shall by law direct.''   It is well past time--it is well past time that Congress, again,  directs the Census Bureau to collect data on the citizenship of  respondents.   I realize that many of my colleagues do not believe that there is a  crisis on our southern border. But just last month, CBP had 239,416  encounters along the southern border. And what that means is every  encounter is either a surrender or an arrest of somebody who is  illegally in the country.   Of those, 25 percent involved an individual who had at least one  prior encounter in the previous 12 months. This does not include the  number of known and unknown getaways which, last year, are estimated to  have been a million individuals we don't know anything about.   So whether someone is a U.S. citizen is an important data point that  should be recorded in the Census and on other Federal data surveys. If  we are going to get information, as the majority leader said, this  should be in that panoply of information.   As we have heard today from my colleague across the aisle, data from  these Federal surveys inform policy decisions. For instance, decennial  Census data informs Federal funding and enforcement of the Voting  Rights Act.                                time  1515    I believe we should know whether the Federal Government is serving  its citizens well, but how can we do that when we do not know how many  citizens there are, how many actual citizens there are, or where they  live?   Today, I will offer a straightforward solution to this problem as a  motion to recommit. If we adopt the motion to recommit, we will  instruct the Committee on Oversight and Reform to consider an amendment  to require the Federal surveys covered by the bill--including the U.S.  Census--to also ask respondents whether they are U.S. citizens.   In contrast to asking intrusive questions about sexual orientation  that serve no legitimate purpose, the Federal Government should have a  better understanding of the U.S. citizens residing in America and those  who are not citizens.   This information will better inform lawmakers and ensure the  government is working to better the lives of Americans, which is what I  have heard is the stated goal of the Democrats.  [[Page H5860]]    It is time that the U.S. Government--and U.S. Congress, especially-- works to protect the prosperity of the American people. Such serious  work starts with strong borders and a sound immigration policy that is  actually enforced.   Contrary to what the chairwoman stated in the Rules Committee, the  Supreme Court has not decided it is unlawful to inquire about  citizenship on the Census.   The Supreme Court--let me reiterate that--has not said you cannot  inquire about citizenship. That is false. It has been done  historically.   In the prior case before the Supreme Court, the process leading up to  putting the question on the Census was flawed. Upon that basis, the  question was decided.   But the decision states, ``The Enumeration Clause permits Congress,  and by extension, the Secretary, to inquire about citizenship on the  Census questionnaire.''   That is what we are doing. We are following the Constitution as has  been recognized by the Supreme Court. It is critical to ensuring an  accurate apportionment of Representatives in the House based on the  Census--in this House--unlike the information this bill seeks to  collect. Similar to your underlying bill, this information will be  voluntarily gathered.   Today, the American people will finally get to see their  Representatives take a vote on this important matter.   Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of the  amendment in the Record immediately prior to the vote on the motion to  recommit.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Madam Speaker, I just want to cover and address some of the  statements made by the chairwoman regarding my previous statement.   She admitted in her statement that several surveys already gather the  info that they seek in the underlying bill. Yet, that was a rationale  for not asking the citizenship question.   What is good for the goose is good for the gander. You are already  collecting some of this information, as you admitted, from 5 different  agencies, and you want to expand it to 130. You said, well, you guys  get it from the Department of Labor statistics on the question of  citizenship. Hey, let's get it all across the board. Let's do it all  across the board. Same rationale.   The chairwoman said the LGBTQ question will be voluntary, but the  citizenship question is not. That is simply untrue. If you look at the  amendment, that would be there.   We discussed this in the committee. All you are doing is you are  adding, in some cases, just the word ``citizenship'' to the questions  that you are already asking, or you are asking whether or not the  respondent is a citizen of the United States.   That is voluntary. It is not mandatory. That is just untrue to say  that.   Then the argument was made that the Supreme Court used a rationale  that was inaccurate. The Supreme Court rationale for not allowing the  Trump administration, through an executive agency, to ask the  citizenship question on the Census was this: It was because the process  was not initiated by Congress.   The Supreme Court specifically stated, ``The Enumeration Clause  permits Congress, and by extension, the Secretary, to inquire about  citizenship on the Census questionnaire.''   It had not been done by Congress. It had been done by a lower-level  agency. So all of those things should now dispel the arguments against  including this amendment. That is why I am going to encourage everyone  in this body to support the motion to recommit.     Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to recommit at the desk.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
