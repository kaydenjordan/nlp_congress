 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 298, I call up  the joint resolution (H.J. Res. 42) disapproving the action of the  District of Columbia Council in approving the Comprehensive Policing  and Justice Reform Amendment Act of 2022, and ask for its immediate  consideration.   The Clerk read the title of the joint resolution.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the measure under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.J. Res. 42, a joint resolution  disapproving of the District of Columbia Council's Comprehensive  Policing and Justice Reform Amendment Act of 2022.   The men and women of the Metropolitan Police Department serve their  community every day to help keep the District safe and secure. In doing  so, they routinely place themselves in dangerous situations to protect  others. Yet, progressive policies from the D.C. Council continue to  hamstring District officers and needlessly place them in unsafe  situations.   The D.C. Council's Comprehensive Policing and Justice Reform  Amendment Act of 2022 does just that. For example, it requires  burdensome and time-consuming approval hurdles before officers may put  on riot gear for their own protection. It creates new mechanisms for  activists to harass officers and their families by obtaining personal  information on the officers. It also creates additional liabilities for  officers that are not found in other police departments.   These are just a few of the many impractical and outrageous proposals  of the legislation.   The D.C. Metropolitan Police Department has seen over 1,190 police  officers leave the force since the beginning of 2020. That is about  one-third of the police department. Nearly 40 percent of those officers  resigned. That means they chose to leave the department instead of  dealing with the increasingly impossible burdens placed on them by the  council.   Since then, crime has been soaring in the District. Compared to this  time last year, homicides are up 25 percent, motor vehicle theft is up  106 percent, and all crime is up 25 percent.   These troubling statistics cannot be allowed to continue. The council  has continued to overlook its law enforcement officers in favor of  progressive, soft-on-crime policies that only benefit criminals. The  almost 700,000 residents of D.C. and approximately 20 million annual  visitors to our Nation's Capital deserve to feel safe.   Ensuring a vibrant and safe National Capital for all Americans to  visit is a key ingredient of the District's future financial health and  a necessity for the Federal Government workforce, and our police  deserve to have the resources to ensure the safety of all.   The D.C. Council's Comprehensive Policing and Justice Reform  Amendment Act does neither of those things. If the D.C. Council wants  to continue down this path, they will have to answer to this Congress.   We are not alone. The D.C. Police Union, representing 3,500 members,  and the U.S. Capitol Police Labor Committee have both endorsed this  resolution of disapproval. D.C.'s reckless reforms have also caught  nationwide attention, with the National Fraternal Order of Police and  the National Association of Police Organizations both asking Congress  to block the D.C. reform package. Additionally, the California  Coalition of Law Enforcement Associations, the Fullerton Police  Officers' Association, and the Las Vegas Police Protective Association  are all strongly in favor of H.J. Res. 42.   We see such broad national support for this disapproval resolution  because other jurisdictions know just how awful the D.C. Council's  anti-policing so-called reforms would be as a precedent for America's  cities.   Additionally, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser declined to sign this  legislation into law. That should be a signal of how extreme it is. The  D.C. Council did not listen and proceeded to pass it anyway.   We also have a recent precedent to consider. Recently, 31 House  Democrats and 31 Senate Democrats joined President Biden and House  Republicans to block the D.C. Council's Revised Criminal Code Act of  2022 from becoming law. Congress successfully blocked the District's  attempt to lessen penalties on dangerous criminals, and now we must act  again to address the D.C. Council's reckless attempt to weaken local  law enforcement.   The dangerous policing reforms addressed by H.J. Res. 42 are even  worse for the current crime epidemic in D.C. We must ensure that these  pro-crime, anti-police policies are not allowed in our Nation's Capital  City, which Congress has a special interest in overseeing.   If the D.C. Council wishes to engage Congress to seek reforms  addressing specific problems in local law enforcement, then the  Oversight Committee stands ready to have those conversations with D.C.  leaders and my colleagues in the House.   This police reform package, which D.C. has presented to Congress for  approval, does far more harm than good and must be rejected. To be  clear, this is precisely the role of Congress when it comes to matters  of the District's governance. Under the U.S. Constitution, Congress is  granted ``exclusive legislation in all cases whatsoever'' over the  District.   The Home Rule Act does establish a degree of local governance, but  under the Home Rule Act, Congress maintains a role to scrutinize and  approve of District legislation. Just because Congress has not been  fulfilling this role in recent decades is not a reason to avoid this  responsibility now, especially when we know the Nation's Capital City  is plunging into a crime crisis. Now is the time for Congress to lean  in and provide the oversight the District so badly needs.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support my colleague Mr.  Andrew  Clyde's resolution of disapproval, and I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 6 minutes to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Clyde), the sponsor of the resolution.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  [[Page H1856]]         Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, the D.C. Council's Comprehensive Policing and Justice  Reform Amendment Act is irresponsible.   It prioritizes the leftist defund the police movement over public  safety and law enforcement of our Nation's Capital.   It is playing with the livelihoods of all who live in or visit D.C.  by rolling back policing in the District. This will only embolden  criminals and demoralize D.C. police officers who put their lives on  the line every day.   The U.S. House must swiftly exercise its constitutional  responsibility to oversee the District of Columbia and reject this  misguided legislation from going into effect.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to unite  in support of a safe National Capital City and support this necessary  resolution of disapproval.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
