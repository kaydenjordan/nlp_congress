 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a milestone in the  life of one of Russellville, Arkansas' most admired citizens, Robyn  Richardson.   He is a beloved fixture in the community and one of the River  Valley's biggest sports fans. I first got to know Richardson when  playing football for my alma mater, Russellville High School, and,  later, Arkansas Tech University. Robyn never missed a game.   I will always remember him in the end zone of football games, ready  to catch field goals and extra points, then promptly returning the  football to the game officials. He was as much a part of the game as  the players on the field.   But, Mr. Speaker, the milestone I speak of is the fact that he is now  the longest-serving employee of Pope County, Arkansas, celebrating his  50th anniversary of employment.   I had the pleasure of joining the city and county last week in a  tribute to Robyn's service. Not surprisingly, he told me he feels great  and has no intention of retiring anytime soon.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud of Robyn Richardson, and I want the Nation to  hear of his amazing record of service.   Congratulations to my friend.                            ____________________
