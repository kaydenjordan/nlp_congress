 Madam Speaker, today, on the birthday of  Martin Luther King, I rise to recognize a Buffalo, New York, resident  born the same year as Dr. King, who continues to serve as a local  church, community, and business leader, my good friend, Clifford Bell.   Brother Bell, as he is known in western New York for the love he  brings to all of those around him, has served as a senior business  advisor to Buffalo State's Small Business Development Center.   He was a colleague of mine in the city of Buffalo Common Council and  he has led the Martin Luther King, Jr., celebration in Buffalo for  three decades. As a council member Brother Bell was known for the line:  ``For whom the bell tolls. This Bell tolls for you,'' a quote that  historically references the interconnectedness of humanity and his  commitment to service.   Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., in his ``Where Do We Go From Here?''  address said: ``Hate is too great a burden to bear. I have decided to  love.''   Brother Bell has lived a life of love, representing the best of our  community and our country. We, as a Nation, can learn from his example.                            ____________________
