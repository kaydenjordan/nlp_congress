 Madam Speaker, my heart aches for our great Republic  today. I implore my Democratic colleagues in this House: We are not  Republicans or Democrats. We are Americans.   This is not the right place. This is not the right procedure. Settle  our political differences politically.   We owe the American people a great duty to come together. Don't give  the Senate the victory lap. Give the House the victory lap. Vote ``no''  to impeach. We owe it to the American people.   They want so dearly for us to come together for our great Republic  and thank our great President.
