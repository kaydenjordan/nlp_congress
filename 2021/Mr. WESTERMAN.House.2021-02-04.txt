 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Washington  and commend him for the great work that he has done with the Western  Caucus and also here in Congress to be a voice for rural America and  for these areas, like my district, that depend on Natural Resources.   Madam Speaker, our country is at a crossroads on the environment. One  road leads to a vibrant, all-of-the-above energy approach, where we  combine our state-of-the-art technology with hardworking American  ingenuity and work ethic to incentivize smart environmental solutions.   The other road leads to a top-down regulatory approach in which those  in power ban, tax, and prohibit energy access resulting in economic  ruin and environmental degradation. It is clear which path President  Biden has chosen.   With a stroke of a pen, he eliminated thousands of American jobs, put  many more into jeopardy, defunded bipartisan conservation programs, and  eliminated some of the safest, most reliable forms of energy production  and transportation we have.   Let's not confuse action with progress. The data is very clear.  America leads the world in environmental standards. If our goal is  actually a cleaner, safer, and healthier environment--and I hope it  is--then we should continue modeling these standards for the rest of  the world to follow, while developing the technology of the future.   However, through his sweeping bans that killed the Keystone pipeline  and shut down new energy leases on Federal lands and water, President  Biden is merely shifting our current demand for energy overseas.   Let me make that very clear: Much as my Democrat colleagues might  pretend otherwise, America's demand for oil and natural gas will not go  away overnight. It cannot. Our infrastructure depends on it. So by  shutting down one of our main domestic supplies, our supply will shift  overseas, where we have no control over their environmental standards.   Put simply, President Biden's orders will hurt our environment in the  long run and devastate our economy in the meantime.   So what is our alternative?   How about allowing the free market to work, like it always has. We  have an innovative, pragmatic plan in place, unlike the Democrats'  haphazard, shooting-from-the-hip approach. It is why I have submitted  pro-growth solutions like the Trillion Trees Act.   Madam Speaker, we don't need to make hollow political points with no  substance and no hope for success. We need an energy plan that looks to  the future while taking care of the needs of today.                                time  2030    Democrats want to make us choose between a healthy environment and a  strong economy. I am here to tell you we can have both. Actually, if we  want a cleaner, safer, healthier environment, then we must have a  strong economy. They go hand-in-hand.   I hope President Biden reverses this ban and puts our environment and  America's economy first.
