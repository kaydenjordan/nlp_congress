 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, it is Thursday. As you know, I like to  come to the floor, and a lot of the time, my colleague from Louisiana  is actually in the Chair, so he gets to hear a lot about the great  State of Alaska. I like to come to the floor to talk about someone in  my State who has done an amazing job either for their community or the  State or even the country. We call this person our Alaskan of the Week.  I know, for the pages, it is their favorite time in the Senate because  they get to learn all about what is going on in Alaska. A lot of people  watching or watching on TV have found a lot of interest in this  because, like every Senator here, I certainly think I come from the  best State in the country. It is beautiful right now. I really want to  invite everybody who is in the Gallery or watching on TV to come up to  Alaska and visit. It will be the trip of a lifetime. I promise.    Yet what makes my State truly great is the people, not just the  majestic mountains and the beauty and the wildlife but the people-- strong, kind, caring people who band together--let's face it--in a  State with some extreme environment. Oftentimes, they band together in  creative ways.   I would like to introduce today our Alaskans of the Week--Holly  Christensen, from Palmer, AK, and Bree Hitchcock, who lives in  Anchorage, AK. Both of these incredible women have spent countless  hours helping thousands of children in Alaska and, really, across  America--children who need help and care and love. They have been  helping children who are suffering from cancer. This is a really  incredible story. It is one of these stories that, I think, most people  love to hear about because it starts with just an idea--a little  movement, a spark--that turns into something big unexpectedly. It is a  pebble in a pond that creates ripples that turn into waves.   This incredible story starts when Holly, an oncology nurse with three  young children of her own, received news that Lilly, who was a child of  one of her former classmates, was diagnosed with cancer. Lilly is young  girl, and she is going through treatment--chemo. Holly knew this would  be a difficult time for Lilly or for any kid who was working through  the difficulties associated with cancer. Of course, a lot of times with  chemo that means losing your hair. It is especially difficult for a  young girl.   Holly had an idea. Why not crochet a wig for Lilly with soft yarn  that made her look like a princess? So she did that. She found some  soft yarn. She crocheted a whimsical wig with long, branded strands of  yellow yarn, decorated with blue and red flowers, modeled after the  hair of the Disney character Rapunzel. She gave this to Lilly, and this  wig brightened this little girl's day during a very difficult, dark  time. She was able to twirl around in a dress with her Rapunzel braid.  She was able, in many ways, to be a kid again and get out of the  darkness and difficulty and pain of the cancer treatments.   Then something really remarkable happened. Lilly and her parents were  so happy with the wig that Holly got some friends together, and they  began to make a few more wigs and then a few more--a dozen or so--for  more children in Alaska who were suffering from cancer. They were wigs  that were all modeled after Disney characters.   That is where Bree comes in. She is from Anchorage. She heard about  Holly's project through Facebook, and she began to volunteer. Soon,  they were making and distributing hundreds of wigs out of Holly's one- car garage in Palmer, AK. Eventually, they started a nonprofit  organization called the  [[Page S2469]]  Magic Yarn Project. Out of this one little idea for this one beautiful,  little girl, the Magic Yarn Project was born.   Soon, dozens of Alaskans began to volunteer their time, and they  began to hold workshops in schools and in hospitals and in community  centers. The magic started to spread throughout Alaska, and then it  started to spread throughout the country and even around the world.  Thousands of people began making princess hair and superhero hair out  of yarn for children who were living in the darkness and suffering  through the difficulty of cancer.   To date, this dynamic duo, Holly and Bree, have facilitated the  distribution of over 7,000 wigs in 38 countries across the globe for  children who are losing their hair due to cancer and chemotherapy  treatments. Think about that--one idea, one wig. Now we are at 7,000.  Holly and Bree have amassed an army of over 4,000 volunteers across the  country to crochet wigs. This takes time and care and talent.   The old, young, and those from every walk of life have reached out to  them to help brighten a child's life. A football player from the  Seattle Seahawks went to the first out-of-State workshop they held in  Seattle. Everybody has been getting involved here. There are even women  who are incarcerated in Alaska who are making whimsical wigs for these  kids. It is impacting everybody.   Out of this one-car garage in Palmer, AK, which is a small town with  a big heart, literally, the production and love and care of making  these wigs has overtaken not just Alaska, not just the country but the  world. Because of the project's growing popularity and their desire to  reach as many children and volunteers as possible, the two have opened  up chapters in seven States and even in Mexico. It has been daunting  and a lot of work, but they have discovered so much about themselves  and their community.   First, they were struck with how generous Alaskans are, and it was  only possible because Alaskans from all across the State rose to the  occasion to help these young kids. Bree said the Magic Yarn Project has  pushed her in ways she never knew were possible. It made her a better  mom and a better person. Holly said one of the most rewarding things  about the project is in watching her own children get involved and help  and have deep compassion for children who are suffering and who are  less fortunate, whether they are in Alaska or in the country or  somewhere else in the world.   Holly said:         There have been times when a little voice inside me says,       ``These are just wigs. This isn't that big or that       important.''    Yet, when they get the pictures back of these young girls from all  over the country who are wearing their beautiful wigs, they realize it  is a big deal. It is a huge deal.   The parents of these kids have told Holly and Bree how grateful they  are to see their children, who often are living lives in pain and with  needles and surgeries and in hospitals, smile again because of what  they have done. ``It gives them a glimpse of what it was like and hope  for what it will be like when they get better,'' Holly said.   So, to Holly and Bree, we can't thank you enough for your  extraordinary work and your great compassion that has touched,  literally, thousands and thousands of lives across America and the  world.   Congratulations for being our Alaskans of the Week.                         Confirmation of Mike Pompeo    Mr. President, I commend my colleagues who debated for the last week  and then voted on the new Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, who I  believe is either en route or will be en route soon to the NATO Foreign  Ministers summit.   As many of us said on the floor, Mike Pompeo is extremely well  qualified to be the Secretary of State--extremely well qualified. He  was a Congressman who focused on foreign affairs. He is the current  Director of the CIA and was an Army officer who graduated No. 1 in his  class from West Point. He was the Harvard Law Review editor when he  went to Harvard Law School.   I particularly commend my colleagues on the other side of the aisle  who did the right thing and voted for Mr. Pompeo.   I have come down to the floor a couple of times to talk about this  issue of having a long tradition in the United States of this body  typically coming together, particularly as it relates to the Secretary  of State. If someone is qualified and is the President's pick, the  tradition has been to vote for that person. If you look at the votes  over the last 50 years for the Secretaries of State, whether  Republicans or Democrats, there was usually a unanimous vote--100  Senators, 96 Senators, 97 Senators. What I am hopeful for is that we  can get back to that issue with regard to foreign policy and national  security choices for the President regardless of who the President is.   I commend my colleagues on both sides of the aisle but particularly  my Democratic colleagues, who, I know, faced a lot of pressure to vote  no. For those who knew it was important to make sure this was a  bipartisan vote, I thank them. I think Mike Pompeo is going to do a  good job.   I yield the floor.
