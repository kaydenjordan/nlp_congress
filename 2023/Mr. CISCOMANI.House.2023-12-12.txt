 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Campbell  Stewart, a student from Pusch Ridge Christian Academy in Oro Valley who  was named to the 2023 National Youth Orchestra.   Campbell's passion for the timpani, also known as the kettledrum,  started when he was just in third grade. This program allowed Campbell  to perform at Carnegie Hall with 89 talented students over the summer.   This is not his first prestigious recognition. Over the years,  Campbell has earned numerous awards for his accomplishments with the  timpani, including receiving gold medals from the Tucson Philharmonia  Youth Orchestra, the Civic Orchestra of Tucson, and the Southern  Arizona Symphony Orchestra.   Additionally, Campbell also had the privilege of participating in the  2021 Juilliard Percussion Seminar, the Hilton Head Jazz Camp in South  Carolina, and the Brevard Music Center festival.  [[Page H6820]]    Once again, I congratulate Campbell Stewart for his achievement and  for being part of the National Youth Orchestra at Carnegie Hall. His  unwavering dedication and commitment to the world of music does not go  unnoticed.                          Celebrating Lou-Ann Preble     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the remarkable  life and achievements of Lou-Ann Preble. Born in 1929 in South  Carolina, Lou-Ann's life has been nothing short of inspiring.   After completing her high school education, Lou-Ann went on to become  a registered nurse, where she met William Preble, a young Air Force  pilot stationed at the nearby Shaw Air Force Base.   As Bill's Air Force career took off, Lou-Ann raised their 11  children, creating a warm and loving home wherever they were stationed.   Upon retiring in Tucson, Arizona, Bill and Lou-Ann did not slow down.  Instead, they immersed themselves in their community and church,  embodying the spirit of service that defined their lives.   In 1992, Lou-Ann Preble was elected to the Arizona House, where she  served until 2001. Her passion for healthcare and a commitment to the  unique health challenges faced by those living in rural areas of  Arizona set her apart from anyone else.   As the vice chair of the Arizona House Health Committee, Lou-Ann  played a huge role in the creation of the Rural Health Committee.   Lou-Ann partnered with the University of Arizona Health Center and  Dr. Ronald Weinstein to create two programs, the Arizona Telemedicine  Program and the Rural Health Professions Program. The ATP connected  remote and prison clinics with healthcare professionals at the UofA,  revolutionizing healthcare access for those in underserved areas. The  Rural Health Professions Program sought to address the shortage of  physicians in smaller communities by establishing rotations for medical  students throughout various Arizona locales.   Today, Lou-Ann Preble enjoys a well-deserved retirement in Tucson,  surrounded by the love and warmth of her children.   I thank Lou-Ann Preble for her tireless service throughout her life.  It has been an honor for me to know her and to be able to call her a  friend and an inspiration, as well. God bless her.                   Congratulating NAMI of Southern Arizona     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the National  Alliance on Mental Illness of Southern Arizona as they mark four  decades in operation.   NAMI of Southern Arizona was founded in 1983 to focus on bringing  awareness to mental health while providing invaluable assistance to  individuals struggling with their mental health. Their mission is to  educate and support anyone affected by mental illness.   In February 2021, a staggering 40 percent of Arizonans reported  experiencing symptoms of anxiety or depression, with 27 percent unable  to access the help they needed. On a bigger scale, one in five people  across the United States face challenges to their mental health.   NAMI provides an array of support groups in both English and Spanish  that focus on almost every area of mental health, from postpartum  depression to teen and adolescent concerns.   NAMI of Southern Arizona has been a beacon of hope, helping  individuals in managing their mental health effectively. We need more  nonprofit organizations like this in the world. The impact of NAMI's  efforts over the past four decades is truly remarkable. I am honored to  highlight all the good work they do to help our community thrive today.                            ____________________
