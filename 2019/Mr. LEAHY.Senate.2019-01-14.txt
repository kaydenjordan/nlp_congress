 Madam President, it is interesting--we have entered the  24th day of the Trump shutdown. That means that for 24 days, hundreds  of thousands of Federal workers have lived with the uncertainty of when  they will get their next paycheck. Tens of thousands, probably hundreds  of thousands, of private contractors know they will never be paid. For  24 days, nine Federal Departments and dozens of Agencies have been  closed for business. They have withheld vital services from millions of  Americans. I want to point out that the millions of Americans who are  not receiving these services pay taxes to have these services. It has  now become the longest government shutdown in history. Taxpayers have  lost billions of dollars. The country has lost billions of dollars.   The United States should be considered the most powerful country in  the world, but the rest of the world sees our government being held  hostage to the whims of an undisciplined President who is proud of the  shutdown and shows no concern for the chaos he is causing to all  Americans, Republicans and Democrats alike.   Ask people at home what this means to them, no matter whether they  are Republicans or Democrats, that the President seems not to care that  the Food and Drug Administration has stopped inspecting seafood,  fruits, and vegetables, and Americans are at the risk of eating tainted  food and feeding their families tainted food. He seems not to care that  the Environmental Protection Agency has stopped inspections of chemical  factories, water treatment plants, and other industrial sites, leaving  our country vulnerable to dangerous pollutants seeping into the air we  breathe and the water we drink. Ask any parent how they might feel  about their child going to school and drinking water that is tainted  with chemicals solely because we closed down the Agency that is  supposed to inspect those chemicals.   He seems not to care that over 800,000 dedicated Federal workers have  gone without a paycheck this month. As a result, across this Nation,  hundreds of thousands of families are wondering how to pay their bills  and put food on the table. It doesn't make any difference whether they  are Republicans or Democrats or Independents; they are hard-working  Americans.    Just a few days ago, the President's own chief economic adviser went  on national television and said furloughed workers were better off from  this shutdown because they don't have to use up vacation days during  this time they are being forced to take. Does he actually know what he  said? Can you even believe such an arrogant, out-of-touch dismissal of  hard-working Americans? The President's economic adviser is going to  get paid and doesn't have to worry, but this cavalier way of treating  hard-working, honest Americans is indefensible.   I hear from Vermonters every day about the impact the shutdown is  having on their lives. None of these Vermonters--Republican and  Democratic alike--are better off. Let me give you an example.   The other day, I heard from a single mother who works at the  Department of Homeland Security in Vermont. She has been working  without pay since December 22, when the Trump shutdown began, and it  has taken a toll. Remember, this woman works for Homeland Security.   She writes:         I love my job and country. I do have a child to feed and       bills to pay. I have been working a second job to get some       money coming in, but when you are working full time and you       have a family to care for, there are only so many extra hours       you can work, especially if you are not getting a paycheck       for some of the work you are doing.   [[Page S169]]     I heard from another mother. She is worried about her daughter. Her  daughter works for the U.S. Institute of Peace. She has been  furloughed. She just missed her first paycheck, and she is unable to  pay her bills and her student loans. Her daughter dedicates her life to  combating terrorism, and now she is not only unable to do her job, but  she is getting into financial trouble. She is worried, and her mother  is worried, as any mother would be, but she does not have the financial  resources to help her daughter.   Then there is the story of Anthony Morselli, who is a TSA agent at  the Burlington International Airport. I see him often as I fly back and  forth. The local paper recently reported he was forced to start a  GoFundMe page in order to raise money to help his family pay the bills  during the shutdown. His wife is also a TSA agent. They are both  working without pay during the shutdown--it is a double hit--and they  have two children to support. He points out that almost everyone seems  to understand except the President.   Mr. Morselli says:         To see a zero balance in your bank account really hurts.       Some of us live paycheck to paycheck. Today would be payday,       and no money is coming in.    Another Vermonter called in who also works for the Department of  Homeland Security in Vermont. He says he has a month's worth of money  available in his savings account, and then he runs out of money  entirely. He has a mortgage to pay, and the bills are piling up. He is  scared. He works for the Department of Homeland Security. He says he  wants to keep his job, but the shutdown is beyond reason. He says he  certainly does not feel valued at all by the President and this White  House. He points out that while the President says he wants border  protection, he has been holding the pay from the people who protect our  borders, including this Vermonter. I couldn't agree with him more.   Last week, the Senate and House passed a bill to ensure that all  Federal workers will get backpay as soon as the shutdown is over. I was  a cosponsor of that bill. I am glad to hear the President will sign it.  It is the least he can do, considering the fact that he is the one who  caused the mess. While this bill offers assurance to Federal employees  that they will eventually get their paychecks, it does absolutely  nothing to help them now. It does not help the people who call my  office--the TSA agents, the DHS employees, or the State Department  employees--because their bills are due now. This is not a case of,  ``Oh, don't worry about it. Someday, you will get a check.'' The bills  are due now, and the President has threatened that his Trump shutdown  could last months or years. This is untenable.   The President says it is about border security. You could have fooled  me. The examples I just talked about--and I could give so many more-- all involve dedicated Federal employees who are working to keep this  country safe. They are proud of the work they do to keep America safe  and are proud of the service they perform for their country, but they  are all caught in the crosshairs of the Trump shutdown. The Trump  shutdown is not about border security; it is about fulfilling a cynical  campaign rally chant the President made to spin up his base. He even  gave his word that Mexico would pay for the wall, while knowing, even  as he said it, that it would never happen.   Congress is a coequal branch of government. We are not in the  business of throwing taxpayer dollars around to build monuments to the  Presidential egos of the Presidents of any party. Everyone knows the  $5.7 billion wall he wants to build is a waste of taxpayer money.  Everybody knows it will not address the immigration challenges in this  country.    The President has manufactured a sense of urgency on the southern  border solely to generate support for his ridiculous wall. The  President likes to spin up his base by talking about the invasion of  illegal immigrants, but that is not the reality. Apprehensions at the  southwest border have dropped 75 percent since 2000. More people are  here in this country illegally because they have overstayed their  visas, not because they have snuck across the border. Every Member of  the Senate supports border security, but I would argue we need to  invest in smart border security, not spend billions of taxpayers'  dollars on a 30-foot wall that determined people will be able to go  over, or through, or under.   The President is now asserting that Democrats are for open borders.  That is nonsense. In fiscal year 2018, the Democrats supported $21.1  billion in direct appropriations for border security and immigration  enforcement. That followed a similar amount in fiscal year 2017. This  funding supports investments at our northern and southern borders to  help stop the flow of dangerous drugs like opioids, fentanyl, and  methamphetamines. It targets money where it is needed. It pays for  19,500 Border Patrol agents nationwide, including, roughly, 16,500 on  our southern border. It pays for 23,500 Customs Officers at our ports  of entry, including 6,815 who are assigned to the southwest border's  ports of entry. In fact, with Democratic support, the number of agents  and officers we have is at a record high, even though illegal border  crossings are at the lowest level we have seen since 1971.   Last year, Democrats and Republicans came together and agreed upon  $1.7 billion in targeted border security investments. This included  over $1 billion to be used between the ports of entry for improved  facilities, tactical communications equipment, additional air assets,  integrated fixed towers, video surveillance systems, ground detection  systems, tactical aerostats, and money for countering cross-border  tunnel threats. This is from Republicans and Democrats working  together. It included $580 million for security at our ports of entry  by increasing funds for intelligence capabilities at the National  Targeting Center, nonintrusive inspection equipment so as to detect  illicit contraband, and opioid testing equipment. It also included  another $615 million to help address the root causes of migration from  Central America.   These are investments that Republicans and Democrats can all agree  on. This is how you protect our borders. It is more complex, but it is  more effective than building a 30-foot wall. A 30-foot wall would not  begin to do what this does. The shutdown is not about border security.  Let's just be honest. It is about the President's own ego. It has to  end.   In a few minutes, we are going to be voting on another bill that is  one the Republican leader keeps bringing up. It is S. 1. At a time when  people are desperate and are out of work here in America, we are to  bring up this bill which has nothing to do with funding the government  or border security. Rather than voting on the appropriations bills that  would put Americans back to work, S. 1 authorizes more than $800  million, in this year alone, for Israeli defense contractors as part of  $38 billion for Israel over the next 10 years. It is money that will  put Israelis to work. It will pay for them to go to work. That is fine,  but couldn't we take time, first, to put Americans back to work?   It also includes the boycott, divestment, sanctions legislation. This  is an open violation of our First Amendment. It would give up Federal  authority over matters of foreign policy to our State and local  governments. I might not like a particular boycott, but the right to  boycott is fundamental. Just pick up any one of our books about the  U.S. civil rights movement and wonder if Martin Luther King and others  would have been successful if they had not been allowed to have  boycotts. It is not up to the government to pick and choose which  boycotts citizens should support or oppose.   We have bills that are supported by Republicans and Democrats alike  that could reopen the government. That should be our focus. We could  talk about creating jobs in Israel at another time. Let's create jobs  in America. Let's reopen our government.   I call on my friends, the Republicans, to stand up to the President  and put a stop to this madness. Otherwise, the shutdown will not be  just the President's fault but the fault of the Republicans in the  Senate.   I implore Senator McConnell to bring up H.R. 21 and H.J. Res. 1 and  send them to the President. Let Democrats and Republicans join together  in voting for them. We could pass them with a veto-proof majority.   Congress is a coequal branch of government. We should not be  intimidated  [[Page S170]]  by any President of any party. We should start acting like a coequal  branch of government. Frankly, we have 800,000 people in this country  who will be paid for their work immediately if we start acting like we  are supposed to--as a coequal branch of government. There are hundreds  of thousands of others who need to work--contractors and all.   Let's stand up for Americans. We have the money for border security,  but let's stand up for Americans. Let's put them to work. Let's let  them get paid for what they are doing. These are our neighbors. These  are people I see in the grocery store in Vermont when I am home on  weekends. They are the people I see coming out of church on Sunday.  These are the people I see when I am walking down the street to pick up  my newspaper. These are good, hard-working people. Of the ones I have  talked to, I have no idea whether they are Republicans or Democrats.  All I know is that they want to do their work for this country. They  support this country. They want to help this country be secure, but  they can't understand why a temper tantrum at the White House will  allow their paychecks to be stopped.    I yield the floor.   I don't see anybody seeking recognition.   So I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask for the time to be  equally divided.
