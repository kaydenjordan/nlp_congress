 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 230, I call  up the joint resolution (S.J. Res. 34) providing for congressional  disapproval under chapter 8 of title 5, United States Code, of the rule  submitted by the Federal Communications Commission relating to  ``Protecting the Privacy of Customers of Broadband and Other  Telecommunications Services'', and ask for its immediate consideration  in the House.   The Clerk read the title of the joint resolution.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 230, the joint  resolution is considered read.   The text of the joint resolution is as follows:                                S.J. Res. 34         Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the       United States of America in Congress assembled, That Congress       disapproves the rule submitted by the Federal Communications       Commission relating to ``Protecting the Privacy of Customers       of Broadband and Other Telecommunications Services'' (81 Fed.       Reg. 87274 (December 2, 2016)), and such rule shall have no       force or effect.    The SPEAKER pro tempore. The joint resolution shall be debatable for  1 hour equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority  member of the Committee on Energy and Commerce.   The gentlewoman from Tennessee (Mrs. Blackburn) and the gentleman  from Pennsylvania (Mr. Michael F. Doyle) each will control 30 minutes.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to  include extraneous material on S.J. Res. 34.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentlewoman from Tennessee?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to  include extraneous material on S.J. Res. 34.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentlewoman from Tennessee?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I do rise today in support of S.J. Res. 34, which  disapproves of the rule submitted by the Federal Communications  Commission relating to protecting the privacy of customers of broadband  and other telecommunication services.   I applaud Senator Flake's work on this issue, as S.J. Res. 34 was  passed by the Senate last week. I also filed a companion resolution in  the House.   The FCC finalized its broadband privacy rules on October 27, 2016. At  that time, they assured us that the rules would provide broadband  customers meaningful choice, greater transparency, and stronger  security protections for their personal information collected by  internet service providers, but the reality is much different.   There are three specific problems with which the FCC has gone about  these rules. First, the FCC unilaterally swiped jurisdiction from the  Federal Trade Commission. The FTC has served as our Nation's sole  online privacy regulator for over 20 years.   Second, having two privacy cops on the beat will create confusion  within the internet ecosystem and will end up harming consumers.   Third, the FCC already has authority to enforce privacy obligations  of broadband service providers on a case-by-case basis. These broadband  privacy rules are unnecessary and are just another example of Big  Government overreach. The Competitive Enterprise Institute estimates  that Federal regulations cost our economy $1.9 trillion in 2015.   Since President Trump took office, Republicans have been working  diligently to loosen the regulatory environment that is suffocating  hardworking taxpayers.   Here is what multiple House Democrats said in a letter to the FCC  last May regarding the FCC's privacy rules:         The rulemaking intends to go well beyond the traditional       framework that has guarded consumers from data practices of       internet service providers and ill-served consumers who seek       and expect consistency in how their personal data is       protected.    Further, FTC Commissioner Joshua Wright testified before Congress  that the FTC has unique experience in enforcing broadband service  providers' obligations to protect the privacy and security of consumer  data. He added that the rules will actually do less to protect  consumers by depriving the FTC of its longstanding jurisdiction in the  area. Once again, these rules hurt consumers.   Incredibly, former FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler referred to the internet  as the most powerful and pervasive network in the history of the planet  before these rules were even created. I found this really odd because  it implied that the FTC regulation had indeed been successful and ought  to continue, ultimately undermining his own rationale for additional  FCC privacy regulation.   Now, there are a couple of myths that are going around that I want to  take the time to dispel. Our friends claim there will be a gap for ISPs  in the FCC privacy rules when they are overturned. This simply is  false, and let me tell you why. The FCC already has the authority to  enforce the privacy obligations of broadband service providers on a  case-by-case basis.   Pursuant to section 201 of the Communications Act, they can police  practices of the ISPs that are unjust or unreasonable. Sections 202 and  222 also protect consumers. It is already in statute. So I encourage my  friends to read title II of the Communications Act. Also, the State  attorneys general have the ability to go after companies for unfair and  deceptive practices.   Third, litigation is another avenue consumers can pursue against ISPs  for mishandling personal data. Service providers have privacy policies.  If they violate the policy, guess what? They can be sued. I know  Democrats will certainly understand that, as they have many trial  lawyer friends, and I urge them to speak to the trial bar.   Fourth, the free market is another great equalizer. Can you imagine  the embarrassment for an ISP that is caught unlawfully selling data? We  have all seen the economic fallout from something such as a data  breach. Companies have a financial incentive to handle your personal  data properly because to do otherwise would significantly impair their  financial standing.  [[Page H2490]]    To my Democrat friends across the aisle, the bottom line is this: the  only gap that exists is in these arguments that you have made.   Consumer privacy is something we all want to protect, and consumer  privacy will continue to be protected and will actually be enhanced by  removing the uncertainty and confusion these rules will create, as the  Democrats Rush, Schrader, and Green indicated in a letter to the FCC  last May.   I also want to speak, for just a moment, on the edge providers  because there has been some question about who has visibility into your  data. Clinton administration veteran privacy expert Peter Swire offered  a report in February 2016 titled ``Online Privacy in ISPs.''   ISP's access to consumer data is limited and often less than access  to others. Swire found that ISPs have less visibility into consumer  behavior online than search, social media, advertising, and big tech  companies.   Swire's study found that, as a result of advancing technologies, the  rise of encryption, and the various ways and locations individuals  access the internet, ISPs now have increasingly limited insight into  our activities and information online.   By contrast, however, so-called edge providers, like search engines,  social media, advertising, shopping, and other services online, often  have greater visibility into personal consumer data.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.   Mr. MICHAEL F. DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself  such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to S.J. Res. 34.   Today, colleagues, we are waist deep in the swamp. The American  people did not ask for this resolution.   In fact, no company will even put its name behind this effort.  Instead, this resolution is the result of an explicit written request  from Washington lobbyists. These lobbyists make the bogus claim that  having actual protections will confuse consumers and the only way to  help clear up this information is to have no rules at all.   No consumer has come forward to support this position. No consumer  has said this argument even makes sense.   I challenge every Member of this body at your next townhall meeting  to have a show of hands of how many people think it is a good idea to  allow your internet service provider to sell their personal information  without their permission.                                time  1600    Then after you get that show of hands, ask them how many of them  would vote for you if you support allowing corporations to do that.   This resolution is of the swamp and for the swamp and no one else.  The rules of this resolution would overturn rules that are simple and  make common sense. They don't require much, only three things:   One, internet service providers should ask permission before selling  your private internet browsing history, app usage, or other sensitive  information;   Two, once they have your information, internet service providers  should take reasonable measures to protect it; and   Finally, if the information gets stolen, the company should quickly  let you know.   That is it. That is all that is being asked of them.   These modest rules don't stop internet service providers from using  data for advertising and profiling or whatever else so long as they ask  first.   ISPs have an obligation under these rules not to dive into the  personal lives of Americans unless that is what those Americans want.  They just need to ask first.   This is particularly true because broadband providers see literally  everything you do online, every website you visit, every app, every  device, every time. By analyzing your internet usage and browsing  history, these companies will know more about you than members of your  own family, more than you tell your doctor, more than you know about  yourself. Without these rules, these companies don't have to ask before  selling all of that information, and they don't have to take reasonable  measures to protect that information when they collect it.   Make no mistake about this, colleagues: Anyone who votes for this  bill is telling your constituents that they no longer have the freedom  to decide how to control their own information. You have given that  freedom away to big corporations. More importantly, there aren't rules  to fall back on if Congress scraps these.   Critics of the rules argue that the Federal Trade Commission should  oversee the privacy protection for broadband providers, but, under  current law, they have no authority to do so, and the CRA won't do a  thing to fix that. Under a Federal court of appeals case, the FTC has  no authority over mobile broadband providers at all.   And to those that say the FCC can evaluate complaints on a case-by- case basis using its statutory authority, the current Chairman--your  current Chairman--stated that section 222 cannot be used to protect  personal information and that rules are necessary to enforce this  statute.   Mr. Speaker, I include for the Record a statement by the FCC  Commissioner.               Dissenting Statement of Commissioner Ajit Pai       Re TerraCom, Inc. and YourTel America, Inc., Apparent           Liability for Forfeiture, File No. EB-TCD-13-00009175.         A core principle of the American legal system is due       process. The government cannot sanction you for violating the       law unless it has told you what the law is.        In the regulatory context, due process is protected, in       part, through the fair warning rule. Specifically, the D.C.       Circuit has stated that ``[i]n the absence of notice--for       example, where the regulation is not sufficiently clear to       warn a party about what is expected of it--an agency may not       deprive a party of property.'' Thus, an agency cannot at once       invent and enforce a legal obligation.        Yet this is precisely what has happened here. In this case,       there is no pre-existing legal obligation to protect       personally identifiable information (also known as PII) or       notify customers of a PII data breach to enforce. The       Commission has never interpreted the Communications Act to       impose an enforceable duty on carriers to ``employ reasonable       data security practices to protect'' PII. The Commission has       never expounded a duty that carriers notify all consumers of       a data breach of PII. The Commission has never adopted rules       regarding the misappropriation, breach, or unlawful       disclosure of PII. The Commission never identifies in the       entire Notice of Apparent Liability a single rule that has       been violated.        Nevertheless, the Commission asserts that these companies       violated novel legal interpretations and never-adopted rules.       And it seeks to impose a substantial financial penalty. In so       doing, the Commission runs afoul of the fair warning rule. I       cannot support such ``sentence first, verdict afterward''       decision-making.        To the extent that the circumstances giving rise to today's       item merited the Commission's attention, there was a better       (and lawful) path forward. We could have opened a notice-and-      comment rulemaking. This process would have given the public       an opportunity to speak. And in turn, the agency would have       had a chance to formulate clear, well-considered rules--rules       we then could have enforced against anyone who violated them.       Instead, the Commission proposes a forfeiture today that, if       actually imposed, has little chance of surviving judicial       review.        One more thing. The Commission asserts that the base       forfeiture for these violations is nine billion dollars--      that's $9,000,000,000--which is by far the biggest in our       history. It strains credulity to think that Congress intended       such massive potential liability for ``telecommunications       carriers'' but not retailers or banks or insurance companies       or tech companies or cable operators or any of the myriad       other businesses that possess consumers' PII. Nor can I       understand how such liability can be squared with the       Enforcement Bureau's recent consent decrees with these       companies. Under those consent decrees, the companies paid       the Treasury $440,000 and $160,000 for flouting our actual       rules and draining the Universal Service Fund by seeking       Lifeline support multiple times for the same customer.        Consumer protection is a critical component of the agency's       charge to promote the public interest. But any enforcement       action we take in that regard must comport with the law. For       the reasons stated above, I dissent.    Mr. MICHAEL F. DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Without these protections,  there will be no clear rules of the road. At a time when foreign actors  like the Russians, the Chinese, and everyone else under the sun are  constantly trying to steal our data and compromise our security, it  would be irresponsible to roll back the only Federal safeguards we  have. I want my colleagues to think long and hard before you give  corporations the ability to sell your information without their  permission.   Mr. Speaker, I include several articles in the Record by Free Press  and the Open Technology Institute opposing the CRA, an op-ed from a  current  [[Page H2491]]  FTC Commissioner opposing this CRA, and a memorandum from engineers at  EFF opposing this CRA.                      [From Free Press, May 10, 2016]     Pay-for-Privacy Schemes Put the Most Vulnerable Americans at Risk                             (By Sandra Fulton)         The FCC has opened a proceeding on the rules and policies       surrounding privacy rights for broadband service. One       industry practice called into question in that proceeding       could have a devastating impact on our most vulnerable       populations.        Internet service providers charge broadband customers a ton       for Internet access. ISPs are increasingly finding new       revenue streams too, by taking part in the multibillion-      dollar market that's evolved out of selling users' personal       information to online marketers. As the debate around privacy       has heated up, ISPs have tried to placate the public's       growing interest in privacy protections while maintaining       revenues they can get when they auction off their customers'       valuable personal information.        One proposed solution that AT&T has largely ``pioneered''?       Have customers pay to preserve their privacy.        The potential harms and discriminatory implications of this       practice are obvious. It could mean that only people with the       necessary financial means could protect their privacy and       prevent their ISPs from sharing their personal information       with predatory online marketers. The FCC rulemaking       proceeding seeks comments on whether to allow such       ``financial inducements'' for the surrender of private       information. If the agency decides not to ban such practices       outright, it wants to know how it should regulate them.        As our lives have moved online, ISPs have gained access to       our most sensitive personal information. Advanced       technologies allow companies to track us invisibly,       collecting and selling data on nearly every detail of what we       do online.        But ISPs don't just stop at knowing what we're doing. The       location tracking that's needed to provide mobile service to       our phones lets the ISPs know when and where we do it too.       And they can figure out the people and organizations we       associate with by looking at who we talk to and which       websites we visit.        As ISPs track their customers, they create comprehensive       dossiers containing sensitive information on each person's       finances, health, age, race, religion and ethnicity. Their       reach is so pervasive that information like a visit to a       website discussing mental health, a search on how to collect       unemployment benefits, or a visit to a church or Planned       Parenthood office could be swept up into their databases.        How do you feel about your ISP selling such a personal       glimpse into your life to online advertisers? Under a pay-      for-privacy scheme, you wouldn't need to worry about it so       long as you could afford to shell out the hush money. But       those who aren't so fortunate would have to relinquish any       control over how their personal data is spread across the       Web.        The FCC raised concerns about this dynamic when it launched       its rulemaking proceeding, noting that such pay-for-privacy       practices might disadvantage low-income people and members of       other vulnerable communities. But it didn't make any specific       recommendations or issue any proposals on how to regulate in       this space.        Long before the FCC launched this inquiry at the end of       March 2016, and even before the agency had clarified its       authority to protect broadband users in the February 2015       Open Internet Order, AT&T's GigaPower broadband service had       become one of the first pay-for-privacy plans on the market.       The AT&T deal allows customers to opt out of some information       sharing if they pay an extra $29 a month or more.        For a struggling family, that could mean choosing between       paying for privacy and paying for groceries or the public       transportation needed to get to work. And while AT&T might be       the first to launch this kind of service, an article in       Fortune notes that other companies are eager to roll out       similar plans.        Under pay-for-privacy models, consumers who are unable to       pay the higher broadband cost will likely see their ISPs       share their data with shadowy online data brokers who use       this information to tailor marketing messages. While       unregulated and unaccountable data brokers are a threat to       everyone's privacy, they're notorious for targeting low-      income communities, people of color and other vulnerable       demographics.        One particularly damning report from the Senate Commerce       Committee offered this glimpse into how these brokers       categorize and label these target audiences:        The Senate committee's report notes, for example, that the       ``Hard Times'' category includes people who are ``Older,       down-scale and ethnically diverse singles typically       concentrated in inner-city apartments.''        It continues: ``This is the bottom of the socioeconomic       ladder, the poorest lifestyle segment in the nation. Hard       Times are older singles in poor city neighborhoods. Nearly       three-quarters of the adults are between the ages of 50 and       75; this is an underclass of the working poor and destitute       seniors without family support . . .''        These classifications can influence not just what kinds of       ads people see, but the interest rates they're offered or the       insurance premiums they pay. These targeted communities are       precisely the ones who can't pay extra to shield their       personal information from these dangerous companies.        There may be some argument that if big companies are going       to profit from our data anyway, it's actually good if their       customers get a share of that. The FCC's rulemaking proposal       notes that brickand-mortar stores and websites alike offer       all sorts of ``free'' services, discounts and perks in       exchange for the data they mine from their customers and       users.        But the nature of the broadband market--where users have no       real options when it comes to choosing their providers, and       no way to opt out short of staying offline--makes the       tradeoffs here especially worthy of attention. If users could       get fair value for their data, and if they got a real       discount on broadband and not just a privacy penalty, and if       they were providing truly informed consent with full       knowledge of all the pernicious uses data brokers have for       their information, then maybe we could have a conversation       about the fairness of such schemes. But those are some very       big ifs.        We need better transparency rules for marketers and easy-      to-use disclosures and opt-in mechanisms before we get there.       We also need strong baseline privacy protections guaranteed       for all, including rules that prohibit ISPs from using       discriminatory schemes that jeopardize the rights of their       most vulnerable customers.        We applaud the FCC for taking this crucial first step to       protect privacy from broadband ISPs' overreach and abuse. As       gatekeepers to the Internet, ISPs hold a wealth of       information about their customers, and the Communications Act       commands the FCC to establish strong safeguards for that       private info. But the FCC also must also remember that our       rights are not for sale--and that privacy is not a luxury for       the wealthy.                                   ____                                ISPs Know All            you deserve more privacy from your broadband provider                               (By Eric Null)         As you read this post, your internet service provider is       collecting information about you: what you're reading right       now on Slate, what URL you go to next, what time of day it       is, and whether you're on your home computer or your mobile       device, among many other data points. Your ISP has similar       data about apps you've used, how much data you consume at any       given time of day, and your other daily internet habits and       rhythms. Of course, your ISP has other up-to-date personal       information as well--things like your name, address,       telephone number, credit card number, and likely your Social       Security number. In this way, ISPs have access to a uniquely       detailed, comprehensive, and accurate view of you and every       other subscriber. All of this at a time when consumer concern       over privacy is increasing and has actually caused people to       refrain from engaging in e-commerce and other activities       online.        To make matters worse, you are essentially powerless to       limit the data your ISP collects about you. While you may, in       some instances, defend yourself against tracking by websites       and apps by disallowing cookies or turning on ``Do Not       Track'' in your browser settings, in many cases there is no       way to protect against ISP tracking except by avoiding the       internet altogether.        While there are some tools that can help consumers protect       themselves, they are not prevalent. For example, ISPs cannot       see full website addresses when that site uses encryption--      denoted by a small lock icon in your browser bar. However,       the website--not you--decides whether it will use encryption.       And while Netflix traffic is encrypted (so your ISP only       knows you're watching videos, not specifically which ones       you're watching), WebMD traffic is not (so your ISP likely       knows every page you've visited on WebMD), even though       medical symptoms are clearly much more personal than your       favorite TV program.        Another example of ways consumers can purportedly protect       themselves is through virtual private networks, or VPNs,       which route web traffic through another network and therefore       effectively ``hide'' the traffic from the person's ISP. But       VPNs are difficult to use and configure. They often cost       extra money, slow down your browsing, and simply send your       data through some other access provider that may be       collecting data about you, too. These options are not       practical defenses for most consumers.        Currently, there are no rules to prevent your ISP from       using these data for almost any purpose, including       categorizing you and serving you advertisements based on       those categories. Targeted ads may even be based on whether       you have (or the ISP has inferred you have) a certain disease       or what your income level is. Recently, Cable One was found       to be using predictive analytics to determine which of its       customers were ``hollow'' (that is, had low credit scores)       and then offering them low-quality customer service. Cable       One technicians, the company's CEO stated, aren't going to       ``spend 15 minutes setting up an iPhone app'' for someone       with a low credit score. Of course, making decisions based on       credit scores is going to disproportionately affect       communities of color and other vulnerable populations.       Additionally, the data ISPs collect, often compiled into a       ``profile,'' might be sold to third parties (like advertisers       or data brokers) and used and reused for purposes for which       they were not initially collected--in ways that often annoy       people, such as when personal information is used to send a       ``barrage of unwanted  [[Page H2492]]       emails.'' And as the number of entities who hold your data       increases, so too does the chance those data will be       compromised by a leak or hack.        So you may find yourself between a rock and a hard place:       Use the internet and give up your privacy, or forego internet       access entirely--something that's not exactly reasonable. But       there is good news. The Federal Communications Commission is       trying to make sure that you and all other ISP customers       don't have to confront this choice. In 2015, as part of       decision to uphold net neutrality, the FCC ruled that ISPs       are ``common carriers.'' (The U.S. Court of Appeals for the       District of Columbia Circuit recently upheld that ruling.)       Since then, the FCC has had a statutory obligation to protect       the data ISPs collect about their customers. To accomplish       that, the FCC recently proposed a new rule that would require       ISPs, in most cases, to seek opt-in consent from customers       before using data collected for purposes other than to       provide service, such as to deliver certain kinds of ads or       to sell to data brokers. That means that if the rule passes,       your ISP would have to notify you of any new intended use of       the data and give you the opportunity to say ``yes, that is       OK with me'' or ``no, that is not OK with me.'' Of key       importance in this rule is that if you said ``no,'' your ISP       couldn't just refuse to serve you--it would have to respect       your wishes and still provide you with service.        The FCC's proposal should be enacted, because you should       not have to trade your privacy to access the internet. (New       America's Open Technology Institute, where I work, has been       actively engaged on this issue and has submitted comments in       the record. New America is a partner with Slate and Arizona       State University in Future Tense.) It should go without       saying, but it's important enough that I will say it anyway:       Internet access is imperative for personal and professional       success in today's digital world. Yet to gain access to the       most important tool of the 21st century, you have to allow       your ISP access to incredibly rich and private information       about what you do online. You should get to control what it       does with that data. Consumers deserve real choice when it       comes to protecting their data, and the opt-in regime       proposed by the FCC is a huge step in the right direction.        Yet--perhaps unsurprisingly--ISPs and several House       committees have responded to the FCC's proposal as if the sky       is falling. They have mounted an all-out assault on the idea       that you should have the right to choose how ISPs use your       data. Their arguments range from the highly dubious (the       proposal exceeds the FCC's authority) to the downright silly       (consumers will be confused by having different privacy rules       for ISPs as compared with other companies, like search       engines and social networks). Chances are your ISP is telling       the FCC that you don't need protections against exploitation       of your data. (If you're interested, you can see exactly what       your ISP is saying--here are the responses from AT&T,       Comcast, CenturyLink, T-Mobile, Verizon, and Sprint; unnamed       ISPs may be represented by various trade associations like       the National Cable and Telecommunications Association and       CTIA for wireless.) However, as with the net neutrality       debate that led to this proposal, consumers may feel       differently.        The FCC has proposed a very strong rule that will help       protect ISP customers from exploitative uses of their data.       This battle for consumer choice will be ongoing for many       months, but soon, you may finally be able to choose both       having internet access and protecting your privacy.                                   ____                                   Electronic Frontier Foundation,                                                  San Francisco, CA.  Five Ways Americans' Cybersecurity Will Suffer If Congress Repeals the                             FCC Privacy Rules         If the House votes to repeal the FCC's recent privacy       rules, Americans' cybersecurity will be put at risk. That's       because privacy and security are two sides of the same coin:       privacy is about controlling who has access to information       about you, and security is how you maintain that control. You       usually can't break one without breaking the other, and       that's especially true in this context. To show how, here are       five ways repealing the FCC's privacy rules will weaken       Americans' cybersecurity.        1. Internet providers will record our browsing history, and       the systems they use to record that information (not to       mention the information itself) will become very tempting       targets for hackers. (Just imagine what would happen if a       foreign hacker thought she could blackmail a politician or a       celebrity based on their browsing history.)        2. In order to record encrypted browsing history (i.e.       https websites), Internet providers will start deploying       systems that remove the encryption so they can inspect the       data. Although US-CERT (part of DHS) just put out an alert       saying that this is extremely dangerous for Americans'       cybersecurity, FCC Chairman Pai just decided not to enforce       rules that keep Internet providers from doing this.        3. Internet providers will insert ads into our browsing,       but that could break the existing code on webpages. That       means security features might be broken, which could expose       Americans to a greater risk of attack.        4. Internet providers will insert tracking tags into our       browsing--and that means every website will be able to track       you, not just your Internet provider, and there's nothing you       can do to stop them.        5. Internet providers will pre-install software to record       information directly from our mobile phones (after all, it's       just one more source of information they can monetize). But       if the software that does that recording has bugs or       vulnerabilities, hackers could break into that software, and       then access everything the Internet provider could see. Do       you trust your Internet provider, which can't even keep an       appointment to fix your cable, to write completely bug-free       software?        The net result is simple: repealing the FCC's privacy rules       won't just be a disaster for Americans' privacy. It will be a       disaster for America's cybersecurity, too.    Mr. MICHAEL F. DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the  balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Rogers of Kentucky). The gentleman is  reminded to address his remarks to the Chair.    Mr. Speaker, I will remind my colleagues across the  aisle that, again, section 222 of the Communications Act covers the  authority that the FCC needs. Traditionally, online privacy has been  handled by the FTC. That is an authority that we have designated to  them.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Oregon (Mr.  Walden), chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield the balance of my time to the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Flores), and I ask unanimous consent that he  may control that time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentlewoman from Tennessee?   There was no objection.
