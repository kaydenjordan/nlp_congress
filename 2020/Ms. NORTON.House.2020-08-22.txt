 Mr. Speaker, even during this pandemic with most agencies  down, we had not heard complaints from the Postal Service until Louis  DeJoy was appointed Postmaster General. On the contrary, the pandemic  had not kept our mail from being faithfully delivered.   Almost immediately after DeJoy assumed office, pandemonium broke out.  For example, in Ward 8 of my district, there was no mail for 2 weeks.  And the District and 46 States have been warned by the Postal Service  itself that it cannot guarantee that all mail ballots will arrive in  time to be counted.   Mr. DeJoy did not tell the truth at the Senate hearing yesterday. We  know that from a July 15 memorandum directing employees explicitly to  leave mail behind and to significantly cut overtime. We know that from  an August 7 Postal Service action that reassigned 23 top executives  with decades of institutional knowledge of postal operations in order  to centralize operations. We know and will bring out before this  hearing is over today that the Post Office continues to be sabotaged.
