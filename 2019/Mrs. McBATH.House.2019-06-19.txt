 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge action to end the  public health crisis of gun violence.   Every day, nearly 100 people are killed in suicides, homicides, and  accidents involving guns, but we have not invested nearly enough in  preventing these deaths. Of the top 30 causes of death, 29 received  more research funding than guns. But today, this body will vote to  invest in gun violence research at the Centers for Disease Control and  the National Institutes of Health.   I recently visited the Centers for Disease Control Injury Center  which is in my district. With this critical funding, they will learn  how we can prevent gun tragedies. This investment is long overdue, and  I was proud to lead my colleagues in asking for this funding.   We have the responsibility to pursue life-saving research, and today  we vote to end gun violence.   As a survivor of gun violence, I could not be more proud of the  measures that we have taken to save the countless numbers of lives that  may be affected by gun violence in the future. The time has passed for  my son. The time has passed for others like my son who was killed  unnecessarily due to gun violence, but I am so grateful for this day.   I am so grateful for the funding for the research that will save  many, many lives for generations to come.                            ____________________
