 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, yesterday evening, President Trump shared  the news that Attorney General Bill Barr will be leaving the  administration in the coming days, and I want to take a moment to  publicly thank the Attorney General for his service to our country.   Under two different Presidents and at two very different times in our  country's history, Bill Barr gladly answered the call to service. His  steadfast leadership has enabled the Department of Justice to continue  its mission at a pivotal moment in our Nation's history.   I particularly appreciate Attorney General Barr's attempt to get to  the bottom of some of the abuse of power by the FBI and the Department  of Justice during the latter part of the Obama administration and early  in the Trump administration.   During his time as Attorney General, Bill Barr has consistently  fought to improve the safety of our communities across the country by  attacking violent crime and aggressively countering transnational  criminal organizations. He has been a champion of Project Safe  Neighborhoods, which has strengthened community partnerships and helped  to reduce crime rates across our country.   He has taken aim at the threats that exist beyond our borders, from  drug cartels in Mexico to economic exploitation and outright theft by  China.   Through it all, he has been as dogged in preventing injustice as in  pursuing wrongdoing.   So I want to thank the Attorney General once again for not only  answering the call to serve a second time but also for once again  serving with distinction and integrity.
