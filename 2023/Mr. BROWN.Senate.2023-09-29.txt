 Madam President, I rise today to congratulate the Ohio  History Connection, National Parks Service, and local Tribal  communities on their historic achievement of earning Ohio's first World  Heritage designation.   The Hopewell Ceremonial Earthworks join the Yellowstone National  Park, the Grand Canyon, the Statue of Liberty, and 21 others as U.S.- designated World Heritage sites. The designation is reserved for the  places on earth that are of ``Outstanding Universal Value'' to humanity  and will support the protection of the site for future generations.   The Hopewell Ceremonial Earthworks are a series of eight ancient  monuments built in the middle of the Woodland period, between 1,600 and  2,000 years ago by people we now refer to as the Hopewell Culture. The  Earthworks embody the artistry, spirituality, and architecture of the  Hopewell peoples. They also reflect the commitment to preservation and  collaboration that archaeologists and Tribal nations have maintained  over the years.   This designation would not be possible without the collaboration of  the Ohio History Connection, the National Parks Service, and local  Tribal communities. May the celebration and preservation of the  Hopewell Earthworks tell the story of Ohio history for generations to  come. Congratulations.                            ____________________
