 Madam Speaker, 2 weeks ago, my Republican colleagues and I  asked for more funding for the Paycheck Protection Program. More than  1.6 million small businesses and their employees were helped before the  money ran out, including $4.3 billion in PPP loans for more than 26,000  small businesses in Kansas.   Now, hundreds of thousands of applications sit, because Congress  would not act in time. As a result, small business owners are laying  off employees, they are losing the businesses that they worked so hard  to build.   This bill will save 201,000 Kansas jobs. While late, this bill  provides more funding to the program, representing a small step towards  reopening America. This money will save businesses and jobs and allows  more hardworking Americans to provide for their families.   Increased testing is a vital step in our return to normalcy. This  bill provides $75 billion for healthcare providers and another $25  billion for testing capacity to combat the virus. Testing is critical  to reopening Kansas and getting America going again.   Today, I am grateful for the Americans who stepped up to help their  neighbors in this unprecedented time, and I will continue to show up  for Kansas by supporting this legislation.
