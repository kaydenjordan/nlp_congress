 Mr. Speaker, I rise in honor of the new head football  coach at Ennis High School, Coach Sam Harrell.   Coach Sam Harrell was born in 1975 in Seminole, Texas. He went to  high school in Brownwood, Texas, where he was valedictorian. He became,  the first time, the high school coach at Ennis back in 1994. Over the  next 15 or 16 years, he won three State championships, went to the  semifinals twice, was Texas High School Coach of the Year in 1999,  became head of the Texas High School Coaches Association, and was in  [[Page H5349]]  the Texas High School Football Hall of Fame.   But in 2005, he came down with multiple sclerosis, which was not  treatable by conventional therapy. He had to go out of the country for  some stem cell treatments. Those were successful. He moved back to this  country, continued to live in Ennis, Texas, and stayed active in the  community. And about 2 weeks ago, the school board and school  superintendent named him, again, to be the head football coach at Ennis  High School.   He is a very great coach, but he is also a greater man. He is very  Christian. He is good with the kids. He is just an absolute stellar  individual.   Congratulations to Coach Sam Harrell, who is, once again, head  football coach for the Ennis Lions, who have five State championships  in their history.                            ____________________     I thank Congressman Olson for his leadership as vice  chairman of the subcommittee and a tireless leader on behalf of energy  in this country.   Also, I want to thank Congressman Johnson for his strong efforts and  also compliment him on his playing in last week's Congressional  Baseball Game. Congressman Duncan was also on the team and played well  as shortstop.   Oil was discovered in Pennsylvania back in the mid-1800s. As the oil  industry began to develop, they more and more would run into what we  would today call associated gas. Every now and then while drilling for  oil they would hit a well that didn't have any oil, but all it had was  what today we call natural gas.   They didn't know what to do with it. They used the oil to make  kerosene, lubricants, and home heating oil and things like that, but  they didn't have a real purpose for natural gas. So they would just  flare it, just literally in the field, light a match, put a flare pipe  up and flare it. As time went on, they discovered that it had a fairly  high Btu energy content, and they discovered a way to contain it, to  store it, and to transport it through pipelines. Because it was a gas,  it was not a liquid in its natural state, so while it was not as  valuable as oil, it had enough value that it was worth looking for and  worth keeping.   You rock along and you rock along, and in the 1950s and 1960s, we  began to set price controls on natural gas in interstate commerce. The  Federal Government would regulate the price and as a consequence people  stopped looking for it, because it wasn't economic to find it unless  you could find a well that you could sell in intrastate commerce,  within the State.   When I ran for Congress in 1984, I ran on the platform of repealing  what was called the Natural Gas Price Act of 1978 where Congress had  set a price control on interstate natural gas in some cases as low as 2  cents per 1,000 cubic feet. Gas in the intrastate market, deep gas, was  selling as high as $15 per 1,000 cubic feet. There is a big difference  between $15 and 2 cents.   One of my first accomplishments in Congress under President George  Herbert Bush, the first President Bush, was to see the NGPA repealed.  The Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 was repealed, and it was my  amendment that did that. So I was very proud of that.   Rock along a few more years, and in 2005, I was chairman of the  Agriculture Committee, and we were doing a major energy bill, the  Natural Gas Policy Act of 2005. We did a lot of things in that bill. We  felt at that time that there was going to be a shortage of natural gas  in this country. Some of the States, States like Massachusetts,  California, and New York, were trying to prohibit import terminals for  natural gas, for liquefied natural gas, LNG, being built. The States  would not give the permits.   So in the infinite wisdom of the Congress, we passed, as a part of  the Energy Policy Act of 2005, a section, an amendment to the bill,  that gave ultimate decisionmaking authority to the Federal Energy  Regulatory Commission, or FERC. Because we thought we were going to  need to build these import terminals to import natural gas and the  States were going to try to thwart it, we required a consultation with  the States. The States had to be involved in the process, but the  ultimate decision would be made by the Federal Government under the  auspices of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.   A funny thing happened, Mr. Speaker. Some oil producers and gas  producers down in Texas--one of them was a Texas Aggie, a guy named  George Mitchell--decided that you had all these shale formations, and  there were hydrocarbons in them, but they were like rock. Literally, if  you look at a core sample of some of these shale formations, which you  all had mentioned today in this Special Order, it is just like solid-- it is solid rock.   George Mitchell and others decided, by golly, we can get natural gas  out of that if we fracture the rock under pressure and create tiny  little cracks where natural gas can escape from. Come to find out it  worked. Then they also decided: Do you know what? Instead of drilling  the classic vertical well, what if we bent the drill bit at a 90-degree  angle and drilled horizontally?   Son of a gun if that didn't work too.   So the combination of hydraulic fracturing with horizontal drilling  made all of these shale formations economic, and the result was an  absolute bonanza of natural gas available at economically recoverable  prices in the United States of America.   Congressman Johnson has mentioned some of the formations up in his  part of the country, the Marcellus and the Utica. Of course, Mr. Olson  talked about the Eagle Ford shale down in Texas, the Barnett shale in  my part of Texas. All over this country--Pennsylvania, even in New  York, California, Colorado, Texas, New Mexico, Louisiana, Arkansas,  Ohio, and Kansas--there are shale formations--literally almost  everywhere in the United States--and in most of those shale formations,  it is economically recoverable  [[Page H5353]]  to drill for natural gas--and in some cases for oil also--but tonight  we are talking about natural gas.   Funny things happened. We didn't need to import natural gas. We had  so much of it, we could export it. We used that provision we put in the  Energy Policy Act of 2005 to begin to license, not import terminals but  export terminals. Congressman Olson, Congressman Johnson, and Chairman  Walden have talked--and I am sure Mr. Bucshon and Mr. Duncan will talk  later--about the economic consequences of that. We are exporting or  going to export about 2 billion cubic feet a day this year of liquified  natural gas.   We are going to quadruple that in the next few years. If you look at  the economic value of that, if you assume that you are selling it  overseas about $4 per 1,000 cubic feet, this year we will export three- quarters of a trillion dollars--a trillion dollars is a thousand  billion. And not in the near future, we are going to be exporting  several trillion dollars worth of natural gas every year, hundreds of  thousands of jobs, just an economic--I don't know what you would call  it--a bonanza. It is not a windfall because it is not luck. It is hard  work. It is American ingenuity and American technology. It is  revolutionizing the energy markets.   As has been pointed out, we are also beginning to export oil as a  consequence of the ban being repealed for crude oil exports. That is a  story for another Special Order.   The future for natural gas in this country as a source of fuel is  unlimited. The economic benefits are obvious, but there is another  benefit, and it is the ability to export freedom. When we export our  natural gas, in many cases we are exchanging the source of the supply  from a totalitarian--not quite totalitarian, but certainly not a  totally democratic country like Russia--with a free country like the  United States.   Now, it has been mentioned that Qatar, Algeria, and Saudi Arabia are  also large exporters of natural gas, and they are allies of the United  States, friends of the United States. But they don't have, as of yet,  the purely democratic institutions, the totally free markets, and the  free market capitalistic system that we have here.   So when we send our natural gas overseas, we are also sending to the  countries that use it, economic, and in some cases, political freedom.  They cannot be held hostage to sources of supply that don't have the  same democratic values that we do.   So, as Congressman Johnson pointed out earlier, the World Natural Gas  Conference is here in Washington next week. A number of us will  participate in that conference. It is really a tribute to the natural  gas industry in the United States that they have used the American  innovative spirit and American technology to create a product which  brings benefits economically not only here but overseas, and it really  helps, in my opinion, put freedom in the driver's seat.   So this is a great Special Order.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Congressman Olson for leading it and the  other members of the Energy and Commerce Committee for participating. I  am proud to be a part of this group.
