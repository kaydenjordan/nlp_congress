 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss the importance of  treating immigrants in a humane way.   In a hearing in the Homeland Security Committee recently, we  discussed an incredibly offensive collector's coin called a challenge  coin being sold online.   It depicted a Border Patrol agent on horseback chasing a Black  Haitian migrant with a whip. The coin celebrated the incident, and it  was claimed to be circulating with Border Patrol agents.   It disgusted almost everyone in the hearing, except for a prominent  MAGA Republican who laughed about it. No one should find the abusive  treatment of human beings funny.   It is a national embarrassment. These migrants are trying to better  their lives and the lives of their families.   We need to have an effective immigration policy in this country, but  we also need to make sure all migrants, regardless of status, are  treated humanely and fairly.                            ____________________
