 Madam Speaker, I rise today in solemn memory of  Ms. Mimi Cusick, a public servant, devoted mother, and larger-than-life  figure in Staten Island politics for the past five decades.   Ms. Cusick passed away on January 5, but she leaves behind a powerful  legacy in my community.   Ms. Cusick encouraged women to get involved in politics. A lifelong  Staten Islander, she expressed a passion for politics at a young age  and worked her way up as a behind-the-scenes force in the Staten Island  Democratic Party.   And even though she was a legend among Democrats on Staten Island,  Ms. Cusick never hesitated to invite friends and neighbors of all  political stripes into her home after great events like the island's  St. Patrick's Day Parade.   After her children left for college, she just couldn't give up  serving her community. No, Ms. Cusick worked as a school safety officer  at P.S. 30 and P.S. 22 for 20 years.   Staten Island and all of New York City are going to miss Ms. Cusick's  generosity of spirit, her devotion to public service, and her passion  for civic engagement.   Madam Speaker, may Ms. Cusick rest in peace. She will be incredibly,  incredibly missed, but we will honor her legacy for all time to come.                            ____________________
