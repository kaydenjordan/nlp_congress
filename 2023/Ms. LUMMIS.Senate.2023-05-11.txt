 Mr. President, later today, we will be voting on  legislation I introduced with 20 of our colleagues, S.J. Res. 23. This  resolution rescinds the Biden administration's 2022 rule that rolled  back a commonsense and necessary definition of ``habitat'' under the  Endangered Species Act from the previous administration.   When Congress passed the Endangered Species Act, it granted the  Secretaries of the Interior and Commerce, through the Fish and Wildlife  Service and the National Marine Fisheries Service, respectively, the  authority to  [[Page S1613]]  designate areas as ``critical habitat.'' Section 7 of the Act prohibits  the ``destruction or adverse modification'' of these critical habitat  designations.   There is no doubt that habitat loss is a contributing factor to  species' declines, so protecting habitat that is necessary to the  survival of species is appropriate. The problem that has arisen,  however, is that these designations have, on occasion, been weaponized  to the detriment of landowners, the American public, and the very  species we are trying to protect.    Two-thirds of all endangered species are located on private lands.  For these species to be recovered, private landowners must be part of  the solution and not treated as the enemy. Unfortunately, through  aggressive critical habitat designations, as well-intentioned as they  might be, private landowners are penalized and harmed instead of  incentivized to help with species recovery.   A recent study that examined more than 13,000 real estate  transactions for land within or near critical habitat for two listed  species in California found that a designation ``resulted in a large  and statistically significant decrease in land value,'' specifically 48  percent for the red-legged frog and at least 78 percent for the Bay  checkerspot butterfly.   This is true across the country. Let me tell you a story from  Louisiana.   In 2001, the Fish and Wildlife Service listed the dusky gopher frog  as an endangered species. After litigation by the Center for Biological  Diversity, in 2010, the Service proposed to designate critical habitat  for the species and included 1,544 acres on a Louisiana site owned by  Weyerhaeuser Company and a group of family landowners. The Service  included the site even though the frog was last seen there in 1965.   Additionally, the site would require substantial modification to  support a sustainable population. According to the Service's own  report, designation of the site could cost the landowners nearly $34  million in lost development value. Weyerhaeuser sued the Fish and  Wildlife Service over the designation, arguing, among other things,  that the site could not be critical habitat because the frog, which did  not exist at the site, could not survive there without the site's being  transformed from a closed canopy timber plantation to an open canopy,  longleaf pine forest. In other words, their land could not be critical  habitat for the frog because it was not habitat at all.   In a unanimous 8 to 0 decision in 2018, the Supreme Court agreed. It  said the ESA ``does not authorize the Secretary to designate an area as  critical habitat unless it is also habitat for the species.''   Now, the problem is that the term ``habitat'' itself is not defined  within the Endangered Species Act. Prompted by that unanimous  Weyerhaeuser Supreme Court case, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service  finalized a rule in 2020 that defined the word ``habitat'' for the  purposes of designating ``critical habitat'' under the ESA.   The definition is simple: Habitat is an area that ``currently or  periodically contains the resources and conditions necessary to support  one or more life process of a species.''   It seems pretty reasonable.   In 2022, the Biden administration caved to radical groups that wanted  to return to free-for-all designations and finalized a rule to rescind  this very reasonable, commonsense definition.   So we are now operating under an ad hoc system that creates decreased  property values and predatory legal challenges for American families  and businesses. In fact, it incentivizes landowners to make sure that  their land could never be habitat for threatened or endangered species.   With the Trump-era rule rescinded, there is no regulation to bind  Federal Agencies in determining the habitat of an endangered species  from which critical habitat can be designated. Without the certainty of  what ``habitat'' actually means, the development of any type can be  blocked, including necessary infrastructure projects that the majority  of this body recently spent hundreds of billions of taxpayer dollars to  support.   It is for this reason that a huge group of outside groups endorsed  this resolution, including the American Road & Transportation Builders  Association, the American Farm Bureau, the National Water Resources  Association, the National Association of Counties, the Public Lands  Council, the National Association of Home Builders, and many others.   In closing, the only way to recover endangered species is to enlist  the help of private landowners in our efforts. Overly broad critical  habitat designations do just the opposite. My friends across the aisle  have argued these designations are necessary for species recovery. The  facts simply don't back this up. Among the 60 species still listed from  the ESA because of recovery as of July 2020, 51 of them never even had  critical habitat designations.   By lowering private landowner opposition to conservation efforts,  which will happen if we pass this rule, our Nation can help recover  threatened and endangered species while simultaneously supporting our  private landowners and public land users in their worthy goals of  providing food, energy, jobs, and homes necessary for the survival of  our own species.   I urge my colleagues to vote yes in support of this resolution.   I yield the floor.                             Vote on S.J. Res. 23
