 Madam Speaker, it is a great honor to be able to recognize  Gunnery Sergeant Henry Baul, the fifth African American marine in the  Nation to be inducted into the U.S. Marine Corps in 1942 following  President Franklin Roosevelt's Executive Order 8802, which ended  discrimination in the Armed Forces.   Although the executive order may have intended to end all  discrimination, it did not end segregation. Between 1942 and 1949,  approximately 20,000 Black marines trained at a segregated facility  named Camp Montford Point, New River, Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune in  North Carolina. The Montford Point Marines is derived from the name of  the facility, and Mr. Baul trained there.   In 2011, President Barack Obama and the 112th Congress passed  legislation to award the Congressional Gold Medal to Montford Point  Marines at a special ceremony here at the U.S. Capitol and at the  Marine Barracks here in D.C.   Mr. Baul, age 96, is a resident of the city of Detroit. He is also  the founder and president emeritus of Montford Point Marines of  America, Inc., a nonprofit organization.   I am proud to recognize Mr. Baul and his work and service. Mr. Baul  and so many others decided to serve our country even in the face of  adversity and discrimination right here at home.   Today I lift up the veterans across the 13th Congressional District  in Michigan in recognition of their service and commitment.                            ____________________
