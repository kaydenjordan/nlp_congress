 Mr. Speaker, I rise to highlight the historic  investments that Ways and Means Democrats have secured in the Build  Back Better Act.   For years, Americans have seen their cost of living rise while my  colleagues across the aisle focused on tax cuts for the wealthy and the  well-connected. At long last, with Democrats in the majority, Congress  is delivering the change that our constituents deserve.   As we rebound from the pandemic, I am very proud that the Build Back  Better Act includes my bills to cap out-of-pocket drug costs for  seniors, lower healthcare premiums for working students, and improve  wages, benefits, and training for workers at nursing homes and  hospitals.   I also want to acknowledge the major investments in our clean energy  future. To tackle the climate crisis and create good union jobs, the  Build Back Better Act includes my bills to invest in clean energy  transmission and incentivize production of dynamic glass.   The Build Back Better Act will pay for itself, create millions of  good-paying jobs, and lower costs for our families. And critically,  through a $5 billion investment in my bill to prevent community  violence, the Build Back Better Act will keep our communities safe.   Mr. Speaker, I urge this body to pass this bold investment in  America.
