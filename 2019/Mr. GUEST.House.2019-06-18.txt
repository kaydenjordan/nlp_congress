 Mr. Speaker, today I recognize an outstanding athlete from  the State of Mississippi. Jake Mangum is Mississippi State University's  center fielder who has recently led the Bulldog baseball team to its  fourth straight Super Regionals and second straight College World  Series.   Jake ranks fourth on the all-time NCAA hits list with 380 hits.  During the regular season, Mangum earned a 375 batting average, scored  65 runs, and totaled 95 base hits, the most in the Southeastern  Conference. Achievements of this magnitude come only with discipline  and determination, characteristics that all Americans should strive to  promote in their everyday lives.   I would like to congratulate Jake on this impressive accomplishment  and thank him for 4 great years at Mississippi State.   I wish him and the Bulldogs the best of luck in Omaha.   Hail State.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the Committee on  the Judiciary be discharged from further consideration of H.R. 962, the  Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, and ask for its immediate  consideration in the House.    Mr. Speaker, I urge the Speaker to immediately reschedule  this important bill.
