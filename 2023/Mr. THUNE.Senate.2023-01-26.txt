 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, 2023 will be a big year on the  agriculture front as we work to draft the next farm bill.   Farm bills are always a major priority for me given the essential  place agriculture holds in South Dakota, and I have been gearing up now  for the 2023 farm bill since last year when I began holding a series of  roundtables with agriculture producers to hear firsthand what farmers'  and ranchers' priorities are right now and what they need from the 2023  farm bill.   I introduced multiple bills last Congress that I hope to get included  in this year's legislation, including bills to strengthen and improve  the Conservation Reserve Program, and address the needs of South Dakota  livestock producers--and of producers around the country.   Livestock production has long been an integral part of South Dakota's  agriculture heritage, including cattle ranching in our West River  communities; and one of my priorities for this year's farm bill is to  address some of the challenges facing South Dakota's livestock  producers in getting their products to Americans' tables.   The last few years have revealed vulnerabilities in our food supply  chain that have had an outsized impact on livestock producers. Early in  the pandemic, some meat processing plants were temporarily closed, and  these closures led to bottlenecks in processing and delays to process  livestock. The results were supply shortages and empty cases at the  grocery stores--shortages that weren't caused by a shortage of  livestock but by a lack of processing capacity to get meat ready for  sale.   Between processing bottlenecks and meatpacker concentration, it has  become clear that livestock producers need more processing options. One  way we can reduce producers' dependence on the big packers is to expand  smaller meatpackers' processing capacity. That is why I am currently  working to reintroduce my Strengthening Local Processing Act.   My bill would help small processors invest in the infrastructure  necessary to expand their capacity as well as direct Federal dollars to  education and training programs that will bolster the industry's  workforce and build the next generation of meat processors and  butchers.   My bill would also allow more State-inspected meat products to be  sold across State lines, which would open up new markets for small meat  processors and the farmers and ranchers who supply them.   If there is one thing that can be said for sure about South Dakotans,  it is that we take our beef seriously. With almost 14,000 beef  operations and 3.8 million head of cattle in our State, it is safe to  say cattle production is alive and well in South Dakota and helping to  fill dinner plates all across America.   And something I consistently hear from folks around the State is that  we need to reform our beef labeling system. South Dakotans, like many  Americans, simply want to know where their food--and their beef, in  particular--is coming from. And that can be pretty hard to do under our  current system. Under our current system, beef that is neither born nor  raised in the United States but is simply finished here can be labeled  ``Product of the U.S.A.,'' even if the only American thing about the  beef is the plastic it is wrapped in--if that.   This is unfair to American cattle producers, and it is misleading to  consumers. Congress has repeatedly tried to address this issue in the  past. The 2002 and 2008 farm bills included mandatory country-of-origin  labeling for beef, but the World Trade Organization ruled against the  United States, and Congress ultimately repealed this requirement, which  I opposed.   But that doesn't mean we should give up on transparency and labeling.  That is why this week I reintroduced my bipartisan American Beef  Labeling Act to require the U.S. Trade Representative to develop a  World Trade Organization-compliant means of reinstating mandatory  country-of-origin labeling for beef.   When you see a label on your beef, you should be able to trust that  it means what it says. And I plan to get my American Beef Labeling Act  included in the 2023 farm bill so that consumers can be confident that  any beef labeled ``Product of the U.S.A.'' really came from American  cattle producers.   Whether it is a farm bill year or not, South Dakota farmers and  ranchers are always at the top of my mind here in the Senate. As a  longtime Member of the Senate Agriculture Committee, I am fortunate to  have a platform that  [[Page S110]]  allows me to address the needs of South Dakota ag producers. And I am  looking forward to working with my colleagues on the Ag Committee and  in the Senate as a whole to deliver a farm bill that addresses the  challenges facing South Dakota farmers and ranchers and farmers and  ranchers around the country.   Agriculture is a tough industry. It is backbreaking work in all  weather, living with the constant risk that a storm or a drought or an  early freeze can wipe out herds or crops--sometimes in an instant. Then  add market fluctuations, processing, transportation challenges, and our  current inflation crisis--it is not an easy life.   But despite its many challenges, it is a proud tradition. And through  it all, our Nation's farmers and ranchers persevere. I am proud to  represent South Dakota's farmers and ranchers here in the U.S. Senate.  I will do everything I can to ensure that this year's farm bill meets  their needs and does everything it can to make their life a little  easier so that they can continue to feed our Nation and the world.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator  from South Carolina (Mr. Graham), the Senator from Wisconsin (Mr.  Johnson), the Senator from Kansas (Mr. Moran), the Senator from  Kentucky (Mr. Paul), and the Senator from Ohio (Mr. Vance).   Further, if present and voting, the Senator from South Carolina (Mr.  Graham) would have voted ``yea'' and the Senator from Ohio (Mr. Vance)  would have voted ``yea.''   The result was announced--yeas 94, nays 0, as follows:                         [Rollcall Vote No. 2 Leg.]                                  YEAS--94       Baldwin      Barrasso      Bennet      Blackburn      Blumenthal      Booker      Boozman      Braun      Britt      Brown      Budd      Cantwell      Capito      Cardin      Carper      Casey      Cassidy      Collins      Coons      Cornyn      Cortez Masto      Cotton      Cramer      Crapo      Cruz      Daines      Duckworth      Durbin      Ernst      Fetterman      Fischer      Gillibrand      Grassley      Hagerty      Hassan      Hawley      Heinrich      Hickenlooper      Hirono      Hoeven      Hyde-Smith      Kaine      Kelly      Kennedy      King      Klobuchar      Lankford      Lee      Lujan      Lummis      Manchin      Markey      Marshall      McConnell      Menendez      Merkley      Mullin      Murkowski      Murphy      Murray      Ossoff      Padilla      Peters      Reed      Ricketts      Risch      Romney      Rosen      Rounds      Rubio      Sanders      Schatz      Schmitt      Schumer      Scott (FL)      Scott (SC)      Shaheen      Sinema      Smith      Stabenow      Sullivan      Tester      Thune      Tillis      Tuberville      Van Hollen      Warner      Warnock      Warren      Welch      Whitehouse      Wicker      Wyden      Young                               NOT VOTING--6       Feinstein      Graham      Johnson      Moran      Paul      Vance   The resolution (S.
