 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in praise of this legislation  as the House prepares to pass the CHIPS and Science Act, a bipartisan,  bicameral bill that will well-equip our Nation to meet and beat the  challenges of the 21st century.   With the monumental investments in this legislation, we take key  steps to strengthen our families' and our Nation's economic future,  remove roadblocks to developing scientific talent, and unleash research  investment in every corner of America now and for generations to come.   Let us salute the outstanding leadership of the House negotiators who  tirelessly fought for and secured many major victories for American  families and the American economy in this package.   Thank you, in particular, to two terrific champions: Chairwoman Eddie  Bernice Johnson of the Science, Space, and Technology Committee,  Chairman Frank Pallone of the Energy and Commerce Committee, as well as  other chairs who were involved in this legislation. I also acknowledge  the leadership of the ranking member, Mr. Lucas. It was a joy and  inspiring to behold Mr. Lucas' very informative and impressive  presentation in favor of this legislation at the Rules Committee  yesterday. In fact, half a dozen of the bills contained in this  legislation are Republican bills.   I particularly join Mr. Lucas in commending the staff on this and pay  special tribute to Jenn Wickre, who has been remarkable in building  bipartisanship in this legislation. My understanding is that she is  recovering at home. I send her best wishes and prayers for a speedy  recovery, with deep gratitude for her bipartisanship in putting this  legislation together, which you so eloquently supported in the Rules  Committee yesterday.   For generations, America has offered a beacon of excellence in  science, innovation, and engineering. Our research has generated  ground-changing discoveries. Our industry has powered unprecedented  prosperity. Our technology has altered the course of history. And our  workforce has been the envy of the world. I am so happy that in this  legislation up to 100,000 Davis-Bacon jobs will be created.   In recent years, many other nations have followed our blueprint,  investing in R&D and manufacturing and education. Their rise not only  threatens America's status as the world leader in innovation but also  the economic security of America's families. That is why, with the  landmark legislation that we  [[Page H7376]]  will pass today, we will put America back on the path to preeminence so  that we can compete and win in the 21st century.   When I mention those 100,000 Davis-Bacon jobs, that means a  prevailing wage for our workers. I salute Chairman  Bobby Scott for his  work in that regard.   It is called the CHIPS and Science Act, and I am so happy because a  week ago I thought it was just going to be the CHIPS Act. But,  fortunately, with the help of Mr. Lucas and the negotiations of our  distinguished chair, Eddie Bernice Johnson, we were able to get it to  be the CHIPS and Science Act.   The chips are for now, that is important, ``Make It In America,''  keep us preeminent. The science is about our ongoing preeminence, and  we will talk some more about that.   Again, because of the persistent, patriotic negotiations, the  Congress can take great pride in this result. Eddie Bernice Johnson has  been a respected leader as chair now of the Science, Space, and  Technology Committee, respected in the science and research community  for her ongoing commitment, her knowledge, her vision, her values about  keeping America number one. I thank her.    The package includes more than $50 billion to bolster America's  manufacturing of semiconductors, seizing the pivotal opportunity to  restore our status as world leader in chips, make it in America, as Mr.  Hoyer would say.   Doing so is an economic imperative, creating, again, nearly 100,000  good-paying union jobs and lowering costs for American consumers while  producing a crucial component of nearly every major technology we  enjoy, including the cars we drive: 1,000 in a car, 2,000 in an  electric car.   It is also a national security necessity, reducing our dangerous  dependence on foreign manufacturing, especially amid growing aggression  from the Chinese Communist Party.   Crucially, the bill contains strong guardrails, ensuring these  transformative investments go straight into the American economy, not  into stock buybacks or dividends or into facilities overseas.   Mr. Speaker, just as importantly, this legislation will reinvigorate  American innovation nationwide with robust investments in research and  technology.   This bill takes a giant leap toward building a more diverse and  inclusive STEM workforce so that our Nation's brightest minds--wherever  they are in whatever communities ethnically, geographically,  generationally--are solving problems with science and driving American  entrepreneurship.   This bill delivers job-creating hubs in every corner across the  country so that more communities can participate in research and  development, and this bill empowers our Nation to push the boundaries  of science with investments that power America's preeminence in both  basic research and next-generation technologies.   In doing so, we ensure America's dominance in the industries of the  future for decades to come.                                time  1315    Mr. Speaker, let me be clear: This legislation is a resounding  victory for the American people. Indeed, the final package contains a  number of key provisions from our America COMPETES Act, on the  Democratic side, which were not included in the Senate bill.   It was House Democrats who secured ironclad guardrails on the chips  investments so that the Federal funding benefits American workers and  interests, not our competitors overseas.   It was House Democrats who delivered historic funding to transform  our Nation's research capacity, powering decades of discovery at the  National Science Foundation, Department of Energy, and National  Institute of Standards and Technology.   It was House Democrats who won smart, strategic investments in our  clean energy and industries of the future, supporting renewable energy,  combating the climate crisis, and developing cutting-edge technologies.   It was House Democrats who fought to broaden participation in the  innovation economy, building a STEM workforce that better reflects the  beautiful diversity of our Nation while bringing RECOMPETE grants-- thank you, Mr. Kilmer--to persistently distressed communities across  the Nation. I thank our distinguished chairwoman, Eddie Bernice  Johnson, for making so much of that possible.   Throughout the process of crafting the CHIPS and Science Act, the  Congress has approached this work with a proud bipartisan spirit, as  was witnessed by Mr. Lucas' beautiful presentation to the Committee on  Rules yesterday.   This legislation was assembled with input from negotiators from both  sides of the aisle and both ends of the Capitol. It was the product of  the committees. In the Senate, the bill earned 14 Republican Senators'  votes for final passage.   Here in the House, the America COMPETES Act was rooted in bipartisan  bills with broad support in the Congress and the country. As I  mentioned, six intact Republican bills are part of this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, this vital legislation will pass today. It will pass. It  would be my hope that it will pass with the broad bipartisan vote that  America needs and America deserves.   As we send this landmark legislation to President Biden's desk, we  participate in a great American tradition. In one of his final  speeches, President John Kennedy addressed the National Academy of  Sciences, where he delivered a powerful case for science as our North  Star. His words have stood the test of time. He said: ``I believe that  the power of science and the responsibility of science have offered  mankind a new opportunity not only for intellectual growth, but for  moral discipline; not only for the acquisition of knowledge, but for  the strengthening of our nerve and our will.''   He knew then, and we know now, science serves as our nerve and our  will to boldly seize the opportunities and tackle the challenges of our  time.   With this legislation, President Biden and the Democratic Congress-- and I would hope in a bipartisan way--proudly charge ahead in this all- American spirit with science, science, science, and science leading the  way.   People say to me, ``Well, science or faith?'' I say I believe that  science is an answer to our prayers.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a strong and bipartisan vote for the CHIPS and  Science Act. I thank all who are involved in this, including Mr. Lucas  and our distinguished chair, other chairs on both sides of the Capitol,  and Members on both sides of the aisle. I urge an ``aye'' vote.
