 Madam Speaker, I would like to address the COVID  pandemic. A lot of people are kind of bored and tired of hearing about  it, but with 2,000 lives lost a day, we shouldn't keep our eye off the  ball.   It seems to be most of the focus or time spent is on masks,  government shutdowns, and vaccines. But some doctors in my district  feel that the treatment, once people get to the hospital, is to blame.  I hope our special committee looks at the treatment people get in the  hospital, analyzing remdesivir and its cost of well over $3,000 a day,  to ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine, together with the shortage of  monoclonal antibodies.   Doctors in my district feel tens of thousands, if not hundreds of  thousands, of lives could be saved if people were given something else  once they got in the hospital. And just because that may not be as sexy  or interesting, I think it is something our special subcommittee ought  to take up and see if they can save some lives. It might take some  standing up to the pharmaceutical industry.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.  Much of the police hatred that we get stems from horribly divisive  politicians like President Biden, who claim that Black children must be  taught to tolerate racist abuse from police just to make it home.   President Obama also had quotes encouraging police hatred by  screaming racism. Let's look at the facts as pointed out by Heather Mac  Donald in an excellent article in The Wall Street Journal. Sadly,  groups who are involved in crime are more likely to get in  confrontations with police. Fifty-three percent of homicide offenders  in America and 60 percent of robberies are committed by the same  demographic that Black Lives Matter purports to help. Study after study  after study analyzing the statistics shows no racism.    Other studies show that Black and Brown policemen are more likely to  shoot suspects than White officers, also inconsistent with the racial  narrative.   You might say why discuss this issue? Who cares if we lie and tear  down the police? I suggest that the Congressmen around here all make an  effort to do a ride-along with the police. See what great, selfless  human beings they are before you scream racism without cause.   Furthermore, police are human, and when you keep calling police  racists, I think sometimes police have a tendency to back off and  become less assertive. And that is one of the major reasons a big city  near me, the city of Milwaukee, for 2 years in a row we have had  massive, record numbers of homicides in the city. That is what happens  when the police become cowed and less effective.   It has resulted, I think, in dozens of murders in Milwaukee that  would not have happened without the racist antipolice groups. And by  groups, I point out, not only politicians, but the NFL has encouraged  police dislike with their Black Lives Matter support in the stadiums.  Stand up to the cheap politicians tearing down the police. Stand up to  the billionaires who own the NFL and fan the flames of anti-race  feelings, and stand with the police of America who are doing a  tremendous job.
