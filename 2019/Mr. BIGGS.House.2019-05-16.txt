 Mr. Speaker, yesterday I introduced the Abortion Is Not  Health Care Act. This bill amends the Internal Revenue Service's  treatment of out-of-pocket abortion costs as a medical expense.   This bill was drafted after receiving feedback from my constituents  that they no longer wanted their tax dollars to support the abortion  industry.   It is unfathomable to me that my Democratic colleagues in Congress  continue to not only condone the practice of abortion but allow  taxpayer dollars to subsidize this abhorrent practice.   For years, the pro-abortion movement has marketed abortion as a form  of reproductive healthcare, but it is time for us to be honest with  ourselves. Healthcare is primarily a restorative function, one that  helps our bodies and minds to heal from disease or ailment.   Under no circumstances should healthcare include the intentional  taking of life.   The Abortion Is Not Health Care Act is a small step towards ending  the Federal Government's treatment of abortion as a healing medical  practice.   I am happy that several of my colleagues and many pro-life groups,  including March for Life, Family Research Council, Eagle Forum, Center  for Arizona Policy, Arizona Right to Life, and others have endorsed  this bill.   As Members of Congress, we have a duty to protect life.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to uphold the call for human  dignity at all stages of life, including while still in the womb, and  support the Abortion is Not Health Care Act.                            ____________________
