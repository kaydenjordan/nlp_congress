 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chair of the Appropriations  Committee for her hard work.   This is an opportunity for me to speak on behalf of my amendment  concerning the toxic chemical from tires, yes, the tires on cars,  trucks, and vehicles, that has a chemical that is killing coho salmon.   I thank also Representatives Kilmer and Schrier for their support of  this amendment and to the combined Washington State University and  University of Washington research team for their work on this critical  issue.   Late last year, this team found that a toxic chemical called 6PPD- quinone runs off roadways and into streams when it rains, entering the  bloodstream of coho salmon and killing them.   Salmon are fundamental to the Pacific northwest culture and  especially for our Native American Tribes. David Troutt, the Director  of National Resources for the Nisqually Indian Tribe has said, ``In  1987, we were fishing 105 days a year. As of 2015, that number has  reduced to 8 days a year, and if the coho population continues to  decline, I am afraid 8 days will go down to no days, disconnecting our  community from the place they have been for 10,000 years.''   It is time for us to robustly fund research into this issue today. By  supporting my amendment, we are sending a message, that Congress is  committed to funding research at the scale to address it.
