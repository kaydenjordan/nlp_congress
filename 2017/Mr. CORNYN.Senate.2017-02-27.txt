Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.    Madam President, it has been since January 20 when  President Trump was inaugurated that we have been trying to get his  Cabinet choices confirmed here in the Senate. Unfortunately, it has  been slow-walked to the point now that tonight we are going to be  voting on the President's nominee to lead the Commerce Department, Mr.  Wilbur Ross. I am grateful to Mr. Ross for wanting to serve the country  in this way. I think President Trump has chosen wisely as to the  Commerce Secretary.   One of the things President Trump said Mr. Ross will do is enter into  the negotiation process on NAFTA, the North American Free-Trade  Agreement. In my part of the world, in Texas, NAFTA is viewed  positively; it is not a dirty word.   Some people have suggested that trade somehow has a negative impact  on our economy, but I believe the evidence is to the contrary. As a  matter of fact, just between Mexico and the United States--5 million  jobs depend on binational trade between Mexico and the United States. I  know from time to time we have differences of views with Mexico. I saw  that Secretary Kelly and Secretary Tillerson were in Mexico City on  Wednesday talking about some of those differences but reassuring our  Mexican counterparts of our sincerity and good will in trying to work  through those. But the fact is, we share a common border with Mexico.  What happens in Mexico has an impact on the economy and public safety  in the United States and vice versa.   So I am actually grateful for the conversation I have had with the  Secretary of Commerce nominee, Wilbur Ross and that he is interested in  updating NAFTA, the North American Free-Trade Agreement, rather than  throwing the baby out with the bath water. I think that is a positive  approach and one that I certainly support.   We have a lot more Cabinet posts that remain vacant in the executive  branch because our friends across the aisle have decided that somehow  serves their political interests. But it does not serve the public's  interests and it does not serve the country's interests to have a  brandnew administration without the ability of the President to pick  and choose the people he wants to help him govern the country. It  creates more problems, and it also prevents us from getting on with the  other important business of the Congress and working together with this  President to try to move the country forward in so many important ways.   I am glad we will actually consider Congressman Zinke's nomination  for the Department of Interior later this evening, but we are going to  have to go through this arduous process, this procedural process of  cloture and postcloture time-burning before we can actually vote on  this qualified nominee. I have said before that by holding up these  qualified nominees, they are not only preventing the executive branch  from working for the benefit of the American people, but they are also  keeping us from our other job. After we get out of the personnel  business, we need to get about the business of legislating and  producing results for the American people. So I hope that at some point  and at some point soon, our Democratic friends will let us move on from  the confirmation process and get down to work where we can make that  progress.
