 Mr. President, today I wish to discuss the importance of  the Justice Department's independent investigation into Russia's  interference in the 2016 Presidential election.   The interference with our election process by a hostile government  was an attack on our democracy and a threat to our national security,  carried out by Russian operatives at the direction of Vladimir Putin  himself. As the intelligence community's unclassified report concluded,  ``We assess Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an influence  campaign in 2016 aimed at the U.S. presidential election. Russia's  goals were to undermine public faith in the U.S. democratic process,  denigrate Secretary Clinton, and harm her electability and potential  presidency. We further assess Putin and the Russian Government  developed a clear preference for President-elect Trump.''   Since Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein appointed Robert Mueller  as special counsel to investigate Russia's attack, 32 indictments have  been returned in connection with the investigation, including  indictments against Russian individuals and companies, as well as  former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort and deputy campaign manager  Rick Gates, who were charged with ``conspiracy against the United  States.'' Mr. Mueller has also secured guilty pleas from other campaign  advisers, including George Papadopoulos and Michael Flynn.   Despite this ample evidence of wrongdoing, the President has  attempted to impede the Russia probe every step of the way, falsely  branding it a ``witch hunt.'' So far, the Mueller investigation has  continued to produce results, despite these attacks. We must be clear  that any attempt to remove special counsel Robert Mueller or Deputy  Attorney General Rod Rosenstein would take our Nation into uncharted  territory. I am disturbed that, last week, a group of the President's  allies in the House of Representatives filed unwarranted articles of  impeachment against Mr. Rosenstein, who has worked to uphold the rule  of law and ensure that the independent Russia investigation can  continue.   Both Mr. Rosenstein and Mr. Mueller have admirable records of public  service. Mr. Mueller, whose qualifications, experience, and character I  have previously detailed on the floor, was a decorated hero of the  Vietnam war, a U.S. Attorney, and a widely respected director of the  FBI. There is no one better equipped to lead the Russia probe.   Mr. Rosenstein, like Mr. Mueller, also has a long and distinguished  career in public service. A native of Philadelphia, Mr. Rosenstein  graduated from the Wharton School and Harvard Law School, after which  he clerked for Judge Douglas Ginsburg of the U.S. Court of Appeals for  the District of Columbia Circuit.   He initially joined the Department of Justice nearly 30 years ago  through the Attorney General's Honors Program. He started as a trial  attorney with the Public Integrity Section of the Criminal Division,  prosecuting public corruption cases. Mr. Rosenstein rose through the  ranks, serving as counsel to the Deputy Attorney General; special  assistant to the Assistant Attorney General in the Criminal Division;  associate independent counsel in the Office of the Independent Counsel;  and assistant U.S. attorney in Maryland. He was recognized for his work  at the Department of Justice with a 1993 ``Commendation Award'' from  the Criminal Division, a 1994 ``Outstanding Contribution to Justice''  award from the Office of the Deputy Attorney General, and a 1997  ``Appreciation Award'' from the Criminal Division's Public Integrity  Section.   In 2001, he became Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General for  the Tax Division, where he supervised the criminal sections,  coordinated tax enforcement activities, and oversaw civil litigation.  Then, in 2005, he returned to the Maryland U.S. attorney's office, this  time as the top Federal prosecutor. He served as U.S. Attorney for over  a decade, until he was nominated to become Deputy Attorney General in  2017. His nomination to this critically important post, at a critically  important time for our Nation, was approved overwhelmingly by this  body, by a vote of 94 to 6.   Mr. Rosenstein has a wealth of experience at the Department of  Justice and has served our country and the American public with honor  and distinction since he entered the legal profession. During his many  years at the  [[Page S5512]]  Department of Justice, he has shown his commitment to the rule of law  and the legal process.   At no time could such commitment be more vital. Our rule of law is  under siege from multiple fronts, including from members of this  administration and the President himself.   Rod Rosenstein and Robert Mueller have so far been able to oversee an  independent investigation, but the threat of interference still  remains. Both of these respected public servants have been the target  of vicious and unfounded partisan attacks with no purpose but to  discredit and delegitimize the Russia investigation. These attacks are  not only shameful; they are undemocratic.   We cannot successfully counter foreign threats to our democracy  without holding up our own institutions from within. A fundamental  principle of our democracy--equal justice under law--has been tested by  this President and his advisers since he entered the White House. We,  too, are being tested. As Members of Congress, will we step up as a  coequal branch of government and ensure that there are consequences  when our principles are breached? As Americans, will we hold our public  officials accountable when they work to undermine the democratic values  that define us as a nation?   That is why I call on Leader McConnell to bring the bipartisan  Special Counsel Independence and Integrity Act to the floor for a vote.  It is why I want to emphasize that any interference with this  investigation, whether it is with Mr. Mueller, Mr. Rosenstein, FBI  Director Wray, or any other official at the Department of Justice, is a  line in the sand that must not be crossed. No one--even and especially  the President of the United States--is above the law.                            ____________________
