 Mr. Chair, I thank Chairman Nadler for yielding, and I  also thank Congressman Johnson for this very important bill. I thank  him for his fight on behalf of so many people.   I rise today in strong support of the FAIR Act. This is a bill that  would end the secret arbitration process and the cycle of silencing  victims of predatory behavior.   I first became involved with this fight a couple of years back when  The Washington Post detailed allegations of a chief executive at Jared  and Kay Jewelers who only promoted women who would sleep with him. The  Post shed light on mandatory, alcohol-fueled managers meetings where  dozens of women were demeaned and groped.                                time  1000    As I continued working on this issue, I met with women from the tech  industry who watched in horror as bigwig executives were given  multimillion-dollar exit packages after facing credible allegations of  misconduct. But none of these women were allowed to speak out.   Why? Because they were forced into a secret arbitration process,  losing their right to sue and ensuring their claims would never see the  light of day. And, if they were to speak out publicly, they--they as  the women who were victims of this--could be sued for breaking this  nondisclosure agreement.   This is a practice that is so egregious that the attorneys general in  all 50 of our States have come out against forced arbitration clauses  that are used in cases of sexual misconduct.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to  stand on the side of workers, on the side of fairness and transparency,  and on the side of doing what is right. I urge all of us to support  this piece of legislation.
