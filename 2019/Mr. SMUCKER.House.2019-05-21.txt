 Madam Speaker, I rise today to urge my colleagues to  support the new trade agreement negotiated with Mexico and Canada, or  the USMCA.   My district that I represent, the 11th District of Pennsylvania, is  one of the top ten dairy producing counties in the Nation and is the  number one producing county for egg layers.   One thing that I can tell you about the farmers of the 11th District  is that they adapt, and they hold on to hope that better times are yet  to come. I agree with them: better times are coming for these farmers  because the Trump administration has worked to do right by the American  farmer in negotiating the USMCA.   Under the agreement, Canada would eliminate its price control  systems, which have effectively locked out America's dairy industry.   The agreement also makes improvements for the egg and poultry  industry, with Canada agreeing to increase its quota regimes to allow  for more American eggs and chicken into the market.   The farmers of my district are eagerly calling for the USMCA to be  enacted as soon as possible, and I join them today in that call. I am  hopeful that we can get there.   That is why I urge the leadership across the aisle to join in  standing up for our Nation's farmers and to allow a vote on the USMCA.  We have a generational opportunity to help American farmers compete and  to thrive. Let's take that opportunity.                       Honoring Warden Cheryl Steberger     Madam Speaker, earlier this month was National  Correctional Officers and Employees Week, and I rise today to recognize  individuals from Lancaster County, who are making a difference  improving criminal justice and public safety in our community.   I would like to recognize Lancaster County Prison Warden Cheryl  Steberger, who has shown exceptional leadership in managing the  Lancaster County Prison. Warden Steberger has substantially improved  the welfare of those repaying their debts to society while in prison  and helped with their transition out of incarceration.   The warden has done so by meticulously following the data with a  program known as Prison Stat. Prison Stat is run in conjunction with  the Lancaster County Prison Board, led by Lancaster County Commissioner  and Chairman Josh Parsons. This program monitors key metrics on the  prison's performance and holds leaders accountable through transparent  and frequent public review of the data.   Their work in Lancaster County has been honored by the National  Association of Counties, who awarded both Commissioner Parsons and  Warden Steberger with the 2018 Achievement in Criminal Justice and  Public Safety Award.   Madam Speaker, we appreciate the work of our correctional officers  and we thank Warden Steberger for her dedication and leadership.                            ____________________
