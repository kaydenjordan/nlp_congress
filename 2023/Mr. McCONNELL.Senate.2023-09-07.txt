 Mr. President, last week, the Biden administration  rolled out the first targets of the scheme it has been working on for  years--prescription drug socialism.   Ironically enough, Washington Democrats' plan to fix prices in the  market for world-leading medical innovations is baked into legislation  they produced after their own runaway spending sent consumer prices  through the roof.   As we know, the Inflation Reduction Act did nothing to reduce  inflation, and by one estimate, the government price controls it  created may well cost the American economy 676,000 jobs.   Before Democrats rammed the IRA through on party lines, the average  net prices for drugs were actually stable or falling, but that didn't  stop the Biden administration from storming ahead with a drug-by-drug  Federal power grab.   So let's be clear about what this means. Companies that don't comply  with the administration's scheme will be forced to pay an unprecedented  and excessive fine or withdraw their products from Medicare coverage,  leaving American seniors with fewer options for lifesaving treatments.  Meanwhile, researchers will have less certainty to dedicate years to  creating the high-quality, consumer-friendly, affordable medications  American industry is known for.   Research from the University of Chicago estimates that prescription  drug socialism will result in 135 fewer new drugs--135 fewer new drugs,  188 fewer new treatments, and a $663 billion drop in innovative  research and development. It will impact 60 percent of cancer  medications on the market today and inevitably freeze innovations on  future treatments.   To make matters worse, limits on price increases will force  manufacturers to launch new drugs at much higher prices to cover future  rising costs and leave many low-income and elderly Americans simply out  of luck.   Price fixing is not some bright new idea cooked up on a liberal  college campus. It is the sort of decrepit socialism that has been  tried with disastrous results in places like China, Cuba, Venezuela,  and the former Soviet Union.   We cannot afford for America's world-leading medical innovators to be  next on the leftwing chopping block, and the millions of Americans  living with rare and aggressive diseases can afford it least of all.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on another matter, the loudest critics  of American assistance to Ukraine tend to rest their case on three  dubious claims: first, that somehow our support for Ukraine is a  distraction--a distraction--from China, when, in fact, there are many  reasons to believe exactly the opposite; second, that there is no  accountability of lethal U.S. assistance when, in fact--in fact--we  have unprecedented visibility into how the weapons and vehicles we are  providing Ukraine are being utilized; and third, that somehow this  whole thing is a zero-sum proposition, that support for Ukraine or  European security comes at the expense of American prosperity and  security, that we are spending too much.   I will discuss each of these faulty arguments in detail in the coming  days, but today I would like to discuss this last one, in particular.  Set aside the fact, recognized by the previous administration's  National Security Strategy, that ``a strong and vital Europe is of  vital importance to the United States.''   Standing with our allies against Putin is directly and measurably  strengthening the U.S. military, growing the U.S. industrial base, and  supporting thousands of good-paying American jobs. The overwhelming  majority of the money that we have appropriated is being spent here in  America, right here in this country. This is especially true for the  security assistance we have appropriated for Ukraine. This assistance  falls into two basic buckets.   The first, smaller portion is for the Ukraine Security Assistance  Initiative--USAI for short. USAI predates the Biden administration. It  was used by the previous administration to enhance Ukraine's military  capabilities.   The second, larger portion isn't even for Ukraine. It is referred to  as ``backfill'' or ``replenishment'' money, and it is used to purchase  new versions of weapons and vehicles to replace the old--sometimes very  old--versions the United States has taken from stockpiles and  warehouses and transferred to Ukraine.   Now, the Biden administration often announces tranches of assistance  as though it is new, direct aid to Ukraine. In fact, it is previously  authorized or appropriated assistance that is only too slowly actually  being disbursed. But, in both cases, the money we are talking about  doesn't go to Ukraine; it goes to defense manufacturing facilities all  across America and supports tens of thousands of American jobs-- expanding our defense industrial capacity to better compete with China,  replenishing America's arsenal with weapons built by American workers.   But don't take my word for it. Just look at where some of these  resources are going. Nearly $1.4 billion is buying the U.S. military  new Javelin anti-tank missiles. These weapons are manufactured at  facilities in Troy, AL; Ocala, FL; Farmington, NM; and Tucson, AZ, that  employ hundreds of thousands of Americans.   Another $3 billion is producing new precision rockets and Patriot  missiles for our military. That work is underway at a plant in Camden,  AR, that employs nearly 1,000 workers. Dozens of suppliers across the  country are doing work to support these high-end weapons.   Hundreds of millions of dollars in new air-to-air weapons systems  bound for the U.S. military are rolling off production lines across the  country--from a Massachusetts facility that employs 400 people to one  in Arizona that employs 14,000. And this work is made possible by  suppliers all across America, including in Iowa, Missouri, Texas,  Florida, Alabama, Utah, and my home State of Kentucky--tens of billions  of dollars directly invested in American military strength, directly  supporting thousands of American jobs, and expanding our defense  industry's capability to produce the weapons needed to deter  adversaries like Russia and China.   Our support to Ukraine is grinding down one of America's biggest  strategic adversaries and showing the other one the strength of our  resolve; and it is providing Western forces, from NATO to Taiwan, with  valuable operational lessons to apply to their own defense.   The value of that to American interests can hardly be measured simply  in dollars or jobs; but critics of this investment cannot ignore its  returns: American industry and workers are stronger for it; our  warfighters are stronger for it; and our Nation is stronger for it.                            ____________________
