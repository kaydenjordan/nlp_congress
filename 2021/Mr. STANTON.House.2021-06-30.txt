 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for his incredible  leadership up to this point and moving forward as we get the INVEST in  America Act passed in this House and soon signed by the President of  the United States.   It is bold. It is transformative. And it is the investment we need  now to compete in the 21st century economy.   Mr. Speaker, this bill includes long-delayed, incredibly important  investments in Arizona's roads, bridges, transit, rail, and water  infrastructure. Arizona will receive more than $5 billion for highways  and almost $1 billion for transit.   Importantly, it supports major Arizona projects: I-11, public transit  in cities big and small, key investments to support local communities,  and improve the way we move people and goods.   It directs significant resources to our long overlooked Tribal  communities throughout the State. It also addresses urgent water needs  in my State by increasing investments in drinking water and wastewater  infrastructure.   Mr. Speaker, the time for action is now, and I urge my colleagues to  support this historic investment in the American people and our  American economy.
