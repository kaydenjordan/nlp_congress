 Madam President, today, I honor the life and work of  Rachelle Bergeron Hammerling, a human rights lawyer who served as the  acting Attorney General of Yap in Micronesia when she was murdered just  a couple of months ago. Rachelle was killed in front of her home on  October 14, 2019, as a direct result of her courageous fight against  human trafficking, domestic violence, and sexual abuse. She was just 33  years old, but her legacy will live on through her family and the  communities she made the ultimate sacrifice to serve.   Rachelle was born in Waukesha, WI, to parents Thomas and Tammy  Bergeron in 1986. After growing up in Wisconsin, Rachelle went on to  obtain a juris doctorate from the University of Florida College of Law  in 2010, an experience her family says she loved.   When Rachelle graduated from law school, her passion to help others  led her to volunteer with the International Justice Mission in India,  where she represented women and children who had been trafficked.  Rachelle spent her career prosecuting criminals involved with sex  trafficking and worked tirelessly to protect the poor against violence.  Rachelle's work took her around the United States, including New York  and Washington, DC. She was a member of the New York State Bar and  created the ``Not-So-Super'' campaign video as an effort to raise  awareness regarding human trafficking during the 2014 Super Bowl. Her  work took her to Beijing, South Africa, India, and finally the Pacific  island of Yap.   Rachelle fought to give a voice to the voiceless and dedicated her  life to empowering and uplifting others. About 4 years ago, Rachelle  moved to Yap after accepting a job as that community's assistant  attorney general. Since January 2019, she had been serving as the  island's only prosecutor and as the acting attorney general, where her  duties included being a part of a human trafficking task force.  Rachelle was very active in the community she served and spent a lot of  time in local schools  [[Page S6946]]  and community centers to warn against the dangers of sex trafficking.   Rachelle also met her husband, Simon Hammerling during her time in  Yap. The two were married in 2018 and had planned to take in a young  girl they had found sleeping on their doorstep. Rachelle passed just  before the two were about to celebrate their 1-year wedding anniversary  and shortly before she and her family were due to move back to the  United States for a new job in Wyoming. Her passing is a tremendous  loss to her family, to the community she fought to serve, and to all  who knew her.   We remember Rachelle with gratitude for her life, and we honor her  for her sacrifice. Scripture tells us that the righteous will rest from  their labor, for their deeds will follow them. As she now rests from  her tireless and courageous work on behalf of the most vulnerable among  us, we know Rachelle's deeds will follow her and continue to inspire  others to pursue justice as fiercely as she did.                            ____________________     Madam President, as the chairman of the Senate  Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, each week I am  privileged to honor an American small business for its dedication to  dignified work and its surrounding community. This week, it is my honor  to recognize Granny Cantrell's Restaurant of Panama City, FL, for its  achievements.   Founded in 2002 by Doug Crosby and his family, Granny Cantrell's is  well known for its delicious southern comfort food and catering. Based  on recipes from friends, neighbors, family, and local churches, Granny  Cantrell's food consists of familiar items such as fried chicken, pot  roast, and macaroni and cheese. Since opening more than 17 years ago,  Granny Cantrell's has experienced success and continued growth. Their  menu has expanded beyond comfort food to offer a variety of daily  specials and health-conscious options. Today, they are an important  part of the Panama City community, attracting and retaining customers  who enjoy their food at the restaurant, as well as at catered events.   Granny Cantrell's dedication to the greater Panama City community is  unmatched. In the days following the landfall of Hurricane Michael in  2018, Granny Cantrell's worked tirelessly with local authorities to  ensure that the city's employees were fed. Additionally, with the help  of likeminded community partners, Granny Cantrell's restaurant was able  to provide and hand-deliver more than 500 prepacked Thanksgiving meals  and 400 cupcakes to those in need after the hurricane. In recent years,  Doug and the Granny Cantrell's team have also opened the restaurant's  doors as a drop-off location for Coats for Kids, a Bay County program  that collects and distributes gently used coats to prepare local  children for the winter. Their dedication to the Florida community,  their fantastic homemade dishes, and exemplary customer service has  certainly not gone unnoticed. For 9 years running, Granny Cantrell's  has been awarded Panama City News Herald's Best of the Bay Award,  highlighting its customers' loyalty and integral place in the local  economy. Furthermore, Granny Cantrell's has been awarded the Reader's  Choice Award by Panama City Living for several years in a row to  commemorate their outstanding food and customer service.   Small businesses play an important role in supporting and uplifting  their communities. Granny Cantrell's is a prime example of the bonds  that small businesses can create when such an integral role is  bolstered. I am proud to recognize this Florida business for its  reflection of America's unique entrepreneurial spirit and its  dedication to the common good of its community. Congratulations to the  entire Granny Cantrell's team. I look forward to watching your  continued success.                            ____________________
