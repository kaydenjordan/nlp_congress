Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so  ordered.    Madam President, out on the campaign trail, Donald Trump  talked a big game about Wall Street. He said: ``Wall Street has caused  tremendous problems for us.'' He claimed that he was not going to let  Wall Street get away with murder.   His closing ad expressed outrage at Wall Street ``controlling the  levers of power in Washington.'' It pictured Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd  Blankfein as part of ``the global special interests that were rigging  the economy against working families.''   Then Trump won, and within days he hired and nominated enough Goldman  Sachs alumni to open a new bank branch in the White House. His senior  strategist, Steve Bannon, spent half a decade at Goldman Sachs as an  investment banker. His National Economic Council Director, Gary Cohn,  came directly from Goldman Sachs, where he spent 25 years and rose to  be second in command at the bank. His Senior Counsel for Economic  Initiatives, Dina Powell, came directly from Goldman Sachs, where she  has been a partner since 2010.   Finally, Donald Trump nominated Steve Mnuchin to serve as his  Secretary of Treasury. Mr. Mnuchin spent 17 years at Goldman Sachs,  much of it in the distribution that created and peddled the kinds of  mortgage-backed securities that would later blow up the financial  system.   Personnel is policy. The selection of all of these Goldman Sachs  executives to serve as core members of Trump's economic team shows that  the President has no interest in reducing Wall Street's influence in  Washington and leveling the playing field for working families.  Instead, it will be the same Republican playbook--gutting the rules for  big banks, firing the cops on Wall Street--the same playbook that paved  the way for the 2008 financial crisis.   But even among the group of Goldman Sachs bankers surrounding the  President, the selection of Mr. Mnuchin as Treasury Secretary stands  out. The Treasury Secretary leads the Council responsible for making  sure Wall Street doesn't blow up our economy again.   The Council cannot do anything without the support of the Treasury  Secretary. No other official has greater responsibility to stand up to  Wall Street if they threaten the economy again. Yet there is nothing-- nothing--in Mr. Mnuchin's record to suggest that he could stand up to  Wall Street. In fact, there is nothing in Mr. Mnuchin's record to  suggest that he would even want to stand up to Wall Street, that he has  even thought of standing up to Wall Street.   Mr. Mnuchin is the ultimate Wall Street insider. From the moment he  graduated from college until today, he has worked at a big bank or a  hedge fund. If Wall Street threatens to blow up the economy again, does  anyone seriously expect Mr. Mnuchin to get tough with his old buddies  and tell them to knock it off?   In fact, you can expect just the opposite. Mr. Mnuchin pretty much  laps the field when it comes to personal experience in tilting the  playing field in favor of financial interests and against working  families. In late 2008, as the financial crisis was sweeping across the  country, Mr. Mnuchin lead a team of millionaires to purchase IndyMac  Bank out of Federal receivership. He rebranded the bank as OneWest and  put himself in charge as CEO. Then, Mr. Mnuchin and OneWest acted  swiftly and decisively to boot more than 60,000 families out of their  homes across the country.   Look, I get it. Foreclosures happen in an economic crisis. But  OneWest, Mr. Mnuchin's bank, was different. It quickly gained a  reputation as a foreclosure machine, both because it was so aggressive  at foreclosing on families and because the bank hardly did anything  else.   Countless homeowners who were trapped by a OneWest mortgage had their  lives turned upside down. Some ended up homeless.    How sleazy and out of line was Mr. Mnuchin's bank? Well, the bank  paid millions of dollars to settle lawsuits for predatory foreclosure  practices. They were so sleazy that they even got hit with almost $3  million in fines for violating the rights of dozens of Active-Duty  servicemembers.  [[Page S1078]]    You really have to ask: What kind of a man does something like that-- cheats our soldiers while they are on Active Duty? The model Mr.  Mnuchin developed for OneWest was terrible for homeowners, but it was  fabulous for him. Six years after buying the bank, he sold it and  reportedly pocketed as much as $200 million in personal profit--$200  million for 6 years of throwing families out of their homes--wow, only  on Wall Street.   Mr. Mnuchin's leadership of OneWest is critical to evaluating his  fitness to serve as Treasury Secretary. That is why I joined 24 other  Democratic Senators in asking Chairman Hatch of the Senate Finance  Committee to include some of Mr. Mnuchin's foreclosure victims as  witnesses at Mr. Mnuchin's hearing.   The chairman refused. So Democrats invited some of those homeowners  to come to the Senate anyway to share their stories at a forum. We  invited every Senator--Democrat or Republican--to attend the forum. We  also invited Mr. Mnuchin to attend. Not one single Republican showed  up--not one. Mr. Mnuchin refused to attend. But Senate Democrats turned  out to listen. The stories that we heard will break your heart.   We heard from Colleen Ison-Hodroff, from Minneapolis, MN. Colleen is  84 years old. She and her husband Monroe got a reverse mortgage on  their fully paid-off home from Financial Freedom, which is a OneWest  subsidiary. At the time, the broker assured them that Colleen could  keep living in her home even if her husband passed away before she did.  But just days--just days--after Monroe's funeral, Mr. Mnuchin's bank  told her she needed to pay off the entire loan or face foreclosure. She  has been fighting them off for 2 years now, but the threat hangs over  her and her family.   Sylvia Oliver from Scotch Plains, NJ, also told us her story. She had  been trying for years to get a loan modification from OneWest. For  years, the bank refused to work with her in good faith. Sylvia choked  up as she described how she felt when her young daughter told her: Mom,  I love our home. She had to smile and look her daughter in the eye, not  knowing whether they could keep that home for more than even a few more  weeks.   We heard from Cristina Clifford, from Carlsbad, CA. Cristina is a  real go-getter, a self-employed small business owner who saved up  enough money to buy her first home soon after she turned 20. When the  financial crisis hit, the income from her business dried up, and she  reached out to Mr. Mnuchin's bank for a modification. But when she sent  in her modification paperwork, along with the check for her first new  payment, she sent them in a single envelope, and Mr. Mnuchin's bank  claimed they had never received the paperwork even though they cashed  the check that was in the same envelope.   Ultimately, Mr. Mnuchin's bank foreclosed on Cristina, just days  after an employee personally had assured her that she could still work  out a modification to keep her home. But she lost her home.   We also heard from Heather McCreary, a mother of twin boys from  Sparks, NV. Like a lot of families, Heather and her husband Jack were  hit hard in the financial crisis. She lost her job as a home health  aide, and Jack, who worked construction, got fewer hours and lower  wages. Heather and Jack applied to OneWest for a modification. They did  everything they were told. But it did not matter to Mr. Mnuchin and his  friends at OneWest.   The bank strung them along for years and then, in the blink of an  eye, foreclosed so abruptly that it literally put Heather, her husband  Jack, and their twin boys out on the street.   All four of these women begged the Senate to reject Mr. Mnuchin's  nomination. Heather said:         Putting Steve Mnuchin in charge of the country's financial       system is an insult to families like mine, families who       worked hard and did everything they could to get by after the       economy collapsed. Take it from my experience, I know he will       not be looking out for working people. Instead, he will use       his position to make the economy work better for people like       himself.    No track record of independence from Wall Street, a history of  profiting off the financial crisis by squeezing working families to the  breaking point--each one of those should be disqualifying to serve as  Treasury Secretary. That should be the end of his nomination. We should  be done with this. But there is more.   During Mr. Mnuchin's nomination process, he flat-out lied to the  Senate. Senator Casey from Pennsylvania asked Mr. Mnuchin a  straightforward factual question about foreclosure abuses at OneWest.  Mr. Mnuchin claimed they did not happen. That is not even a good lie.  Within days, reporters found court documents contradicting Mr.  Mnuchin's claim. You know, something like that should not be a partisan  issue. A person who lies to Congress should not be the country's top  economic official--period, done.   But when Senate Democrats demanded that Mr. Mnuchin come before the  Finance Committee again to account for his statement, Republicans on  the committee unilaterally changed the rules and rammed Mr. Mnuchin's  nomination through without a single Democrat present.   Do Senate Republicans care about Mr. Mnuchin's lies?   The American people should.   If Mr. Mnuchin is willing to lie about something that is so easily  disproved by public court documents, what else is he willing to lie  about? How can Congress or the American people believe him ever again?   We know Mr. Mnuchin has the full support of Wall Street. The big bank  lobbyists, Mr. Mnuchin's hedge fund pals, man, they want to see him  confirmed. They are lobbying hard. They know he will help out his old  buddies and give them all the financial rule rollbacks and sweetheart  deals that they want. What we know is that is usually enough to carry  the day around here.   But me? I am going with Colleen and Heather and Sylvia and Cristina.  I heard what Mr. Mnuchin and his bank did to them and to thousands more  like them in Massachusetts and all across the country. The U.S. Senate  should not reward that kind of sleazy, cruel, and sometimes illegal  conduct by making him the Secretary of Treasury.   We cannot say to the millions of people who lost their homes, who  lost their jobs, who lost their savings during the financial crisis,  that a man like Mr. Mnuchin will be entrusted with the keys to our  Treasury. We cannot say to the American people that someone who lied to  Congress--who lied and didn't even have to come back and explain his  lie--can become a senior Cabinet official.   A lot of people believed Donald Trump when he said he would be tough  on Wall Street. A lot of people voted for him because of that promise.  By hiring half of Goldman Sachs to run the economy, Donald Trump has  made clear he has no intention of keeping his promise. And now, with  the vote on Mr. Mnuchin, the American public will have the chance to  see whether Senate Republicans are serious about keeping Wall Street in  line too.   Don't hold your breath, America. I will be voting no on Mr. Mnuchin's  nomination, and I urge all of my colleagues to do the same.   I want to read some of the stories that we have about Mr. Mnuchin's  time at OneWest. You know, you don't have to take this just from me. I  may be the one speaking here today, but it is the voices of Colleen and  Heather and Sylvia and Cristina and thousands of others whose lives  were ruined by Steve Mnuchin's aggressive foreclosure tactics that  really deserve to be heard.   I have already told you about Colleen Ison-Hodroff, the 84-year-old  woman who is getting cheated out of her home, her home that she lived  in for over 50 years and that was fully paid off. She is getting  cheated out of that home by Steve Mnuchin's bank.   Now what I would like to do is to share her full story in her own  words. This is what she had to say:         My name is Colleen Ison-Hodroff. I am 84 years old. I am a       resident of Minneapolis, Minnesota. My husband Monroe Hodroff       and I purchased our home located at 2753 Ewing Avenue in 1963       as a home for our family of six children. They called us the       Brady Bunch of Ewing Avenue. Our house was the heart and soul       of our family. Monroe and I were married for 55 years, and we       successfully ran four small grocery stores. I would like to       thank you all very much for allowing me to share my story.        I am here today because Financial Freedom, my reverse       mortgage servicer, is trying to foreclose on my home. This is       despite the fact that when my husband Monroe and I took out       this loan, they told us that I could  [[Page S1079]]       remain in the home if Monroe should die before me.        In July of 2006, my husband and I decided to take out a       reverse mortgage loan with Financial Freedom. It was a very       complicated process. Someone came to our house and I was       asked to sign a number of papers. Usually, Monroe handled the       financial matters for our household. We were told that I       could live in the house if Monroe passed away. It was never       Monroe's or my intention that the survivor of the two of us       would have to sell the house or leave if one of us died. We       would not have signed for the loan if we thought that was the       case.        My husband Monroe passed on September 12, 2014. A mere 10       days later, despite what we had been told, Financial Freedom       contacted me and told me that I needed to pay off the loan       immediately. This was news to me. I was in no financial       position to do so. Since then, Financial Freedom has been       trying to foreclose on me. I think this is an injustice in       that an elderly woman was deceived, and now Financial Freedom       is trying to take my home. Why would Financial Freedom do       this to me? I relied on what I was told, and now they are       trying to kick me out of our family home.        How was I supposed to know if what I was told wasn't true?       What am I supposed to do now?        My understanding is that in such circumstances, Financial       Freedom blames HUD for it kicking out Non-Borrowing Spouses.       Experts who have reviewed my paperwork have told me that this       isn't even a HUD-backed loan, so Financial Freedom has no one       to blame but themselves. It seems Financial Freedom should be       working to keep people like me in their homes, and not       fighting to kick us out.        I hear that Steve Mnuchin was a leader of the bank that is       doing this to me and other seniors. I do not think a man like       that should be the Treasury Secretary and in charge of our       economy. We can't let that happen. Thank you again for       allowing me to tell my story on behalf of those who have had       bad dealings with Financial Freedom and OneWest.    Thank you, Colleen. I appreciate you telling your story.   I also talked about Heather McCreary, her husband, and her twin boys,  and how her family was left out on the street because of the greed of  Steve Mnuchin and OneWest Bank.   Heather courageously shared her story with us, and here is what she  said:         My name is Heather McCreary. My husband Jack, my two kids       Jaden and Clara, and I are from Sparks, Nevada. This is my       story about how my family's American Dream turned into a       nightmare. I'm sharing my story with the hope of explaining       why we cannot let Steve Mnuchin become Secretary of the       Treasury. Putting Steve Mnuchin in charge of the Treasury       Department would mean that a man who profited off the       struggles of families like mine would be one of the most       powerful people in the U.S. economy.        For a while, it was looking like our shot at the American       Dream was going pretty well. In 2006, Jack and I bought our       dream home in Sparks--just a mile away from my parents, and a       short walk to Jaden and Clara's school and to parks the kids       could play in. I was working as a home health care worker and       Jack was working in construction, and together we were       managing just fine.        Then, in 2008, when the economy started to get worse, I was       laid off. The following year in 2009, Jack was laid off too.       Though Jack was able to find another job pretty fast, he had       to take a big pay cut--from about $25 an hour to $8.50 an       hour. Between the cut in Jack's pay and the loss in income I       experienced when going on unemployment insurance benefits       after I got laid off, we were pinched and we were drowning       financially. However, we were determined to keep our dream       home, so Jack and I were tenacious about doing whatever we       could to get help. We sought help from the Hope Now Alliance,       which is an alliance of HUD-approved counselors who provide       free foreclosure help, and from the Washoe County Senior Law       Project. We worked side-by-side with both organizations to do       everything required of us by our mortgage servicer IndyMac,       which later became OneWest.        When we first asked for help, OneWest gave us a short       forbearance and allowed us to make a smaller payment for       several months with the goal of a reduction in our monthly       mortgage payments through the Home Affordable Modification       Program (or HAMP). By applying for the HAMP program, we       thought we were back on the road to keeping our home. We       complied 100 percent with OneWest's requirements for HAMP--we       were incredibly nervous about being able to keep our house,       so we were extremely careful to make sure we did everything       we could to keep the process going forward. Our application       for HAMP was processed and we were approved for a       modification. I sent in the signed paperwork and the first       payment under the modified payment amount.        But then the process started to fall apart.        After a whole 30 days, OneWest returned our personal check       and told us that only certified checks would be accepted, so       they were now voiding the modification offer. We had followed       the instructions to the letter on OneWest's paperwork,       crossing our ``T''s and dotting our ``I''s. But in the end,       this didn't matter--and OneWest's rejection of our HAMP       application put us on the road to foreclosure.        We applied two more times for loan modifications over the       next six months because we were given assurances by people at       OneWest that they would approve our application. We again       complied with every request OneWest made of us, taking care       to send in extra documents whenever OneWest requested them.       But as far as I can tell, OneWest never attempted to process       the loan modification.        The foreclosure went through and we lost our home on       September 10, 2010. The foreclosure left us without a home,       and finding a new rental was extremely difficult because of       our credit. Juggling the demands of raising our twins and       this was so hard--the foreclosure even meant that our kids       had to miss school. Eventually we did find a new place, but       we had to pay an outrageous rent--even though it was not a       good home for us at all. It's hard to explain the shame,       embarrassment, and grief that Jack and I felt.        I've cried a river of tears over this. I really didn't       think we were asking too much: we wanted to hang onto our       home for the sake of our kids, and we did everything we could       to stay in our home. And while I will probably never know       exactly what OneWest did, the outcome of my story proves that       Steve Mnuchin's company had no interest in helping us. They       wanted to foreclose because they were focused on their       profits. Putting Steve Mnuchin in charge of the country's       financial system is an insult to families like mine: families       who worked hard and did everything they could to get by after       the economy collapsed.        Take it from my experience--I know he will not be looking       out for working people. Instead, he will use his position to       make the economy work better for people like himself. On       behalf of my family and others like it, I ask you to please       reject Steve Mnuchin as Treasury Secretary.    Thank you, Heather, for sending in your letter. I appreciate it.   And remember Sylvia? She and her family are facing foreclosure later  this month, yet she still came all the way to Washington to stop the  Senate from putting Steve Mnuchin in a position to harm millions of  others.   Sylvia told us her story, and this is what she said:         My name is Sylvia Oliver, I am a homeowner from Scotch       Plains, New Jersey. I got my mortgage from IndyMac in May       2008, and about a month later, IndyMac failed. I want to       share my story because it is more than a house--it is a home       for me, my husband, and my three children and my       grandchildren.        In early 2009, my husband and I were facing financial       difficulties. Because of the economy being in bad shape, my       husband was between jobs. We reached out to OneWest to       request a modification. We were told that we had to make       three payments in order to move forward on a permanent       modification, and so we made those three payments. After       making those payments, I reached back out to OneWest to find       out what the next steps were. But I couldn't get a straight       answer from them, so we continued making partial payments,       even though it was a challenge for us financially.        In February 2010, I submitted a modification application to       OneWest Bank. About six weeks later I received a Notice of       Intent to Foreclose. However, the person I had been talking       to at OneWest, a man named Albert, told me not to worry, and       encouraged me to continue submitting updated documents to the       bank. So, for the next year, I would submit new documents to       the bank, through FedEx and through faxes. And, every week, I       would call Albert and ask if he had an update on my       situation, and every week I was told there was no answer and       to call back the next week.        After a year of my weekly phone calls, I finally a received       a denial letter from OneWest in February 2011, when they said       they couldn't modify my loan.        Albert at OneWest told me I could reapply for a       modification, which I did, because I really wanted to keep       our home.        For the next several months, the cycle would repeat with       the bank telling me to reapply for a modification, me       believing that they were sincere, and then a few months later       being told that we had been declined again. This was       surprising, because during this time we were back on our feet       and our incomes were both increasing, which meant we were in       a better position to pay for our mortgage.        At the end of 2015, I received another notice of       foreclosure from the bank. At this point it became clear to       me that OneWest never had any intention of modifying the loan       in such a way that they would still get paid back and we       would be able to keep our home.        In March of 2016, I hired a lawyer because I thought they       might have more success in working with the bank than I did.       At my attorney's advice, I filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy as       part of another modification application. That process went       on for about five or six months, with the same cycle of me       sending paperwork over and over to the bank, and the same       answer again.        Last year I was facing foreclosure three weeks before       Christmas. However, that was then postponed until this month.       In fact, I was supposed to be foreclosed on by OneWest       today--    That is the day she came to Washington--   [[Page S1080]]            however, after Senator Menendez's office called OneWest, I       learned that my sale had been postponed at least until next       month.        Earlier this month, I sought help from a HUD approved       housing counselor. She worked with me and my husband to       document our income and to submit a modification application.       After analyzing the situation, she was surprised to hear that       we had not qualified for a modification earlier, especially       since my husband and I both had good incomes.        As of right now, I am still facing foreclosure next month--    That would be February--       and I know in my heart this is because OneWest's only intent       was to foreclose on my home.        This bank has had ample opportunities to modify my loan. In       fact, they told me that they own the loan, so I know they       can't blame the situation on an investor not allowing them to       modify my loan. Nobody should have to go through the       experience that I have gone through during the past several       years with OneWest Bank. It has been very painful and       stressful not knowing if my kids and my family were going to       have a home to live in or if it is going to be foreclosed on.        I would ask you to remember my experience when you consider       whether Mr. Mnuchin is qualified to lead the Department of       the Treasury. As the CEO and Chair of OneWest Bank, Mr.       Mnuchin had the opportunity to help families like mine with       responsible loan modification, and he didn't. I don't think       this is a track record that anybody should be proud of.    Thank you, Sylvia for telling your story.   Then there is Cristina, a small business owner who owned her own home  at the age of 20. I already told you about how Steve Mnuchin's bank ran  her in circles until they could foreclose on her house. But now I want  you to hear the full story from Cristina. Here is what she said:         Good afternoon. My name is Cristina Clifford. I'm hoping       that by sharing my story today I can explain why I believe       confirming Steve Mnuchin as Treasury Secretary would be a       serious mistake for our country. I experienced firsthand what       it was like to be subject to OneWest's greed, and I can tell       you that the person who ran OneWest Bank should not be the       person responsible for oversight of the U.S. economy.        In 2001, when I was 20, I bought my first home--a great       condo in Whittier, California, just outside Los Angeles. I       was young, but I've always been a motivated self-starter. I'm       also a self-employed, small business owner--my primary source       of income. Things were going just fine, and I was never, ever       late on my mortgage payments.        However, that changed in 2008--like it did for so many of       us--when the economy took a turn for the worse. My business       struggled, and I started relying on credit cards to stay       afloat. In March of 2009, I was unable to make my mortgage       payment for the first time in eight years as a homeowner. I       called OneWest directly to see what options I would have for       keeping my home. They told me flat out that because I had       never been delinquent, they had no way of helping me.        In order to get help, they said, I would have to fall       behind on my payments. Of course this was misleading--and,       I've since found out, a common tactic that mortgage lenders       use to push people into default.        From there, I began the long, long process of loan       modification through the Home Affordable Mortgage Program (or       HAMP). I sent in numerous documents to OneWest, and in May, I       was offered my first loan modification. I was thrilled--the       new payments would fit perfectly in my budget, so I signed       the loan modification papers and sent them via FedEx along       with a check for my first payment under the new, modified       payment amount. In July, I expected OneWest to send me a       statement with the new lower payment amount. Instead, I       received a letter saying that they had not received my loan       modification paperwork, so the modification terms were no       longer valid. I called them and OneWest confirmed that they       had not received my returned loan modification agreement.        I knew right away this wasn't right, because they had       cashed the check for the first modified payment in the same       FedEx envelope. That they managed to cash the check but       completely neglect the loan modification agreement--again, in       the same envelope--is absolutely outrageous.        I had no choice but to apply again, this time submitting       even more documents; I was told to submit and resubmit many       duplicative documents in many different formats. Despite how       difficult OneWest made the process, I did everything they       asked because I was determined to keep my home. On August 3,       2009, I received a notice of default from OneWest but       proceeded with my second attempt at modifying my loan. I       received my second loan modification offer later that month.       The terms were almost identical to the offer they made me in       May, so I quickly signed the offer and mailed it in with       another check.        In October, I got a letter exactly like the one I received       earlier saying that they had not received the loan       modification paperwork and that the modification offer was no       longer valid. Yet as they did the first time, they cashed the       check I sent with the signed offer.        At this point, I felt I had no choice but to get an       attorney, who worked to get my foreclosure postponed while       the loan modification process played out. He spoke with       people at OneWest who told him that they would postpone the       sale of my condo until the loan modification process was       completed.        This simply wasn't true: on the evening of December 3,       2009, I received a knock on my door from a man that       introduced himself as the new owner of my property. And in       March of 2010, I received a final notice telling me that I       had five days to leave my apartment--five days to pack up the       ten years of my life I'd spent in my home.        The reason I am sharing my story is because there are so       many other people out there like me who got left in the dust.       Steve Mnuchin profited from people like me, even when we did       everything we could to keep our homes. You might say that       Steve Mnuchin did not personally authorize OneWest to cheat       me out of my home, but his fortune rose as a direct result of       managing a company that routinely engaged in irresponsible       behavior.        The Treasury Secretary will be tasked with making sure the       economy is working in a way that benefits all of Americans,       not just the top 1 percent. However, Steve Mnuchin is not       that person; he is just the opposite. Please make a statement       for people like me and oppose his confirmation as Treasury       Secretary.    Thank you, Cristina. Thank you for coming to Washington. Thank you  for submitting your story.   Now these are just four stories--four experiences--among the  thousands more like them, all leading to the same simple but startling  conclusion: Under Steve Mnuchin's leadership, OneWest Bank took  advantage of homeowners all across the country in the immediate  aftermath of the financial crisis. And why did they do it? They did it  to make a quick buck.   But don't just take my word for it. Paulina Gonzalez, the Executive  Director for the California Reinvestment Coalition also came to  Washington to speak to us. Paulina and her organization have been  closely tracking OneWest's destructive practices for years. Here is  what Paulina told us:         My name is Paulina Gonzalez. I am the Executive Director of       the California Reinvestment Coalition. Over the past 30       years, CRC has grown to the largest state reinvestment       coalition in the country with a membership of 300       organizations that serve low-income communities and community       of color.        It is critically important that our elected representatives       and the American public hear directly from people who have       lost their homes due to the egregious practices by OneWest       under Mr. Mnuchin's leadership, before deciding on his       nomination to the high and important office of Treasury       Secretary.        I'm going to share some data and information with you in       the next few minutes, but know that the wreckage from OneWest       is not really about numbers, data, and legal briefs. It's       about the tens of thousands of Americans who have suffered       devastating personal and financial losses as a result of       OneWest's abusive foreclosure practices.        Whether it's the story of the Minnesota woman who sought a       loan modification from OneWest and returned to her home in a       blizzard only to find that her locks were changed. Or the 90       year old woman who was nearly kicked out of her home for       mistakenly paying 27 cents less than [the amount] OneWest       said she owed. Or the 80 year old former Christian missionary       who was notified at his home that Financial Freedom was       foreclosing on him because the bank said it had no record of       him living there. The issue is the same: instead of helping       people stay in their homes, Mr. Mnuchin devised a foreclosure       machine that used every trick in the book to profit from       their suffering.        And foreclose he did. CRC and Urban Strategies Council       analyzed data showing that OneWest foreclosed on over 36,000       families in California and 24,000 families nationally. All of       these foreclosures occurred after Mr. Mnuchin purchased       IndyMac Bank. In addition, we suspect that OneWest's reverse       mortgage subsidiary, Financial Freedom, has foreclosed on       more seniors, widows, and widowers, and heirs than any other       company participating in the federal Home Equity Conversion       Mortgage program. A Freedom of Information Act request that       we filed with HUD revealed that Financial Freedom had       foreclosed on over 16,000 seniors, widows, widowers, and       their families, or 39 % of all Home Equity Conversion       Mortgage foreclosures, roughly twice the rate one would       expect given the bank's market share.    I just want to say that one more time. They foreclosed on seniors, on  widows, on widowers, and on families at about twice the rate of anyone  else doing the same business.         Mr. Mnuchin may defend his record by saying he inherited       these bad loans, that the foreclosures were inevitable, and       that his bank followed the law in dealing with his customers.       We strongly disagree, and it appears we are not alone. In a       CNN story that aired on January 3rd about Mr. Mnuchin and  [[Page S1081]]       Financial Freedom, a HUD spokesperson was quoted as saying,       ``while HUD doesn't dispute that it has strict rules for       government backed reverse mortgages, OneWest had the ability       to give survivors more time but chose not to.''        Mr. Mnuchin's spokespeople have also praised his       modification record. But, we are not sure there is much to       praise. 2013 data from the Treasury Department shows that       OneWest had among the highest denial rates for the Home       Affordable Modification Program, [HAMP,] the federal       government's main foreclosure prevention effort. Under Mr.       Mnuchin, OneWest denied three-quarters of the thousands of       loan modification requests that came in from families       trying to save their homes. OneWest was much more likely       to deny loan modifications under this program than peers,       such as Bank of America or Wells Fargo.        A January 2013 memo from the California Attorney General's       office revealed a staff investigation finding of ``widespread       misconduct'' at the bank, including backdating thousands of       foreclosure documents, improper foreclosure auction credit       bidding which meant the bank could claim tax exemptions it       wasn't entitled to, proceeding with foreclosures without the       proper authority to do so, and speeding up foreclosure       timelines. All of these practices deprived working families       in California a fair chance to stay in their homes.        The Treasury Secretary leads our economy. The Secretary       helps oversee our banking system and will have much to say       about important policies relating to banking, housing, and       economic development that will impact all Americans. The       country needs a Treasury Secretary who will consider the       needs of all Americans, including working class Americans.       Mr. Mnuchin's tenure at OneWest Bank shows him to work in his       interest and in the corporate interest, at the great expense       and harm to everyday Americans.    Thank you, Paulina. I appreciate your sending in this information,  and I agree.   Unfortunately, Mr. Mnuchin's history of oppressive foreclosure  practices isn't the only thing that disqualifies him from serving as  Secretary of the Treasury. I already told you that Mr. Mnuchin flat-out  lied to the Senate when he told my colleague, Senator Casey, that his  bank didn't engage in certain foreclosure practices. I wish to share an  article from the Columbus Dispatch uncovering the exact practices Mr.  Mnuchin told the Senate that his bank never engaged in. The article  says: ``President Donald Trump's nominee for U.S. treasury secretary  was untruthful with the Senate during the confirmation process,  documents uncovered by The Dispatch show.''         Steve Mnuchin, former chairman and chief executive officer       of OneWest Bank, known for its aggressive foreclosure       practices, flatly denied in testimony before the Senate       Finance Committee that OneWest used ``robo-signing'' on       mortgage documents.        But records show the bank utilized the questionable       practice in Ohio.        ``This guy is just lying. There's no other way to say it,''       said Bill Faith, executive director of the Coalition on       Homelessness and Housing in Ohio.        The revelation comes with the committee's vote on whether       to confirm Mnuchin's nomination, currently scheduled for       Monday night.        ``Robo-signing'' is the informal term for when a mortgage       company employee signs hundreds of foreclosures, swearing       they have scrutinized the document as required by law when in       fact they have not.        ``OneWest Bank did not `robo-sign' documents,'' Mnuchin       wrote in response to questions from individual Senators,       ``and as the only bank to successfully complete the       Independent Foreclosure Review required by federal banking       regulators to investigate allegations of `robo-signing,' I am       proud of our institution's extremely low error rate.''    I just want to read that one more time. Steve Mnuchin said: ``OneWest  Bank did not `robo-sign' documents.'' And he is proud of what he did.   But a Dispatch analysis of nearly four dozen foreclosure cases filed  by OneWest in Franklin County in 2010 alone shows that the company  frequently used robo-signers. The vast majority of the Columbus-area  cases were signed by 11 different people in Travis County, Texas. Those  employees called themselves vice presidents, assistant vice presidents,  managers and assistant secretaries. In three local cases, a judge  dismissed OneWest foreclosure proceedings specifically based on  inaccurate robo-signings.         The Dispatch found more than 1,900 OneWest foreclosures in       the state's six largest counties from 2009 to 2015.        Carla Duncan, a social worker from Cleveland Heights, was       snared by OneWest's robo-signing machinery.        On her way out of town for a short trip in 2010, Duncan       stopped by her home to get her mail and found a note from a       field inspector for her mortgage company, saying that her       house was vacant and was going to be boarded up.        ``It wasn't vacant, I was living there,'' Duncan said.       ``There were curtains on the windows. The radio was playing       and the dog was there.''        What Duncan didn't know at the time was that OneWest had       begun foreclosure proceedings on her three-bedroom home even       though she was up-to-date on her payments. OneWest refused to       accept a loan modification approved by a previous lender that       had been purchased by OneWest, and it wanted to substantially       increase Duncan's interest rate and monthly payment and add       late fees. The company also put a lock box on a separate       rental property she owned in Cleveland.        After hiring former Ohio Attorney General Marc Dann, waging       a five-year court battle and filing personal bankruptcy,       Duncan was finally able to get the foreclosures dismissed and       keep her home and rental property. She said the experience       was devastating.        ``It got to the point that I was afraid to open my own       door.''        Court records show that Duncan's mortgage was robo-signed       by Erica Johnson-Seck, vice president of OneWest's department       of bankruptcy and foreclosures. From her office in Austin,       Texas, Johnson-Seck robo-signed an average of 750 foreclosure       documents a week, according to a sworn deposition she gave in       a Florida case in July 2009.        Under oath, Johnson-Seck acknowledged that she did not read       the documents she was signing, taking only about 30 seconds       to sign her name. To speed up the process, Johnson-Seck said       she shortened her first name in her signature to just ``E.''       In the deposition that OneWest's practice was to review just       10 percent of the foreclosure documents for accuracy.        Dann, who now specializes in representing clients who have       problems with banks and other lenders after he was forced to       resign as attorney general nearly 10 years ago, said       Mnuchin's businesses were a ``major offender'' in problem       mortgages. Dann said Mnuchin's firms were known for dual       tracking [which means](pursuing foreclosure simultaneously as       they allegedly worked with homeowners), fabricating documents       and other tactics ``that caused unbelievable devastation in       people's lives.''        In 2010, federal laws were changed, enabling borrowers       victimized by lenders to sue them. Dann said he worries that       Mnuchin, as treasury secretary, would quietly work to repeal       reforms collectively known as the Dodd-Frank Wall Street       Reform and Consumer Protection Act.        That appears to be the case.        ``It has been over six years since the passage of Dodd-      Frank and it seems like an appropriate time to review all of       the regulations from Dodd-Frank to understand their impact on       the market, investors, small businesses and economic       growth,'' Mnuchin said in a written answer to the Senate.        The Dispatch analysis showed thousands of Ohio homeowners--      including 245 in Franklin County--found themselves in       OneWest's crosshairs when they defaulted on their loans, the       majority of them with high interest rates. Many mortgages had       terms that housing and financial experts view as predatory:       prepayment penalties, interest-only loans and no-money-down       loans.        Mnuchin was labeled by critics at the time as the       ``Foreclosure King.''    That is it--the ``Foreclosure King.'' That is who is just hours away  from becoming the chief financial officer of our country.   Steve Mnuchin is a Wall Street insider who has spent his career  looking out for himself and his billionaire buddies. He led a bank that  forced thousands of hardworking Americans out of their homes, and he  lied to the Senate.   The Constitution demands that Senators advise and consent on the  President's nominations. Well, here is my advice: Steve Mnuchin is not  fit to be Secretary of Treasury.   He will not look out for the millions of Americans still recovering  from the recession, like Heather and Cristina. He certainly will not  defend the interests of middle-class families like the McCrearys and  the Olivers. And I know he will not stand up to Wall Street and fight  to protect the interests of all Americans.   I urge my colleagues to oppose Mr. Mnuchin's nomination.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Fischer). The clerk will call the roll.   The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.
