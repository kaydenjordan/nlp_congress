 Madam Speaker, at a time when the country is facing  a 40-year high rate of inflation, Americans are struggling, the economy  is contracting, and we are in a recession, they are jamming through a  $750-billion bill with a slush fund that will only further fuel  inflation, lead to higher energy costs, and drive up manufacturing  costs as a supply chain crisis persists.   What a lousy idea to raise taxes during a recession. This will not  just hit businesses, but families earning as little as $50,000, and  that is exactly why this bill is doubling the IRS by 87,000 agents.   This is a level that is:   More than the population of Biden's entire hometown of Scranton,  Pennsylvania.   More than the fans that can fill the MetLife Stadium where the Giants  play.   Three times the staff at the Pentagon.   Four times the Border Patrol agents when we have a border crisis; and   Eight times the drug enforcement agents when fentanyl is taking  record lives of young Americans.   This bill does not include one cop as crime is skyrocketing in cities  like mine.   This Congress is disconnected with the real problems that Americans  face. To call this the Inflation Reduction Act is a lie.    Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to remove the  gentlewoman from New York (Miss Rice) and the gentleman from New Jersey  (Mr. Smith) as cosponsors of H.R. 1642.
