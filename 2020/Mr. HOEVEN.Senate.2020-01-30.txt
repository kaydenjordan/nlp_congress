 Mr. Chief Justice, I am sending a question to the desk  for myself, Senator Boozman, Senator Wicker, and Senator Capito.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. The question for counsel for the President from  Senators Hoeven, Boozman, Wicker, and Capito:         House managers contend that they have an overwhelming case       and that they have made their case in clear and convincing       fashion. Doesn't that assertion directly contradict their       request for more witnesses?
