 Madam President, I rise today to applaud the CEO  of the Arkansas Hospitality Association, Montine McNulty, who will be  retiring at the end of this year.   During this very challenging time for the hospitality industry,  McNulty persevered through all of the difficulties that transpired amid  the COVID-19 pandemic. When small businesses were shutting down and  people were taking early retirements, McNulty decided to postpone  retirement to help Arkansas' hospitality industry navigate the new  economic realities it confronted after COVID-19 appeared and disrupted  so much about how and when business operated. Her selflessness and  devotion to ensuring that the industry not only stayed alive, but  succeeded during those difficult times, was truly inspiring.   McNulty has spent the past 25 years leading the AHA. There are a  number of significant changes that have occurred during her tenure as  CEO, all of which McNulty adapted to for the benefit of the AHA, the  industry, and the Natural State's economy. Technology innovations over  the last two-and-a-half decades have allowed for quick and effective  communication and relationship building within the hospitality  industry. McNulty expertly used these advancements to the advantage of  AHA members, and the results have been to position the organization's  tools and capabilities to assist businesses in expanding on and  delivering better services.   Because of McNulty's excellent leadership skills, the Arkansas  hospitality industry has been able to thrive for the past quarter  century. She will be sincerely missed when she leaves the AHA.   Of course, McNulty will not completely leave the hospitality industry  even after stepping down as CEO of AHA. She is an emeritus member of  the Arkansas Parks, Heritage and Tourism Commission, and current  president of the Arkansas Tourism Development Foundation--roles that  will allow her to continue offering her wisdom and expertise into the  future.   Montine McNulty is an excellent example of a true leader and an  excellent businesswoman. Arkansas will be forever grateful for the  contributions she has made to the hospitality industry and our economy.  It is an honor to celebrate her 25 years of leadership and extend our  sincere thanks for all her efforts that served to improve and  contribute to our great State.                            ____________________
