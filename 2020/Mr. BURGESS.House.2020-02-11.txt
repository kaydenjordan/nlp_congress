 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.   Part of one of the underlying bills, H.R. 2546, the Protecting  America's Wilderness Act, includes language to expand the Santa Monica  Mountains National Recreation Area by some 191,000 acres, an area known  as the Rim of the Valley Corridor.   In 2008, Congress directed the Secretary of the Interior to study  whether to designate all or a portion of the Rim of the Valley Corridor  as part of the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area. In  2016, the National Park Service recommended an expansion of 173,000  acres.   The bill today expands the area by more than that to 191,000 acres,  including new areas that were not listed in the study. They are  completely disconnected from the Rim of the Valley Corridor; yet they  are included in the exclusion.                                time  1300    In addition, the National Park Service testified in June 2019 against  the proposed expansion of the Santa Monica Mountains National  Recreation Area, citing a need to focus resources on the deferred  maintenance backlog.   The proposed land expansion would include Soledad Canyon, a mineral- rich area where the Bureau of Land Management has issued contracts to  mine millions of tons of sand and gravel for southern California. Our  strong economy has led to an increase in manufacturing and  construction. The problem is that the supply of construction materials,  like those that can be found in this area, is declining.   This legislation, the underlying legislation, would make it  incredibly onerous for contracted companies to move forward with  agreed-upon projects. Democrats often talk about the importance of a  large infrastructure bill, yet the passage of this bill would increase  the costs of essential materials that such projects do require.  [[Page H1029]]    The bottom line is that the land under consideration is currently in  dispute, and decisions that will significantly change the landscape and  activity of an area should not occur without consensus.   Last night, the Rules Committee reported a rule that included  consideration of two amendments that may help address these concerns.  Representative McClintock offered an amendment to allow the Secretary  of Agriculture or Secretary of the Interior to exclude from wilderness  designations any areas that do not meet the definition of wilderness as  defined in the Wilderness Act.   Representative Westerman offered an amendment to strike all  designations of potential wilderness under the bill.   Those are commonsense amendments, and when the appropriate time  comes, I urge all Members to support the amendments. The underlying  bill is flawed, and I will oppose it on passage.
