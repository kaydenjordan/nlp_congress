 Madam Speaker, I rise today to  congratulate the Central High School Dragons and the Everett High  School Warriors baseball teams on winning the PIAA Class 3A and Class  2A championships, respectively.   Through practice, hard work, and determination, these teams battled  through difficult seasons in order to seize their championship  victories.   For the Central High School Dragons, their championship came after an  undefeated season. For the Everett Warriors, a hard-fought 1-0 victory  in the final game of the year was needed in order to raise the  championship trophy.   For both these teams, their refusal to quit when games were close is  a testament to their commitment, to their communities, and to each  other as players.   I am proud of what these young men have accomplished, and I look  forward to seeing their continued success as they embark on careers.                        end the southern border crisis     Madam Speaker, in the past 50 years, we  have seen such change on our southern border. In the past 10 years, we  have continued to see changes on our southern border.   Madam Speaker, 50 individuals on the FBI terrorist watch list have  been apprehended on our southern border.   Madam Speaker, 50 potential terrorists, with only the intent to harm  American citizens, have been apprehended on our southern border.   What is President Biden's response? To leave our border wall  unfinished and our citizens vulnerable to attack.   We cannot allow these open border policies to continue. We cannot  allow these terrorists to continue to enter the United States through a  porous and vulnerable southern border.   Now, with a potential surge of more than 18,000 migrants expected to  cross the border if title 42 is repealed, more terrorists will attempt  to enter our country.   It is time to secure our border. It is time to codify title 42. It is  time to put an end to this crisis.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for  yielding.   Right now, today, as we all are here in the Halls of Congress, our  Nation is facing a mental health crisis. And this crisis followed 2  years of lockdowns and remote learning that have left so many Americans  feeling isolated, lost, and, in some cases, hopeless. Particularly, our  young Americans feel all of these emotions.   I rise today in support of this legislation that would help to  address this crisis head-on by helping to ensure that those who are  struggling can receive the help that they so desperately need, that  they need, and they need our attention to it right now.   The Restoring Hope for Mental Health and Well-Being Act of 2022  expands access to care for millions of Americans, including children  and teenagers who are desperately in need of this assistance.   As a doctor, I have treated patients who have later lost their lives  to mental illness. Just last week, we had physicians here on the Hill,  pediatricians, family doctors, telling us that they have seen the shift  of the pendulum; that they see on a daily basis more and more cases in  their patients, specifically involving mental health.   And there is not a single American who has not in some way been  impacted by the effects that mental illness is having today.   In the past year, over 107,000 Americans have lost their lives to  drug overdoses. Far too many grandparents, far too many fathers,  mothers, sons, and daughters are dying. We cannot wait to act any  longer. We need to act and vote on this legislation.   To help address the tragedy of addiction, this bill increases support  for opioid recovery programs that will help people who are struggling  to receive the care that they need.   This bill would go on to make mental health screenings a part of each  person's annual physical exam and evaluation and help to ensure that  everyone who sees a doctor is able to have a conversation frankly,  concisely, clearly, about their mental health and the mental health  issues that they are facing.   Most importantly, this bill would provide a whole-of-care approach  that would fund prevention, treatment, and recovery services for the  people who are suffering with addiction. We have worked as a committee,  as a conference addressing these important issues.   I urge all of my colleagues to vote to pass this important piece of  legislation.
