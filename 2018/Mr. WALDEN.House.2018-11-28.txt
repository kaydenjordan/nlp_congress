 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 6753, the Health  Care Fraud Prevention Task Force Act. This bipartisan bill--which I  introduced with Ranking Member Frank Pallone, and is supported by Ways  and Means Chairman Kevin Brady and Ranking Member Richard Neal--passed  the Energy and Commerce Committee unanimously earlier this year. This  will be the 132nd bill that our committee has passed this Congress, 92  percent of which have been bipartisan just like this one. I look  forward to continuing in that vein over the next two years.   By passing this bill, we will be codifying a program that already  works. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) currently  operates the Health Care Fraud Prevention Partnership--a voluntary  collaboration between the federal government, state agencies, law  enforcement, private health insurance plans, and anti-fraud  associations. Together, this group works to detect and prevent fraud  that threatens to undermine our nation's health care system. This  program was created by the Obama Administration, and the Trump  Administration has recommended codifying it into law. The bill before  us today does just that, also strengthening and expanding the scope of  partnership's work.   Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of this commonsense, bipartisan bill to  improve the integrity of our nation's health care system.
