 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to wish my mom a  happy 60th birthday. I couldn't ask for a better mom. Most likely her  favorite son, I have known each and every day of my life that my mom  loves me and she is proud of me.   My mom hasn't always had it easy. She has worked hard all of her  life, both as a cook in a nursing home for nearly 40 years and by  holding it all together at home as she cared for my dad, my two  brothers, and me.   What we need now more than ever is more moms like my mom, and as we  celebrate Mother's Day this weekend, we honor our moms and say thank  you for their tireless work and sacrifices.   Motherhood is a full-time job and a lifetime commitment, but the  impact that mothers make in the lives of their children is profound.   I am grateful for all of the moms in my life, including my  extraordinary wife, Amanda, who is raising three extraordinary little  girls.   Mr. Speaker, I wish my mom a happy birthday and wish all the mothers  in northeast Indiana and across our country a happy Mother's Day on  Sunday.                            ____________________
