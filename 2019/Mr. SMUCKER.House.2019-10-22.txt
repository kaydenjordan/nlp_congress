 Madam Speaker, I rise today to give voice to my  constituents on the destructive partisan and secret impeachment  inquiry, which really is a slap in the face to the overwhelming  majority of Pennsylvania's 11th District who voted for and continue to  support President Trump.   Judith from Ephrata writes:         Congressman, my husband and I are furious about this       constant push to impeach President Trump. We don't care how       many Members of Congress don't like him. It is not their       choice; it is ours.    Rebecca from Lititz writes:         I am alarmed at the political climate and attempts to       impeach our President. The House has done nothing to solve       the issues facing our country and continues to spend their       time trying to stop the progress that our President has made.    Jody from Windsor writes:         Can you please tell Speaker Pelosi and the Democrats that       the overwhelming majority of people I interact with in my       daily life want them to stop these unfounded impeachment       proceedings into President Trump and get back to work fixing       the issues we elected Congress to fix?    Madam Speaker, I share my constituents' anger and frustration toward  the show trial. This process isn't honest or fair.                            ____________________
