 Madam Speaker, I rise today to remember  the life and the legacy of Dr. Glenn Blodgett, known to most as Doc  Blodgett. Doc Blodgett passed away at the age of 73 on November 21,  surrounded by loved ones.   Doc Blodgett spent more than 40 years managing the horse division at  the Four Sixes Ranch in Texas. Blodgett led the ranch's team of  veterinary staff. He oversaw all veterinary practices and reproductive  services, including horse breeding. Nearly 1,500 mares were bred from  the ranch each year.   Outside of his work at the Four Sixes Ranch, Doc served on the board  of the American Association of Equine Practitioners and in 2019 was  inducted into the Texas Cowboy Hall of Fame.   Earlier this year, I had the great privilege of traveling to the Four  Sixes Ranch and interacting with Doc Blodgett and the legendary horse  program at the ranch. One thing was clear during the visit, Doc  Blodgett was incredibly passionate about his work. He was a master of  his practice and someone who left an irreplaceable mark on the equine  industry.   Doc Blodgett is survived by his loving wife of more than 50 years,  Karen Wright, his two daughters, four granddaughters, and one grandson.   Madam Speaker, please join me in keeping Karen, the Blodgett family,  and Doc Blodgett's friends in your prayers.                            ____________________
