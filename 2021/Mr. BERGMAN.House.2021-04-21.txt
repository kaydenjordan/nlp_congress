 Madam Speaker, I thank Representative Johnson for  yielding. It is an honor to be here on the floor with him tonight.   Our country recognizes leadership at all levels, regardless of party  ideology,  [[Page H2046]]  and I see here on the floor real leadership, committed leadership.   I rise today to express deep concern for the state of our Nation's  southern border. Words matter, and it is time we start calling this  situation what it really is: a crisis. In simple words, it is what it  is. Don't try to paint it in many different ways.   President Biden has invited this crisis through his words and in his  executive actions, including terminating construction of the wall on  our southern border.   We need real leadership now. Now is not the time to be hiding. We  need the leaders to step out and step up. It is time to put up and put  out the political gamesmanship, put that all behind us and take a  serious look at what is happening on the southern border. When I say a  serious look, I mean that literally.   Vice President Harris, let alone President Biden, has yet to visit  the border since being charged with addressing the crisis there. The  United States is and must always remain a free and welcoming Nation.   We are all immigrants. We are immigrants by generations who came here  for one of two reasons, for an opportunity or fleeing persecution. That  hasn't changed.                                time  2030    We are also, and by all standards measured, a Nation of law and  order, and our laws must be followed.   Madam Speaker, I urge Congress to take up critical legislation, such  as Representative Andy Biggs' Stopping Border Surges Act and  Representative Jeff Duncan's H.R. 88, Build up Illegal Line Defenses  with Assets Lawfully Lifted Act of 2021. These bills will begin to  address the root cause of our immigration issues.   In addition, the bureaucracies here in D.C. can play a positive role,  such as Department of Labor and DHS. They can help. Because when you  look at those who seek to come here legally and work as guest workers,  we can bring good people from around the world here through the H2B and  H2A programs. They do not seek permanent status; they come here to  work, and they go home. The bureaucracies can get involved to help  good, legal immigration occur after you separate out the guest worker  programs.   Madam Speaker, we can secure our border, protect those wishing to  come here legally, and crack down on those who wish to do us harm--and  I mean, crack down on those who wish to do us harm. It is time this  body gets to work to address this critical issue immediately.
