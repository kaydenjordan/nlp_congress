 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for his leadership on  this. Here we are again. We are here once again to speak against the  Biden administration's new waters of the United States rule. This is a  bridge too far. Since this issue last appeared on the House floor, a  Federal judge blocked the rule, as the chairman mentioned, in 26  States.   It seems that even our judicial system is signaling this is a vast  overstep of Federal jurisdiction. Yet, President Biden is insistent on  pushing this resolution through. There are already State and local laws  in place to protect our waterways, and these entities are much better  equipped to oversee small, isolated bodies of water.   All this change does is create more red tape for farmers, ranchers,  and landowners. What it does not do, it doesn't make our waterways any  cleaner.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this measure and give  the power back to the States.
