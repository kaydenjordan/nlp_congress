 Madam Speaker, when an armed mob stormed the Capitol  earlier this year, they did so under the belief that political violence  was an acceptable means to an end. As leaders and as Members of this  body, every one of us has a responsibility to stand up and to make  clear that way of thinking is unacceptable.   We have a responsibility here to work together to keep our  colleagues, our staff, and all of the people who work in this building  safe. That goal becomes more difficult when Members are making open  threats of violence on social media.   It is not acceptable for a Member of Congress to insinuate that they  want to violently kill another Member, and we need to directly respond  to this threat.   Today, we have an opportunity to send a strong, unified, bipartisan  message against this kind of conduct.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on the resolution  to ensure accountability and recommit ourselves to the safety of every  Member and future Member of this body.
