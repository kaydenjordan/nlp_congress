 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I rise today on this very important issue that is near and dear to my  heart and ought to be near and dear to the heart of this body and the  United States of America.   I think the Democratic majority made a horrific mistake this week in  stripping out Iron Dome funding from the NDAA bill. I was shocked.   I was shocked because I grew up in a country that, despite being a  Republican--and I am a strong Republican; my mother was a strong  Democrat, my father was a strong Republican--support for Israel, our  beloved ally, our democratic ally, our only really, really reliable  ally in the Middle East was stripped out of that bill.                                time  1245    This was a defensive mechanism. This is a system, Mr. Speaker, that  keeps missiles from coming in and killing innocent men, women, and  children who live in fear. Never let an Israeli live in fear from  terrorism again; a defensive mechanism, a defensive system.   So today I do applaud the Democrats for finally standing up and  admitting their mistake with this bill that is unnecessary in this  format but has become necessary because it was stripped out of the  major NDAA bill.   So I will be strongly supporting this bill, this billion dollars for  a defensive system, but more importantly today before I reserve the  balance of my time, let me say that as an American, as a Republican, as  a servant in this House, the United States of America must state its  unequivocal support for the State of Israel.   Israel has gone through a tumultuous history since its founding. The  United States has stood with Israel. We will stand with Israel today on  this important bill. We will fund the Iron Dome, and we will always  protect the Israeli people from terrorism wherever it comes from.  [[Page H5110]]    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as  necessary to respond to this comment.   Mr. Speaker, the truth has finally come out on the floor of the House  of the United States of America. I heard some of my Democratic  colleagues: Stand with me, with Israel, with our ally, to fight  terrorism with a defensive weapon system.   And what did we just hear? We heard the Democratic Party speak out.  We heard, right now, from my colleague across the aisle with a shocking  statement. She opposes this because they have a vocal minority in the  majority party that is anti-Israel, that is anti-Semitic. And as  Americans, we can never stand for that.   I grew up with Holocaust survivors. I grew up with children of  Holocaust survivors. Israel has been attacked and attacked and attacked  since its inception.   As Americans, I beseech you, I reach out to the majority, and I say  condemn what we just heard on the floor. Condemn terrorism. This is a  defensive weapon system. Stop playing your procedural games.   I hear recommit. It was a motion to recommit. You just saw something  on this floor I thought I would never see, not only as a Member of this  House, but as an American.   Let us stand with Israel. Let's combat anti-Semitism wherever it is  in the world, whether it is in the United States, whether it is from  terrorism.   I am shocked with what I just heard. I ask the majority to condemn  the comments that were just made by their Member.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Louisiana (Mr. Scalise), the Republican minority whip.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  South Carolina (Mr. Wilson).    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman an additional 30  seconds.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  California (Mr. LaMalfa).    Mr. Speaker, I have no additional speakers and would  be ready to close when appropriate. I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, today we have had yet another heated  debate in the people's House in the greatest, freest Nation in the  world.   The United States of America is a beacon of freedom. In my 10-year  tenure in Congress, I have spoken with world leaders in Israel, in the  Middle East, in Europe, across the globe. The world looks to the United  States for leadership and for freedom.   Our great ally in the Middle East, Israel, has been threatened. Its  citizens have been threatened since its inception, and that is wrong.   I associate myself partially with the remarks of the majority leader  when he said we need to pass this bill today; and we do. We need to  give Israel and the Israeli people the capability to continue to defend  themselves against what are terrorist attacks on its people.   Over 4,000 rockets directed by terrorists, supported by countries  such as Iran and others, who wish to seek destruction of Israel. As  Americans, we can never allow that to happen. As human beings, we can  never allow that to happen. And we need to be heard, that beacon of  freedom in the United States of America, all over the world in our  defense of Israel because other countries have let them down.   Today, we will not let Israel down. We will pass this bill. And to my  colleagues on the other side of the aisle who once had a great  Democratic Party, like the great Republican Party in our great two- party system, stand up, stand up and fight anti-Semitism wherever its  ugly head is raised. It is the right thing to do.   We will do it with our vote today. But we heard from someone from  Michigan (Ms. Tlaib); we heard from their radical left wing that does  not support Israel, that does not support the Jewish people. It does  not support their right, their inherent right to exist.   Let us, as Americans, make our resolve now, today, and forever in our  great Republic to protect the people of Israel. Let's pass this bill,  and let's associate our comments, as Americans, with those who will  always stand up and fight anti-Semitism, racism, sexism, and every  wrong-ism that exists. That is our great America. That is our great  Republic.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
