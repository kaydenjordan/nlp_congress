 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, today I come to the floor to talk about  what is very obvious on television--the crisis at the southern border.   During the past several months, the American people have watched as a  full-blown crisis has developed. It has reached a catastrophic phase,  and it is not getting any better.   Let me reemphasize that whatever the Biden administration wants to  call it, it is a crisis. Simply put, the administration is in denial,  and that denial has caused a humanitarian and national crisis. For  example, border crossings are at the highest level we have seen in the  last 15 years. Last month, Customs and Border Patrol, Border  Protection, encountered more than 170,000 people attempting to cross at  the southern border. That number includes almost 19,000 unaccompanied  children, which is the highest number ever recorded in a single month.   The surge has overwhelmed personnel and prompted the Biden  administration to put out--would you believe this?--emergency calls for  volunteers. They did that from across the Federal Government. According  to news reports based on recent Biden administration emails, the  administration is recruiting NASA employees to sit with children at  border facilities. Really? That is NASA. The border crisis is so bad  that the Biden administration is trying to pull people from NASA and  place them at the border.   My fellow Senators, this situation is out of control. This is a  humanitarian and national security crisis. Terrorists, smugglers,  criminals have seen this as their golden opportunity, and they are  surely taking advantage of it.   This can't continue. I have written to the Biden administration. I  have visited the border in person. I have seen overwhelmed facilities.  I have heard the calls of the cartel members and human traffickers  yelling insults from across the Rio Grande, taunting Senators--yes,  taunting Senators.   Senator Cornyn and I have written to the chairman of the Judiciary  Committee strongly urging him to hold border security hearings. During  the Trump administration, while I served as chairman of the full  committee and Senator Cornyn served as subcommittee chairman, we held  no less than 15 hearings on oversight of the Department of Homeland  Security and various aspects of our immigration policy. As chairman of  the committee during the first 2 years of the Trump administration, I  held hearings on immigration topics of bipartisan interest to all  committee members, including Democratic committee members. Those  hearings included oversight of family reunification efforts and the  Trump administration's decision to end DACA programs.   In that very same way, I am hopeful that Chairman Durbin will be  willing to hold hearings on matters of great importance to me and  committee members on both sides of the aisle. I am ready to work with  him to put together hearings that address these problems productively.   During the Easter recess, I instructed my oversight and investigative  staff to get a classified briefing from the Department of Homeland  Security, Customs and Border Protection, and Immigration and Customs  Enforcement. That briefing provided important and time-sensitive  information that further solidifies my belief that the Biden  administration's border crisis is a national security problem.   Moreover, the Biden administration's denial that there is a border  crisis is itself a national security problem. You can't solve a problem  if you refuse to admit that there is such a problem existing. This  head-in-the-sand attitude will cost lives. That is what is so sad about  the situation. It is not making anyone's life any better. In fact, it  is putting lives at risk, American lives and immigrant lives. Yet the  administration refuses to solve the problem.   Earlier this month, I requested that the Department of Homeland  Security, Customs and Border Protection, and Immigration and Customs  Enforcement, after briefing my investigative staff, that they brief the  full Judiciary Committee, Republicans and Democrats, on a member level.  Members need to fully understand the national security problems at the  border with respect to terrorists, narcoterrorists, human smugglers,  and every one of their criminal counterparts. We must also be fully  read in to the methods and means that they use to plan and accomplish  their criminal goals.   Yesterday, in response to my request of these Agencies, the committee  had that briefing. What we learned is that the crisis at the border is  getting worse, and bad actors are expanding their technological edge to  become more efficient at accomplishing their criminal goals. Human  smuggling networks, cartels, and other bad actors are continuing to  take full advantage of the crisis.   As to where we go from here, the Biden administration knows it has a  crisis on its hands. It is time to stop the denial and act now to solve  this border crisis                             Information Sharing    Mr. President, on another issue, I would like to address my fellow  Senators. This deals with counterfeits and the need for the Federal  Government to modernize its approach to information sharing.   Counterfeits pose a danger to the health and safety of consumers.  They also infringe on U.S. intellectual property rights and unfairly  benefit international criminals.   This will come as no surprise to anyone: The majority of fake goods  come from China and Hong Kong. And the United States? Well, we are the  biggest loser when it comes to our intellectual property-related crime  and activity.   Unfortunately, the problem of counterfeits has gotten worse during  the pandemic. Americans have increasingly turned to e-commerce to buy  goods like personal protective equipment, household products, as well  as household cleaners, children's toys, and a lot of other items I  won't list. Criminals use the same e-commerce sites to sell their bogus  goods. These sites give criminals an air of legitimacy and make it  harder for law enforcement to catch them. E-commerce sites also let  criminals create multiple product listings that can trick consumers  into purchasing fake goods.   Unfortunately, when there is money to be made, criminals will find  out how to profit and do it at the expense of others, even in the event  of a global pandemic. However, there is some good news. We have ways of  addressing the problem.   Last week, I introduced legislation that will give U.S. Customs and  Border Protection more authority to share information with rights  holders and other interested parties on suspected counterfeit  merchandise. This is an issue I first identified as chairman of the  Senate Finance Committee when I investigated counterfeit goods sold  online. During this investigation, I discovered that certain U.S. laws  prevent Customs and Border Protection from sharing key pieces of  information with their private sector partners. As a result, it is  harder for Customs and Border Protection and its private sector  partners to detect and disrupt counterfeiting networks. If they could  work together and the law allowed it, it would be a lot easier to  tackle the problems.   To give credit where it is due, Customs and Border Protection has  recognized this problem and is taking steps to rectify it through the  21st Century Customs Framework--for short, 21CCF--to improve data- sharing capabilities in real time. However, without statutory authority  from Congress, in some ways, Customs and Border Protection has one hand  tied behind its back. So my bill will get rid of some of these barriers  for the Agency. It is one small but very crucial step toward a more  secure supply chain.   Sharing information is a simple solution that often gets overlooked.  However, it can be an effective tool in creating comprehensive strategy  against counterfeit activity. So I am asking my colleagues to join me  in making this legislative fix so that we may create a supply chain  that addresses a 21st-century problem.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, on April 13, I delivered remarks on  the Senate Floor to share my condolences for Iowa State Patrol Sergeant  Jim Smith, who lost his life in the line of duty. I was honored to  attend Sergeant Smith's funeral on April 16 in Independence. Jim Smith  was revered as a man of strong convictions, love of family, and deep- rooted faith. Iowa State Patrol Colonel Nathan Fulk gave the following  eulogy in honor of Sergeant Smith. I ask unanimous consent that the  eulogy be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:        Col. Nathan Fulk Remarks at the Funeral for Sgt. James Smith         I'm going to ask all of you here today to do something for       Jim Smith. I'm going to ask you to do something for Jim       Smith's wife, Kathy, his son, Zander, and his daughter,       Jazlyn. And what we're asking you to do today is to open your       minds and your hearts to the Lord Jesus Christ. His presence       is here today. Jim Smith is here with us today.        Our faith teaches us that in our suffering God is with us.       Jim's priorities were faith, family, and his commitment to       public service and his community. During a time in history       when we wonder--with conflict, adversity, and challenge, we       can doubt the support we have in society. However, the       outpouring of support for the City of Independence has been       truly amazing. You've reminded us why we love working,       serving, and living in the state of Iowa. You've reminded us       why we have a strong passion to serve and protect those in       the community. And you've shown us that love, compassion, and       respect are true Iowa values.        This senseless and tragic loss is difficult for everyone       here today. Our Department of Public Safety family, our Iowa       State Patrol Family, you know we're hurting but we're not       broken. We are struggling but we're not lost. And we're       deeply saddened but we will work to find peace in the days       ahead. Commissioner Stephan Bayens and I are extremely proud       of the work you do each and every day. His expectation for       our leaders is we take the absolute best care of our       personnel. Rest assured that we are here for you and we will       keep you in our thoughts and prayers.        We will remain committed to serving Iowans with integrity,       fairness, respect, honesty, courage, and compassion. This       will be vital to our healing process and into the future. We       are here for our troopers, our special agents, our       communication specialists, our local law enforcement       partners, and our first responders. We must navigate through       this together, day by day, and week by week. We're going to       continue to do our job and we're going to do it well. We're       going to do it with confidence, professionalism, and       integrity. We will work together to establish a pathway to       heal while we honor Sgt. Jim Smith's sacrifice and his       legacy.        Jim's faith and family was the foundation of his life. He       loved being an Iowa State Trooper, but his job did not define       who he was. What defined him was his family, his faith, and       his true love for others. Sergeant Jim Smith worked for the       State Patrol for twenty-seven and a half years, and twenty-      five years on our tactical unit. During that time, he served       as a team leader. And he was a humble man with a tremendous       work ethic. Jim loved his job and he set an excellent example       for others to follow. He mentioned how his parents provided       him important qualities of hard work and determination that       led to his success. He provided strong leadership in District       Ten, alongside Lt. Senne, Sgt. O'Rear, and Sgt. Trimble. They       all speak highly of his character, his integrity, and his       commitment to do the right thing for the right reason. I       learned this week that Jim's biggest vice was chocolate milk.       Chocolate milk was a treat for him when he accomplished       something special. I'm sure most of us in this room today       wish chocolate milk was our biggest vice. This just speaks of       Jim's character and who he was.        On the Area C Tactical Team for the Iowa State Patrol, he       was extremely experienced in handling high-risk calls. He had       quiet confidence that provided reassurance to the Area C       Tactical Unit. This quiet confidence exhibited as `we got       this.' Jim was a sheepdog, that protected sheep. He always       wanted to be the number one man in the door. This was his       struggle with becoming a team leader on the tactical team,       was he would have to give up that number one position. Jim's       wife, Kathy, recently mentioned to the State Patrol staff why       he wanted to be the first to the door, and she now       understands it. His priority was to protect his people.        Captain Olmstead and several other leaders in the       organization challenged Jim to put in for a supervisory       position. He struggled with this. Jim would politely decline       and say, ``I love taking bad guys to jail and working the       road.'' And he did it well. He felt that if he was promoted       to become a supervisor he-couldn't do his road enforcement       responsibilities, to protect and serve. One day Jim called       Captain Olmstead and said he thought it was time to take on       the leadership and supervisory position. He knew he needed to       mentor young troopers, to show them what a work ethic and a       commitment to the organization and to the State of Iowa meant       to him. He went on to be promoted to sergeant and continue to       do what he loved while mentoring, leading by examples, and       encouraging troopers to work hard each and every day.        Jim was an extremely humble person that strove for       excellence in his work, was strong in his faith, and he       walked in Jesus' footsteps. He recently provided a sermon at       church entitled Act Your Age. He brought in a Superman       lunchbox and began to share the food that his wife, Kathy,       had prepared for him. Jim pulled out an apple and he said       that he asked his wife, Kathy, to pack him a Twinkie. He said       Kathy reminded him that ``we're not on a diet, we're just       making healthy life choices.'' But during that sermon he had       a powerful message, a message he wants you to hear today. Jim       said, ``I want my kids to know what's good and true.'' He       spoke of sacrificial love and that children are adorable       little creatures of God. He said that ``my kids fill my life       with love.'' His correlation with that sermon was that God       sees us as the children he created. You are a child of God,       act your age. He closed with, ``Cherish God, know that God       loves you, God still sees you as a child he created. So go to       him as a child, depend on him, love him, and seek to be loved       by him.'' It was a very captivating message he shared.        Family was extremely important to Jim. He often spoke of       his wife, Kathy, and he loved you deeply. He spoke of his       son, Zander, and his daughter, Jazlyn. He loved you two very       much. He loved spending time with both of you and telling       stories to all the troopers about the trips you took and the       quality time you spent together. And that meant the world to       him. He often spoke to the troopers--he was trying to be a       good role model and a good father, and spoke of the dreams he       had for both of you two. He wanted to be a good example for       you. He wanted to lead you down a path of faith and to set       you up for success in life. You both made him an extremely       proud father.        I've been struggling to find the right words to comfort us       all today. As we walk through this together, seeking to find       a sense of purpose and a sense of peace, I don't have to look       for those words because Jim left them for us. These       handwritten words are from Jim. They were in his Bible, and       Kathy provided them to us this week. The words were, ``Don't       just know, do. Live in service. Know the goal, finish strong.       Teach with application. Don't just tell, show. Don't just       learn, do. Live out God's word. Live out faith. Teach, take       care of our family, but also change the world.''  [[Page S2062]]         1 Peter 2:21 says, ``For God called you to do good, even if       it means suffering, just as Christ suffered for you. He is       your example and you must follow in his footsteps.'' You       know, reflecting on Jim's life has impacted us all this week.       It has impacted me and challenged me to think about being the       best person I can be. So I've asked myself some tough       questions. Am I following in Jesus Christ's footsteps? Am I       following in Jim Smith's footsteps? Can I be a man that cares       for my community like Jim Smith cared for this community? Can       I be a man that loves my children like Jim Smith loved Zander       and Jazlyn? Can I be a man that loves my wife like Jim loved       his wife, Kathy? And can I be a man that loves the Lord Jesus       Christ, like Jim Smith loved the Lord, his God? We love you       Jim, we will see you again                            ____________________
