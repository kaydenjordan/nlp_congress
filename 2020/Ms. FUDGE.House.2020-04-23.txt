 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Madam Speaker, I wonder when this administration will treat all of  its citizens with the same concern. Yes, our small businesses need  additional support and our hospitals, too, but big banks should not  have access to any more money because they have really already taken  care of all of their friends.   I am happy our farmers are being helped, but what about hungry  people? The USDA has decided to buy meat and produce, put it in a box,  and send it to the unemployed through food banks. Why not just increase  SNAP benefits as we have requested?   When is the right time to fight for teachers and sanitation workers,  police, fire, and EMS?   When do we ensure prisoners are safe and are afforded appropriate  care?   When do we provide nursing homes with adequate resources?   When do we guarantee every child has access to distance learning?   When is it the right time to fight for those who can't afford to pay  2 or 3 months' rent at once?   Most Americans don't have the luxury of waiting for us to pick and  choose who gets help. We keep saying it will be in the next bill. Our  people need it now.
