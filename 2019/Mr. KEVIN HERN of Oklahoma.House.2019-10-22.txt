 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition  to H.R. 2513, the so-called Corporate Transparency Act. I fear that, in  the pursuit of ``transparency,'' my colleagues have crossed a line.   This bill would be more appropriately titled the Small Business  Registration and Surveillance Act because that is exactly what it would  do. This bill would require America's small business owners--those with  20 or fewer employees--to register their confidential information with  a Federal law enforcement and intelligence agency they have never heard  of and allow that agency to surveil them without a subpoena or a  warrant.   As a former small business owner for 34 years, I know that paperwork  is incredibly burdensome and small business owners have to file  paperwork themselves. Unlike the big banks, they don't have compliance  departments to fill this information out.   NFIB estimates that this legislation will cost small business owners  $5.7 billion over 10 years. CBO estimates that this bill will have a  significant impact on 25 to 30 million small businesses in America.  This is a slap in the face to the small business owners who are doing  everything they can to achieve the American Dream.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on H.R. 2513.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, Republican or Democrat, we  can all agree on this: When you have been accused of something, you  have the right to publicly defend yourself.   My colleagues across the aisle are making heinous accusations about  President Trump but are refusing to give him a voice in the process to  defend himself.   Any impeachment proceeding in the history of our country has operated  with full transparency and with a bipartisan effort, but that is not  what is happening here.   Subpoenas are flying right and left without any consultation of the  minority. Interrogations and hearings are happening in secret.   Why isn't the media demanding to be in the room instead of waiting  for individuals to come out and get cherry-picked information?   The American people deserve better.   If they had solid evidence or even a factual basis for impeachment,  they would be shouting it from the rooftops and broadcasting it on  every screen in America.   This is a sham process. It makes a mockery of our government.   We must end this illegitimate inquiry and return to the rules and  traditions that have governed this body for the last 232 years.                            ____________________
