 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 6374, the Fitness Information  Transparency Act of 2018. H.R. 6374 would require the Department of  Homeland Security to issue uniform standards to vet Federal contractors  seeking to work for the department.   Currently, there is no standard for vetting contractors to determine  their fitness to access DHS facilities, IT systems, and sensitive  information. Each  [[Page H7801]]  component has different standards, different procedures, and different  adjudicators for contractor fitness. Lack of a department-wide uniform  standard hinders reciprocity across the department. As a result, the  committee has received testimony that contractors who work for multiple  DHS components are investigated over and over and over again. What a  waste of time and resources.   Today, DHS contractors routinely wait 3 to 4 months, if not longer,  to be investigated, regardless of whether they have already been  determined to be fit by another DHS component. This wait time is costly  for not only the contractor, but it also hinders the ability of the  Department of Homeland Security to execute its mission.    Today, neither the contractor nor their employer is regularly  informed of the status of their investigation. Enactment of H.R. 6374  would help ensure that Federal contractor firms can access timely  information regarding the status of their employees' fitness  investigations.   Thanks to language that was authored by Representative Correa and  accepted in committee, H.R. 6374 also recognizes that weaknesses in DHS  fitness processes not only undermine the onboarding of Federal  contractors in a timely way but also the onboarding of new DHS  employees.   Representative Correa's amendment would require the department to  take steps to improve the suitability determination process for Federal  applicants and appointees and to report on the degree to which  components and offices are granting reciprocity to individuals who are  employed by other components or offices within the DHS.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support this measure. H.R.  6374 improves the Department of Homeland Security's contractor  investigation process by requiring a uniform set of standards,  encouraging reciprocity among components, and enhancing communication  between the department and the private sector.   It is our duty as Members of Congress to ensure processes are  followed and that such processes are effective and efficient. H.R. 6374  seeks to do just that.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support H.R. 6374, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 6447, the Department of  Homeland Security Chief Data Officer Authorization Act. H.R. 6447 would  require the Department of Homeland Security to designate a chief data  officer for the department. This official would be responsible for  coordinating the organization and integration of data across the  department for improved analysis and decisionmaking.   DHS generates, collects, and maintains vast quantities of data, but  has difficulty uniformly analyzing it because of its inconsistencies in  how data is collected and maintained throughout the department.                                time  1800    The chief data officer would serve as the lead official for  coordinating internal data processes to achieve data and  interoperability across DHS systems.   Importantly, H.R. 6447 includes language authored by the  Representative from Florida (Mrs. Demings) to delegate responsibility  for overseeing the Data Quality Act to the chief data officer.   Under the Data Quality Act, Federal agencies are required to issue  guidelines to maximize the quality, objectivity, utility, and integrity  of information, including statistical information they disseminate.  Additionally, the law requires agencies to establish mechanisms for  persons to correct data that does not comply with guidelines.   At this time, when truth is under assault, it is critical that there  be vigilant watchdogs to help ensure that information provided by the  Department of Homeland Security is accurate. With that, I encourage my  colleagues to support this measure.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no speakers on this bill,  and I am prepared to close.    Mr. Speaker, I am delighted to be here with my  friend, Mr. Katko, and I am prepared to close.   Mr. Speaker, enactment of H.R. 6447 would help improve DHS' ability  to integrate and analyze data and ensure the reliability of the data it  disseminates.   Further, it would help ensure that Congress is provided timely and  accurate data to facilitate effective oversight. As such, I encourage  my colleagues to support H.R. 6447.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 6265, the PreCheck is PreCheck  Act of 2018.   Mr. Speaker, in 2011, the Transportation Security Administration  launched the PreCheck program to expedite vetted, known travelers  through airport checkpoint screening. Today, TSA PreCheck is in more  than 200 airports nationwide, improving security by allowing TSA to  focus resources on the passengers it knows the least about who may pose  a higher risk to the aviation system.   While PreCheck has generally proven popular with passengers, there is  a concern that TSA has strayed from the program's original intent. In  an effort to manage checkpoint wait times, TSA has pushed travelers who  are not enrolled in PreCheck into expedited screening lanes.   While I recognize that large crowds of passengers waiting at  checkpoints could pose a security risk, the way to prevent long lines  is to staff checkpoints sufficiently, not to abuse the availability of  expedited screening lanes.   H.R. 6265 seeks to address this issue by requiring that PreCheck  lanes be used only by trusted travelers, with limited exceptions.   It also requires TSA to pilot a risk-modified screening concept under  which a new level of screening, somewhere between PreCheck expedited  screening and standard screening, could be provided to passengers who  TSA deems to pose a lower risk to security.                                time  1915    Finally, this bill pushes TSA to grow participation in the PreCheck  program by providing more innovative and convenient enrollment  opportunities for passengers.   This bill is a result of bipartisan work and builds upon legislation  that the Committee on Homeland Security ranking member, Mr. Thompson,  advanced in the last Congress; and it is my delight to work with the  current sponsor of this bill, Mr. Katko, as we move forward to ensure  that traveling passengers are always safe. I thank Mr. Katko for his  collaboration on this bill.   Mr. Speaker, in closing, Members on both sides of the aisle have been  frustrated by not only TSA's use of PreCheck lanes to address wait  times, but its failure to make significant progress in improving  PreCheck enrollment opportunities. Enactment of H.R. 6265 should help  TSA achieve its original vision for the PreCheck program.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 6461, the TSA National  Deployment Force Act.   Mr. Speaker, the Transportation Security Administration maintains a  National Deployment Force, or NDF, a volunteer force made up of  transportation security officers who are deployed to various locations  across the country in support of TSA's homeland security mission.   Today, the TSA Administrator is able to deploy this force to respond  rapidly to operational challenges at more than 440 airports where TSA  conducts security operations. Maintenance of this operational  capability would not be possible if TSA did not maintain a robust  federalized screening workforce.   TSA deploys the NDF to address hiring difficulties, seasonal demands,  severe weather conditions, and periods of relief and recovery following  a natural disaster or other major incident, as well as to support  securing national security events, again, such as the Super Bowl and  national political conventions. In particular, the NDF was critical to  ensuring TSA could continue to operate fully in the aftermath of  Hurricane Sandy after that storm devastated my region of the country.   Notably, TSA has called upon the NDF to fill staffing gaps at  airports where private screening companies operating under TSA's  screening partnership program are unable to hire enough officers. My  bill authorizes the NDF to ensure its work continues and directs TSA to  report to Congress on the NDF's activities to ensure proper oversight.   Because officers serving on the NDF often go above and beyond,  leaving their homes and families on short notice, my bill authorizes  TSA to consider service in this force as a positive factor when  evaluating applicants for promotions within TSA.   The NDF is a critical component of TSA's homeland security efforts,  and I urge my colleagues to support this measure.   Mr. Speaker, in closing, in recent years, we have seen TSA face a  wide array of challenges, including complex threat streams, lengthy  wait times, and the need to reopen airports quickly after natural  disasters. The NDF provides TSA with the operational flexibility it  needs to maintain the security of our country's transportation systems  in the face of these challenges.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my partner on the Transportation and Protective  Security Subcommittee, Mr. Katko, as well as my other colleagues for  their support, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 6438, the DHS Countering  Unmanned Aircraft Systems Coordinator Act.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 6438 directs the Department of Homeland Security to  have a designated official to coordinate the Department's unmanned  aircraft systems, or UAS, plans and policies.   The countering UAS coordinator would work with Department components  and offices to ensure testing, evaluation, or deployment of systems to  identify, assess, or defeat a UAS threat are in compliance with  applicable Federal laws. The coordinator would also serve as the  principal Department official responsible for disseminating information  to the private sector regarding counter-UAS technology.   In homeland security circles, there is broad recognition that UAS  technology enhances capabilities to, among other things, deliver  disaster relief to affected areas and surveil weak spots along the  southwest border.   At the same time, Mr. Speaker, today, there is considerable concern  regarding the security threats that UAS may pose. More and more, we  hear of instances where unmanned aircraft systems, commonly referred to  as drones, are used for nefarious reasons, such as smuggling operations  or to conduct surveillance to evade law enforcement. The threat was  underscored last month when a drone was used in an unsuccessful  assassination attempt on the life of the Venezuelan President as he  spoke at a massive military parade.   As such, I support DHS organizing itself to better address this  emerging homeland security threat, as set forth in H.R. 6438.   There is increasingly more concern regarding the potential threats  that UAS may pose to the security of our Nation and its people.   Last Congress, when I served as the ranking member of the Oversight  and Management Efficiency Subcommittee with Mr. Perry, we worked  together on legislation that I drafted to address the UAS threat. Since  that time, the range of threats associated with UAS has grown more  complex and demand that DHS prioritize counter-UAS efforts in an  unprecedented way. Designating an official to coordinate Department  counter-UAS plans and policies is a step in the right direction.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Perry) for  his work on this measure, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 6400, the United States Ports  of Entry Threat and Operational Review Act.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 6400 would require the Department of Homeland  Security to conduct an analysis of the threats and operations at all  United States air, land, and sea ports of entry.   Following the completion of the threat analysis, H.R. 6400 requires  the Department to produce a strategy and implementation plan to  mitigate such threats. The strategy and implementation plan must  include consideration of improvements needed at the ports of entry to  reduce wait times and facilitate the lawful movement of trade, travel,  and people.   This bill is modeled after the Northern Border Security Review Act,  which was signed into law in 2016. Most of what is required in this  measure is already being done by the Department. What H.R. 6400 would  do is bring together various mandated materials into one report. The  Department should be able to carry out this new mandate in a way that  is not duplicative of other efforts.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support H.R. 6400, a  measure that directs DHS to take a holistic approach to protecting our  ports of entry, vital gateways for trade and travel.   Speaking of the need for a holistic approach to homeland security, I  would be remiss if I did not acknowledge that the Department's  Quadrennial Homeland Security Review is 247 days overdue.   Pursuant to section 707 of the Homeland Security Act, the Department  is required to produce this overarching strategy every 4 years. As the  author of the Quadrennial Homeland Security Review Technical  Corrections Act of 2017, a measure aimed at improving the quality of  future reviews that is pending in the Senate, I strongly believe that  DHS needs to do a better job of prioritizing its vast array of homeland  security mission areas.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
