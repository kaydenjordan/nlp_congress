 Madam Speaker, I have heard from so many working  families across central and northwestern Illinois who feel like they  are left behind.   Big corporations report record profits while workers struggle to make  ends meet. Let's remember that it was the American worker who built  this country, and it was the workers coming together to bargain  collectively who built a strong middle class.   The PRO Act is the most significant update to workers' rights in 80  years, and it couldn't come soon enough.   When workers have the power to stand together and form a union, they  get higher wages, better benefits, and safer working conditions.  [[Page H992]]    I was proud to help introduce the PRO Act, and I urge Members of  Congress to pass it so we can protect the right to organize, rebuild  our middle class, and improve the lives of working families in Illinois  and across our great Nation.                            ____________________
