 Madam President, today I wish to give notice of my intent  to object to any unanimous consent agreement regarding Senate Executive  Calendar No. 367, the nomination of Daniel Jorjani to be Solicitor at  the Department of the Interior.   Recently released documents reveal that, during Mr. Jorjani's  confirmation hearing before the U.S. Senate Energy and Natural  Resources Committee, he knowingly gave misleading and untruthful  testimony about the Department's Freedom of Information Act--FOIA-- policy.   Department officials appear to have created a policy with regard to  the Freedom of Information Act allowing political appointees to delay  and thwart the release of information to the public. Worse still, when  I asked Mr. Jorjani about this policy, he told me it didn't exist.   Attempts by political appointees at the Department to delay,  stonewall, and otherwise inhibit public and congressional oversight are  completely unacceptable. This sort of rank political interference with  government accountability runs contrary to the very basis of our form  of government.   On February 28, 2019, the Department issued an updated version of its  formal ``Awareness Review'' policy, which outlines the Department's  review process for FOIA document productions. However, based on  documents obtained through multiple FOIA requests, it appears the  Department has a supplemental process for document productions that has  not previously been made public.   Mr. Jorjani appeared before the U.S. Senate Energy and Natural  Resources Committee on May 2, 2019, for his confirmation hearing to  serve as the Department's Solicitor. During Mr. Jorjani's hearing and  in written testimony he provided the Committee shortly thereafter, he  told me this supplemental awareness review process did not exist.   Currently, the Department's inspector general is conducting a review  of Interior's FOIA policies. In addition, I have asked the U.S.  Department of Justice to look into whether Mr. Jorjani perjured himself  before the committee.   I cannot condone the movement of Mr. Jorjani's nomination. Therefore,  I will object to any unanimous consent agreement to consider Mr.  Jorjani's nomination.                            ____________________
