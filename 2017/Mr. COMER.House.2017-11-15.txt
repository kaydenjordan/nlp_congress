 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 2873) to designate the facility of the United States Postal  Service located at 207 Glenside Avenue in Wyncote, Pennsylvania, as the  ``Staff Sergeant Peter Taub Post Office Building''.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2873         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from  Kentucky (Mr. Comer) and the gentlewoman from New Jersey (Mrs. Watson  Coleman) each will control 20 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Kentucky.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on the bill under consideration.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Kentucky?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on the bill under consideration.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Kentucky?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2873, introduced by the  gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Brendan F. Boyle).   The bill names the United States Post Office at 207 Glenside Avenue  in Wyncote, Pennsylvania, after U.S. Air Force Staff Sergeant Peter  Taub.   During his service, Staff Sergeant Taub participated in more than 12  combat missions in hostile areas.   Staff Sergeant Taub was killed in action on December 21, 2015, in an  ambush suicide attack in Afghanistan. He gave his life in service to  this Nation.   I thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Brendan F. Boyle) for  introducing this bill to honor the bravery and sacrifice of Staff  Sergeant Taub.   I urge my colleagues to support this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.   Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to join my colleagues in consideration of  H.R. 2873, a bill to designate the facility of the United States Post  Office located at 207 Glenside Avenue in Wyncote, Pennsylvania, as the  Staff Sergeant Peter Taub Post Office Building.   A native of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Mr. Taub was inspired by his  grandfather's World War II military service to join the Air Force in  2007. He loaded missiles for F-15 fighter jets in Japan before  transferring to Ellsworth Air Force Base in South Dakota, where he  specialized in arming B-1 bombers.   In 2013, after earning his bachelor's degree in cybersecurity, Peter  became a special agent in the Air Force Office of Special  Investigations and participated in over a dozen combat missions through  hostile areas.   On December 21, 2015, while in Afghanistan, Staff Sergeant Taub gave  his life, along with four of his fellow airmen, when his unit was  ambushed in a suicide attack. He was posthumously awarded the Bronze  Star, Purple Heart, Air Force Commendation Medal, and Air Force Combat  Action Medal, and he leaves behind a beloved wife and two children.   Mr. Speaker, we should pass this bill to honor Staff Sergeant Peter  Taub's bravery and remember the ultimate sacrifice he made to protect  our Nation.   I urge the passage of H.R. 2873.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I reserve the  balance of my time.   Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume  to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Brendan F. Boyle).   Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I thank my  colleague from not too far away in Trenton, New Jersey, as well as my  colleague from the Commonwealth of Kentucky.   Today, I rise in support of H.R. 2873, a bill to designate the  facility of the United States Postal Service located at 207 Glenside  Avenue in Wyncote, Pennsylvania, as the Staff Sergeant Peter Taub Post  Office Building.   Staff Sergeant Taub, a constituent of my 13th Congressional District  of Pennsylvania, was a shining example of the best our country has to  offer. He exemplified unwavering patriotism and heroic bravery.   Peter made the ultimate sacrifice for his country when a suicide  bomber took his life in Afghanistan in December 2015. Renaming the  Wyncote Post Office in his hometown is really the least we can do to  honor him. It is a small but important symbol of our eternal thanks. I  am here today urging the House to pass my legislation to do just that.   Peter was born on November 2, 1985, in my hometown of Philadelphia,  to his parents, Joel Taub and Arlene Wagner. Peter was then raised in  Wyncote,  [[Page H9294]]  Pennsylvania, and graduated from Cheltenham High School in 2004.   His mother, Arlene, and brother, Jonathan, run the very popular  Washington, D.C., sandwich shop called Bub and Pop's.   Peter was inspired by his grandfather's service in World War II, so  he enlisted in the Air Force in December of 2007 after attending  community college for some time.   During his career in the military, Peter was assigned to a base in  Japan, where he loaded missiles onto F-15 fighter jets. Three years  later, he was transferred to Ellsworth Air Force Base in South Dakota,  where he specialized in arming B-1 bombers.   Peter went on to obtain a bachelor's degree in cybersecurity and was  hired as a special agent in the Air Force Office of Special  Investigations in December 2013. During his service, Peter participated  in more than 12 combat missions in hostile areas.   Peter was killed, along with four other airmen, in a suicide ambush  attack in Afghanistan on December 21, 2015.   Peter is survived by his wife, Christina; their 3-year-old daughter,  Penelope; and another daughter, Petra, who was born after Peter's death  in the summer of 2016.   President Obama paid tribute to Peter, as well as the other troops  who were killed in the attack, calling their service ``outstanding''  and ``brave.'' I second those descriptions.   Posthumously, Peter was awarded the Bronze Star, the Purple Heart,  the Air Force Commendation Medal, and the Air Force Combat Action  Medal.   It is my hope that, with this legislation, the 13th District of the  Commonwealth of Pennsylvania will pay daily tribute to the memory of  one of our heroes, Staff Sergeant Peter Taub.   Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the bill, and I yield back  the balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the  gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Comer) that the House suspend the rules  and pass the bill, H.R. 2873.   The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the  rules were suspended and the bill was passed.   A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 3109) to designate the facility of the United States Postal  Service located at 1114 North 2nd Street in Chillicothe, Illinois, as  the ``Sr. Chief Ryan Owens Post Office Building''.

The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 3109           Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives       of the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SR. CHIEF RYAN OWENS POST OFFICE BUILDING.           (a) Designation.--The facility of the United States       Postal Service located at 1114 North 2nd Street in       Chillicothe, Illinois, shall be known and designated as the       ``Sr. Chief Ryan Owens Post Office Building''.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Kentucky?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3109, introduced by the  gentleman from Illinois (Mr. LaHood). The bill names the United States  Post Office at 1114 North 2nd Street in Chillicothe, Illinois, after  U.S. Navy SEAL Senior Chief Ryan Owens, who was killed in action in  Yemen earlier this year.   Mr. Speaker, I yield as much time as he may consume to the gentleman  from Illinois (Mr. LaHood) to further describe the bill and Senior  Chief Owens' service to his country.   Mr. LaHOOD. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Kentucky for  yielding the time for this important legislation.   On January 29, 2017, U.S. Navy Chief Special Warfare Operator William  ``Ryan'' Owens was killed during a raid in Yemen. At the age of 36, he  gave the ultimate sacrifice in order to protect our great Nation.  Today, he is survived by his wife, Carryn, and their three young  children.   Ryan Owens grew up in Edelstein, Illinois, in my congressional  district, a town that is in a very rural area with barely one stop  sign. Friends and family say that, even at a very early age, Ryan knew  he wanted to serve his country as a Navy SEAL.   After graduating from Illinois Valley Central High School in  Chillicothe, Illinois, in 1998, he took the first steps towards his  goal by enlisting in the Navy.   Ryan served his first tour of duty at the Office of Naval  Intelligence in Suitland, Maryland, eventually completing his SEAL  training in California in 2002. Over the next 15 years, he completed  four tours as a U.S. Navy SEAL, working all over the globe to fight  against terrorism and protect the interests of the United States.   Ryan was 2 years into his fifth tour as a Navy SEAL when he was  tragically killed during an intelligence-gathering operation against an  al-Qaida cell in Yemen.   Throughout his 15 years as a Navy SEAL, Ryan Owens gave much to our  country, protecting our freedoms, and helping rid the world of evil. It  is for these reasons that I introduced H.R. 3109, which will rename the  post office in Chillicothe, Illinois, as the Sr. Chief Ryan Owens Post  Office Building.   My office and I worked closely with the U.S. Postal Service, the U.S.  Navy Congressional Liaison's Office, the Central Illinois Gold Star  Families, and, most importantly, Ryan's family. All of us were  determined to make sure we got this right, choosing a location with  strong ties to the community in which Ryan grew up. In the end, it was  his wife, Carryn, who decided on Chillicothe, the town where Ryan  attended and graduated high school, as the best place for this building  to be renamed in his honor.                                time  1530    I was proud to introduce our bill with overwhelming bipartisan  support here in the House with every member of the Illinois delegation  signing on as a cosponsor in support. It is my hope that the House acts  to pass this bill today and that the Senate will quickly follow suit.   While we can never repay Chief Owens or his family for the sacrifices  he made, renaming the post office in his honor is a small way to thank  him for his service and dedication to protecting our great Nation and  the values that we hold so dear. We continue, today, to pray for Carryn  and his children. We are indebted to his service and his sacrifice to  our great country.   Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to join my colleagues in consideration of  H.R. 3109, a bill to designate the facility of the United States Post  Office located at 1114 North 2nd Street in Chillicothe, Illinois, as  the Sr. Chief Ryan Owens Post Office Building.   A native of Edelstein, Illinois, Ryan Owens graduated from Illinois  Valley Central High School and joined the Navy in 1998.   Ryan served at the Office of Naval Intelligence before completing  SEAL training and was selected as a chief petty officer in 2009.   While on his fifth tour of duty with the elite SEAL Team Six, Ryan  sustained wounds in a firefight and succumbed to his injuries on  January 29, 2017.   Ryan's dedicated service has been recognized through a number of  awards  [[Page H9295]]  and medals, including the Navy and Marine Corps Medal, a Bronze Star  and Bronze Stars with Combat V, a Joint Service Achievement Medal, and  three Presidential Unit Citations.   Mr. Speaker, we should pass this bill to honor the heroism of Sr.  Chief Ryan Owens and recognize the ultimate sacrifice he made for our  country.   Mr. Speaker, I urge the passage of H.R. 3109, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. Taylor).

In those three decades, we have  seen unbelievable progress in technology, communications,  manufacturing, and so much more. I am thrilled we now have a chance to  pass meaningful tax reform, an opportunity to finally move to a Tax  Code that works for families, small businesses, and Americans across  the board.   We have a once-in-a-generation chance to bolster middle class  prosperity, strengthen our economy, and help America's global  competitiveness. These are not just abstract concepts. These are real  people, families, businesses, and workers.   Over this past year, I have traveled through the 35 counties that I  represent, and I have been so impressed by the countless Kentuckians  who are working to bring jobs of the future into rural America. Unlike  these innovative entrepreneurs, our Tax Code is, unfortunately, stuck  in the past.   Like many of my constituents in the First District, I run a family  farm and have experienced the challenges of dealing with an outdated  and cumbersome Tax Code. know firsthand the difficulties small  businesses face when they try to operate, grow, and hire more workers  while battling a Tax Code that does not work for them. Passing tax  reform is finally within reach, and I enthusiastically support swift  passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.    Throughout our Nation's history, small businesses have served as the  backbone of our communities. These companies provide high-quality jobs,  contribute to their local communities, and invest money right here at  home. That is why I am dedicated to enacting tax relief that allows  American small-business owners to keep more of their hard-earned tax  dollars, to grow their businesses, and to compete globally.   This bill will create almost 13,000 new jobs in the Commonwealth of  Kentucky and will raise after-tax income for middle class families by  almost $2,000. More than 59,000 taxpayers in the First District itemize  their taxes, and because of the near doubling of the standard deduction  and other simplifications, many of our taxpayers will have much simpler  returns. And for our Nation, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will generate  economic growth adequate to increase Federal tax receipts by $1  trillion.   In the First District of Kentucky, there are nearly 44,000 taxpayers  who earn small business income. Under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, small- business owners will benefit from the new lower 9 percent tax rate on  the first $75,000 of their business income for owners earning less than  $150,000. Families and small businesses will have more opportunities to  succeed with this framework.                                time  1930    Additionally, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act reduces the number of  deductions and credits aimed at special interests and other well- connected groups, which will create a simpler, more level playing field  for American taxpayers. Getting rid of these special privileges in the  Tax Code will ensure that all Americans, not just those who can afford  their own tax preparers, get to keep more of their own money.   President Trump, my colleagues in Congress and I have promised to  deliver tax reform in a big way. I am proud to be keeping this promise  now. My constituents deserve a system that enables them to keep more of  their hard-earned money and spend less of their time dealing with our  overly complicated Tax Code.   I think it is important to address a concern that I have heard  throughout the tax reform debate, one that I take very seriously: our  national debt, which currently tops $20 trillion and is growing every  day. The debt is a serious problem that poses an impediment to growth,  a burden on our future, and a threat to our national security.   While I am glad to finally hear bipartisan interest in addressing  this challenge and getting the deficit under control, I think it is  clear that any solution must include reducing government spending,  particularly on mandatory programs that are the major drivers of our  debt. I look forward to continuing to work towards this goal.   The last time we addressed our Tax Code was when President Reagan was  in office. Sticking with the Tax Code we have had for decades, one that  leaves U.S. businesses and workers behind, is not an option. Now, I  have high hopes for the future with this tax reform framework.   I will continue fighting for reform that will benefit Kentuckians and  our Nation as a whole, and I look forward to supporting progrowth  solutions that have proven to benefit our Nation and our citizens.
