 Mr. President, this morning, the Senate continues to  send its prayers to all the victims of yesterday's horrific shooting.  We know our House colleagues are all thinking about their colleague,  Majority Whip Scalise. It has been an immensely difficult 24 hours for  all the victims, including Matt Mika, who remains in ICU, Zach Barth,  and, of course, Capitol Police Officers Crystal Griner and David  Bailey. Those officers didn't back down when faced with this threat.  Instead, as the Capitol Police always do, they put themselves in harm's  way to help protect others. Without them, we know so many more would  have been injured.   So we want to continue to express our gratitude to all those who  graciously put their lives on the line to keep the Capitol community  safe. In doing so, we are also reminded of the bravery of our  colleagues on the field yesterday--those who stepped in to help friends  who had been injured as they waited for first responders to arrive. I  think it says something about the character of those people as well.   The events of yesterday were devastating, and we know it will take  time to heal. But for now, the members of the congressional baseball  team have made the decision to go forward with tonight's game, which  will be played for charity. I know we will be thinking about each of  them as they take the field tonight.   Mr. President, the Senate today will take a final vote on the  bipartisan first step to hold Iran and Russia accountable. This follows  overwhelmingly bipartisan action yesterday to approve the Russia  sanctions amendment, an effort that would not have been possible  without the good work of our Foreign Relations Committee chairman,  Senator Corker, and our Banking chair, Senator Crapo, and their ranking  members.   After 8 years of failed foreign policy under the Obama  administration, 8 years of following the Obama administration's  preferred strategy of drawing down both our forces and our commitments,  we must take a stronger stance in deterring Iran and holding its regime  accountable for its actions and addressing Russia's years-long pattern  of provocations.   These sanctions, which are just one of our foreign policy tools, will  only work as part of a broader effort to rebuild our military force  structure and combat readiness in order to send a strong signal to  friend and foe alike. The United States should no longer stand by and  allow threats like these to go unaddressed.   When the administration completes its series of strategic reviews, I  will  [[Page S3506]]  look forward to hearing from the President and his advisers their  recommendations for countering Iran's malign conduct across the Middle  East and their recommendations for countering Russia's persistent  efforts to undermine NATO.   As I said earlier this week, this Iran and Russia sanctions agreement  reflects good bipartisan work. I want to thank Senators on both sides  of the aisle for coming together to codify and strengthen existing  sanctions. Let's come together again now and pass these sanctions later  this morning.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  title amendment at the desk be agreed to.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that at 5  p.m. on Monday, June 19, the Senate proceed to executive session for  consideration of Executive Calendar No. 108. I further ask that there  be 30 minutes of debate on the nomination, equally divided in the usual  form, and that following the use or yielding back of time, the Senate  vote on confirmation of the nomination with no intervening action or  debate; and that if confirmed, the motion to reconsider be considered  made and laid upon the table and the President be immediately notified  of the Senate's actions.    Madam President, I move to proceed to executive  session to consider Calendar No. 94.    Madam President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.    Madam President, I move to proceed to legislative  session.    Madam President, I move to proceed to executive  session to consider Calendar No. 97.    Madam President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  mandatory quorum call with respect to both cloture motions be waived.    Mr. President, I thank my friend from Delaware.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  be in a period of morning business, with Senators permitted to speak  therein for up to 10 minutes each.
