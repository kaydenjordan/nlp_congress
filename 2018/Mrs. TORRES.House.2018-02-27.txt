 Mr. Speaker, I was unavoidably detained and was thus  unable to cast my vote on rollcall votes 83, 84, 85, 86, and 87. Had I  been present, I would have voted ``nay'' on rollcall No. 83, ``nay'' on  rollcall No. 84, ``nay'' on rollcall No. 85, ``nay'' on rollcall No.  86, and ``nay'' on rollcall No. 87.                            ____________________
