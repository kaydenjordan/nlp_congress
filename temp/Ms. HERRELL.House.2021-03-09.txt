 Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to call up H.R.  682, the Reopen Schools Act, to get our kids out from behind screens  and back in the classroom.    Madam Speaker, I just rise in opposition to this.   Madam Speaker, I would say it is more disingenuous for this body to  pretend to tell the American people that we are doing something good  for their children when, in fact, more money in this bill is going to  help one Democratic district in California than is going to help all of  the COVID relief efforts.   We have got our priorities very wrong. Our children are the future.   And thank God that the Senate took the $15-an-hour minimum wage out  of this because that was another nail in the coffin for our small  business owners. But to sit here and think we are doing something  special for our constituents, that is not really truthful. We are doing  something special for Speaker Pelosi and a lot of others who want big  bailouts for the Democratic cities.    We can do better. We can do better for our students and for our  families because those are the people in the trenches. Our future  depends on it. Our students depend on it. We need to put our children  back in school and we need to open our economy.
