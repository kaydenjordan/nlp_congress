 Mr. Speaker, who are we if we cannot honor and  celebrate those who have given their ultimate in the National Police  Week?  [[Page H2247]]    I want to say to my hometown law enforcement that we mourn Jason  Michael Knox, Harold Lloyd Preston, Lemuel Bruce, and Mark C. Brown.   We mourn Christopher Brown, and we mourn Johnny Ramos Sanchez. We  mourn Juan Menchaca, we mourn Raymond Scholwinski, and we mourn Ernest  Leal.   We thank them. They are our family members, our brothers and sisters.  We honor them and express our appreciation for their laying down their  lives to save children and to take families out of burning buildings.   We acknowledge Houston law enforcement officers who are now  memorialized on the wall of honor, which I intend to introduce into  this body's Record.   Then I want to acknowledge the legislation that I hope my colleagues  will sign, and that is, to honor those who stood tall and fought for us  on January 6. This resolution will tell us their story, and that is why  I stand today to tell the story of those who have sacrificed for us in  this week. They are our family. We honor them, and we mourn them.   Mr. Speaker, as a member of the Law Enforcement Caucus and the Chair  of the Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, and Homeland  Security, I know well the service and sacrifice of our neighbors in law  enforcement, both in my hometown of Houston, Texas and here in the  Capitol.   I would like to take this minute to honor those fallen heroes in the  City of Houston over the last year, and would like to reiterate our  support for our polices officers across the nation and here at the  capitol for their duty and sacrifice in the defense of ourselves and  our communities.   It is altogether fitting and proper that we do this.   Among those fallen Texans are:   Sergeant Harold Lloyd Preston of the Houston Police Department with  41 years on the force whose watch ended on October 20, 2020, when he  was fired upon while responding to a call for assistance involving a  domestic disturbance.   Officer Jason Michael Knox of the Houston Police Department, whose  watch ended on May 2, 2020, when his aircraft experienced operation  control issues and crashed into an unoccupied building during a search  mission.   Investigator Lemuel Bruce of the Houston Fire Marshal's Office, whose  watch ended on October 16, 2020, due to an ambush while conducting  surveillance as part of an ongoing arson investigation.   And those officers who risked exposure to the COVID-19 pandemic in  their tireless pursuit for justice and against violence, who contracted  the virus in the course of their duties, and who eventually succumbed  to the deadly virus:   Investigator Mark C. Brown of the Harris County Constable's Office,  whose watch ended on July 26, 2020;   Deputy Sheriff Johnny Tunches of the Harris County Sheriff's Office,  whose watch ended November 2, 2020;   Deputy Juan Menchaca, Jr. of the Harris County Sheriff's Office,  whose watch ended June 13, 2020;   Sergeant Raymond Scholwinski of the Harris County Sheriff's Office,  whose watch ended May 6, 2020; and   Senior Officer Ernest Leal of the Houston Police Department, whose  watch ended on November 27, 2020.   The National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial is the Nation's  monument to law enforcement officers who have died in the line of duty.   Dedicated on October 15, 1991, the Memorial honors federal, state and  local law enforcement officers who have made the ultimate sacrifice for  the safety and protection of our nation and its people.   Carved on its walls are the names of 22,611 officers who have been  killed in the line of duty throughout U.S. history, dating back to the  first known death in 1791.   Added to the Wall this year will be the names of 295 police officers  killed in the line of duty in 2020.   2020 was one of the deadliest years for law enforcement officers in  history.   Mr. Speaker, enshrined on the Memorial Wall of Honor also are the  names of 2,052 fallen peace officers from the state of Texas, the most  of any state, including 116 members of the Houston Police Department  who gave their lives to keep their city safe.   Mr. Speaker, today there are more than 800,000 law enforcement  personnel serving the people of our country, the highest amount ever.   About 12 percent of them are female.   These brave men and women risk their lives to keep the peace and keep  us safe but they are too often taken by the violence they are working  to prevent.   Every 58 hours, a law enforcement officer is killed somewhere in the  United States.   There are also 58,627 assaults against our law officers each year,  resulting in 16,667 injuries.   Mr. Speaker, on January 6, 2021, the then-President of the United  States encouraged his followers to ``fight like hell'' to disrupt and  derail the constitutionally required Joint Meeting of Congress to open,  count, and publicly confirm the vote tally of the Presidential electors  and announce the persons who had been elected President and Vice  President of the United States.   What followed was thousands of domestic terrorists, insurrectionists,  and rioters charging the Capitol Building, the bastion of American  democracy, with metal pipes, chemical irritants, and other weapons.   In their way the officers of the United States Capitol Police  Department, the Metropolitan Police Department of Washington, DC, and  other uniformed law enforcement officers stood their ground in defense  of American democracy.   There is no finer example of the selfless devotion to duty and love  of country, than these officers' valiant, heroic, and courageous  response to the assault on the Capitol Building.   At least 138 officers, 73 from the United States Capitol Police  Department, and 65 from the Metropolitan Police Department of  Washington DC, sustained injuries during the attack on the Capitol  Building, several of whom required hospitalization.   The seven hours between the urgent call for help from the Capitol  Police to the Metropolitan Police Department and the resumption of work  by both Houses of Congress will be indelibly etched in the memories of  every law enforcement officer who was on the scene, as it is in the  minds of the Senators, Representatives, congressional and support  staff, and members of the media corps who were forced to seek safety  behind locked doors.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to represent the people of the 18th  Congressional District of Texas in paying tribute to the 295 fallen  heroes who will be joining the 22,611 gallant men and women who gave  the last full measure of devotion to the communities they took an oath  to protect and serve.   Mr. Speaker, I ask for a moment of silence in memory of the 295  officers whose names will be added to the National Law Enforcement  Officers Memorial.
