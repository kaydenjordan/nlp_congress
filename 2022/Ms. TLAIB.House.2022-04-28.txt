 Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to recognize the city of River  Rouge, Michigan, as they celebrate a 100-year anniversary.   Established as a city on April 3, 1922, River Rouge is a rich part of  Michigan's history. It is situated between the Detroit and Rouge  Rivers. The city of River Rouge has been the heart of Michigan's  industrial and manufacturing history.   Nearly 8,000 residents strong, the city of River Rouge takes pride in  its role as being an integral part of Michigan's economy. They are the  jewel of Michigan's downriver communities.   It continues to thrive as a diverse, vibrant, and welcoming community  that I truly love.   Its public parks and access to river recreation offer unique  opportunities for enjoying nature and spotting wildlife along the  riverfronts.   Please join me in recognizing the city of River Rouge as we join them  in celebrating its 100-year anniversary.   Again, I am beyond proud of serving this beautiful city of River  Rouge and its residents in Michigan's 13th District Strong.                            ____________________
