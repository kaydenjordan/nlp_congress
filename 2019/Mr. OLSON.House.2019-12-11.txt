 Mr. Speaker, a Texas legend, Houston Oilers Coach Bum  Phillips, said this about Hall of Famer Earl Campbell:         Earl may not be in a class by himself, but whatever class       he is in, it don't take long to call the roll.    Those exact words apply to our retired city manager, Allan Bogard.  Allan is retiring after 19 years running our city.   Sugar Land is Sugar Land because of Allan. He created Sugar Land Town  Center, brought Constellation Field, brought Minute Maid's headquarters  to Sugar Land, made our airport number one in its class in America, all  this while keeping a AAA bond rating.   Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the 130,000 Texans who live in Sugar Land,  Allan has given us a motto for all time: In Sugar Land, our sugar is so  sweet, we have no Equal.                            ____________________
