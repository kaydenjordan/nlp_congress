 Mr. President, reserving the right to object.                      Unanimous Consent Request--S. 2798    Mr. President, I support whistleblowers, and I do think they have a  role to play in keeping government accountable. They should not lose  their jobs or be prosecuted because of their willingness to speak, but  what we have seen over the last few years is that we have a system that  we should continue to refine.  [[Page S6429]]    When Edward Snowden exposed the breadth of unconstitutional  government spying, that everything you do can be seen and stored by the  government without cause, without an individualized order, in secret,  in bulk, in defiance of the Fourth Amendment, not one finger was raised  by those voices who are so proud now to defend whistleblowers, not one  of them stood up for Edward Snowden.   Many, in fact, in Congress condemned him. They wanted to bring him to  trial. Senators talked about hanging him from the closest tree, about  executing him. People called into question his motives. Hillary Clinton  implied that Edward Snowden was a foreign spy. Chuck Schumer, who now  has such outrage and defense of the whistleblower statute, lifted not  one finger for Edward Snowden. In fact, he called him a coward.   So really I think that the outrage we see here is selective outrage,  and it is because they are intent on overturning the election of the  people. They are intent on removing Trump from office, no matter what,  and they will use whatever means they can to do it.   Interestingly though, despite all of these people calling Edward  Snowden a traitor, Congress ended up abolishing the bulk collection  program that he exposed. Congress knew that they had done something  illegal by collecting all of your metadata, all of your phone call  data, without the permission of a judge and that it violated the Fourth  Amendment.   They knew that he had probably become the greatest whistleblower of  all time; yet where are the voices defending Edward Snowden now? Not  one of these people who fake outrage over this whistleblower and  President Trump and impeachment--not one of them will stand up for  Edward Snowden. They would still put him in jail for life, if they  could.   In the end, we did end bulk collection because Edward Snowden bravely  came forward and said that the government was lying to us, that James  Clapper, now a big President Trump hater, came before the Senate and he  lied directly to Senator Wyden when he said: We are not collecting your  data.   Yet where is Edward Snowden in all of this, as these great defenders  of the whistleblower statute are here? Not a word for Edward Snowden.  Snowden himself said that he didn't have adequate protection to bring  his claims internally because he was a government contractor and not an  employee and not subject to the whistleblower statute.    Subsequently, Congress fixed that. Now, contractors in the  intelligence community can make whistleblower claims. I agree with  that. There are also now protections for some other contractors. We  should extend and expand the protections, and we should make this  protection retroactive to account for people like Snowden.   So the bill I will introduce today will expand the Whistleblower Act,  it will be made retroactive so Edward Snowden can come home to live in  his own country. All he did was expose that his government was not  obeying the Constitution. If this fake outrage here is really towards  whistleblowing, why don't we make it retroactive and defend the most  famous whistleblower of all time? That is what my bill would do.   While Snowden's disclosures were in defense of the Fourth Amendment,  the Sixth Amendment guarantees an individual the right to face their  accuser; yet the House of Representatives has been conducting a secret  impeachment inquiry based on secret claims made by a secret  whistleblower.   My bill would make clear that the Sixth Amendment is not superseded  by statutes and that the President should be afforded the same rights  that we all should, to understand the nature of the allegations brought  against them and to face their accuser. This is in the Sixth Amendment.   So for all the caterwauling about whistleblower statutes, there is a  high law of the land. It is the Constitution. It is the Bill of Rights.  The Sixth Amendment says if you are accused of a crime, you get to face  your accuser.   In fact, there was a resolution last week placed by 50 members of the  Republican Caucus that condemns the process going on in the House. It  condemns it because it says specifically, in the resolution signed by  50 Republicans, that the President should get to face his accusers,  that he should have counsel and call on witnesses and to understand the  basis of the charges against him.   See, here is the thing: The whistleblower should be called because  they are making accusations against the President. That is the Sixth  Amendment. We don't do away with the Sixth Amendment because we are  talking about impeachment or talking about the President. But the  whistleblower is also a material witness. The whistleblower is a  material witness because he worked for Joe Biden. He worked for Joe  Biden when Joe Biden and Hunter Biden were involved in corruption in  Ukraine.   This person worked on the Ukraine desk. This person traveled to  Ukraine. This person was involved with aid. So when Joe Biden says we  are going to deny aid to Ukraine unless you hire a prosecutor that is  looking into my son's company that is paying Hunter Biden $50,000 a  month, don't you think we have the right to call these people? Don't  you think that Joe Biden should appear? Don't you think that Hunter  Biden should appear? Absolutely, the whistleblower should appear  because he is an accuser, but also because he is a material witness to  the conflict of interest scandal that involves Hunter Biden and Joe  Biden.   Fifty Republican Senators signed on to a resolution that says the  President should get to face his accusers. My bill, the Whistleblower  Act of 2019, would make that clear, that the Sixth Amendment is not  superseded by statutes and that the President should be afforded the  right to understand the nature of the allegations brought against him  and that the President should get to face his accusers.   Mr. President, as in legislative session, I ask unanimous consent  that the Senator modify her request so that, instead, the Senate  proceed to the immediate consideration of my bill, the Whistleblower  Act of 2019, S. 2798, introduced earlier today; I further ask that the  bill be considered read a third time and passed; and that the motion to  reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table.    Mr. President, reserving the right to object.   I am disappointed that any Senator would come to the floor and find  the Bill of Rights laughable. The Sixth Amendment is an important part  of our Constitution, and the right to face your accuser is incredibly  important. It is disappointing that an actual U.S. Senator would come  to the floor and say that it was laughable to apply the Bill of Rights  to the President. I am disappointed that it has come to this.   I will hope that Americans would look at this and say, absolutely,  the President deserves the same protections that the rest of us  deserve.
