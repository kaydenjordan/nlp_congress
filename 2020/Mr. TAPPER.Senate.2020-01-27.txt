 House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is still holding on       to the Articles of Impeachment.    Mr. Counsel HERSCHMANN. Urgency? Urgency, for which you want to  immediately remove the President of the United States? You sat on the  articles for a month--the longest delay in the history of our country.   They adopted them on Friday, December 13, 2019--Friday the 13th--went  on vacation, and finally decided after one of their Democratic  Presidential debates had finished and after the BCS football  championship game, that it was time to deliver them.   What happened to their national security interest argument? Wasn't  that the reason that they said they had to rush to vote? It is urgent,  they told us. No due process for this President. It is a crisis of  monumental proportion. Our national security is at risk every  additional day that he is in office, they tell us.   The House managers also used the same excuse for not issuing  subpoenas for testimony. They had no time for the normal judicial  review. They even complained about the judicial review process sitting  in this Chamber before the Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court--a  judicial review in which the judge agreed to an expedited schedule.  Even that was not good enough for them when they issued the subpoenas.   One of the lawyers for the subpoenaed witnesses wrote to the House  general counsel: ``We are dismayed that the House committees have  chosen not to join us in seeking resolution from the judicial branch of  this momentous constitutional question as expeditiously as possible.''   He continued: ``It is important to get a definitive judgment from the  judicial branch determining their constitutional duty in the place of  conflicting demands of the legislative and executive branches.''   Isn't that the point? Isn't that how our system of government works?  Isn't that how it has always worked? Isn't that how it is supposed to  work?   These same Democrats defended other administrations who fought  judicial review of congressional subpoenas, and I think we all remember  Fast and Furious.   The same attorney, when he wrote to the House chair, said:         The House chairmen, Mr. Schiff and Mr. Nadler, are mistaken       to say the lawsuit is intended to delay or otherwise obstruct       the committees' vital investigatory work.    He continued:         Nor has this lawsuit been coordinated in any way with the       White House any more than it has been coordinated with the       House of Representatives. If the House chooses not to pursue       through subpoenaed testimony, let the record be clear that is       the House's decision, if they come before you and they blame       the administration and they blame you if you don't subpoena       witnesses and have them before you.    Yet even in the face of this overwhelming evidence, they claim that  the President is to blame for their decision to withdraw their own  subpoenas or not issue others. Their choice, but the President is  responsible. That is one of their claims. It is ludicrous.   They are blaming the President because they decided on their own not  to seek judicial review and enforcement of their own subpoenas and for  some witnesses never even issued subpoenas. In their minds, that is  impeachable.   Manager Nadler spoke eloquently back before the House Judiciary  Committee hearing in December of 1998. He said:         There must never be a narrowly voted impeachment or an       impeachment substantially supported by one of our major       political parties and largely opposed by the other. Such an       impeachment would lack legitimacy, would produce divisiveness       and bitterness in our politics for years to come, and will       call into question the very legitimacy of our political       institutions.    Manager Nadler was right then, and it is equally true today.  Divisiveness and bitterness. Divisiveness and bitterness. Listen to his  words.   Impeachments by one party cause divisiveness and bitterness in our  country. That is what a partisan impeachment leads to.   Sadly, when Manager Nadler eloquently warned against divisiveness and  bitterness, the House did not follow his admonition. They did not heed  his advice, and that is one of the reasons we are sitting here today  with Articles of Impeachment that are not found in our Constitution or  the evidence and are brought simply for partisan politics.   This is a sad time for all of us. This is not a time to give out  souvenirs, the pens used to sign two Articles of Impeachment, trying to  improperly impeach our country's representative to the world.   This is not the time to try to get digs in that the President will  always be impeached because we had the majority and we could do it to  you and we did it to you. It is wrong. It is not what the American  people deserve or want.   Sadly, the House managers do not trust their fellow Americans to  choose their own President. They do not think  [[Page S604]]  that they can legitimately win an election against President Trump, so  they need to rush to impeach him immediately. That is what they have  continually told the American people, and that--that is a shame.   We, on the other hand, trust our fellow Americans to choose their  President. Choose your candidate. Let the Senators who are here who are  trying to become the Democratic nominee try to win that election, and  let the American people choose.   Maybe--maybe they are concerned that the American people like  historically low unemployment. Maybe the American people like that  their 401(k) accounts have done extremely well. Maybe the American  people like prison reform and giving people a second chance.   Tellingly, some of these House managers worked constructively with  this administration to give Americans a second chance. That was the  public interest. That is what the country demands. That is what society  deserves.   Maybe the American people like an administration that is fighting the  opioid epidemic. Maybe the American people like secure borders. Maybe  the American people like better trade agreements with our biggest  trading partners. Maybe the American people like other countries  sharing in the burden when it comes to foreign aid. Maybe the American  people actually like low taxes. In other words, maybe the American  people like their current President--a President who has kept his  promises and delivered on them.   If you think Americans want to abandon our prosperity and our  unprecedented successes under this President, then convince the  electorate in November at the ballot box. Do not try to improperly  interfere with an election that is only months away, based on these  Articles of Impeachment.   In your trial memorandum that you submitted here before the Senate,  you speak about the Framers of the Constitution believing that  President Trump's alleged conduct is their ``worst nightmare'' and that  they would be horrified.   In fact, sadly, sadly, it is the House managers' conduct in bringing  these baseless Articles of Impeachment that would clearly be their and  our worst nightmare.   Thank you.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. The majority leader is recognized.                                    Recess
