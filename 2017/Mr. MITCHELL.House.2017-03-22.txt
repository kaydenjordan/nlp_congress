 I thank the gentlewoman from North Carolina for  yielding me time.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Small Business Health Fairness  Act. We have all talked a lot about our plan to repeal and replace  ObamaCare. This legislation is a key component of our rescue mission  for health care in America.   Small businesses have been hit particularly hard by ObamaCare's  mandates, skyrocketing costs, and limited choices. Small-business  owners, many of whom want to provide health care for their employees,  have told me that they are struggling to do so because of ObamaCare.   This legislation would level the playing field for small businesses  by allowing them to band together to increase bargaining power to lower  costs. It would expand affordable care for families trying to secure  health insurance through their employer and lower costs for small  businesses with limited resources.   In addition, this bill includes strong protections for patients with  preexisting conditions, a top priority of mine and many of my  colleagues as we work for healthcare reform in America.   Today we are acting on our promises to deliver relief from ObamaCare.  We are returning power where it belongs, choice where it belongs: to  patients and doctors, not Washington.   I urge you to support the Small Business Health Fairness Act.
