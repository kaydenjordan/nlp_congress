 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to complete my  remarks before the vote.    Mr. President, in a few minutes, we are going to vote on  Marvin Quattlebaum to be a circuit judge for the Fourth Judicial  Circuit in Richmond, VA. He is a South Carolina native and a district  court judge in South Carolina. I have known Marvin for well over 20  years. He is one of the most capable lawyers I have ever met. He has a  great reputation as a district court judge.   I thank President Trump for nominating him. I thank my Senate  colleagues for moving his nomination forward. He will be a great  addition to the Fourth Circuit. He is a very sound, conservative judge  who is incredibly fairminded. To my Democratic colleagues who moved his  nomination through the Judiciary Committee, thank you.   Later in the day, we will vote on cloture on the nomination of Jay  Richardson, also from South Carolina, to be on the Fourth Circuit in  Richmond, VA. He was reported out of committee 20 to 1. Both gentlemen  are rated unanimously ``well-qualified'' by the ABA. Jay is one of the  great legal minds of our time, and I think he is going to be a great  addition to the Fourth Circuit.   He prosecuted the Dylann Roof case, the man who killed the nine  parishioners at the Mother Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, SC. I  recommend that you take time to listen to his arguments about that case  if you ever get a chance. It is very eloquent.    Both of these fine men come from South Carolina, and I urge my  colleagues to vote affirmative when that time comes. I do want to again  thank President Trump. Senator Scott and I both highly recommend to our  colleagues ``yes'' votes for Mr. Quattlebaum and Mr. Richardson in just  a minute.   I thank Senator McConnell for moving these nominations forward and  Senator Grassley for making sure they got out of committee.   With that, I yield.
