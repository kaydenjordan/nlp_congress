 Mr. President.    I object.    Mr. President.    I object.    Mr. President.    Sure.    I thank the chairman. It is always a privilege to be on  the floor with the Senator from Rhode Island and to serve him on the  committee, so thank you for that.   I would just say this: It has been nearly a year now since the  events, the catastrophe, in Kabul that claimed the lives of 13  servicemembers, including from my home State of Missouri.   This was a catastrophe of this administration's making, and it has  been now nearly 2 weeks, maybe 3, since I began to enter into the  Record, page by painstaking page, this report undertaken by U.S.  Central Command about that disaster at Abbey Gate in Kabul, about those  deaths, not to mention the hundreds of American civilians who were left  behind.   I am entering this report into the Record so the American people can  see it because I cannot convince my friend from Rhode Island to hold a  public hearing on this report, and I cannot convince the White House to  stop their coverup of the events at Abbey Gate and the role they played  in it.   This is not for lack of trying. For months on end, I have come to  this floor and asked for a public hearing on this report. I have asked  my colleagues. I have written to the chairman. I have spoken to members  of the committee, who, by the way, say they have no objection.   And just last week, the White House reached out to me and said: What  is it that you want?   I said, I want accountability for what happened in Afghanistan and  Abbey Gate, and, specifically, I want a public hearing on this report,  to which the White House said it is up to the chairman.   So I hope that we can make some progress on actually getting  accountability for what happened, for the servicemembers whose lives  were lost, and we can end this continual Vietnamesque, yearlong effort  to push this crisis out into the shadows, to ignore it as if it never  happened, and to deny the American people the accountability that  servicemembers deserve.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, had there been a recorded vote, I would  have voted no on the confirmation of Executive Calendar No. 1058, Adair  Ford Boroughs, of South Carolina, to be United States Attorney for the  District of South Carolina for the term of four years.                            ____________________     Mr. President, following my submission in a previous  session of the U.S. Senate, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in  the Record the next part of an investigation directed by the U.S.  Central Command concerning the Abbey Gate bombing in Afghanistan in  August 2021.

Clark,      Lieutenant General, USA, Commanding.                                   ____                                       United States Central Command,                                         Office of the Commander,                           Macdill Air Force Base, FL, 22 Nov. 2021.                    Memorandum for Secretary of Defense       Thru: Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff      From: General Kenneth F. McKenzie, Jr., Commander, U.S.           Central Command      Subject: Abbey Gate AR 15-6 Investigation         Mr. Secretary, I have reviewed the AR 15-6 investigation       completed at my direction by U.S. Army Central (ARCENT) and       concur with and endorse its findings and recommendations. The       investigation was exceptionally comprehensive in its scope,       as appropriate to the tragic events that precipitated its       initiation. The investigating team, led by BG Lance Curtis,       conducted 70 separate interviews, many of which were held in       a group setting to facilitate a free flow of information. A       total of 139 people were interviewed at seven different       locations spanning five countries. Interviews ranged from       between one hour and six hours in duration, with the average       interview lasting between two and three hours, and the       average transcription totaling nearly 11 pages. I       specifically concur that:        The task organization worked. This was in large part due to       pre-existing or quickly forged relationships among leaders at       the highest echelons and adaptability at the lower echelons;        By 25 August 2021, Abbey Gate was the main effort for       ``walk-up'' gate operations at Hamid Karzai International       Airport;        There was no complex attack; it was a single suicide bomber       not accompanied by enemy small arms fire;        There is no evidence that Afghans were killed by return       fire from U.S. forces in the immediate aftermath of the       attack;        The attack was not preventable at the tactical level       without degrading the mission to maximize the number of       evacuees;        The attack was not the result of any act of omission or       commission by forces on the ground;        The wounds sustained by the service members Killed in       Action were so catastrophic that none could be saved; and        Although not assigned as a task to ARCENT or the       investigating team, it is my judgment that all injuries       sustained by U.S. personnel incident to the Abbey Gate attack       occurred in the line of duty and were not due to any       misconduct by the killed or injured U.S. personnel.        I further concur with the recommendations detailed in the       ARCENT investigation. Accordingly, I have directed the       following actions:        The Findings and Recommendations will be forwarded to all       USCENTCOM Service Component Commanders to ensure that all       U.S. servicemembers at Abbey Gate during the attack, and       present in any of the blast zones detailed in the       investigation, are afforded the opportunity to be evaluated       for Traumatic Brain Injury (Recommendation (a));        The Findings and Recommendations will be forwarded to all       USCENTCOM Service Component Commanders to facilitate       prioritized access to appropriate mental health evaluations       for personnel involved in executing entry control point       operations from 17-26 August and personnel involved in the       medical response to the attack on 26 August (Recommendation       (b));        The investigation will be forwarded to the Joint Staff to       inform any efforts that might be undertaken to develop       interagency doctrine for Noncombatant Evacuation Operations       (Recommendation (c)); and        Relevant portions of the investigation will be forwarded to       U.S. Marine Corps Forces Central for appropriate action       regarding the potential serious injury or death of an Afghan       civilian on or about 20 August 2021 resulting from the       alleged improper deployment of a flash bang grenade by a U.S.       Marine from 2nd Battalion, 1st Marine Regiment       (Recommendation (d)).        Based on the totality of the facts and circumstances       detailed in the ARCENT investigation, I do not believe that       any adverse administrative or disciplinary action is       necessary or appropriate for any U.S. personnel involved in       our operations at Abbey Gate.        The ARCENT investigating team and the ARCENT Commander, LTG       Ron Clark, briefed me in person on 11 November 2021 regarding       this investigation. The presentation was as comprehensive as       the investigation itself, and it included detailed PowerPoint       slides, embedded video, and exceptionally well scripted       speaker notes that complemented the written investigation and       facilitated an informative exchange of questions and answers.       I highly recommend you take the brief in person, and set       aside two hours to this purpose. If you concur, my       headquarters will work with your staff to make the ARCENT       team available.
