 Madam Speaker, I rise today to talk about the FAA  Reauthorization Act.   Since before I was elected to Congress, my district has been  afflicted by excessive aviation-related noise. I campaigned on  addressing this issue, and yesterday, I gave testimony on my amendments  in the Rules Committee. I am following through on my commitment to  offer relief to my constituents.   If enacted, the changes I proposed would lower the permissible  decibel levels from 65 to 55, reevaluate the technology known as  NextGen, and put up for questioning its impact on communities all  around the United States that suffer with the issue of constant flight  paths.   Since taking office, I have visited with the people of New York's  Third District who have begged me to take action on this matter, often  with tears in their eyes.   Most people will suppose this is an exaggeration, but most people  have no idea what it is like to live right next to one of the largest  airport hubs in the country.   I am here today to make sure my constituents and many others around  the country know that they are not alone and that their plight is not  in vain. I urge this body to take these amendments into consideration.                            ____________________
