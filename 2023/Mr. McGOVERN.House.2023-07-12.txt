 Mr. Speaker, this week, in the name of ``national  security,'' Congress will likely approve a nearly $1 trillion National  Defense Authorization Act, but the 35 million Americans who don't know  where their next meal is coming from won't feel any more security  because for struggling families in this country, Republicans are  cutting food benefits.   I find it unconscionable that Members of Congress are okay cutting  programs that help hungry kids, like SNAP and WIC, supposedly in the  name of deficit reduction. Meanwhile, they are fine sending almost a  trillion dollars to an agency that can't pass an audit and to defense  contractors who pad their pockets by fleecing America's taxpayers.   Let's broaden our definition of national security to include more  than bullets and bombs. Let's include the security of our people, their  health, well-being, and economic stability.   True national security ought to mean that every American has enough  to eat.   No more blank checks to the Pentagon. Let's reinvest in our people to  end hunger now.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend, the gentleman from  Oklahoma (Mr. Cole), the distinguished chairman of the Rules Committee  for yielding me the customary 30 minutes.   Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I have to say that I respect the gentleman, and I  appreciate his remarks, his commitment to civility and decency and  fairness. I know that he wants this House to run better and reflect the  will of the Members. Quite frankly, I just don't believe what is  happening in this Chamber lives up to the standard that he has set.   Last night, the Rules Committee met at 11 p.m. to advance a rule, not  for the whole National Defense Authorization Act, which we were  supposed to start debating today, but for part of the National Defense  Authorization Act.   I get it. I have been in the majority before. I understand it is not  always easy. What is happening today on the floor--not knowing when we  are coming back to finish the second rule for this bill, or what  offensive amendments will be included--is not just weird, it is nuts.   A small group of radical, hard-right Members, the MAGA circus I call  them, is threatening to take down the NDAA rule unless they get their  way. The ``unless they get their way'' part is really becoming a theme  in this Congress.   I don't envy the gentleman from Oklahoma because what he is dealing  with is truly bizarre. The MAGA circus wants to load up what could and  should be a bipartisan bill--a bipartisan bill that passes every single  year. They want to load it up with every single divisive social issue  under the sun via the amendment process. Anti-abortion? Check. Anti- LGBTQ rights? Check. Anti-gun safety? Check.   It is not just that they are demanding it, it is that Republican  leadership is probably caving. It is embarrassing, but, quite frankly,  it is not surprising. This is just the latest example of how Kevin  McCarthy has ceded control of this body to the most extreme Members of  his own caucus while hanging everyone else out to dry and cutting  mainstream Members out of the process. Kevin McCarthy may be the  ringmaster, Mr. Speaker, but the clowns have taken over the circus.   This is a group of Members that are so far to the right that they  have now begun purging Members from their own ranks for not being  ideologically pure enough. It is honestly kind of scary. That is who is  trying to write this year's defense bill.   The party of single-issue bills wants to turn the NDAA into an anti- abortion, anti-LGBTQ bill that weighs in on every wedge issue and  culture war from guns to border and beyond.   Give me a break. If they want to do a single-issue bill, get this  stuff out of here and pass a bipartisan NDAA bill.   By the way, I would say that I find some of the amendments that have  been introduced to this NDAA incredibly offensive. We have Members  saying they want to get woke out of the military, but they can't even  define ``woke.''   Was desegregating the military woke?   Was allowing women in combat roles woke?   Was repealing Don't Ask, Don't Tell woke?   That is what I want to ask some of my colleagues. I am pretty sure  what their answer would be.   Mr. Speaker, why all the backroom dealing and negotiating with MAGA  clowns?   By the way, I say that as somebody who has voted against the NDAA in  the minority and in the majority because, quite frankly, I am sick and  tired of sending blank checks to the Pentagon while we nickel and dime  programs that help everyday people.   Mr. Speaker, I wish the Republicans luck in trying to solve this  internal power struggle. I have to say, I don't have a whole lot of  faith that this is going to work out in a way that will be good for  this country.   I don't think it will work out in a way that will be good for most  people in this country.   This is an example. I think when people are watching these  proceedings and are seeing the kind of extortion that the MAGA  Republicans are exacting from the current leadership, this is what I  think people look at and say: This is what is wrong with Washington.   Mr. Speaker, I say this with no disrespect to the chairman, who I  think is an example of what is right in this place. I will be voting  ``no'' on this rule. I urge all of my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this  rule. I hope and pray that my Republican friends can get their act  together so we can actually start doing the people's business.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for his comments. I would just say  for the record that we are not objecting to more amendments being made  in order.   I will remind my colleagues that when I was chairman of the Rules  Committee, we had made 650 amendments in order for the National Defense  Authorization Act, which is far higher than the 290. We hope that you  have at least 650, and maybe you can surpass us. That would be  wonderful.   We don't object to a process that allows for more amendments to be  considered or more amendments to be made in order. What we object to is  the extorting of your leadership by a small group of extremists in this  House who are trying to force their rightwing and hard-line views on  Congress and the people of this country.   We are concerned, quite frankly, that some of these ideas that the  MAGA circus is proposing couldn't even pass if it were brought up as a  freestanding amendment. We are worried about a self-executing rule as  part of the next  [[Page H3222]]  rule that will make them part of the base bill. That is what we are  concerned about.   Mr. Speaker, I would say to the gentleman, we want more amendments in  order. We think that is a good thing. What we are worried about is what  this small group of individuals that seems to be engaged in extortion  on every single major bill that comes to this floor, what they will end  up winning in this process. What they will win is not reflective of  what I think the majority of this Chamber believes. That is deeply  concerning to us.    Mr. Speaker, I urge that we defeat the previous question. If we  defeat the previous question, I will offer an amendment to the rule to  provide for consideration of a resolution which states that it is the  House's sacred responsibility to protect and preserve Social Security  and Medicare for our future generations and reject any cuts to these  essential programs.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment into the Record, along with any extraneous material,  immediately prior to the vote on the previous question.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  New York (Mr. Bowman), to discuss that proposal.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to include in the  Record the Statement of Administration Policy for H.R. 2670.    Mr. Speaker, the administration supports this bill as  it is written, but the statement also notes several concerns that the  administration has with the bill, which they hope Congress will work  with them to address.   House Democrats are going to do what we can to fight against any  attempts to push the bill to the extreme MAGA fringes.   As I was saying earlier, we have no objection to making more  amendments in order. Again, when I was chairman of the Rules Committee,  we made a lot of amendments in order to the defense authorization bill.   Let me give you an example, Mr. Speaker, about some of the people who  are not thinking in reality here.   Last night, we had a Republican Member come up and testify about an  amendment to withdraw us totally from NATO, a critical alliance between  Europe and North America created after World War II that provides  massive social, economic, and political benefits to its members in the  face of an aggressive adversary.   My Republican friends have their heads in the sand if this is the  kind of thing that they think will make our country more safe, and this  is exactly the kind of amendment that the fringe elements of the MAGA  circus are supporting.   By the way, the author of this amendment isn't extreme enough for the  Freedom Caucus. They want her out of the Freedom Caucus because she is  not pure enough or not extreme enough.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to include in the Record an  article from Foreign Policy titled: ``Why Americans Still Need NATO.''    Mr. Speaker, we are really worried about where this is  headed. The amendments that are contained in this first rule--most of  them, I think, if not all of them--will probably pass with bipartisan  support. Many of them are not controversial at all. It is what is  coming next that has us concerned.   What will the MAGA wing of the Republican Party extort from this  leadership? What are the horrific policy items that they are going to  demand to be put into this bill in order to get it through the House?   Those are the things we are worried about.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Doggett).    Mr. Speaker, ``A Pentagon study released earlier this  year found major defense contractors flush with, `cash beyond their  needs for operations or investment.' They have tens of billions of  excess cash from Pentagon business to hand out to shareholders.''   I think it is outrageous that Republicans will happily line the  pockets of these ultra wealthy contractors but pinch pennies when it  comes to the American people.   As I said earlier, we are talking about nearly a trillion-dollar  Pentagon budget here. At the same time, appropriators led by  Republicans are cutting programs like WIC and Meals on Wheels.   Mr. Speaker, I request unanimous consent to include in the Record an  article from CBS News titled, ``How the Pentagon falls victim to price  gouging by military contractors.''    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Alabama (Ms. Sewell).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, this is more ridiculous Republican infighting and  wasting more time. That is what this is. They are bickering on  everything, from spending levels to whose bill gets on the floor when.  It distracts from the other very real work that Congress has the  opportunity to do here.   We should also be working to protect our constituents from gun  violence. There were more than 17 mass shootings this past Fourth of  July weekend that killed dozens of Americans, but Republicans are too  busy fighting with Republicans.   We should also pass bills to keep pollutants from clogging up our air  and toxins from ruining our water, but Republicans are too busy  fighting with Republicans.   We should also do more to stop the opioid crisis and provide support  for those struggling with their mental health, but Republicans are too  busy fighting with Republicans.   We should also make sure that every American has access to quality  healthcare, the chance to receive a good education, or even the basic  rights to housing and food, but Republicans are too busy fighting with  Republicans.   There is so, so much we should be doing, including passing this  bipartisan defense budget, but Republican leadership is busy trying to  cater to every whim of the MAGA circus.   I will say it again, Kevin McCarthy may be the ringleader, but the  clowns have taken over. It is no way to govern, and it continues to set  a deeply dangerous precedent for how this body conducts business moving  forward, including with the appropriations process.   Mr. Speaker, let me explain why we are here right now, and why we are  in this situation.   We have passed a defense bill by huge margins every year for the past  63 years. Yet here we are with this stalling of moving the full bill  forward because a small group of people who call themselves the Freedom  Caucus have basically said that they will block passage of this bill if  the Republican leadership doesn't cave to every one of their demands.   They call themselves the Freedom Caucus. That seems like a strange  name. I mean, are they for the freedom for people to read whatever  books they want in the library? No.   Are they for the freedom of women to be able to control their own  bodies? No.   Are they for the freedom for people to love who they want in this  country? No.   Are they for the freedom to protect people from gun violence in this  country as we see the number of incidents involving guns in this  country rise at this alarming rate? No.   I think the only thing they are pro-freedom about is the freedom to  harass the Republican leadership, the freedom to extort the leadership  to cave to their ideas that, by the way, are deeply unpopular not only  in this Chamber, that is sadly controlled by the Republicans, but views  and ideas that are deeply unpopular throughout this country.   Mr. Speaker, and I get it. They threaten the Speaker by saying that  we will move to vacate the Chair. We will move to oust you as Speaker  if you don't do everything we say. When they say jump, they want the  Speaker to respond by saying, how high. This is a bad way to run this  Congress. This is not what the American people expect from the House of  Representatives. They certainly don't want ideas that are so extreme,  so to the fringe, being shoved down their throats.   At some point, the Speaker has to stand up to these people. At some  point, he has to say no. At some point, he has to make it clear that  what they are asking is beyond the pale. It is not only not good  policy, but it is bad for this institution, and it is bad for this  country. That is why we are here.   We don't know when the Rules Committee will meet again. We don't know  whether we are going to meet again this afternoon, tonight, tomorrow.  We had one member of the Freedom Caucus say: Well, we can meet in  August-- or after August.    So this notion of everything being held hostage because of a small  group of rightwing extremists just has to stop.   Mr. Speaker, we are about to approach appropriations season. I don't  know how the hell you are going to get appropriation bills through here  with some of the stuff that is being forced onto those bills and some  of the cuts that are being forced.   As I said earlier, cuts in programs like WIC, Women, Infants and  Children's program; Meals on Wheels. I mean, really? Those are the  priorities of this Republican majority? This has to stop. This has to  stop.   So stay tuned, everybody, for how this all plays out. We don't know  whether we are going to finish this bill this week or next week or  sometime into the future, but this is not the way Congress should be  run.   Certainly, I would urge the Speaker to stand up to this small group  of fringe lawmakers who are trying to extort unreasonable demands from  him that are not in the interest of the people of this country.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote on the previous question because I  believe it is important that we make it clear we don't want cuts in  Social Security and Medicare. I urge a ``no'' vote on the rule.   Again, I hope and pray that my friends can get their act together in  the very near future so we can actually move forward with a debate and  a final determination on where people stand on this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.
