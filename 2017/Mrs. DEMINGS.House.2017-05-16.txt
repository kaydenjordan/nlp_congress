 Mr. Speaker, this year marks the 54th anniversary of  Peace Officers Memorial Day, so I rise tonight to pay tribute to the  law enforcement officers from Florida who were killed in the line of  duty last year.   Today we remember them and honor them for their service and  dedication: Deputy Sheriff Eric James Oliver from the Nassau County  Sheriff's Office; Major Jorge Sanchez from the Miami Police Department;  Deputy Sheriff Michael Scott Williams from the Taylor County Sheriff's  Office; Sergeant Jorge Ramos from the Florida Department of  Corrections; Deputy Sheriff John Robert Kotfila, Jr., of the  Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office; Police Officer Henry Malcolm  McAleenan, Jr., of the Miami-Dade Police Department; and, as you have  already heard tonight, Special Agent J. Scott McGuire of U.S. Homeland  Security Investigations.   Mr. Speaker, we remember these brave men and pray for their families  and the countless others who have mourned their loss.                            ____________________
