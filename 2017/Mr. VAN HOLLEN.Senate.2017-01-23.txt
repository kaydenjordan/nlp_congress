 Mr. President, President Trump has repeatedly called  into question the integrity and professionalism of the brave men and  women in our intelligence community. In addition, throughout the  campaign, his statements revealed a dangerous propensity to ignore  important principles of civil and religious liberty.   Under these circumstances, it is especially important that the  Director of the Central Intelligence Agency be an individual who will  implement the Agency's vital national security responsibilities in a  manner consistent with our Constitution and the rule of law. The head  of the CIA must ensure that the men and women of the Agency are not  pressured by the President--or anyone else--to violate important  American values and principles.   Congressman Mike Pompeo has impressive credentials; and, should he be  confirmed, I pledge to work with him to support the national security  missions of the CIA. However, his positions on spying on Americans, the  use of torture, and religious minorities cause me to question this  nomination.   Modern nations must have intelligence agencies to help keep us safe.  Thus, in the 1947 National Security Act, Congress created the Central  Intelligence Agency. The CIA provides the President and senior  policymakers with vital national security intelligence.   But the CIA and other U.S. intelligence agencies must work within our  Constitution. By design, the CIA has no law enforcement role. And the  law focuses the CIA on overseas intelligence gathering, limiting what  it can do here in the United States.   Our Constitution limits how much intelligence agencies and government  generally can intrude into the lives of Americans. The Fourth Amendment  to the Constitution provides: ``The right of the people to be secure in  their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable  searches and seizures, shall not be violated.'' To conduct searches,  the Constitution requires the government to have probable cause and get  a warrant. Congress passed and the States ratified the Fourth Amendment  as part of the Bill of Rights, in response to the abuse of general  search warrants issued by the British in pre-Revolutionary America.  [[Page S382]]    Thus, in 2015, a Federal judge ruled that the National Security  Agency's program of systematically collecting Americans' domestic phone  records likely violated the Constitution. And also in 2015, Congress  enacted the USA FREEDOM Act in large part to limit that program. The  USA FREEDOM Act represented real progress and a departure from the  untenable situation before the law. It ensured that the intelligence  community and law enforcement have the necessary tools that they need  to protect our Nation, but it does so in a manner that is consistent  with the fundamental principles in our Constitution.   Congressman Pompeo, however, has been an ardent proponent of the data  collection that the Federal judge ruled likely unconstitutional. In a  recent Wall Street Journal op-ed piece, Mr. Pompeo wrote that Congress  should reestablish the collection of metadata and also combine it  ``with publicly available financial and lifestyle information into a  comprehensive, searchable database.'' And in 2015, Congressman Pompeo  introduced the so-called Liberty Through Strength Act II, which would  have rolled back the reforms of the USA FREEDOM Act   Indeed, Mr. Pompeo apparently has a troubling bias against privacy.  Mr. Pompeo wrote in the Wall Street Journal op-ed piece that ``the use  of strong encryption in personal communications may itself be a red  flag.''   I am also deeply concerned about Congressman Pompeo's position on  torture. After release of the 2014 Senate torture report, Mr. Pompeo  said, ``These men and women are not torturers, they are patriots. The  programs being used were within the law, within the Constitution.'' If  Mr. Pompeo's conception of the law and the Constitution would allow the  use of the torture that the 2014 report documented, then I am concerned  that he reads our Constitution's protections too narrowly. If  confirmed, Mr. Pompeo's support for such torture techniques as  described in the 2014 Senate torture report could once again harm  America's reputation abroad and endanger American troops whom our  enemies might capture.   I am also concerned that Mr. Pompeo has been an enthusiastic  supporter of the Guantanamo Bay prison. When MSNBC's Craig Melvin asked  Mr. Pompeo in 2013 about a hunger strike at the Guantanamo Bay prison,  Mr. Pompeo said, ``The last thing to say about these folks who are  supposedly hunger strikers is that they look to me like a lot of them  had put on weight.'' And last year, Mr. Pompeo said, ``The detainees at  GTMO are treated exceptionally well--so well that some have even  declined to be resettled, instead choosing to stay at GTMO.''   In fact, the Guantanamo Bay prison is a blot on America's reputation  in the world. As President Obama has said, ``Keeping this facility open  is contrary to our values. It undermines our standing in the world. It  is viewed as a stain on our broader record of upholding the highest  standards of rule of law.'' If confirmed, Mr. Pompeo's support for the  prison would harm American interests in the world.   Mr. Pompeo has also cast aspersion on Muslims generally. In a 2013  statement on the House floor, Congressman Pompeo said:         ``When the most devastating terrorist attacks on America in       the last 20 years come overwhelmingly from people of a single       faith, and are performed in the name of that faith, a special       obligation falls on those that are the leaders of that faith.       Instead of responding, their silence has made most Islamic       leaders across America complicit in these acts. . . . But the       silence in the face of extremism coming from the best funded       Islamic advocacy organizations and many mosques across       America is absolutely deafening. It casts doubt upon the       commitment to peace by adherents by the Muslim faith.''    It is unacceptable to smear all Muslims based on the actions of  radical extremists who seek to hijack the name of Islam for their evil  purposes. That kind of demagoguery has no place in our country.   Placing someone who maligns all Muslims in charge of the CIA would be  a propaganda boon to enemies who seek to portray America's foreign  policy as a war against Islam. And the expression of such views by a  senior government official could discourage Muslim Americans from  working with law enforcement here at home.   Run properly, the Central Intelligence Agency makes an important  contribution to keeping America safe. But run poorly, the CIA can  embarrass the Nation in the world and ultimately endanger our troops,  our diplomats, and Americans abroad.   It is thus important that the person who heads the CIA be a person  who respects the Constitution and understands the limits that the  Constitution and statutes place on the Agency's role. While I hope he  will prove me wrong, Mr. Pompeo's statements lead me to conclude that  he is not the right person for this job.
