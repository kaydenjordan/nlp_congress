 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize my good  friend, Mr. Roger Moss, who is stepping down as director of the  Savannah Children's Choir.   Mr. Moss started the Savannah Children's Choir in 2006, with 30 kids,  aiming to transform children into confident leaders through music  education. Now, the choir is booming. It mentors hundreds of students,  and the choir has gone on to award-winning performances throughout  Europe.   The choir has brought children of diverse backgrounds together for a  common purpose, winning praise from countless parents, who have seen  significant improvements in their children's ambitions, demeanor,  creativity, and much more.   I thank Mr. Moss for his important work in the Savannah community.  However, I understand his work will continue as he is beginning a new  school: the Savannah Exploratory Charter Academy. We are, indeed, very  fortunate in Savannah that Roger Moss has adopted us as his home and  brought his immense talents with him.   Mr. Speaker, I wish Mr. Moss the best of luck with his new project.                            ____________________
