 Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to welcome our guest  chaplain, Rabbi Aaron Krupnick of Congregation Beth El in Voorhees, New  Jersey.   The congregation has been part of our South Jersey community since  1920, when it was originally founded in Camden City.   Now it offers a spiritual home for hundreds of Jewish families in  South Jersey.   Rabbi Krupnick came to our community in 1994 from Montgomery,  Alabama. There, he helped lead interfaith services with leaders like  Martin Luther King, III, and Rosa Parks.   As you heard in his prayer, he often discusses patience,  understanding, kindness, compassion.   In a world where religion too often creates so much conflict, Rabbi  Krupnick focuses on togetherness. He knows there is more that connects  us than divides us.   I have been fortunate enough to attend services and seder at Beth El.  I have witnessed firsthand how the community is welcoming, loving, and  supportive of all.   Mr. Speaker, today I am honored to welcome Rabbi Krupnick to the  House of Representatives and I thank him for his offering of this  morning's prayer.   His compassion, his teachings, his strong leadership have helped  foster a vibrant Jewish community in our region, and I know it will  stay that way for years to come.                            ____________________
