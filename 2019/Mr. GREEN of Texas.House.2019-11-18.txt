Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their  remarks on this legislation and to insert extraneous material thereon.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, for more than 25 years, the House has failed to formally  codify the vital disaster recovery program called the Community  Development Block Grant Disaster Recovery, CDBG-DR, program.   Today, we in this body have it within our power, through this  important vote, to at least resolve many of the problems, delays, and  inefficiencies for disaster victims. H.R. 3702, the Reforming Disaster  Recovery Act, is a solidly bipartisan solution to the persistent long- term disaster recovery crisis that directly impacts all of our  districts.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my cosponsor, Mrs. Wagner, for her steadfast  commitment to making meaningful reforms to the delivery of Federal  disaster recovery resources to those who need it the most.   Mr. Speaker, I also thank Chairwoman Waters for her tireless  leadership of the Financial Services Committee. It is due to her  visionary leadership that our committee has moved so much legislation  on a bipartisan basis, including this piece of legislation.   Additionally, Mr. Speaker, I thank Ranking Member McHenry--the bill  came out of the Financial Services Committee unanimously--Leader Hoyer,  Leader McCarthy, and Democratic and Republican staff.   I would like to thank the Office of the Inspector General of Housing  and Urban Development; Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Dr.  Ben Carson; Transportation and Infrastructure Committee Chair DeFazio  and Ranking Member Sam Graves; Appropriations Chair Lowey and Ranking  Member Kay Granger; and, of course, Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner, who  has been a steadfast supporter; Harris County Judge Lina Hidalgo;  Harris County Commissioner Rodney Ellis; and Harris County Commissioner  Adrian Garcia.   H.R. 3702 codifies, for the first time, the requirements and policy  objectives of the CDBG-DR program. In the wake of increasing threats  from severe weather events, this is a critical long-term reform for  Federal public policy on disaster recovery.   As but one example, Houston had three record-breaking floods in a 3- year period, the last one being Hurricane Harvey. A major component of  the Federal response to each of these floods is CDBG-DR, a program  administered by the Department of Housing and Urban Development for the  past 26 years.   According to findings by HUD's inspector general, this important  lifeline to recovery for so many stricken communities needs to be  amended, not ended. This bears repeating. HUD believes that this  legislation is going to help mend some of the problems, and HUD does  not desire to see us end the CDBG-DR program.   The HUD OIG recommended codification of the CDBG-DR program  requirements to achieve four essential objectives.   The first, the creation of a permanent framework for future  disasters; this bill does that.   Reduction of the existing volume of Federal Register notices; this  bill does that.   Standardization of the rules for all grantees; this bill does that.   Timely disbursement and closing of grants; this bill does that as  well.   The bill incorporates 21st century mitigation resiliency standards  championed by Majority Leader Hoyer, whom I thank, Mr. Speaker, for his  thoughtful contributions to the legislation and for his commitment to  bringing this important measure to the floor today.   Finally, the bill reflects many hours of constructive input from the  Committees on Transportation and Infrastructure as well as  Appropriations.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.           Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, House of             Representatives,                                 Washington, DC, November 13, 2019.      Hon. Maxine Waters,      Chairwoman, Committee on Financial Services, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairwoman Waters: I write concerning H.R. 3702, the       Reforming Disaster Recovery Act of 2019. There are certain       provisions in this legislation that fall within the Rule X       jurisdiction of the Committee on Transportation and       Infrastructure (``Committee''). Since a committee report was       not filed on this bill this Congress, our sequential referral       request will not be adjudicated. However, H.R. 3702 closely       resembles H.R. 4557, the Reforming Disaster Recovery Act of       2017, introduced in the 115th Congress and for which the       Committee did receive a sequential referral.        According to House Rule X(l)(r), the Committee's       jurisdiction includes emergency management, specifically       ``Federal management of emergencies and natural disasters.''       As part of this jurisdiction, the Committee has authority       over the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), the       Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance       Act (Stafford Act), and activities relating to the full cycle       of emergency management--preparing for, protecting against,       responding to, recovering from, and mitigating against all       hazards--whether natural or man-made. Also falling under the       jurisdiction of the Committee are:        ``Flood control and improvement of rivers and harbors'';        ``Construction or maintenance of roads and post roads'';        ``Public works for the benefit of navigation, including       bridges and dams'';        ``Roads and the safety thereof'';        ``Transportation, including . . . transportation       infrastructure''; and        Economic development programs.        H.R. 3702 authorizes the Department of Housing and Urban       Development's (HUD) Community Development Block Grant-      Disaster Recovery (CDBG-DR) program, which was first funded       in 1993. The authority for the CDBG-DR program has       historically been a construct of appropriations bills. This       legislation would formally authorize in statute for the first       time a disaster program in HUD to provide assistance for       ``disaster relief, resiliency, long-term recovery,       restoration of infrastructure and housing, mitigation, and       economic revitalization in the most impacted and distressed       areas (as such term shall be defined by the Secretary by       regulation) resulting from a major disaster declared pursuant       to the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency       Assistance Act.'' In the past, the CDBG-DR program has only       been available for some declared disasters and activated via       appropriations bills when disasters have been of such a       magnitude that Congress has determined such additional       funding may be needed.        The current Federal authorities for preparing for,       responding to, and recovering from disasters were established       in the Disaster Relief Act of 1974 (P.L. 93-288) and       subsequently updated by the Stafford Act. Prior to the       establishment of FEMA in 1979, such programs and activities       were scattered throughout the Federal government. When FEMA       was moved into the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) in       2002, the authorities and activities of FEMA were dispersed       throughout the Department. During these reorganizations, the       Committee's jurisdiction flowed with the subject matter of       emergency management regardless of where and how such       authorities were dispersed. Then, Congress enacted the Post-      Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act (P.L. 109-295) in       2006, restoring FEMA and establishing it as the Federal       agency with the primary mission ``to reduce the loss of life       and property and protect the Nation from all hazards,       including natural disasters, acts of terrorism, and other       man-made disasters, by leading and supporting the Nation in a       risk-based, comprehensive emergency management system of       preparedness, protection, response, recovery, and       mitigation'' (6 U.S.C. 313).        Given that the CDBG-DR program could directly impact FEMA's       mission and programs, and potentially conflict with FEMA's       delivery of disaster assistance and administration of       recovery programs, codifying this major disaster assistance       program, regardless of what department or agency it is under,       should fall within the Committee's jurisdiction over the       ``Federal management of emergencies and natural disasters.''        There are even more potential conflicts impacting the       Committee's jurisdiction given the breadth of the projects       and activities CDBG-DR can fund. In addition to CDBG-DR funds       being used for disaster relief and long-term recovery, they       can also be  [[Page H8919]]       used for the restoration of infrastructure, housing, and       economic revitalization. These activities include rebuilding       homes, repairing roads and bridges, rebuilding or replacing       water and wastewater facilities, repairing public buildings,       and economic development. HUD could potentially establish       requirements for these activities funded through CDBG-DR that       conflict with the requirements and policies the Committee       establishes through our water resources and surface       transportation bills.        It is critical to ensure that our Federal emergency       management programs are coordinated, accountable, and       effective, and that oversight of these programs is clear.       Without the lead Committee on Federal emergency management--      the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure--      effectively able to carry out oversight of a disaster       program, the potential result is conflicting requirements and       guidance issued under different disaster programs with little       obligation to coordinate with each other. The result could be       new hurdles to recipients of Federal assistance and aid at a       time when we've seen a significant increase in disasters       impacting so many communities across our Nation. Because of       this, I also ask your cooperation in working to ensure that       future bills related to CDBG-DR are also referred to the       Committee.        At this time however, in order to expedite floor       consideration of H.R. 3702, the Committee agrees to forgo       action on the bill. This is conditional on our mutual       understanding that forgoing consideration of the bill would       not prejudice the Committee with respect to the appointment       of conferees or to any future jurisdictional claim over the       subject matters contained in the bill or similar legislation       that fall within the Committee's Rule X jurisdiction. I also       request that you urge the Speaker to name members of this       Committee to any conference committee named to consider such       provisions.        Please place a copy of this letter and your response       acknowledging our jurisdictional interest on H.R. 3702 into       the Congressional Record during consideration of the measure       on the House floor. I look forward to working with the       Committee on Financial Services as the bill moves through the       legislative process.            Sincerely,                                                  Peter A. DeFazio,      Chair.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                 Committee on Financial Services,                                  Washington, DC, November 18, 2019.      Hon. Peter A. DeFazio,      Chairman, House Committee on Transportation and           Infrastructure, Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Chairman: I am writing to acknowledge your letter       dated November 13, 2019, concerning H.R. 3702, the       ``Reforming Disaster Recovery Act of 2019.''. Noting that       H.R. 3702 differs substantially from H.R. 4557, introduced in       the 115th Congress, the Committee on Financial Services       confirms our mutual understanding that foregoing action on       H.R. 3702 does not prejudice any future jurisdictional claim       over the subject matters contained in the bill or similar       legislation, nor does it prejudice your committee from       seeking the appointment of conferees on the bill or such       legislation.        The Committee on Financial Services further acknowledges       your request for appointment of outside conferees from the       Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure for any       provisions within the Committee's Rule X jurisdiction should       this bill or similar language be considered in a conference       with the Senate.        Pursuant to your request, I will ensure that this exchange       of letters is included in the Committee report to H.R. 3702       and the Congressional Record during Floor consideration of       the bill. I appreciate your cooperation regarding this       legislation.            Sincerely,                                                     Maxine Waters,                                                        Chairwoman.     Mr. Speaker, I am honored to yield 1 minute to  the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), the honorable majority leader  of the House.   (Mr. HOYER asked and was given permission to revise and extend his  remarks.)    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman  from North Carolina (Mr. Price), the chair of the Appropriations  Committee Subcommittee on Transportation, and Housing and Urban  Development, and Related Agencies.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, point of inquiry, please, how much  time does the gentleman from North Carolina have remaining?    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, how much time do I have remaining?    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, for 26 years we have had the circumstances that we are  trying to correct with this bill. This bill is not perfect, but for 26  years, it has been an opportunity for those who desire to do otherwise  to bring the cause before the Congress of the United States of America.   It is ironic that this cause would be brought to the Congress at the  time we are about to pass significant legislation that the Governor of  North Carolina agrees with.   I have a letter that is signed by many Governors, one of whom is the  Governor of North Carolina. I won't read it in its entirety, but I do  think one line is salient and important. It reads: ``We''--all of these  Governors--``ask that Congress pass it as quickly as possible.'' Pass  it as quickly as possible.   They are talking about this bill, the Governor of North Carolina.   I would also add, Mr. Speaker, that FEMA has indicated on the record  that it does not desire to have this bill under the jurisdiction of  FEMA.   In fact, I have a statement from the associate administrator for  response and recovery, Mr. Jeff Byard, and it reads: ``I would love to  work with the committee about expanding our authorities . . .'' he is  talking about the Financial Services Committee. ``. . . to do a  different means of housing, but not to take on other agencies'  responsibilities or grants.'' He is talking about our agency, HUD.  They, meaning FEMA, do not want to take on the responsibilities that  HUD has already within its wheelhouse, as they say.   Now, Mr. Speaker, I would also add this: The Committee on Financial  Services is familiar with these kinds of concerns associated with  disaster relief. We have the Community Development Block Grant program  under our jurisdiction. We have the National Flood Insurance Program  under our jurisdiction.                                time  1700    And as a Member, I would tell you that I was born in Louisiana. I  know what New Orleans is like. I was there after Katrina. I saw what  happened, and I also saw thousands of people come to my district in  Houston, Texas,  [[Page H8923]]  where they were welcomed. They were welcomed, and many of them are  still in my district in Houston, Texas.   This is not to say that my colleagues have done anything wrong. I am  merely indicating that I have some understanding about what is  happening in Louisiana. But I also know what is happening in Texas.   Mr. Speaker, in Texas, within a 3-year period, we had billion-dollar  floods each year. We had Hurricane Harvey, the last, and Hurricane  Harvey took lives and inundated our city. It was like something we have  not seen before and, arguably, the country has not seen before, but we  suffered through it. And we want to make it easier for those persons  who were victimized, such as the ones who were victimized with Harvey,  to have a better means by which they can acquire long-term relief.   FEMA deals with immediate relief, emergency relief. HUD is dealing  with long-term relief. We are dealing with mitigation. Mitigation can  take years to accomplish because some of the structures that have to be  rebuilt can be rebuilt in no short order. It takes time. It takes  plans. You have to involve various agencies to rebuild these  structures. We are talking about long-term relief. That is what this  bill provides.   This bill also is about the business of making sure--and I must  commend Mr. Hoyer for this--that that mitigation relief that the  Governors that I spoke of wanted is contained in the bill. The  Governors called to our attention the need for mitigation relief, as  did the builders. And Mr. Hoyer, working with the builders, crafted the  mitigation language that is going to make a difference in the future.   It is not a perfect bill. We will not have a perfect bill in this  House--unless everybody agrees with me, and that is not likely to  happen. It is a good bill and all of my friends on the other side are  good people, every one of them. I have an inordinate amount of respect  for them, and I support their efforts to do more in the area with FEMA,  but I do not support efforts to remove this program from HUD.   HUD has had it for 26 years--hasn't been perfect--but we are trying  to perfect some of the issues associated with mitigation, some of the  issues associated with disaster relief. And we are doing a fairly good  job with this bill--not a perfect bill, but it is a good bill.   And I would hope that my colleagues--understanding that over the last  26 years, we haven't had a FEMA bill brought to the floor and passed,  and we now have the opportunity to pass this HUD bill, my hope is that  we will get it passed. My belief is this is the right bill for the  right time. It not only makes sense, it makes dollars and cents. It  will save money and it will save some lives.   Mr. Speaker, I would just mention a few more entities, if I may, with  reference to endorsement: the National Housing Resource Center; the  National Fair Housing Alliance; the National Low Income Housing  Coalition; Disaster Housing Recovery Coalition; and, of course, we have  the Consortium for Citizens with Disabilities Housing Task Force. Also,  Disaster Law Project; Enterprise Community Partners; Fair Share Housing  Center; and we have the Hispanic Federation. Also, Local Initiatives  Support Coalition; National Association of Councils on Developmental  Disabilities; National Coalition for Healthy Housing; National  Community Development Association; National Law Center on Homelessness  and Poverty; Paralyzed Veterans of America; and Texas Low Income  Housing Information Service. And many more.   Mr. Speaker, as I bring this to closure, I include in the Record a  letter from the Governors as it relates to this legislation.                                                    October 9, 2019.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Speaker of the House,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Mitch McConnell,      Majority Leader,      U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.      Hon. Kevin McCarthy,      Minority Leader,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Chuck Schumer,      Minority Leader,      U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Pelosi, Minority Leader McCarthy, Majority       Leader McConnell, and Minority Leader Schumer: Our states are       full of determined, tough people. For generations, our       families have weathered brutal hurricanes, killer tornadoes,       sustained flooding, and devastating forest fires. But recent       history tells us there's a new normal when it comes to these       natural disasters and if we don't rise to the challenge, they       will get the best of us.        As these natural disasters continue to increase in       frequency and devastation, we appreciate relief and recovery       assistance from the federal government. However, there are       critical reforms needed to ensure long-term disaster recovery       programs function more efficiently.        Right now, long-term federal disaster recovery assistance,       in the form of Community Development Block Grant--Disaster       Recovery (CDBG-DR) funding controlled by the U.S. Department       of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), gets passed by       Congress and announced with great fanfare, but affected       states are left to wait months--sometimes years--before HUD       publishes the Federal Register. A Federal Register is only       the first required step in a lengthy and bureaucratic       approval process setting out how that money can be put into       action.        CDBG-DR funds are routinely appropriated after natural       disasters, but the program is unauthorized, meaning states       must wait for new Federal Register guidelines after each       round of funding is announced. There are currently over 60       Federal Register Notices on record for CDBG-DR, with grantees       facing variable, overlapping and even contradictory details.        Many of us have met with the President, administration       officials, and our Congressional representatives to push for       changes. We need Congress to require HUD to publish program       requirements in the Federal Register within a much shorter       timeframe. Better yet, Congress could get the money to the       people who need it even faster by formally authorizing the       CDBG-DR program so that Federal Register instructions can be       significantly standardized and expedited. Bipartisan       legislation to do this has been introduced in both the House       and the Senate, with a clear intent to balance speed-to-need       and accountability for public resources. We ask that Congress       pass it as quickly as possible.        Another critical reform would create a universal       application for disaster survivors that would be shared among       FEMA, HUD and the Small Business Administration so people       busy with recovery only need to fill out one application.       Combining this with seamless interagency data sharing would       enable significantly better communication and coordination,       as well as faster disbursement of funds and improved       oversight and accountability.        We must all keep fighting for survivors recovering from       these disasters, working to rebuild their lives and protect       themselves from the next catastrophe. We owe it to them to       deliver on our mission for stronger, smarter, more resilient       communities.            Sincerely,      Governor Roy Cooper,        State of North Carolina.      Governor JB Pritzker,        State of Illinois.      Governor Mike Parson,         State of Missouri.      Governor Tony Evers,         State of Wisconsin.      Governor Kay Ivey,        State of Alabama.      Governor Eric Holcomb,         State of Indiana.      Governor Ralph Northam,         State of Virginia.     Mr. Speaker, with this said, I thank my  colleagues again. I consider them all honorable people, and I beg that  my colleagues would support this legislation that is 26 years in the  making. If it fails, I know not when we will stand in this position  again.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass  the bill (H.R. 4029) to amend the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance  Act to enable Indian Tribes and tribally designated housing entities to  apply for, receive, and administer grants and subgrants under the  Continuum of Care Program of the Department of Housing and Urban  Development, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 4029         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Tribal Access to Homeless       Assistance Act''.       SEC. 2. PARTICIPATION OF INDIAN TRIBES AND TRIBALLY                     DESIGNATED HOUSING ENTITIES IN CONTINUUM OF                     CARE PROGRAM.         (a) In General.--Title IV of the McKinney-Vento Homeless       Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 11360 et seq.) is amended--        (1) in section 401 (42 U.S.C. 11360)--        (A) by redesignating paragraphs (10) through (33) as       paragraphs (12) through (35), respectively;        (B) by redesignating paragraphs (8) and (9) as paragraphs       (9) and (10), respectively;        (C) by inserting after paragraph (7) the following:        ``(8) Formula area.--The term `formula area' has the       meaning given the term in section 1000.302 of title 24, Code       of Federal Regulations, or any successor regulation.'';        (D) in paragraph (9), as so redesignated, by inserting ``a       formula area,'' after ``nonentitlement area,''; and        (E) by inserting after paragraph (10), as so redesignated,       the following:        ``(11) Indian tribe.--The term `Indian Tribe' has the       meaning given the term `Indian tribe' in section 4 of the       Native American Housing Assistance and Self-Determination Act       of 1996 (25 U.S.C. 4103).''; and        (2) in subtitle C (42 U.S.C. 11381 et seq.), by adding at       the end the following:       ``SEC. 435. PARTICIPATION OF INDIAN TRIBES AND TRIBALLY                     DESIGNATED HOUSING ENTITIES.         ``Notwithstanding any other provision of this title, for       purposes of this subtitle, an Indian Tribe or tribally       designated housing entity (as defined in section 4 of the       Native American Housing Assistance and Self-Determination Act       of 1996 (25 U.S.C. 4103)) may--        ``(1) be a collaborative applicant or eligible entity; or        ``(2) receive grant amounts from another entity that       receives a grant directly from the Secretary, and use the       amounts in accordance with this subtitle.''.        (b) Technical and Conforming Amendment.--The table of       contents in section 101(b) of the McKinney-Vento Homeless       Assistance Act (Public Law 100-77; 101 Stat. 482) is amended       by inserting after the item relating to section 434 the       following:  ``Sec. 435. Participation of Indian Tribes and tribally designated                housing entities.''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks on this legislation and to insert extraneous material thereon.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4029, the  Tribal Eligibility for Homeless Assistance Grants Act of 2019, which  makes Tribes and tribally designated housing entities eligible to  receive McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Grant funding.   Mr. Speaker, Native Americans and Alaska Natives face some of the  worst housing and living conditions in the United States. They face  high poverty rates, unemployment, overcrowding. Standard housing  conditions are not something that they enjoy; in fact, they enjoy  substandard conditions. And they have unique issues for developing  housing.   As a result, Native Americans tend to be overrepresented among the  homeless population. Despite the prevalence of homeless in Native  communities, Tribes and tribally designated housing entities are not  currently eligible to compete for HUD McKinney-Vento Continuum of Care  grants.   Current housing assistance for Native communities fall substantially  short of meeting their affordable housing needs, and this bill would  direct more housing resources to address homelessness on Tribal lands.  I am proud to see that Members have worked together to put forth a  bipartisan bill to better address homelessness among Native Americans  and Alaska Natives.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Washington (Mr. Heck) for  introducing this important legislation that is aimed to help address  Tribal homelessness. I urge all Members to vote ``yes'' on this  important legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman  from Washington (Mr. Heck), a member of the Financial Services  Committee and the sponsor of this legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of  my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I, too, thank all of my colleagues for the bipartisan  support this bill has received. I thank the sponsor of this  legislation, Mr. Heck, again, for bringing it forward. It is an  important piece of legislation.   I would like to say this: Native Americans and Tribal communities  have, for too long, suffered from a lack of funding for housing and  homelessness assistance despite the growing need for safe, decent, and  affordable homes on Tribal lands.   Mr. Speaker, this is a bill that will bring some relief. It is not  perfect. Mr. Heck has said it is a first step.   I urge my colleagues to join me, Mr. Heck, and Mrs. Wagner in  supporting this piece of legislation, and I yield back the balance of  my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass  the bill (H.R. 5084) to amend the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to  require the submission by issuers of data relating to diversity and for  other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 5084         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Improving Corporate       Governance Through Diversity Act of 2019''.       SEC. 2. SUBMISSION OF DATA RELATING TO DIVERSITY BY ISSUERS.         Section 13 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15       U.S.C. 78m) is amended by adding at the end the following:        ``(s) Submission of Data Relating to Diversity.--        ``(1) Definitions.--In this subsection--        ``(A) the term `executive officer' has the meaning given       the term in section 230.501(f) of title 17, Code of Federal       Regulations, as in effect on the date of enactment of this       subsection; and        ``(B) the term `veteran' has the meaning given the term in       section 101 of title 38, United States Code.        ``(2) Submission of disclosure.--Each issuer required to       file an annual report under subsection (a) shall disclose in       any proxy statement and any information statement relating to       the election of directors filed with the Commission the       following:        ``(A) Data, based on voluntary self-identification, on the       racial, ethnic, and gender composition of--        ``(i) the board of directors of the issuer;        ``(ii) nominees for the board of directors of the issuer;       and        ``(iii) the executive officers of the issuer.        ``(B) The status of any member of the board of directors of       the issuer, any nominee for the board of directors of the       issuer, or any executive officer of the issuer, based on       voluntary self-identification, as a veteran.        ``(C) Whether the board of directors of the issuer, or any       committee of that board of directors, has, as of the date on       which the issuer makes a disclosure under this paragraph,       adopted any policy, plan, or strategy to promote racial,       ethnic, and gender diversity among--        ``(i) the board of directors of the issuer;        ``(ii) nominees for the board of directors of the issuer;       or        ``(iii) the executive officers of the issuer.        ``(3) Alternative submission.--In any 1-year period in       which an issuer required to file an annual report under       subsection (a) does not file with the Commission a proxy       statement relating to the election of directors or an       information statement, the issuer shall disclose the       information required under paragraph (2) in the first annual       report of issuer that the issuer submits to the Commission       after the end of that 1-year period.        ``(4) Annual report.--Not later than 18 months after the       date of the enactment of this subsection, and annually       thereafter, the Commission shall submit to the Committee on       Financial Services of the House of Representatives and to the       Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of the       Senate and publish on the website of the Commission a report       that analyzes the information disclosed pursuant to       paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) and identifies any trends in       such information.        ``(5) Best practices.--        ``(A) In general.--The Director of the Office of Minority       and Women Inclusion of the Commission shall, not later than       the end of the 3-year period beginning on the date of the       enactment of this subsection and every three years       thereafter, publish best practices for compliance with this       subsection.        ``(B) Comments.--The Director of the Office of Minority and       Women Inclusion of the  [[Page H8928]]       Commission may, pursuant to subchapter II of chapter 5 of       title 5, United States Code, solicit public comments related       to the best practices published under subparagraph (A).''.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks on this legislation and to insert extraneous material thereon.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 5084, the Improving  Corporate Governance Through Diversity Act of 2019.   I thank the chair of our Subcommittee on Consumer Protection and  Financial Institutions, the Honorable   Gregory Meeks, and the chair of  the Subcommittee on Investor Protection, Entrepreneurship, and Capital  Markets, the Honorable Carolyn Maloney, for this incredibly important  piece of legislation.   According to Deloitte's 2017 board diversity survey, 90 percent of  companies surveyed agreed that increased board diversity will improve  their company's ability to innovate as well as their overall business  performance.   Given the impact on performance, investors have an interest in the  extent to which companies include diverse perspectives and people in  their boardrooms and senior executive ranks.   Despite the acknowledgment by companies that the highest levels of  their organizations should reflect the diversity of their shareholders,  consumers, and America at large, the Alliance for Board Diversity  reported that, among Fortune 500 companies, 80.7 percent of new board  directors in 2017 were White men.   To address the lack of transparency and to shine a light on the lack  of representation of women and minorities in corporate boardrooms and  in the C-suite, H.R. 5084 would require public companies to annually  disclose the voluntarily self-identified gender, race, ethnicity, and  veteran status of their board of directors and nominees and senior  executive officers.   This bill would also establish a diversity advisory group at the  Securities and Exchange Commission and require the agency's Office of  Minority and Women Inclusion to publish best practices for compliance  with diversity reporting requirements.   We must ensure that the leadership of corporate America reflects the  growing diversity of our Nation. Transparency and disclosure are two  actions that allow progress toward racial and gender parity at the  highest levels of corporations.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 5084,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman  from New York (Mr. Meeks), the chair of our Subcommittee on Consumer  Protection and Financial Institutions.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman  from New York (Mrs. Carolyn B. Maloney), the chair of the Subcommittee  on Investor Protection, Entrepreneurship, and Capital Markets.    Mr. Speaker, I, too, encourage my colleagues to  please support this important piece of legislation. It will make  meaningful change.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass  the bill (H.R. 4344) to amend the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to  allow the Securities and Exchange Commission to seek and Federal courts  to grant disgorgement of unjust enrichment, and for other purposes, as  amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 4344         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Investor Protection and       Capital Markets Fairness Act''.       SEC. 2. ADDITIONAL RELIEF.         (a) In General.--Section 21(d) of the Securities Exchange       Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78u(d)) is amended by adding at the       end the following:        ``(7) Additional relief.--        ``(A) In general.--In any action or proceeding brought or       instituted by the Commission under any provision of the       securities laws, the Commission may seek, and any Federal       court may grant the following additional relief:        ``(i) Disgorgement in the amount of any unjust enrichment       obtained as a result of the act or practice with respect to       which the Commission is bringing such an action or       proceeding.        ``(ii) Injunctions, including officer and director bars.        ``(B) Rule of construction.--Additional relief sought under       this paragraph may not be construed to be a civil fine,       penalty, or forfeiture subject to chapter 163 of part VI of       title 28, United States Code.        ``(C) Statute of limitations.--A Federal court may not       issue relief under this paragraph if the action or proceeding       brought or instituted by the Commission was commenced more       than 14 years after the alleged violation.''.        (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by this section       shall apply with respect to any actions or proceedings       pending or commenced on or after the date of the enactment of       this section.

SEC. 3. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS.         The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.   [[Page H8930]]      Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend  their remarks on this legislation and to insert extraneous material  thereon.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 4344.   I would like to start by commending my colleagues, Representatives  McAdams and Huizenga, for crafting this bipartisan solution to a  problem that, in just 2 years, has cost investors approximately $1.1  billion.   In 2017, the Supreme Court, in Kokesh v. SEC, held that the authority  of the Securities and Exchange Commission, SEC, to recover for  investors the wrongful gains of securities law violators, known as  disgorgement, is effectively a penalty. As a result, the SEC's  authority to obtain disgorgement is time limited by the general Federal  statute of limitations for penalties so that the SEC must bring its  case within 5 years of the violation.   This ruling was a boon to white-collar criminals like Bernie Madoff  and Allen Stanford, who are now able to defraud investors for a decade  and keep their profits.   Even worse, the SEC is currently in litigation before the Supreme  Court over whether it even has the authority to obtain disgorgement for  investors.   I am pleased that H.R. 4344 would ensure that the SEC has the tools  it needs to hold bad actors accountable and to return funds to harmed  investors by clarifying that the SEC does indeed have disgorgement  authority, and its authority reasonably extends to 14 years following  the date of violation. This longer time limit would ensure that the SEC  has enough time to detect and sue the Bernie Madoffs of the world.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman  from Utah (Mr. McAdams), the sponsor of the legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman from Utah an  additional 1 minute.    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman from Utah an  additional 30 seconds.    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman from Utah an  additional 10 seconds.    Mr. Speaker, I submit for the Record a letter on  this legislation from the Chair of the SEC, Mr. Clayton.                                        United States Securities and                                             Exchange Commission,                                  Washington, DC, November 17, 2019.      Re H.R. 4344, the Investor Protection and Capital Markets           Fairness Act.       Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Speaker, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Kevin McCarthy,      Republican Leader, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Pelosi and Leader McCarthy, I write concerning       the importance to our investors and our markets of the       Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC or Commission)       authority to seek disgorgement of unjust enrichment from       those who have violated the federal securities laws. This       authority is particularly important in circumstances where       retail investors have been the victims of long-running, well-      concealed frauds, including Ponzi schemes. For these victims,       an action by the SEC seeking disgorgement may be the only       practical means of recourse.        The recent Supreme Court decision in Kokesh v. SEC, 137 S.       Ct. 1635 (2017), significantly limited the SEC's authority to       seek disgorgement. In Kokesh, the Supreme Court found our use       of the disgorgement remedy operated as a penalty, which       subjected that remedy to a five-year statute of limitations       from the date of the misconduct. As a result, our ability to       address well-concealed frauds has been significantly       restricted, including in situations where our Main Street       investors need us most. More recently, the SEC's ability to       seek disgorgement in any district court action has been       questioned.        With deference to your judgment regarding the appropriate       length for the statute of limitations and other terms, I       respectively request that you act to ensure that we are able       to seek disgorgement to the extent appropriate to protect our       investors and our markets. Prompt congressional action also       would remove the uncertainty regarding our  [[Page H8932]]       general authority to seek disgorgement in district court.        Fortunately, the U.S. House of Representative is       considering H.R. 4344, the Investor Protection and Capital       Markets Fairness Act, which would amend the Securities       Exchange Act of 1934 to explicitly provide the Commission       with authority to seek disgorgement of unjust enrichment in       district courts. I greatly appreciate this bipartisan,       bicameral work underway to address this important issue and       welcome the opportunity to continue to work with Congress to       ensure defrauded retail investors can get their investment       dollars back while being true to the principles embedded in       statutes of limitations.                    Importance of Disgorgement as a Remedy         The SEC's longstanding ability to obtain disgorgement of       ill-gotten gains in federal district court is an important       tool for our enforcement program and has allowed the agency       to return billions of dollars to innocent investors       victimized by perpetrators of fraud. For many--if not most--      of these victims, disgorgement awards in SEC cases are the       only practical way to recoup what was stolen from them. The       Commission is committed to returning money to harmed       investors promptly and has worked hard to improve the       effectiveness of our distribution program over recent years.       Since the beginning of Fiscal Year 2017, the hard work of the       women and men of the SEC has led to the return of over $3       billion to harmed investors.                  Impact of Kokesh on Main Street Investors         Notwithstanding these successes, the Supreme Court's       decision in Kokesh has impacted the SEC's ability to return       funds fraudulently taken from Main Street investors. In       Kokesh, the Supreme Court found our use of the disgorgement       remedy operated as a penalty, which subjected the       Commission's ability to seek disgorgement of ill-gotten gains       to a five-year statute of limitations.        The Kokesh case itself highlights this problem in stark       terms. Of the $34.9 million that Charles Kokesh       misappropriated, $29.9 million fell outside of the 5-year       statute of limitations. The SEC was unable to collect that       $29.9 million from him for distribution to his victims, who       largely consisted of small-dollar Main Street investors.        Overall, since Kokesh was decided, at least $1.1 billion in       ill-gotten gains has been unavailable for possible       distribution to harmed investors. Much of this is tied to       losses by investors.                    Importance of Statutes of Limitations         The SEC's authority to seek disgorgement should not be       unbounded. I agree that statutes of limitations serve       important functions in our legal system, and as a general       matter, our remedial authority should be subject to       reasonable limitations periods. However, as I look across the       scope of misconduct we encounter, including most notably       Ponzi schemes and affinity frauds, I believe a period longer       than five years from the date of the misconduct is       appropriate in various circumstances. This is especially the       case in our private, retail markets where there are fewer       causes of action and safeguards available compared to the       public capital markets. Further, we often see fraudsters       target certain categories of investors. These investors--      notably teachers, military service personnel, the elderly,       and religious-affiliated groups--need and deserve legal       protection and the SEC's attention, particularly in the case       of private, targeted frauds.     H.R. 4344, the Investor Protection and Capital Markets Fairness Act         H.R. 4344 would address two important issues. First, the       bill addresses the result of the Supreme Court's ruling in       Kokesh that SEC disgorgement claims are subject to a five-      year statute of limitations. The Court's holding has had the       anomalous effect of allowing the most ``successful''       perpetrators of fraud--those who prevent the discovery of       their schemes for longer than the limitations period--to keep       their ill-gotten gains. H.R. 4344 will ensure that       sophisticated fraudsters who carry out some of the most       harmful frauds, including Ponzi schemes that can defraud       investors for long periods of time before being uncovered,       cannot keep their victims' money.        Second, some perpetrators of fraud have tried to keep their       ill-gotten gains arguing that district courts lack the power       to order disgorgement in any Commission action. The primary       objective of disgorgement is to return circumstances to the       pre-fraud status quo. The Supreme Court recently granted       certiorari to address this question in Liu v. SEC, No. 18-      1501. H.R. 4344 would confirm and ratify district courts'       authority to do what they have been doing for decades--order       violators to surrender the money they obtained by breaking       the securities laws so that victims have a chance to be       compensated.        H.R. 4344 is an important response to real harms suffered       by innocent victims of the worst types of securities frauds.       These are frauds that undermine the public confidence in our       markets that the 4,400 women and men of the SEC strive to       preserve every day.        Thank you for your continuing commitment to America's       investors and our markets.            Very truly yours,                                                       Jay Clayton,                                                          Chairman.     Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman  from New York (Mrs. Carolyn B. Maloney), who happens to be the  chairperson of the Subcommittee on Investor Protection,  Entrepreneurship, and Capital Markets.    I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my  time.   I, too, urge support of this bill, specifically because it would  protect the SEC's longstanding authority to recover for investors the  unjust enrichment from defendants and set a reasonable time limit to do  so. I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass  bill (H.R. 4300) to provide Federal housing assistance on behalf of  youths who are aging out of foster care, and for other purposes, as  amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.

The amendments made by this Act shall not apply to housing       choice voucher assistance made available pursuant to section       8(x) of the United States Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C.       1437f(x)) that is in use on behalf of an assisted family as       of the date of the enactment of this Act.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks on this legislation and to insert extraneous material thereon.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 4300, the Fostering  Stable Housing Opportunities Act of 2019. This bill will help to ensure  that our young adults aging out of foster care and at risk of  homelessness have the housing assistance they need. In addition, this  bill includes incentives for these young adults to participate in  activities or programs to help them achieve self-sufficiency.   The young people who have aged out of the foster care system face  many challenges as they abruptly face adulthood without many of the  supports needed to help them make the transition. These young people  have limited resources with which to secure safe and stable housing,  which leaves them at heightened risk of experiencing homelessness.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume  to the gentlewoman from Pennsylvania (Ms. Dean), the sponsor of the  bill.    Mr. Speaker, I simply want to thank Mrs. Wagner  for working with me and the other members of the committee. I would  like to also thank Ms. Dean and Mr. Stivers for introducing this  important piece of legislation that is aimed at protecting some of our  most vulnerable young people who too often fall into homelessness after  they age out of foster care.   Mr. Speaker, I support this legislation and urge my colleagues to do  so, and I yield back the balance of my time.
