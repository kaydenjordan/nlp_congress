 Madam Chair, the increased cost of energy over the last  couple of years under the Biden administration has put tremendous  strains on small businesses, families, and my neighbors across  Pennsylvania and across our country.   My district does encompass a good portion of the Marcellus shale, one  of the highest natural gas producing regions, in fact, in the world.   Energy is jobs. Energy is good pay. Natural gas is about education.  The schools that are developing throughout my communities in order to  enrich young people for the future and have them stay in Pennsylvania  is so incredibly meaningful, Madam Chair.   Natural gas, Madam Chair, is one of the cleanest energies known to  man. A tripling, it is known, of the use of natural gas will enormously  reduce carbon emissions on a worldwide perspective. There is so much  good about this. Natural gas is an answer to any transitional carbon- free emissions.   Madam Chair, this administration has been doing everything it can to  assault domestic energy and is truly choosing Venezuela over  Pennsylvania and OPEC over Texas, and the list can go on.                                time  1400    This is senseless. H.R. 1 corrects a lot of this. H.R. 1 is about  energy independence, which improves our national security. It is about  less carbon emissions because we do create the cleanest energy in the  world. H.R. 1 is about strengthening America, Madam Chair.
