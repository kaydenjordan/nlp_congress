 Mr. Speaker, I never thought in coming to Congress that I  would be voting on legislation that would take away health insurance  from 24 million Americans, including my own constituents.   The Speaker said that this legislation is an act of mercy. I think it  is merciless. Every human being has a spark of divinity in them, and we  dishonor that with this legislation. It is not worthy of the American  people. There is less coverage, higher costs, elimination of essential  services--not only for what people need day to day but for the  unexpected. That is what insurance is all about.   There is a crushing age tax for people between the ages of 50 and 64.  What has happened to the GOP? Is it now ``get older people''?   This does not deserve one vote in the House of Representatives. It is  shameful, and it is immoral.
