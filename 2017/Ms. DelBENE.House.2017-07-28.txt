 Mr. Speaker, 26 States and the District of Columbia have  legalized some form of marijuana, including my home State of  Washington. Yet marijuana possession or use for any purpose is still  prohibited under Federal law, leaving my constituents, including cancer  patients, at risk of prosecution.   That is why today I am reintroducing the State Marijuana and  Regulatory Tolerance Enforcement Act, the SMART Enforcement Act. My  bill will fix the conflict between State and Federal law by giving  States a waiver from the Controlled Substances Act.   It also resolves the banking issues currently forcing dispensaries to  operate in an unsafe all-cash basis.   These waivers will ensure people in States that have different laws  from the Federal Government on marijuana are protected from  prosecution, provided they meet certain requirements, because people in  these States should not live in fear of unpredictable actions from the  Attorney General and the Department of Justice on this issue.                            ____________________
