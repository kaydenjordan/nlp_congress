 Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to  recognize and thank the chair of the Senate Health, Education, Labor,  and Pensions Committee and Senator from Tennessee, Lamar Alexander.  Senator Alexander has committed his life to public service for both the  people of Tennessee and Nation. He served first as the Governor of  Tennessee, then as the Secretary of Education under President George H.  W. Bush from 1991 to 1993, and finally in the U.S. Senate since 2003.  Senator Alexander has served more years as Governor and U.S. Senator  than any other Tennessean who has occupied both positions. It has been  an Honor to serve with Senator Alexander over the past 4 years.   As chair of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee,  Senator Alexander dedicated the end of his Senate career to issues such  as the opioid epidemic, supporting mental health providers, lowering  prescription drug prices, and cultivating innovation in the medical  field, just to name a few. During his tenure as chair Senator Alexander  presided over more than 70 hearings and oversaw more than 45 bills that  eventually became law.   Senator Alexander has dedicated his career to faithfully representing  the people of our great country, believing that ``the best decisions  are made by those closest to the people.'' Thank you, again, to Senator  Alexander. I wish him a long and peaceful retirement, playing piano and  spending time with his wife, Honey, their children and grandchildren,  and dog, Rufus.    Mr. President, I would like to recognize and thank  the Senator from Kansas, Pat Roberts. He has served the people of  Kansas and our Nation in Congress for nearly 40 years, serving 16 years  in the House of Representatives and in U.S. Senate since 1997. Over the  past 4 years, I have had the pleasure of serving with Senator Roberts  in the Senate, including on the Committee on Rules and Administration  and the Finance Committee for the last 2 years.   Senator Roberts has been a pragmatic partner on legislation focused  on supporting rural hospitals and telehealth access during the  pandemic. We introduced the Rural ACO Improvement Act to support rural  health care providers as well as the Ensuring Parity in Medicare  Advantage for Audio-Only Telehealth Act to protect seniors' access to  telehealth visits even when video is not available during the COVID-19  public health emergency. I respect and appreciate Senator Roberts's  dedication to these important issues.   Senator Roberts has had a long and esteemed tenure in Congress, and  his emphasis on working across the aisle can be seen clearly with the  record number of votes in favor for the 2018 farm bill. His evident  love for his family, rich heritage as a fourth-generation Kansan, and  his call for levity and humor in the Senate to ensure bipartisanship  will be remembered for years to come. I thank Senator Roberts and wish  him, his wife Franki, and his family all the best in the coming years.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I want to take a moment to recognize  and thank the Senator from Wyoming, Mike Enzi. He has served the State  of Wyoming and our Nation for more than 40 years, first as the Mayor of  Gillette, then in both chambers of the Wyoming Legislature, and finally  in the U.S. Senate since 1997. Over the past 4 years, I have had the  pleasure of serving with Senator Enzi in the Senate, including on the  Finance Committee for the last 2 years. Together, we introduced the  1921 Silver Dollar Coin Anniversary Act, to celebrate the anniversary  of the Peace silver dollar memorializing the end of World War I.   Senator Enzi has had a long and distinguished tenure in the Senate as  both the chair and ranking member of the Health, Education, Labor, and  Pensions Committee and as the chair of the Budget Committee. Across all  his legislative efforts, Senator Enzi has remained a staunch advocate  of his ``80 percent tool''--the belief that we can get a lot done when  we can agree on 80 percent of the issues 80 percent of the time. This  lesson is one that we all should take to heart as we enter the 117th  Congress and the future.   Senator Enzi's legacy and his words of wisdom--do what is right, do  your best, treat others as they wish to be treated--will continue to  remind us to work hard and serve our constituents to the best of our  abilities. I wish him a peaceful retirement fly-fishing on the banks of  Wyoming's rivers, and I wish his wife Diana and his family all the best  in the next chapter.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I would like to recognize and thank  Senator Johnny Isakson for his service  [[Page S7706]]  in the U.S. Congress. Having served in the House of Representatives  from 1999 to 2004 and later in the Senate from 2005 until his  retirement in 2019, Senator Isakson has dedicated himself to supporting  longstanding, bipartisan measures. His ability to find common ground  and his commitment to public service are a reflection of his adherence  to Georgians' and our Nation's values. It is my honor to have served  alongside Senator Isakson during the 116th Congress.   In his tenure, Senator Isakson sponsored over 130 bills--a testament  to his determination and aptitude to work across party lines. Having  served in the Georgia Air National Guard, Senator Isakson played a key  role in passing salient legislation to aid our veterans. As chairman of  the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs, he led the Department of  Veterans Affairs Educational Assistance Improvement Act of 2017, which  created opportunities for veterans to pursue higher education. I am  proud to have cosponsored this bill in my first year in office and to  have worked with Senator Isakson to unite Congress in support of our  veterans, among many other bipartisan causes led by Johnny.   Senator Isakson's time in office has left a profound mark in the  Halls of Congress. I am confident his courage, compassion, and  celebrated accomplishments will be remembered for years to come. I  thank Senator Isakson for his service and send my best wishes to him  and his wife Dianne and their children, Kevin, Julie, and John.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I want to take a moment to recognize  and thank the vice chairman of the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs,  Senator Udall, for his years of leadership in the Senate, on our  committee, and for his commitment and service to  [[Page S7707]]  our Tribal communities. It has been an honor to serve with him the past  4 years.   I want to thank Senator Udall for his wisdom, his mentorship, and the  example that he has set for us through his many years in Congress and  in the Senate. I also want to thank his staff for their support of all  of our work in the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs. Senator Udall's  tireless leadership and ability to work across the aisle with Chairman  Hoeven, each Member of the Senate, and our Tribal leaders has  encouraged all of us to truly work together in a bipartisan manner to  find solutions on behalf of our Tribal communities.   I am particularly thankful, for Senator Udall's leadership in helping  ensure that Senator Murkowski's and my bills, the Not Invisible Act and  Savanna's Act, became law. With their passage, we are finally beginning  to address the serious epidemic of missing and murdered indigenous  women and girls. His commitment to combatting violence against Native  women and children has been crucial for their success.   Senator Udall's achievements in the Senate stand as a testament to  the spirit of the West, which we both call home. From conserving and  protecting our public lands through the Great American Outdoors Act and  championing the rights of Indian Country, to empowering our Tribal  communities through introducing the Native American Voting Rights Act  and ensuring vital coronavirus relief funds and care reach those who  need it most, Senator Udall has always prioritized the needs of western  communities.   Whether it is through finding creative solutions to address the  homework gap through partnering with me to introduce E-Rate Support for  School Bus Wi-Fi, or fighting for quality housing through  reauthorization of the Native American Housing Assistance and Self- Determination Act, his work here has led to tangible benefits for rural  and Native communities in my home State of Nevada and all across the  country.   I have no doubt that Senator Udall's legacy of service here will  continue to leave a powerful impact on the lives of many in our Tribal  communities for years to come, so thank you again, Senator Udall, for  all your contributions.    Mr. President, I want to recognize and thank  Senator Cory Gardner for his years of service to the people of  Colorado. Senator Gardner has served the people of Colorado for 15  years as a member of the State house of representatives, a Congressman  from Colorado Fourth District, and as a U.S. Senator. It has been an  honor to serve with him in the U.S. Senate and alongside him on the  Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.   Like my home State of Nevada, Colorado is a precious treasure of the  American West, famed for its soaring peaks and beautiful countryside.  Senator Gardner committed himself to protect and preserve heritage  through championing our national parks and public lands with the  passage of the Great Americans Outdoors Act. Senator Gardner also  understands that preserving our outdoor spaces is vital to our western  economies and to the physical and emotional well-being of the people  who call our State home. I must thank him for supporting our  successful, bipartisan effort to reauthorize Brand USA to promote the  United States as a destination to global travelers and support workers  and businesses in tourism and hospitality in our States. I also want to  thank him for partnering with me on the ACCESS Broadband Act to enhance  access to Federal broadband programs and deliver these vital services  to our rural communities. Finally, I must acknowledge Senator Gardner  for joining Senators Burr, Sinema, Congressman DeSaulnier, and me in  introducing the Moving FIRST Act to invest in our local communities  infrastructure to help them overcome local challenges and meet the  needs of the future.   Thank you, again, to Senator Gardner, for his public service. It has  been an honor to work with him here in the Senate and join in his  commitment to all of us throughout the region we call home.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I want to take a moment to recognize  and thank Senator Doug Jones for his service in the U.S. Senate and to  the people of Alabama. In just 2 years, Senator Jones has become a  respected voice in the Senate and built a reputation as someone who  puts the interests of his constituents before partisanship or ideology.  It has been a privilege working alongside him during the 116th  Congress.   Senator Jones's achievements are remarkable for a first-term Senator.  I was proud to work with him on his Military Widow's Tax Elimination  Act, which helps ensure that nearly 70,000 surviving military spouses  receive their full benefits, as he shepherded this important  legislation through Congress. He has also passed legislation to expand  insurance coverage for COVID-19 vaccines and treatments, helped his  rural constituents navigate the healthcare system, and promoted justice  for victims in unsolved criminal civil rights cases. I am proud to have  worked with him on my legislation to expand workforce development  programs and hands-on learning in high schools.   These incredible accomplishments demonstrate the hard work and  dedication that Senator Jones brought to the Senate. He is a man with  unwavering principles but a strong drive to find common ground and  bring tangible benefits to the people of Alabama.   Senator Jones's legacy in the Senate is one I hope we can all  remember as we look to work together for the betterment of our States  and the Nation. It has been a privilege to work alongside him for the  last 2 years, and I know he will continue to inspire us all as he  begins the next chapter in his distinguished life.    Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to  recognize and thank Senator Martha McSally for her career of service. I  had the pleasure of serving alongside Senator McSally on various  committees but primarily wanted to underscore our work together on the  Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources' Subcommittee on Water  and Power. In her capacity as subcommittee chair and mine as ranking  Member, we were successful in shepherding the Colorado River Drought  Contingency Plan Authorization Act, P.L. 116-1, through the Senate and  ensuring that it was signed into law on April 16, 2019. This monumental  legislation culminated years of work by the seven Colorado River basin  States, researchers, local stakeholders, and Tribal governments, and  affirmed the commitments made by the basin States to reduce States'  water usage and target minimum water levels for reservoirs in the  river's watershed, such as Lake Mead on the Arizona-Nevada border and  Lake Powell on the Utah-Arizona border. I commend Senator McSally's  dedication to this effort to secure sustainable water levels for the 40  million Americans who rely on the Colorado River as a water source. It  has truly been a pleasure to work with Senator McSally on this and  other western priorities, and I wish her and her family all the best in  their future endeavors.                            ____________________
