 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from New Jersey for  his long-time leadership in protecting innocent, unborn lives. He was  here at the beginning. The fathers of the pro-life movement here in the  United States Congress were Chris Smith and Henry Hyde.   Speaking of Henry Hyde, we have had for a long time something called  the Hyde amendment, which basically said U.S. tax dollars could not go  to pay for abortions, but we have a radical pro-abortion group of  people that control this Congress now. They think that tax dollars  ought to go to pay for other people's abortions.   They also believe that not only should we pay for abortions here in  the United States with the people's tax dollars, but they ought to pay  for abortions across the globe, and that is a reversal of the Mexico  City policy.   The Supreme Court is currently considering two cases that may  fundamentally alter abortion in this country, and it is my hope, my  sincere hope, that this Court will finally right a grievous past wrong  and give the rights to the most vulnerable among us, the unborn, and  protect lives in the future rather than what has happened in the  slaughter of over 63 million of our fellow citizens.    I want to thank Mr. Smith and all the other Members who will be  speaking here today for their leadership on this vital, vital issue.
