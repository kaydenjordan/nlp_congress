 Madam President, I rise today to talk about a New Mexico  family who is severely impacted by the shutdown, and I think there are  probably hundreds of thousands of families like this across the  country.   This is Leah Teresa Ornelas, her husband Ervie, and their sons Ian  and Zachary. They are all from Carlsbad, NM. Zachary, their youngest-- in the middle--had a brain tumor and has undergone two surgeries.  Zachary is now disabled and requires constant care. Ervie, his  stepfather, reduced his work as a daycare teacher by 75 percent to take  care of Zachary. Leah is a public nurse, and her paycheck goes to their  high insurance costs and medical bills. The family moved back in  together to save on expenses. Their older son, Ian, is now the main  provider for the family. Ian works for the Department of  [[Page S244]]  the Interior, has been furloughed for 26 days, and has now missed a  paycheck.   The Ornelas family is scared to death that Ian will miss another  check and another check. They simply cannot make it without Ian being  paid. The Ornelas family has made tremendous sacrifices as a family.  They can make no more adjustments, as the President callously advised.   This Trump shutdown must end now. The President and Senate majority  must do the right thing for the Ornelas family--and for hundreds of  thousands of families across the Nation--and open our government now.   I yield the floor.
