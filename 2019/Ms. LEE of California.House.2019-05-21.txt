 Madam Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the  100th anniversary of the 19th Amendment passing in the House giving  women the right to vote.   Today, along with my yellow rose, I stand here wearing a purple and a  black ribbon honoring the history of African American women who are  unsung heroes, like Sojourner Truth, and Ida B. Wells, and Mary Church  Terrell.   These women fought tirelessly so all women would have the right to  vote. Although, even after the ratification of the 19th Amendment, many  Black women and Native American women were still denied their voting  rights.   Madam Speaker, let us not forget the sacrifices and the achievements  of Black women and all women of color who continue to fight for women's  right to vote, many of whose names we may never know, but without whom  many of us would not be here today.   As we celebrate this important milestone with this historic number of  women and women of color in Congress, let us remember the words of  suffragette Mary Church Terrell. She said: ``And so, lifting as we  climb, onward and upward we go.''                         [From ACLU, May 18, 2019]   Celebrate Women's Suffrage, but Don't Whitewash the Movement's Racism         My 94-year-old great-aunt, Paralee Wilmer--we call her       Aunty Lee--voted for the first time after moving to       Cincinnati, Ohio, in 1944. Born to no-nonsense, small farmers       in Millers Ferry, Alabama, and the youngest daughter of 12       children, Aunty Lee was one among many African Americans who       moved from the South to the North in search of better job       opportunities and greater freedoms during the The Great       Migration. These freedoms included the right to vote without       intimidation or any other hindrance.        Aunty Lee's memory is a bit cloudy regarding whether the       first time she cast her ballot was in an election for local       politicians or a presidential race, but one thing she knows       for sure is her pastor at the time inspired her to exercise       her constitutional rights and fulfill her civic duties. He       said, ``When it's time to vote, make sure you vote. When it's       time to do grand jury, make sure you go.''        At age 20, Aunty Lee understood the magnitude of her       pastor's advice, given the disenfranchisement of Black folks       that she witnessed growing up in Millers Ferry--including       poll taxes, literacy tests, and outright violence and       intimidation that prevented Black people from voting. To be a       Black citizen in America but denied full citizenship rights       epitomizes the hypocrisy of American democracy. This is a sad       truth that I repeat like a blues refrain to my students.        This summer--as the nation celebrates the 170th anniversary       of the first major convention for women's rights at Seneca       Falls and the 98th anniversary of the 19th Amendment to the       Constitution, which granted women the right to vote--how do       we reconcile widespread narratives of a triumphant, steady       march towards women's enfranchisement with the more       complicated and painful reality of my great-aunt's lived       experience as a young, Black woman in Jim Crow America?        One word: intersectionality.        Legal scholar Kimberle Crenshaw argues that racism and       sexism intersect in a manner that compounds Black women's       oppression. Although the above historical events occurred       long before Crenshaw articulated intersectionality, this       insightful theory should be applied to all historical       narratives that do not fully engage with the lived       experiences of African-American women.        What do we notice when we take an intersectional view of       the events that transpired at Seneca Falls? How does our       understanding of the history of all women's political       empowerment in the United States change?        When suffragists gathered in Seneca Falls, New York, in       July 1848, they advocated for the right of white women to       vote. The participants were middle and upper-class white       women, a cadre of white men supporters and one African-      American male--Frederick Douglass. The esteemed abolitionist       had forged a strong working relationship with fellow       abolitionists and white women suffragists, including       Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony. No Black women       attended the convention. None were invited.        Although women of color were profoundly absent at Seneca       Falls, a greater degree of cultural inclusion was on the       horizon. In May 1851, African-American abolitionist Sojourner       Truth spoke at a women's rights convention in Akron, Ohio.       During her famous speech on the abolition of slavery and the       promotion of women's rights, Truth allegedly bared her breast       and proclaimed, ``Ain't I a woman?''        It was a melodramatic act and statement, but as historian       Nell Painter argues, it never happened Instead, it was a       quaint fiction crafted by convention organizer Frances Dana       Gage and other white feminists who depicted Truth to white       audiences as a genuine albeit primitive ally in the fight for       women's rights. Thus, the 1851 convention marked a modicum of       progress, but this progress is tainted by white suffragists'       attempts to control Truth's voice.        By the turn of the 20th century, Black suffragists such as       Mary Church Terrell represented intersectional feminism at       its best. Born to former slaves in Memphis, Tennessee,       Terrell earned her bachelor's and master's degrees from       Oberlin College and served as president of the National       Association of Colored Women. In February 1898, Terrell spoke       at the National American Woman Suffrage Association       convention in Washington, D.C.        Her speech forced powerful white women attendees to reflect       on the compounding oppressions and systemic violence that       Black women endured during slavery. She ended on a more       optimistic note--praising the sheer grit and intellect of       freed women. Terrell's rhetorical style echoed the American       ethos of self-made men and women, but she oversimplified the       historical reality that the paths to racial and gender       equality are long, jagged, and still unwinding.        The history of women's suffrage in America is not nice or       neat, because the impact of white supremacy is broad and       human nature is messy. Furthermore, a nation built on stolen       land from Native Americans and stolen labor from African       slaves is flawed from the start. We must constantly       acknowledge this truth and engage in an intersectional       celebration of women's rights activists and landmark events.        In addition to celebrating the passage of the 19th       Amendment, let's celebrate the upcoming birthday of African-      American suffragist Mary Church Terrell, who would be 155 on       September 23. Let's celebrate the lives and legacies of the       true Sojourner Truth, abolitionist and suffragist Harriet       Tubman, and Shirley Chisholm--the first Black woman elected       to Congress and to seriously run for president.        Let us celebrate and support current-day Black Lives Matter       founders and organizers Alicia Garza, Patrisse Cullors, and       Opal Tometi, three queer Black women committed to ``placing       those at the margins closer to the center'' of political       leadership. Last but not least, let's celebrate the lives of       everyday people like my Aunty Lee--a Black woman born and       raised in Jim Crow Alabama who sought out a better life in       Ohio and has religiously exercised her right to vote for the       past 74 years. Let us celebrate these Black women while       recognizing that the struggle to vote without obstacles       continues.                            ____________________
