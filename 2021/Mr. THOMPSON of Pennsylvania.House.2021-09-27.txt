 Madam Speaker, I rise today to  celebrate Penn State University's Berkey Creamery on their 2021 award  for Best Whole Chocolate Milk. It only seems fitting to announce this  award today, on National Chocolate Milk Day.   The creamery took home this award on August 30 at the World Dairy  Expo Championship Dairy Product Contest. And I can attest it is  delicious.   Whole milk is the number one provider of nine essential nutrients as  well as a great deal of long-term benefits. Millions of Americans  nationwide enjoy it. In fact, 70 percent of milk consumed is flavored,  with chocolate milk being the most popular. But milk consumption is  declining, and due to misguided public policy, this nutritious beverage  was removed from the National Lunch Program.   Earlier this year, my colleague, Mr. Antonio Delgado and I introduced  the Whole Milk for Healthy Kids Act. This legislation would provide our  students with the nutrient-rich beverage by bringing flavored and  unflavored whole milk back into the school cafeterias.   Madam Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to celebrate today with a  large glass of chocolate milk.                            ____________________
