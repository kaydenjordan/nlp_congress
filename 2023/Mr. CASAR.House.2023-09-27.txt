 Mr. Chair, we must stop the dangerous, expensive, corrupt,  and ineffective political stunts at the border and instead chart a new  path for a safe, orderly, and humane immigration system. Abbott's  Operation Lone Star must end, and I urge passage of the amendment of  the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Castro), my good friend, to ensure  Federal funding does not go to this failed program.   Every day, Texas Governor Greg Abbott violates the rights of asylum  seekers and violates the rights of our border communities all to score  political points against President Biden. We have seen these inhumane  policies in action that have taken the lives of children at the border,  and we have lost National Guardsmen to death.    This is not only inhumane, but Operation Lone Star is not effective.  Governor Abbott is lighting $25 million on fire every week to cause  suffering instead of creating solutions.   Why do my colleagues across the aisle not want solutions? Because  they have no interest in a functioning immigration system. They thrive  off of keeping the immigration system broken so they can continue to  stoke anti-immigrant fears for their own politics.   Operation Lone Star, furthermore, is also unconstitutional. In  Arizona v. United States, the Supreme Court ruled the Federal  Government, not people like Governor Abbott, have supremacy over the  immigration system. Abbott's unconstitutional, abusive, wasteful, and  inhumane Operation Lone Star is a disgrace to our State and to our  Nation.   I want to be clear: Not one cent of Federal money should go toward  caging families, cutting innocent people with razor wire, or drowning  children, period.
