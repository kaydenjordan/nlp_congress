 Mr. President, I listened carefully to the statement by  the Republican leader on the floor, and I am hoping we can reach some  agreement later today as to the nominations to be considered this day  and very quickly next week. I will, for the record, make it clear that  the seven nominees who moved through on the first day of the Obama  administration were people who had their ethics statements filed on  time, had filed all the legally required papers on time for review.   Unfortunately, that is not the case for all of the nominees by the  new Trump administration. Some of them bring to this nomination some  extraordinarily challenging financial data, and because of their  companies, because of their lifestyles, because of their wealth, it  takes longer to go through these documents than it does for people of  modest means. When we proposed, by the Obama administration, Penny  Pritzker, of Chicago, to serve as Secretary of Commerce, it took 6  months to clear the paperwork on her financial background. The more  complex the financial data, the more difficult and challenging it is  for the committees of the Senate to do their work and to do it  properly.   We want to make certain we don't cut any corners. We don't want to  create any advantage for any single nominee. They have to be held to  the same standard as the nominees under the Obama administration. I am  hoping we can move on it with dispatch on some of these nominees, and I  don't quarrel with the Republican leader's premise that there are some  noncontroversial nominees who would be easier to handle than others.   Let me quickly add, for those who have forgotten the record of the  Republicans in the Senate when it comes to delaying nominations,  exhibit A will continue to be the vacancy on the U.S. Supreme Court.  For the first time in the history of the United States of America, the  Republican majority in the U.S. Senate refused a hearing and a vote on  a nominee to fill a vacancy on the U.S. Supreme Court. That went on for  the entire duration of the Obama Presidency. Some 11 months, that  position on the highest Court in the land remained vacant because of  the specific political strategy of the Republican leader on the other  side.   He said: We will keep this open in the hopes that a Republican  President will be able to fill it. He had a grin and a smile and, I  guess, a feeling of accomplishment on election day when a Republican  was elected President. That vacancy continued for political reasons,  regardless of the fact that it created at least a hardship and some  confusion on the highest Court of the land. It went on for 10, 11  months, and it continues to this day.   I might also remind him that the nomination of Loretta Lynch for the  highest law enforcement position in America sat on that Senate calendar  for months, with no objection stated by any Member on the other side.  They refused to call her name and allow a vote for the Attorney General  of the United States of America. Similarly, an Assistant Secretary of  the Department of Treasury, a key position to deal with terrorism  financing, was held on that calendar, I believe, for a year or more  with no controversy. They had the power to do it, and they did it. So  this notion that we slowed things down really negates and ignores the  reality of the record before us.    Mr. President, I yield the floor.    Will the Senator yield for a question?    Will the Senator yield for a question?    Will the Senator yield for a question?    Will the Senator yield for a question?    Will the Senator yield for a question?    Mr. President, there were 2 minutes extended to each  side, if I am not mistaken.   The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator cannot object. There is  2 minutes on both sides.    Mr. President, I only want to ask my friend from North  Carolina, the chairman of the committee, two questions.   Is it traditional for the Senate Intelligence Committee that you  chair to report out a nominee like Congressman Pompeo, and have you  reported him out of your committee to the floor?    The Democratic side yields back all time.   The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. All time has expired.    I announce that the Senator from Virginia (Mr. Kaine) is  necessarily absent.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber  desiring to vote?   The result was announced--yeas 89, nays 8, as follows:                        [Rollcall Vote No. 31 Leg.]                                  YEAS--89       Alexander      Baldwin      Barrasso      Bennet      Blunt      Boozman      Brown      Burr      Cantwell      Capito      Cardin      Carper      Casey      Cassidy      Cochran      Collins      Coons      Corker      Cornyn      Cortez Masto      Cotton      Crapo      Cruz      Daines      Donnelly      Duckworth      Durbin      Enzi      Ernst      Feinstein      Fischer      Flake      Franken      Gardner      Graham      Grassley      Harris      Hassan      Hatch      Heinrich      Heitkamp      Heller      Hirono      Hoeven      Inhofe      Johnson      Kennedy      King      Klobuchar      Lankford      Leahy      Lee      Manchin      Markey      McCain      McCaskill      McConnell      Menendez      Moran      Murkowski      Murphy      Murray      Nelson      Paul      Perdue      Peters      Portman      Reed      Risch      Roberts      Rounds      Rubio      Sasse      Schatz      Schumer      Scott      Shaheen      Shelby      Stabenow      Sullivan      Tester      Thune      Tillis      Toomey      Van Hollen      Warner      Whitehouse      Wicker      Young  [[Page S356]]                                        NAYS--8       Blumenthal      Booker      Gillibrand      Merkley      Sanders      Udall      Warren      Wyden                               NOT VOTING--3       Isakson      Kaine      Sessions   The motion was agreed to.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I voted in favor of the nomination of Gen.  John Kelly to be U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security, and I am  submitting this statement to explain my vote.   This nomination is not a referendum on President Donald Trump's  immigration policy. If it were, I would have voted against the  nomination.   In considering this nomination, the questions are whether General  Kelly is unqualified to serve as Homeland Security Secretary and  whether his views are too extreme to lead our homeland security and  immigration enforcement efforts. In my view, General Kelly easily  passes both tests.   Gen. John Kelly is clearly qualified to head up the Homeland Security  Department. He served honorably in the U.S. Marine Corps for more than  four decades, first as an enlistee and later as an officer, culminating  in his role as commander of U.S. Southern Command. As SOUTHCOM  commander, Kelly oversaw a variety of operations in the Caribbean,  Central America, and South America from headquarters in Miami.   General Kelly knows better than most what is at stake in our efforts  to protect our Nation from harm. He served three tours in Iraq, and in  2010, his son, Marine 1st Lt. Robert Michael Kelly, 29, was killed in  southern Afghanistan while leading his platoon on a combat patrol when  he stepped on a concealed bomb. He is the highest ranking military  officer to lose a child in combat in Afghanistan or Iraq.   I am sure that I will disagree with General Kelly on some occasions,  but he does not have a track record of extreme statements on  immigration or the other issues that will be under his jurisdiction as  Homeland Security Secretary.   I know that some of my Democratic colleagues voted against General  Kelly's nomination because he refused to publicly commit to keeping the  Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals--DACA--program in place and to  protecting DACA recipients from deportations. Reasonable people can  disagree, and I respect my colleagues who are voting against General  Kelly's nomination, but I don't believe this justifies opposing this  nomination.   There is no one in the Senate who is more committed than I to  protecting the DACA program and no one who has worked harder to protect  the young immigrants who are eligible for this program. Seven years  ago, I was the first Member of Congress to ask President Obama to  establish the DACA program. DACA is based on the DREAM Act, legislation  I first introduced 16 years ago that would give undocumented students  who grew up in this country a chance to earn their citizenship.   The young people who are eligible for DACA and the DREAM Act are  known as DREAMers. Over the years, I have met hundreds of DREAMers and  I have come to the floor more than 100 times to tell these DREAMers'  stories, which make the case for DACA and the DREAM Act better than I  ever could.   Last week, General Kelly came to my office to meet with me. We spent  most of our time discussing DACA and the DREAMers. General Kelly  promised me that, if he was confirmed, he would be a part of the  discussions about the future of DACA. He said that he felt strongly  that DREAMers should be protected from deportation and that he would  fight for that view. General Kelly also committed that he would come to  Chicago with me to meet with a group of DREAMers and to visit an  immigration detention center, so that he would understand the human  impact of the laws he will be enforcing.   Based on these assurances, I am pleased to be able to support General  Kelly's nomination. But let me be clear. If General Kelly supports an  effort by the new administration to rescind DACA or deport DREAMers, I  will fight him tooth and nail.   I congratulate General Kelly on his confirmation, and I look forward  to working with him on the critical issues under his jurisdiction,  especially the future of DACA and the DREAMers.
