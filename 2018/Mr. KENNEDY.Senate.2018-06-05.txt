 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I rise today because, in my judgement, we  are in the midst of a deeply troubling trend regarding banking and the  Second Amendment. I know that seems a bit strange. What does banking  have to do with the Second Amendment? I have wondered that myself.  Allow me to explain.   We have 120 million gun owners in America. Like those Americans, I am  alarmed by the activist anti-gun policies unveiled by the ``we are  smarter than you'' financial elites who run two Wall Street banks:  Citigroup and Bank of America. They have a political agenda, and those  banks' political agenda stands to hurt many small businesses in my  State of Louisiana that are going to lose their banking services simply  because these small businesses choose to exercise their  constitutionally protected Second Amendment rights.   On March 22 of this year, Citigroup issued a press release. That  press release detailed how Citigroup will penalize banking clients who  follow Federal, State, and local gun laws. Citigroup's new policy will  tell businesses what kinds of firearms they can stock, what kinds of  accessories those small businesses can stock in their stores, and who  they can sell them to. I thought this was America.   This new policy has already taken effect all across Citigroup, and it  has impacted hundreds of small businesses, institutional clients, and  even their credit card partners.   Not to be outdone, 2 weeks later, Bank of America joined in. On April  10, Bank of America announced that it will no longer loan money to  businesses that, in its opinion, are ``deplorables'' because those  businesses manufacture legal semiautomatic rifles. Targeting firearms  owners and business owners is not only an affront to responsible, law- abiding, constitutional gun owners across this country; it is a threat  to the sanctity of our very Constitution and the Second Amendment   I realize that the management of these two banks have a constitution  whose bill of rights jumps from one to three, but I can assure them  that in the Constitution read by the rest of America, there is a Second  Amendment.   I have written to both the chief executive officers of Citigroup and  Bank of America about my concerns, and they have yet to respond. I  understand that Mr. Brian Moynihan, the CEO of Bank of America, is  actually here in Washington lobbying folks on Capitol Hill this week. I  suppose he was too busy to come by and address my concerns. Once again,  I invite him to come by my office and speak about this in person.   I can't overstate the gravity of this issue. It is important for  consumers and businesses all across America. Both Citigroup and Bank of  America are considered by the U.S. Government to be ``systemically  important banks.''  [[Page S2986]]  That means they are too big to fail. That is why the American taxpayers  had to bail them out in 2009.   The American taxpayers, many of whom Citigroup and Bank of America  now condescend to across our great land, gave Citigroup $476 billion of  their hard-earned money--not $476 million to bail out Citigroup, $476  billion. And the American taxpayers, many of whom choose to exercise  their rights under the Second Amendment and whom these banks are trying  to now punish, gave Bank of America $336 billion in 2008 and 2009 to  keep them from going broke.   These banks are supposed to act as a source of credit for households  and businesses and local and State governments and as a source of  liquidity for the entire banking system, but that also means their  corporate policies will have ripple effects through every corner of our  economy, from consumers and businesses of all sizes to banks and  nonbank holding companies.   If the banking system worked like a grocery store, I would still  disagree with these new anti-gun rules by Citigroup and Bank of  America, but I would respect their rights to enact whatever corporate  policies align with their beliefs. But banks are not grocery stores. A  grocery store doesn't need a government charter to operate. A grocery  store doesn't have a government corporation backed by the taxpayers of  this country to insure their deposits. A grocery store doesn't have a  government bank that pays them interest. Banks do.   One grocery store doesn't get so big that it lends and borrows and  buys and sells from nearly every other grocery store in the country.  Citigroup does, and so does Bank of America.   A grocery store doesn't need an $812.3 billion bailout from the  American taxpayers, many of whom choose to exercise their rights under  the U.S. Constitution, including, but not limited to, the Second  Amendment.   Citigroup and Bank of America have decided to make banking a red- versus-blue issue by trampling on the Second Amendment rights of small  business owners and therefore all Americans.   If additional big consumer banks come out with similar anti-Second  Amendment policies, it will get harder and harder for businesses in my  State of Louisiana and small businesses in other States and elsewhere  to find banking services. We will have red banks, and we will have blue  banks. I don't think that is what we want in America.   I want to make sure that the Federal Government isn't rewarding this  behavior with even more taxpayer dollars. I think $1 trillion to bail  out these two banks by the American taxpayers is quite enough.   I have already petitioned the General Services Administration to  cancel the Federal Government's $700 billion contract with Citigroup,  and I have urged officials in the State of Louisiana to reevaluate all  State contracts with any Wall Street bank that chooses to implement an  extra-legal policy that infringes on the Second Amendment to the U.S.  Constitution.   Citigroup and Bank of America owe their continued existence to the  generosity of the American taxpayer. If it weren't for the American  taxpayer, there would be no Citigroup; there would be no Bank of  America. I find it very disturbing that these Wall Street banks may be  profiting from taxpayer-funded contracts at the same time they are  pushing a political agenda--and that is what it is, a political  agenda--and severing ties with law-abiding businesses in the process.  Given the size of these banks, it is likely that the same is true in  States across America.   I find it offensive--I find it offensive--that Wall Street banks are  taking taxpayer dollars with one hand and condescending to them with  their ``we know better than you do'' attitude by using the other hand  to come after the guns those taxpayers lawfully own under the Second  Amendment. Rather than impose its political agenda on law-abiding  citizens, these Wall Street banks ought to remember how taxpayers spent  billions of dollars--almost $1 trillion--to bail them out after the  2008 financial crisis. They owe a tremendous debt to the American  people, and it seems they have a very short memory.   We don't need red banks in America. We don't need blue banks in  America. We need safe banks in America.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I have 6 requests for committees to meet  during today's session of the Senate.
