 Madam Speaker, this evening, on the occasion of  this special order hour, I rise to commemorate the Congressional Black  Caucus and its rich history of representation of Black voices across  the nation.   Today's Black Caucus is the materialization of the vision that our  founding members had 50 years ago. Now nearly 60 members strong, our  caucus has fought to empower the Black community so that they too may  achieve the American Dream. And our success in doing so, as well as  upholding the fundamentals of democracy, is unparalleled in this body's  history.   Now, in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, we face one of our  toughest challenges yet. While it is true that the pandemic has  affected all of us in some way, it has especially highlighted and  exacerbated the inequalities that the Black community still faces in  our society. We have been forced to battle the pandemic on two fronts-- health-wise and economically.   Studies show that the comorbidities most closely associated with  COVID-19 complications are diabetes and hypertension, which  disproportionately affect the Black community. The prevalence of these  diseases is systemic in nature--a result of decades of a lack of access  to quality, accessible, and culturally competent medical care.   I have also met with Black business owners in North Texas, who  credited preexisting funding gaps and feeble relationships with lenders  for their hardships during the pandemic. Disadvantaged at the onset,  these businesses became increasingly unable to meet market needs, and  reports now say that the pandemic has wiped out nearly half of Black  small businesses in our country.   In the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Black Caucus has played a  critical role in the  [[Page H583]]  drafting and enacting of legislation to support Black Americans-- including President Biden's newest package. Billed as the American  Rescue Plan, the $1.9 trillion relief package consists of several  provisions advocated for by the Black Caucus. Among them include $400  billion for vaccine distribution with a focus on minority communities,  $15 billion for equitably distributed grants to minority-owned small  businesses, and investment in infrastructure projects to create more  jobs for unemployed minorities.   Madam Speaker, the Congressional Black Caucus will certainly play a  prominent Congress for generations to come. I look forward to  continuing to work with my colleagues in the caucus to advance better,  more equitable policies for all.                            ____________________
