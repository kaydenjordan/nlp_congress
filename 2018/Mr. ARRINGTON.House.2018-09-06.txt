 Mr. Speaker, in the short time since we have passed  historic tax relief for the American people, we have already seen  tremendous results.   By putting in place pro-growth, free market policies, we have  unleashed a booming economy with higher wages and more job  opportunities. With over 6 million job openings, the unemployment rate  at an 18-year low and small business optimism at a 34-year high, our  country's economic future looks as bright as it has ever been.  [[Page H7877]]    And thanks to tax cuts, 90 percent of Americans have seen an increase  in take-home pay, with a family of four in my district keeping about  $2,000 a year.   Now, some people call that crumbs, people, I think, that are  disconnected to working families and middle-income families, people who  want to raise your taxes because they think Washington knows best when  it comes to spending your money. They want to prop up failed  government-controlled, top-down healthcare systems that have failed.   West Texans know better than this, and they know that this is real  cash in their pockets that will allow them to invest more in their  future and in their family's future.   The bottom line is this: tax reform is paying off in a big way for  our families all across this great land; companies are giving bonuses,  increasing benefits, and hiring new employees and providing workers  with new opportunities, and most importantly, we are seeing optimism,  optimism spread throughout this great land.   In fact, tax reform has been so successful, that we want to keep  building on it and keep the momentum going. That is why I am proud to  support Tax Reform 2.0. I want to thank my friend and fellow Texan,  chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, Kevin Brady, for  leading the charge.   The central point of Tax Reform 2.0 is making tax relief for lower  and middle income families and small businesses permanent.   In the first round of tax reform, we cut taxes for individual and  small business owners, doubled the standard deduction and doubled the  child tax credit. However, under current law, these provisions and  others are set to expire in 2025.   We don't need to wait until the last minute to prevent Americans'  taxes from going up. We can make tax relief permanent now, and that is  where Tax Reform 2.0 comes in.   According to the nonpartisan Tax Foundation, making this tax relief  permanent will grow the GDP by another 2.2 percent, boost wages, and  create over a million new jobs; this, on top, again, of the significant  gains we have seen and experienced from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.   Making tax cuts permanent would also allow Americans to plan more  confidently for their future, whether that is putting more money away  for their kids' colleges or setting more money aside for their  retirement or a rainy day fund.   A recent survey found that nearly 80 percent of Americans live  paycheck to paycheck and 60 percent of Americans say they couldn't  afford a $500 emergency. Remember, the folks in my district are keeping  $2,000 a year because of the recent tax reform. Sixty percent of  Americans say $500 would put them in a real bind.   Making tax relief permanent is an essential opportunity for us,  giving Americans the certainty that they deserve in making their  financial decisions, and we in Congress can provide that certainty by  delivering on Tax Reform 2.0.   Mr. Speaker, currently our economy is growing at a record pace, and  we need to keep the policies in place that allow job creators and  businessowners of all kinds to keep their foot on the pedal.   Our job creators are always thinking of ways they can be more  innovative and competitive, and we in Congress would do well to have  that same mentality. We must be proactive and constantly be revisiting  our Tax Code and finding ways to improve it, to modernize it so we  don't fall behind our foreign competitors.   In order to encourage and reward the risk-taking, the invention, the  entrepreneurship that has characterized the great American economy, Tax  Reform 2.0 also expands on expensing for startup companies. By allowing  new businesses to write off more of their initial costs, we can spur  innovation and more job creation new businesses bring to this country  and allow us to maintain our position as the economic envy of the  world.   Mr. Speaker, the first round of tax reform reflects the timeless  truth that the American people know best how to spend their hard-earned  money, better than politicians, better than government bureaucrats in  Washington, D.C. By cutting the amount that government takes out of  people's paychecks, people have more freedom and they have more  resources to invest in their families, in their community, and in our  economy.   Tax Reform 2.0 would keep our economy growing and ensure America  retains our entrepreneurial edge that has made us a magnet for  innovation and the most prosperous, the most powerful, and the most  generous country in all the world.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to support Tax Reform 2.0 and I encourage my  colleagues to do so.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous materials on the topic of this Special Order.    Mr. Speaker, George Mason, the patriot, said:  [[Page H7909]]  ``Nothing so strongly impels a man to regard the interest of his  constituents as the certainty of returning to the general mass of the  people, from whence he was taken, where he must participate in their  burdens.''   Translation: The Founding Fathers wanted us to come here and do the  people's business and then go home, back to the ``farm,'' and live  under the rules we passed. They want us to come up here and represent  the people, their interests, and no other; the public's interests, no  other; America's interests, no other.   They wanted us to come here with a singular purpose and that is to do  what is right and good for the American people and to have the courage  to step up to the plate, because every generation is called to do so,  and to make the sacrifices and to make the tough calls and take on the  tough issues of the day and solve them, even if that causes you to have  a shorter political career than you anticipated. That is the theme of  this Special Order, Mr. Speaker. It is term limits.   We the Members who gather today to talk about it might be taken off  some of the Christmas card lists of some of our friends and colleagues.  But this does not in any way disparage Members who served here for many  years and many terms. I think you have folks here--and I think in fact  I can name some--who have done a good job, who have served well. But I  don't think it is healthy.   Just because you can do it doesn't mean we shouldn't create an  environment and have the right incentives for the right behavior. I  think there are just too many forces that pull us as Members in  directions other than doing what is best and right for this country and  for the people we came here to represent.   So I think there is an ideal way. And I think we are off the mark  from that ideal, from the spirit and the intent of what George Mason  said in that quote, and what our Founding Fathers believed from the  very outset.   Mr. Speaker, like my colleagues who will speak here in a moment, we  didn't run just to rearrange the furniture in the people's House. We  ran to make a real difference, to advance real reform, so that this  country and its leaders could govern and solve problems and move this  Nation forward.   So my greatest calling, I believe, isn't just to advance reforms to  education or to healthcare or to the Tax Code. I think this is a season  for reforming this institution, first and foremost. I think that we are  long overdue, but I think the time is right for structural,  fundamental, systemic reforms to the United States Congress.   As a new Member and as a new generation of Members, I cannot tell you  how excited I am to stand with my colleagues today, Republican and  Democratic, and talk about one of those structural reforms that I think  will strike at the heart of some of the problems with Washington and  the culture of Washington.   Woe to me and any Member who comes up here just to change the course,  the policy course of this country, and not do anything to affect the  broken culture of this body. I think it is incumbent upon us to do that  and to change this broken culture.   I think if we take anything away from this last Presidential election  on either side of the aisle and whatever party you claim, we can all  agree that the American people are fed up with the status quo. They  don't want business as usual. I think there is a crisis in confidence  in this institution.   When I ran, I ran railing against the culture of Washington and the  fundamental changes and the brokenness of this institution. Now I am a  Member. Now it is time to act on the things that I so boldly proclaimed  that we needed to do.   I think that for this reason Republican and Democrats alike have come  together to support a constitutional amendment that would limit the  number of terms an individual may serve in the United States Congress.   There are different ways to organize it, structure it, but I think  the intent and the heart of all these reform initiatives around term  limit are getting after, I think, the same desired outcome. We believe  that, above and beyond Tax Code reform, bettering the healthcare  system, limiting regulatory burden, and so on and so forth, we have got  to change this institution.   We have a great chance. I do think the timing is right. Our Founders  never intended these public servants to be professional career  politicians. They didn't want a permanent political class to rule the  land from Washington. Instead, they envisioned this sort of citizen- legislator way of leading and serving, and then living back among our  brothers and sisters.   People say this is tilting at windmills and this is an unproductive  quest. But all you have to do is look at George Washington and the  example he set by custom, by tradition. When asked to serve more than  two terms as President, he said: We got rid of a King George. We don't  need a King George. I wanted to serve my people as President. It is  time for me to go back to the farm.   For 100 years, that custom was honored. And then, FDR ran for a third  and fourth term. The people reacted, and we had the 22nd Amendment to  the Constitution and we have term limits on our Presidents.   I think that if it can happen for Presidents, where the people say,  We don't want kings, I believe--and especially today, in these times-- that the people are speaking, if we will just listen and respond. They  don't want career politicians either. Neither are healthy for this  great country.    There was a recent survey, as recent as February of this year, where  over 80 percent of the American people--Democratic, Republican,  Independent--say that this initiative of term limits being effectuated  in an amendment to the Constitution would make this institution run  better and would change the culture for the better. They support it. I  am old-fashioned enough to believe if 80 percent of the people want  something, they ought to get their chance to at least debate it and  vote on it. I am grateful for this time that we have to talk about it.   I am looking at my colleagues here in the Chamber and I see Ro  Khanna, my friend from California. We have very different backgrounds.  We come from different places and different ideological places. We have  different thoughts about policy reforms on various issues.   But when we met during orientation as two new Members--a former  member of the George W. Bush administration and a former member of the  Obama administration--you couldn't have two more different people. But  we had a great conversation, we struck up a friendship, and our  families love each other, care about each other, and I want him to be  successful, I want his family to be successful. We came together on one  thing in particular and it was this notion of term limits.   We introduced what I think is still the only bipartisan, Democratic  and Republican-introduced legislation to limit Members of Congress'  terms. I am grateful for his friendship and I am glad he is here.   I think I am going to stop talking, Mr. Speaker, and ask my  colleagues to share their thoughts. I am going to start with a dear  friend, Representative Brian Fitzpatrick from the Commonwealth of  Pennsylvania, District Eight.   Brian is the heart and soul of this initiative. We went to see the  President of the United States on this, Republicans and Democrats, and  he said: This is the most energized group I have met with. It is  because we believe that we can actually make real change with real  reforms like term limits.   Brian has been the heart and soul of this. He, like myself, is very  passionate about this. He has dedicated a lot of his time and effort  introducing congressional reform and anticorruption legislation to fix  Washington's broken system. These measures include his own term limit  legislation, a constitutional amendment that would prevent Members of  Congress from being paid unless a budget is passed, and a balanced  budget amendment that would force Congress to stop kicking the can down  the road and address our national debt now.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr.  Fitzpatrick).    Mr. Speaker, I think anybody who heard the remarks  from my friend Brian Fitzpatrick is, without a doubt, inspired by the  new blood and the new fire in the belly of this new membership of this  institution that, again, wants to make real change.   I love what he said to me--and he may be mad when I quote him, but he  said: If we could get a vote, if we could just get a vote. And if we  got a vote, I believe it would pass because I think the American people  would put too much pressure on our colleagues, which is a good thing.  That is how it works. And we would pass this, and we would be able to  have this new dynamic which would get at that root cause and change the  behavior of this institution and the culture.   He said: If I could get that, I would be willing to leave tomorrow,  if that is what it took. If I knew I could leave knowing that that  would happen, I would leave tomorrow.   Thank God for people like Brian Fitzpatrick. I am so proud to serve  with the gentleman, and I appreciate his leadership on this issue. He  really is the heart of this movement in our class. And I know that it  extends beyond our class, but I think there is a sense of urgency to do  something real in this class.   This isn't the silver bullet. This isn't the panacea. There is a list  of things that are root causes and fundamental structural reforms, but  I think this one should be the easiest to pass this House. And the  people want it, as the gentleman said.   Mr. Speaker, now I am going to introduce another member of this new  class of Representatives, from the great State of Wisconsin, another  dear friend,  Mike Gallagher.   During his first 100 days in office, Mike introduced a number of  bills to drain the swamp, including his own term limit legislation, a  5-year lobbying ban for retiring Members, reforms to the congressional  pension, and the Do Your Job Act, which would prevent Congress from  leaving for recess until it passed all its appropriations bills.   This is a guy who wants to make a real difference, and he is willing  to stick his neck out and do it. Probably, none of these are very  popular here, but I guarantee you they would be powerful in  implementation and the change--the good change--that they would make.   Since taking office last year, he has made decreasing the size and  influence of the Federal Government, restoring power back to the  people, a top priority; and he is an original cosponsor of Ro Khanna  and my term limit legislation and led the first Special Order to  discuss term limits in this Chamber. I thank Mr. Gallagher for his  leadership.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Gallagher).    Mr. Speaker, that is the courage of a captain in the  Marine Corps. I am grateful for his service to this country in the  armed services. I am blessed to call him my friend. And again, the fire  in the belly to come up here and make lasting reforms for our children  and grandchildren--and game-changing reforms.   So I am grateful to Mr. Gallagher, and I thank the gentleman for  being a leader on this issue.   Mr. Speaker, I am now going to introduce a dear friend whom I  mentioned earlier, Ro Khanna, a Democrat from California.   I want to just also note before Representative Gallagher may have to  leave, but he is speaking from the traditionally Democratic podium. I  don't know. There is not a law. I don't think there is even a House  rule that says you have to speak on the right side or the left side.  But he speaks over there, and our Republican colleague Brian  Fitzpatrick also stood over there, not just in solidarity on this  issue, but with the spirit of friendship and the notion of restoring  civility in this body.   When I look at you guys across the aisle and I see a Republican and  Democrat on the Democratic side, traditionally, I am reminded of our  class signing the civility agreement and sitting in the middle of this  Chamber as a message to others and as an affirmation to each other that  part of the culture change that we are talking about--in this respect,  it is term limits, but it is more than that. It is some of the things  that Mr. Gallagher is pushing through legislation, but it is also the  softer issues, the intangible cultural issues like civility.   With that, I want to say that I thank Mr. Khanna for his leadership.  His folks are well represented by him. He knows what he believes. He  fights hard for his beliefs and his constituents, but he remains  independent to those beliefs and to those interests. I am proud to call  Ro Khanna my friend.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. Khanna).                                time  1800     Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Khanna. I think we  would do a lot for the confidence of the American people if we could  get a vote on it. I think they would believe that this body is actually  responding to them, instead of just talking to each other in this  bubble up here in Washington.   Again, there are good people, but there is a bad dynamic. You put  good people in a bad dynamic and a history that creates a bad culture  and you get bad outcomes.   So this isn't to disparage anybody on either side. It is to align the  incentives so that we can be most responsive and do what was expected  when the folks hired us to do this job, and that is to focus on their  interests, the interests of our country, do the right thing, and put  America first.   I am reminded from the comments of Mr. Khanna that, when we had the  meeting with the President--and I want to say that Mr. Mark Meadows,  the Representative from North Carolina, helped us a great deal to get  that audience with the President. I think everybody here is grateful  for his efforts to do that. We knew that, from the outset--Mr. Khanna  and I talked about this--that if we were going to have a path to  success and not just make this part of the sort of rhetoric or some  political box-checking exercise, but if we were going to really try to  get this across the goal line with many others who have other pieces of  legislation similar to our term limits legislation: A, it needed to be  bipartisan; and, B, we needed buy-in from the drainer of the swamp in  chief.    If there is anything that the man in the Oval Office, Donald J.  Trump, represents, it is shaking up this culture. Whether you like the  way he is shaking it up or not, that was the message, that they wanted  change. They didn't want business as usual.   This is a proud moment for me because of my colleagues' response to  the President when he said: Do you really think we are going to get a  vote on this? Do you really think that you are actually going to get a  vote whereby your fellow Members, who have been there longer than you  all, would actually term limit themselves?   That is when my new friends and colleagues, Republican and Democrat,  said: Mr. President, grandfather them in. Term limit us. Start with our  class and every class that follows. Don't worry about the ones who are  there. They may want a term limit, they may not. But we are not going  to get into that. We don't want to slow this down. We want to be  successful.   I really appreciate that response. I believe in it wholeheartedly. I  am all in, and I am a true believer in what we are doing. So I thank  Mr. Khanna.   Now, Mr.  Tom Marino, the United States Representative from the great  Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, the 10th District, he has been working on  this before probably my freshmen colleagues had thought to even run for  this in their respective offices. He introduced term limit legislation  to help ``return our government'' to one that truly is for the people  and by the people.   He believes, like I do, and the gentleman you heard speak earlier,  that it is well past time to get Washington back to work for the  American people.   So may God bless my friend  Tom Marino, as I yield to him to speak  about this term limit effort.   Mr. Speaker, may I ask how much time I have left?    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Marino.)    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from the  Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and his passion and his focus on the  things that will really move the needle and really change the culture  and really make a difference for his kids and grandkids. And I am  thankful that he came and expressed his sentiments and the history  behind his leadership and experience long before I showed up; and he  has plowed some good ground for the new Members who spoke today, and we  greatly appreciate that.  [[Page H7914]]    Mr. Speaker, I say to the gentleman, I think we can be successful, I  really do, and here is why. I think we have the precedents of the 22nd  Amendment, which was done in the shadow that was cast by one of our  greatest leaders, George Washington, and the custom and tradition of  the 2 terms for President.   But the people, with angst and vehement opposition to more than two  terms as President, spoke, and there was enough critical mass where we  had the 22nd Amendment. We passed a constitutional amendment. It has  already happened and it can happen again. I believe that we are  embarking on such a time and a season in the life of this country.   And the public frustration, we have talked about the approval rating,  popular reform. We talked about the polls. Over 80 percent of the  American people want this. And then we talked about the man in the Oval  Office who ran on draining the swamp. And this is a definitive  measurable way to do that. It is not the only way; it is not the  panacea for all of the ills culturally in this institution, but it  would certainly be a big start.   So, Mr. Speaker, I say thank you to my colleagues for the support and  for their eloquent and passionate remarks to advance this.   And I want to say a special thanks to the President for tweeting out  on this after our meeting, for endorsing our efforts, and I encourage  him. There are two things we need. We need the President to continue to  make this a priority, and we need him to continue to talk about it; and  we need the next leadership of this body, whatever that looks like and  however that sorts out, we need the leadership to bring this to a vote.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms.  Foxx). It is not on the issue of term limits. It is on another very  important issue.                            Recognizing Eli Herman     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from North  Carolina. And I just say, in conclusion, before I yield the balance of  my time back, Mr. Speaker, that, and I was remiss to not mention that  this would be the appropriate way to conclude.   I want to thank the majority leader, Kevin McCarthy, for allowing my  colleagues and I to speak on this issue on the floor of the House, of  the people's House, and being open to allow Members to bring their  ideas and the things that they ran on, the things that they are  passionate about, that they believe will make the biggest difference  for the future of this country.   To me, that is a big part of leadership, being big enough to allow  people to take the microphone and speak on these issues, whether he  believes in it, supports it or not, I don't know. But I know that he is  a good leader for allowing us to speak about it, and I am grateful for  that.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
