 Madam Speaker, I thank Chairwoman Lowey for more than  three decades of valuable service to our Nation.   I joined Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee on an amendment that  directs NIAID, led by Dr. Anthony Fauci, to prioritize minority patient  outreach and minority candidate inclusion in COVID-19 critical clinical  trials or therapy development.   I worked with Chairman Raul Grijalva on an amendment that supports  English language acquisition grants used by school districts and  teachers that teach English language learners, like myself, that sat in  the back of a classroom for 2 years not knowing what was being said.   I have worked for the past 2 years with my colleague Jose Serrano on  the National Science Foundation's STEM undergraduate program for  Hispanic-serving institutions.   Finally, Madam Speaker, I am glad we included my critical amendment  to prohibit the Office of Refugee Resettlement from contracting with  for-profit contractors to house unaccompanied alien children.   That is a private sector money grab that benefits from children that  are split, ripped apart from their parents' arms.
