 Madam Speaker, I rise to honor and recognize the  president and CEO of the Galveston Regional Chamber of Commerce, a  fighter for small businesses, an advocate for our youth, and a dear  friend of mine, Mrs. Gina Spagnola.   I am very proud to stand here on the House floor and celebrate the  remarkable Gina Spagnola for her 20 years of unwavering service to the  Galveston Regional Chamber of Commerce. Under her guidance, the chamber  has thrived.   For over 178 years, the Galveston Regional Chamber's mission has been  to foster business and community development, and Gina's leadership has  elevated this historic institution to unprecedented heights.   Gina has not only embraced this mission, she has embodied it. Her  unwavering commitment to Galveston Island and the broader Texas Gulf  Coast region has been a driving force behind the chamber's success.   I could go on about the great work and things Gina has accomplished,  but we could be here for hours. Instead, Madam Speaker, I will  highlight a few things to give you a little picture of how lucky  Galveston is to have her advocacy and passion for the businesses in our  community.   One of Gina's proudest accomplishments has been the inauguration of  this very Galveston Women's Conference she started 16 years ago. After  [[Page H4237]]  years of surprising and celebrating the amazing women in Galveston, we  get to surprise her by celebrating her. Surprise, Gina.   Gina's ability to build effective relationships with elected  officials has facilitated numerous achievements.   She championed the creation of Lemonade Day to help today's youth  become the business leaders, the social advocates, the community  volunteers, and the forward-thinking citizens of tomorrow.   In times of adversity, Gina's resilience and commitment shine  through. Just 2 months after Hurricane Ike wreaked havoc on Galveston  Island, she spearheaded a successful recovery expo that enabled local  businesses to reopen their doors. This initiative garnered State and  national recognition, showcasing Gina's effectiveness in driving  impactful initiatives. Gina's compassion extends beyond our District 14  and its borders.   Gina's remarkable leadership has been widely acknowledged. In  December 2022, the Galveston Regional Chamber of Commerce received a  five-star accreditation from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the highest  rating in the industry. Out of the 7,000 chambers in the Nation, only  142 hold this prestigious distinction, with the Galveston Regional  Chamber of Commerce being just 1 of 27 in Texas and the only one in  Galveston County, not to mention all of the awards and recognition she  has received and all the boards she sits on and has sat on.    As I said, I could go on and on.   Madam Speaker, we thank Gina for two decades of remarkable service,  but let us also celebrate the values of dedication, leadership, and  community that she embodies.   Gina's legacy is one of inspiration, and we are grateful for her  tireless efforts to make Galveston a better place. Congratulations on  her outstanding achievements. May her journey ahead be as bright and  rewarding as the path she has for our community.   I thank Gina for her unwavering commitment to Galveston and the Texas  Gulf Coast. We are very blessed to have her in our lives, and I can't  wait to cheer her on as she continues leading this chamber to  greatness.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate a century  of excellence at Lamar University in Beaumont, Texas.
