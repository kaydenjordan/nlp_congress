 Mr. Speaker, last night, President Obama delivered his  farewell address to the Nation. Today, I rise to thank President Obama  for his steady and his strong leadership over the past 8 years. He has  served this Nation with dignity, with purpose, and helped us achieve  some important successes during his tenure.   When he took office, this country was on the brink of a depression,  facing a financial crisis unlike anything we have experienced. He has  helped to put us on the right track, rebuilding the American auto  industry and steady private sector job growth.   Now, we know we have a lot left to do, as he said last night. But he  has given us the opportunity and the tools to continue that good work.  No country, no nation, and certainly no government is dependent on any  single individual. As he said, it is up to all of us, not just those of  us in Congress or in public office but all citizens, to continue to  work together to create the great society that we are all committed to.   But it would be a mistake to not take this moment to thank that  individual, to thank President Obama, for the clarity of his moral  leadership, for his grace, and his class. We owe him a great debt of  gratitude.                            ____________________
