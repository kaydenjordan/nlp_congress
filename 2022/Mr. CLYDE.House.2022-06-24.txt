 Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Ohio, soon to be  the Judiciary chair, for yielding.   First, thank you to the Supreme Court for removing the curse of  abortion sanctioned by a Federal Court ruling back in 1973. Six Supreme  Court Justices have stood for life, and that is a beautiful thing.  [[Page H5911]]    Now, regarding this gun control bill before us today, this bill would  have done nothing to curb the actions of illegal-minded criminals  intent on harming our children. But it will harm the law-abiding  citizens of this great Nation by violating their Second, Fourth, Fifth,  and 14th Amendments, specifically, their due process rights. Let me  refresh our collective memories.   The Fourth Amendment: ``The right of the people to be secure in their  persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and  seizures, shall not be violated.''   The Fifth Amendment: ``No person shall be . . . deprived of life,  liberty, or property, without due process of law.''   The 14th Amendment: ``Nor shall any State deprive any person of life,  liberty, or property, without due process of law.''   Then, of course, my favorite, the Second Amendment: ``The right of  the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.''   These red flag laws enable one-sided ex parte hearings, and though  they don't take some of the guns from all of the people, they take all  of the guns from some of the people. This is completely unacceptable.   I stand against it, and I encourage all Members of the House to vote  against it.
