 Mr. President, as a member and former chairman of  the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, each month  I recognize and celebrate the American entrepreneurial spirit by  highlighting the success of a small business in my home State of Idaho.  However, in honor of Veterans Day on November 11, this month I will  honor a veteran-owned small business for each of the 10 days the Senate  is in legislative session. The personal sacrifices made by America's  veterans have protected the very freedoms and values that give each of  us and our children the ability to achieve the American dream. The  skills veterans learn as members of the military are invaluable and  undoubtedly contribute to Idaho's flourishing veteran business  community. I am proud of the sacrifices veterans have made to protect  our country and that they are choosing Idaho to call home when they  complete their service in the military.   As your U.S. Senator from the great State of Idaho, it is my pleasure  to recognize Eagle Rock Gallery in Idaho Falls as the Veteran-owned  Idaho Small Business of the Day for November 7, 2019.   Eagle Rock Gallery opened 6 months ago in Idaho Falls. It is owned  and operated by U.S. Army veterans Gary Jensen and his wife, Kathi  Cheyenne Jensen. The Jensens opened the gallery to host a collection of  nationally and internationally recognized fine artists. The gallery  includes a portrait studio, where clients can schedule portrait  sessions for their families, friends, and even pets. In addition, the  gallery features a variety of art available for purchase.   Kathi Cheyenne Jensen is an award-winning photographer known for her  patriotic images, specifically those that feature bald eagles. The  Jensens  [[Page S6472]]  seek to honor veterans who, like themselves, have sacrificed for  American freedom. Recently, the gallery held a fundraiser with proceeds  going to support local veterans in Idaho Falls.   Congratulations to Gary and Kathi Cheyenne Jensen and all of the  artists at Eagle Rock Gallery for being selected as the Veteran-owned  Idaho Small Business of the Day for November 7, 2019. You make our  great State proud, and I look forward to your continued growth and  success.                            ____________________
