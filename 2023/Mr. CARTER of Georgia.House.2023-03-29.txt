 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  retirement of Mr. Jones Hooks, the longest serving executive director  of the Jekyll Island Authority.   Mr. Hooks' 15 years of service to the people of Jekyll Island will  never be forgotten. When he became the executive director in 2008, the  island was in economic trouble, with many of its facilities operating  at a deficit.   To fix this problem, and many others plaguing the island, the  authorities on Jekyll proposed multiple goals, such as revitalizing  Jekyll's facilities, establishing a credible conservation effort, and  partnering with the private sector on certain efforts the Jekyll Island  Authority could not handle alone.   Mr. Hooks achieved every goal put forth by island leadership. Thanks  to his efforts and leadership, Jekyll Island is a thriving community, a  hallmark of conservation efforts, a tourism location enjoyed by many,  and much more.   I thank Mr. Hooks, once again, for his service, and I hope he has a  restful retirement.        Recognizing 25th Anniversary of Belfast/Good Friday Agreement     Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  25th anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement that brought an end to 30  years of conflict in Northern Ireland.   The conflict, known as The Troubles, resulted in the deaths of  hundreds of people. The conflict saw families, friends, and neighbors  turn on each other. It saw political discourse become replaced by  violence and bloodshed.   Despite the viciousness and length of the conflict, all parties  involved, with U.S. diplomatic support, managed to come to an agreement  to end it.                                time  1030    Now, 25 years after the signing of the Good Friday Agreement, the  Emerald Isle remains more peaceful and more prosperous than before the  historic agreement. I applaud the commitment to peace by leaders on  both sides of the Irish Sea.   I also applaud the recent Windsor Framework, which managed to  preserve the principles of the Good Friday Agreement while also holding  true to the requirements of Brexit.   As Americans, we should look to the Good Friday Agreement as hope  that despite our differences, we can come together to solve problems,  and we can work together as one team to make our country great.                  Celebrating the Life of Charlene Saunders     Madam Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the  life of Charlene Saunders, a loving mother, wife, and educator in the  Savannah community.   Charlene and her husband, Bill, moved to Savannah in 1958 to  establish the athletic program at the Savannah Country Day School.   During her 31 years at Country Day, Charlene served as the head coach  of girls' basketball, girls' track, and the cheerleading team, and she  oversaw the PE department.   While Charlene's teams amassed winning records, she is remembered for  her strong bond with her athletes and as a model of integrity, grace,  spirit, and grit. In 1982, Saunders Gym was named in her honor.   Charlene and Bill Saunders were fixtures at all student events and  were held in such high regard by the student body that they received  two yearbook dedications and were also named the honorable homecoming  king and queen.   Her legacy continues to impact generations of students. She will be  dearly missed by all who knew her.                        Recognizing Leroy Chapman, Jr.     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Leroy  Chapman, Jr., for being named the new editor-in-chief at the Atlanta  Journal-Constitution.   A veteran of the Navy, he has been a journalist for 28 years,  originally coming from South Carolina. Leroy currently serves as the  managing editor and has been with the AJC since 2011.   Over the course of his 27-year career, he has also worked as a  columnist and editorial writer, a business reporter, and a college  sports reporter.   During his career, he has helped cover a number of high-profile  stories, including the 2020 election results and the court cases of  teachers and administrators charged in the Atlanta Public Schools  cheating scandal.   Leroy will be the AJC's first Black editor-in-chief in the  newspaper's 155-year history.   I congratulate Leroy on this wonderful honor. I look forward to his  continued success at the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.   By the way, this comes from another Leroy.  [[Page H1535]]                                ____________________     Mr. Chair, I rise today in full, unambiguous  support of H.R. 1, the Lower Energy Costs Act.   The Energy and Commerce Committee recently heard from David Hickman,  a farmer, who described our current economy as the most perilous time  for American agriculture. He is right, and he is not alone.   Every day that I am in Georgia's First Congressional District,  whether I am talking to a parent, a farmer, a teacher, a trucker, or a  small business owner, I hear the same concern: Inflation is too high.  Everything, from diesel to food, is more expensive under this  President, who cannot stop himself from spending your money, stealing  your retirement funds, and stomping on your small business.   The average household is paying $10,000 more per year as a result of  Biden's policies. What is worse is that pain is the point.   On day one of his Presidency, President Biden declared war on  American energy, and at breakneck speed ended American energy  independence and killed thousands of jobs.   What came next? Inflation, high interest rates, small businesses  closing their doors, and even more inflation.   When you plunge a knife into the heart of our economy, you can't be  surprised when it begins bleeding out.   Fortunately, House Republicans are stepping up and delivering  solutions for the American people. H.R. 1 will increase American energy  production, reform the permitting process for all industries, reverse  this administration's anti-energy policies, streamline energy  infrastructure, and boost the production and processing of critical  minerals. That is a long-winded way of saying that this bill will make  our energy sector more affordable, more efficient, and will create more  jobs.   The American people told us that inflation and high energy prices  were their number one concern, and we are listening by making it the  House's number one priority. It doesn't even matter if you think we  should ``drill, baby, drill'' or never use fossil fuels again, we need  to be able to build in America again.   That is why I am particularly glad that my bill, H.R. 1070, was  included in this legislation. It will help bring necessary permitting  reform and investment in America's critical mineral mining and  processing. Right now we rely almost entirely on China for critical  minerals needed for batteries, smartphones, military technologies, and  more.   Simply put, this is not energy independence. We depend more on China  than we have ever relied on OPEC or any other countries for oil. It is  a national security concern to depend on any one country that much for  such an essential material.   My district is one of the few places in America that mines critical  minerals, and we are eager to bring more of this essential and valuable  supply chain home.   H.R. 1 is an important step, and I encourage all of my colleagues to  vote in favor of this important legislation.
