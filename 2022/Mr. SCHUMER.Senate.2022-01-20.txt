 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, last night was a reminder of a difficult  but important reality of our great democracy: The march to freedom,  through thick and thin, is never over--and we have to keep marching.   While last night's vote was disappointing, it will not deter Senate  Democrats from continuing our fight against voter suppression, dark  money, and partisan gerrymandering. Democrats are proud of the fight we  held last night. The strength, eloquence, enthusiasm, and overwhelming  participation of my Democratic colleagues during debate was  exhilarating and shows the passion we feel about this issue.   Facing an uphill battle from the start, we lost the vote. But to have  not voted would have been a far greater loss, a loss for our Democratic  Party, which for generations has stood for voting rights; a loss for  the civil rights advocates who have sacrificed so much on this issue;  and a loss for the American people and what this country stands for. On  an issue this important, not doing everything we could would have been  unacceptable.   Now, the bromides of the beltway class hold we should not have held a  vote on voting rights if the outcome was not certain. They are wrong.  Imagine telling Dr. King not to march from Selma to Montgomery because  he could not be sure what obstacles awaited him and his fellow freedom  fighters. Imagine telling John Lewis he should never have crossed the  Pettus Bridge because it was unclear what perils awaited him on the  other side.   Every Member of this body who has ever invoked these great titans of  freedom has an obligation--an obligation--to uphold their legacies not  just with words but with actions. Senators were elected to vote. The  examples of Dr. King, of John Lewis inspire us, give us strength, and  show us that sometimes the only right option is to move forward.   And we need to remember what this is about. With the advent of Donald  Trump and his many Big Lies, with the January 6 insurrection, with the  vicious acts of voter suppression throughout the States, and with the  greedy dark money interests that fuel the Republican Party these days,  this is a fight for the soul of America--nothing less. So Democrats  will not shy away from an uphill fight; we will continue to face them.   And I believe that the lessons of history are clear: When  Representatives have to take a stand, when they have to show to the  American people where they are on the issues, the right side of history  ultimately prevails. We know history is on the side of voting rights,  and we know that forcing leaders to take stands will ultimately move  the ball forward.   Now, finally, I want to thank all my colleagues who came to the floor  yesterday to speak valiantly in defense of voting rights and for  working assiduously for months on this vital issue: Senators Klobuchar  and Merkley, Booker, Schatz, Senator Kaine--you, Mr. President-- Senators King, Tester, Warnock, Ossoff, Durbin, Padilla, Leahy--and so  many, so many more. Their leadership, their expertise, and their  dedication to protecting our democracy is inspiring. It gives our  caucus strength, and it made such a difference. Last night was unusual  and exhilarating because we fought the good fight.  [[Page S358]]    As former Majority Leader Alben Barkley of Kentucky said 80 years ago  this November, facing a filibuster, which successfully blocked anti- poll tax legislation--the majority leader, Alben Barkley, from  Kentucky, said:         I am glad I have made this fight. I have made it in behalf       of what I believe to be the broad and true foundations of a       true democracy.    Senate Democrats fighting for voting rights is not over. We will keep  fighting until voting rights are protected for every single American.  And one day--hopefully, sooner rather than later--we will succeed.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask to execute the previous order with  respect to the Thomas nomination.    Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.
