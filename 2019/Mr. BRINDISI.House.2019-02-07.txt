 Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Chair, I thank the gentlewoman from California, chairwoman of  the Veterans' Affairs Committee's Health Subcommittee, for introducing  this important bill, as well as the chairman of the Veterans' Affairs  Committee, the gentleman from California.   Veterans should never have to miss a doctor's appointment or medical  treatment because they don't have access to affordable childcare. This  bill is a commonsense solution that removes this roadblock and ensures  our Nation's veterans have access to the care they have earned. I am  glad to see the House take up this issue.   My amendment would clarify that community-based outpatient clinics  are included under the bill's definition of facilities of the  Department and ensure that veterans who receive their care from CBOCs  are able to access VA childcare assistance.   Many veterans who live in rural areas in my district and across the  country do not have a full-service hospital nearby, and they rely on  CBOCs to receive primary and mental healthcare. It is important to make  clear that this childcare benefit would include them, no matter how  small or large their VA facility is.   As a new Member of the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs, I will  continue working to improve access to VA healthcare and benefits for  veterans, including veterans living in rural communities.   I urge adoption of my amendment and again thank the gentlewoman from  California for introducing this bill, and I urge our colleagues on both  sides of the aisle to pass the underlying legislation.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Takano), the chair of the committee.    Madam Chair, I urge adoption of the amendment, and I  yield back the balance of my time.
