 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize Coach Pat  O'Keefe of Grand Ledge, who is retiring after 51 seasons leading the  high school's baseball program.   Coach O'Keefe led the Comets to a pair of State championships and an  incredible 1,315 wins, making him the winningest baseball coach in  Michigan history.   Adding to his accolades, Coach O'Keefe is a member of the Michigan  High School Baseball Coaches Association Hall of Fame, the Greater  Lansing Sports Hall of Fame, and the Michigan Baseball Hall of Fame.   He shares the successes of his career and gives credit to his wife of  48 years, Melody.   Coach O'Keefe is an exemplary community leader who will leave a  lasting legacy beyond baseball. He modeled the value of hard work and  sportsmanship, and he taught valuable life lessons to the young men on  his teams.   Once again, I wish to congratulate Coach O'Keefe on a remarkable  career, and I thank him for making such a positive impact on five  decades of students in Grand Ledge.                            ____________________
