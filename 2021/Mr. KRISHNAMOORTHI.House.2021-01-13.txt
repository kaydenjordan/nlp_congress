 Madam Speaker, my parents brought me as an infant  to America because they knew it is the land of democracy. It is the  beacon of hope for all the world. We called it the American Dream.   When Donald Trump told rioters to go to the Capitol and, quote,  unquote, ``fight like hell,'' he incited an attack on the Capitol and  the ideals comprising the American Dream.   I am voting for impeachment because I know we are still the country  my parents believed in, and I will fight like hell for it.
