 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in memory of Dr.  Eugene Talmadge Maddox, a veterinarian and a remarkable Georgian.   Mr. Speaker, 1954 was an eventful year for Gene, as he graduated from  Alexander Baldwin Agricultural College and married the love of his  life, Patsy Copeland. He went on to receive his veterinary degree from  the University of Georgia in 1959.   Following his graduation, they moved to Thomasville, Georgia, where  he worked at Clanton Veterinary Hospital. He founded his own animal  hospital, Cairo Animal Hospital, in 1963, and served Grady and  surrounding cities until he retired in 2004 to serve as a Georgia State  representative for Grady and Decatur counties in 2012.   In 2006, he was honored by the Georgia Veterinary Medical Association  as Veterinarian of the Year. In 2015, he received the prestigious J.T.  Mercer Lifetime Achievement Award.   An active member of his community, Gene was the former president of  the American Veterinary Medical Association, the Georgia Veterinary  Medical Association, and a member of the Georgia Cattlemen's  Association. He also served as chief veterinary medical examiner under  four Governors during his career.   A loving father and husband, an outdoorsman, a community advocate,  and a dedicated veterinarian, Gene is sure to be missed.                            ____________________
