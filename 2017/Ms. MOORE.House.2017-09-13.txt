 Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Wisconsin is recognized for 5  minutes.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Wisconsin is recognized for 5  minutes.    Oh my, my, my, Mr. Chairman, and my good friend from  Michigan. The fact of the matter is that section 1502 is, in fact,  working. The GAO report that Mr. Huizenga referred to actually said  that the civil war and conflict is, in fact, diminishing as section  1502 is being implemented. It is working better and sooner than I  thought it would be.   Just a little bit of a refresher course for you, Mr. Chairman. The  minerals contained in consumer electronics that we all use--TVs, cell  phones--are fueling war and conflict in the Congo. And I am not talking  about a little skirmish here. I am talking about, we are funding armed  militias, and it is a civil war on a scale of deaths that compare with  World War II, and notable for its brutality, its savagery, its  mutilation, rape.   I can tell you that our good GOP friends say that it is a laudable  goal to stop these civil wars, but it just doesn't belong in securities  law; the logic being the transparency doesn't belong in security law.   Oh, okay. Well, I can tell you that companies find that it is  material, a security term of art, whether their brand is tarnished with  literally the blood of children and enslaved workers that are standing  there, I would suspect, with some of these Congolese who want section  1502 to go away, who are running these armed militias for profit. So do  consumers and so do investors. Hence, the rise of socially-conscious  mutual funds that are regulated by the SEC.   I notice that my comrades have not introduced--there's nothing in  this amendment that would provide for ending this kind of civil war on  the scale of World War II in their amendment.   I want to say, because of the United States' leadership on conflict  minerals, the EU and China are enacting their own versions of  implementing prohibitions against the receipt of conflict minerals.  This amendment puts America last in world leadership.   I do realize the gentleman had the right to close, but his time  having been consumed, I will go on to report to you, Mr. Chairman, that  more than 75 percent of the world's smelters for the four minerals now  have passed conflict-free audits. Companies are putting this in place  and they are finding that they are happy with it; that the costs of  implementing it are less than they thought it would be, much less than  they thought it would be; and they are receiving a premium for these  metals if they can, in fact, report that they are conflict-free.                                time  1615    According to the United Nations, as of 2016, over three-quarters of  3T miners surveyed in eastern Congo are working in mines where there is  no armed group standing over them. That is according to an independent  study.   Today, 78 percent of the world's smelters for the four minerals have  now passed conflict-free audits, or 253 smelters in total. The record  is abundantly clear. Section 1502 is working.   Now, he talked about Congolese leaders who don't like it. These are  people who are profiting from the armed conflict, but there are  Congolese communities and leaders who support section 1502 because they  are seeing the improvements in security and rule of law.   For example, Justine Masika Bihamba, the coordinator of Synergy of  Women for Victims of Sexual Violence says: ``Ten years ago, we were  under the de facto control of armed groups. Today, let's admit we are a  long way from that. And if we are honest, that is in part because of  Dodd-Frank.''   Bishop Nicolas Djomo came before our committee and said: ``We urge  the U.S. business community to account for the gruesome social costs of  the illicit mining as they calculate their cost for compliance with  section 1502.''   There is a moral dimension to this that we cannot ignore. If we want  to make America great again, let's not cede our moral authority on this  issue.   Mr. Chairman, I would ask my colleagues to vote against this  amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Huizenga).   The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes  appeared to have it.    Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.   The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further  proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Michigan  will be postponed.
