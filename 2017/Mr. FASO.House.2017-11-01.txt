 Mr. Speaker, I was unavoidably detained. Had I been  present, I would have voted ``yea'' on rollcall No. 598.                             PERSONAL EXPLANATION     Mr. Speaker, I was unavoidably detained. Had I been  present, I would have voted ``yea'' on rollcall No. 598.                             PERSONAL EXPLANATION     Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Lipinski, my friend from  Illinois, for holding this Special Order this evening, to highlight the  important work being done by the Climate Solutions Caucus, to develop  economically viable solutions to address climate change.   Mr. Speaker, changing weather patterns and extreme weather events  threaten nearly every aspect of New York State's economy, including our  agricultural and outdoor recreational sectors. The recreational economy  alone generates $42 billion in consumer spending each year, while  supporting over 300,000 Empire State jobs. As we work to address  climate change in a bipartisan manner, we must employ a variety of  techniques that both mitigate impacts and support economic growth.   I am currently working with my Agriculture Committee colleagues on  conservation legislation for the next farm bill that will provide  important data points on conservation programs and outcomes, allowing  legislators and regulators to most efficiently use taxpayer dollars to  achieve real conservation results for our farms. These incentive  programs support farming practices that, among other benefits, like  increasing yield, lowering the amount of fertilizers that are employed,  pull carbon from the air and sequester it in the soil.   In addition to sequestering carbon in the soil. We can also work to  reduce emissions through greater efficiency in the transportation  sector. Indeed, the transportation sector is one area where  CO2 emissions have risen in the last 20 years, unlike, for  instance, the electric generation sector.   One easy fix would be to modernize the air traffic control system to  fly planes on more direct satellite guided routes because direct routes  save fuel. When Canada switched to a modern air traffic control system,  the national fleet was able to reduce emissions in that nation by  millions of tons per year.   These commonsense changes are great steps forward in combating  climate change, but our work is far from over. We must address the real  impacts of man-made climate change and emphasize the need to develop  and create jobs with a goal of protecting our environment. It is  critical that we work together to develop smart solutions that will  conserve our natural resources and protect our communities and  infrastructure for future generations.    Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to be a member of the Climate  Solutions Caucus, and I look forward to working with my colleagues. I,  particularly, want to applaud our distinguished friend from Illinois,  Mr. Lipinski, for organizing this Special Order tonight on a bipartisan  basis so that we can address this issue and allow the folks at home and  all around the United States to better understand the work that is  being done here in Congress on a bipartisan basis to address climate  change.
