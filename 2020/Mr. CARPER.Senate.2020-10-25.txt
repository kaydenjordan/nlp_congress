 Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to share with you  and our colleagues some of my thoughts concerning the nomination of  Judge Amy Coney Barrett to serve as an Associate Justice of the Supreme  Court of these United States.   I believe it was Winston Churchill who once said these words: ``The  further back we look, the further forward we see.'' So let me begin  today by looking back in time--way back in time.   More than 230 years ago, during the Constitutional Convention in  Philadelphia, just up the road from my family's home in Wilmington, DE,  our Founders debated at great length on how to create a different kind  of government--an experiment, if you will, in which a nation's citizens  would elect their own leaders, and a system of checks and balances  would ensure that country would never--never--be led by a tyrant.   Among the most contentious issues they debated during that summer of  1787 in the City of Brotherly Love was the creation of a Federal  judiciary. Our Founders disagreed, oftentimes strongly, about what our  judicial system should look like and how judges should be selected: Who  would nominate them? Who would confirm them? Would they serve one term,  multiple terms, or would their appointments be lifetime in nature?   When the Framers appeared to be hopelessly deadlocked, members of the  clergy were brought in to pray that God would provide the leaders with  the wisdom to break the impasse.   In the end, it apparently worked, and our Founding Founders ended up  adopting a compromise very similar to one they had rejected just a few  weeks earlier; namely, the President would nominate judges to serve  lifetime appointments with the advice and consent of the Senate.   Not surprisingly, almost 240 years later, we are still sparring over  what those words should mean.   Having said that, the blueprint that was drafted that year and later  ratified by the 13 States would go on to become the most enduring and  replicated Constitution in the history of the world.   Among our most important sworn duties here in the U.S. Senate is to  act as caretakers of that Constitution and the rights it provides for  our citizens while protecting this unique system of checks and balances  that provide the foundation on which our democracy is built.   That brings us to the present. This past week, Republican Members of  the Senate Judiciary Committee voted to advance Judge Barrett's  nomination to the floor of the Senate, but they have done so, I fear,  at great cost to this body and quite possibly to our democracy.   When our Founders carefully designed our system of checks and  balances, they did not envision a sham confirmation process for  judicial nominees. But as much as I hate to say it, that is what this  one has been, pure and simple. This entire process has become an  exercise in raw political power, not the deliberative, nonpartisan  process that our Founders envisioned.   Frankly, it has been a process that I could never have imagined 20  years ago when I was first elected to serve with my colleagues here.  Over those 20 years, I have risen on six previous occasions to offer  remarks regarding nominees to the Supreme Court as we considered the  nominations of Chief Justice Roberts, Justice Alito, Justice Sotomayor,  Justice Kagan, Justice Gorsuch, and Justice Kavanaugh.   One name not mentioned among the six I have just listed is that of  Judge Merrick Garland. After being nominated by President Clinton to  serve on the DC Circuit Court of Appeals--that is the top appellate  court in the country--and confirmed by a Republican-led Senate with a  bipartisan margin of more than 3 to 1--76 to 23, in fact--Judge Garland  has served with distinction on our top appellate court since 1997,  including for many years as its chief judge.   President Obama later nominated him to serve on the Supreme Court 237  days before election day in 2016--237 days before election day.   By submitting the name of Judge Garland to the U.S. Senate for  consideration 4 years ago, President Obama, who was twice elected by  clear margins in both the popular vote and the electoral college,  nominated a man who spent his entire 20-year career as a judge working  to build consensus and find principled compromises. Yet we never got a  chance to consider Judge Garland's nomination to serve on the Supreme  Court on this Senate floor.   Judge Garland wasn't given a vote either in committee or here in the  U.S. Senate. Judge Garland wasn't given a hearing. Most of our  Republican colleagues wouldn't even meet with him, even though many of  them had voted earlier to confirm him to, again, serve on the top  appellate Court of our land.   Judge Garland's nomination languished for 293 shameful days. A great  many Americans believe that it is the equivalent of stealing a Supreme  Court seat. A good man--a very good man--was treated badly and so, too,  was our Constitution.   Still, many of our Republican colleagues assured us that if the  tables were turned later on, they would hold themselves to the same  standard and only allow the next President to fill the Supreme Court  seat should a vacancy occur during an election year.   Then, on September 18, 2020, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg passed away,  46 days before a Presidential election. And with her death, most of our  Republican colleagues changed their tune almost overnight.   Today, with more than 220,000 Americans dead and more than 8 million  [[Page S6472]]  Americans infected with the coronavirus--not to mention 13 million  unemployed--we are in the midst of an election, rushing to confirm a  controversial nominee from President Trump, who lost the popular vote  by nearly 3 million votes and was subsequently impeached by the House.   Judge Barrett's nomination was rushed out of committee just 12 days  before election day, in a process that many believe was a clear  violation of the rules of the Judiciary Committee. Think about that--12  days.   Instead of keeping their word, a number of our Republican colleagues  are fast-tracking a nominee--and not a consensus nominee from the  judicial mainstream like Judge Merrick Garland--as tens of millions of  Americans are mailing their ballots in, dropping off their ballots, and  lining up to vote.   This confirmation process is shameful. It is unprecedented. If you  have ever wondered what hypocrisy looks like, this is it.   I know that many Americans, including many of our Republican  colleagues, see in Amy Coney Barrett a well-qualified judge and, in  Donald Trump, a duly elected President, and they believe a vote is  necessary because, after all, it is spelled out in the Constitution.   Well, let me be clear. There was no precedent for the shameful  blockade of consideration for Judge Merrick Garland, and there is no  precedent for confirming Judge Barrett just 8 days before an election.   As my colleagues know, I am not given to hyperbole, but rushing to  confirm Judge Barrett has the potential of altering, perhaps forever,  the way the American people view the Supreme Court and the U.S. Senate.   To our Republican friends, let me remind you that just because you  can do this and get away with it doesn't make it right. This is wrong,  and in your hearts you know it is wrong. Your actions stand our system  of checks and balances on its head--in the end, only serving to weaken  our democracy, not strengthen it.   To those Americans who want to see an up-or-down vote on Judge  Barrett, I understand that you may not share my views or my fears,  which many other people do share, but let me stop here for a moment to  share with you something that isn't widely known about most Republicans  and most Democrats here in the U.S. Senate.   While you would never know it most days by watching the news, most of  us who serve in this body generally get along. While a lot has changed  since Senators Pat Leahy and Chuck Grassley came here a long time ago,  bipartisan friendships still endure, although they don't flourish as  they once did.   Many of us agree at times in hearing rooms and many of us disagree at  times in hearing rooms and on the Senate floor, but just about every  week that we are in session, a number of Democrats and Republicans  still find time together for prayer and reflection, whether at Prayer  Breakfast in the Capitol or at one of several bipartisan Bible study  groups, including one led by our Senate Chaplain, Barry Black, who  previously served as Chief of Chaplains for the Navy and the Marine  Corps.   Oftentimes at these gatherings we are reminded of the Golden Rule,  one of the two greatest commandments: to treat other people the way we  want to be treated.   After serving here for 20 years, I remain convinced that our  friendships and our ability to reach consensus on critical issues  facing our Nation are based in no small part on our faithful adherence  to that commandment, which can be found in every major religion of the  world, and we are at our best here in this body when we follow it.   I believe that true adherence to the Golden Rule calls for fairness  in the way we discharge our constitutional responsibilities for  judicial nominations, too, including nominations to the Supreme Court,  regardless of which party occupies the White House or the Presiding  Officer's chair.   We can't have one set of rules for Democratic Presidents and another  set of rules for Republican Presidents. The Golden Rule called for a  vote for Judge Garland, and I believe that, today, the Golden Rule  calls for hitting the pause button on Judge Barrett's nomination until  the President, who is elected in 9 days, is sworn into office.   Why? Because the American people deserve to have their voices heard.  But you don't have to take my word for this. Consider, if you will, the  words of our Republican leader, Mitch McConnell, from March 2, 2016, 14  days before President Obama had even nominated Judge Merrick Garland to  serve on the Supreme Court, following the death of Justice Scalia, and  a whole 7 months--a whole 7 months--before an election.   Leader McConnell said 4 years ago:         The American people deserve to be heard on this matter.       That's the fairest and most reasonable approach today.    He went on to say:         Voters have already begun to choose the next President who       in turn will nominate the next Supreme Court Justice. . . .       This is something the American people should decide.    That is what he said 4 years ago.   Let's also listen to what the current chairman of the Senate  Judiciary Committee, Senator Graham, told us March 10, 2016. This is  what he said:         I want you to use my words against me.    Think of that.         I want you to use my words against me. If there's a       Republican President [elected] in 2016 and a vacancy occurs       in the last year of the first term, you can say, ``Lindsey       Graham said, `Let's let the next President, whoever it might       be, make that nomination.' ''    And finally, here is the advice of my friend, then-chairman of the  Senate Judiciary Committee, Senator Chuck Grassley, following the death  of Justice Scalia. He said:         The President should exercise restraint and not name a       nominee until after the November election is completed.    He went on to say:         President Lincoln is a good role model for this practice.       The President should let the people decide.    I am glad Senator Grassley mentioned our Nation's 16th President  because I believe President Lincoln's example will serve us well,  especially at this moment. Why do I say that?   Well, after a Supreme Court vacancy occurred just 27 days before the  1864 Presidential election, what did President Lincoln do about it? Did  he rush to fill the vacancy? Did he call the Senate to push through a  nominee in a month's time, largely because he could? No, he did not.   In the midst of a Civil War that took the lives of hundreds of  thousands of Americans, Lincoln called for allowing the American people  first to decide who would be President, and that person would then  nominate a candidate for the vacant seat, with the advice and consent  of the Senate.   Nearly 150 years later, Lincoln's words give us a clear roadmap for  doing the right thing: Let the American people have their voices heard  before filling this vacancy, instead of rushing it through just days  before an election.   As we all know, the Supreme Court seat we are debating today was left  vacant by the death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who served on the  Supreme Court since 1993. We continue to mourn her loss. We continue to  pray for her family and loved ones.   Justice Ginsburg may have been small in stature, but, in death, our  Nation has lost a true giant. Ruth Bader Ginsburg made it her life's  work to challenge the laws and systems in this country that limited  opportunity for women solely on the basis of their gender. She was a  pioneer in her own right, but perhaps even more importantly, she paved  the way for generations of women and girls who would come after her.   Today, women can sign a mortgage on their own in no small part  because of Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Today, women can open a bank account or  apply for a credit card without a male cosigner in no small part  because of Ruth Bader Ginsburg. And, today, pregnant women cannot be  discriminated against at work in no small part because of Ruth Bader  Ginsburg.   I am confident that her legacy will live on, especially in all the  women and young girls she inspired throughout her remarkable life, but,  unfortunately, with her passing, the equality that she spent her life  fighting for is now on the line.   Many Americans believe in their hearts that the threats posed by this  nominee, the one before us at this moment, are real. That is  particularly true when it comes to access to affordable healthcare, to  the rights of women to make their own healthcare decisions, to voting  rights, and, perhaps  [[Page S6473]]  most importantly, to the future of our planet.   The Affordable Care Act hangs in the balance with this nomination.  Think about that for a moment. Right now, our country is in the midst  of a public health crisis the likes of which those of us living have  never seen.   Over 8 million of our fellow Americans have been infected with this  coronavirus. Over 220,000 lives have been lost to this deadly virus.  That is more than the entire population of Des Moines, IA. We are  consistently seeing 700 Americans die from the coronavirus every day.   The front page of yesterday's Wall Street Journal makes it clear. It  is not getting better; it is getting worse.   As it turns out, America has less than 5 percent of the world's  population, but our country accounts for more than 20 percent of the  world's deaths from coronavirus. No other nation on Earth comes close  to that. The numbers don't lie.   Mexico, our neighbor to our south, has lost 88,000 people to the  coronavirus; we have lost 220,000. The United Kingdom has lost 44,000;  we have lost 220,000. France has lost 34,000, Germany just over 10,000,  and we have lost over 220,000. Canada, our neighbor to the north, has  lost just over 9,000; Japan, 1,700 deaths; Australia, 905 deaths; South  Korea, just 457 deaths from the coronavirus; and we have lost over  220,000.   While this carnage continues here and abroad, our friends in the  other party continue to press the Supreme Court to throw out--to throw  out--the Affordable Care Act in its entirety, not next year, next  month.   Meanwhile, nearly 13 million Americans are unemployed, and our  unemployment rate, at nearly 8 percent, is more than double the rate  from the beginning of this year. But rather than prioritize public  health and long-overdue relief for the millions of Americans who are  struggling to get by, our Republican colleagues have instead decided to  fast-track a Supreme Court nominee just 8 or 9 days before a  Presidential election.   So why the rush? Well, to figure that out, all you have to do is look  at a calendar. Just 7 days after election day on November 10, the  Supreme Court will hear oral arguments in a case known as California v.  Texas. California v. Texas--a case that was brought by 18 Republican  attorneys general and the Trump administration--seeks to overturn the  Affordable Care Act in its entirety--in its entirety.   If confirmed, Judge Barrett may well end up casting the deciding vote  on whether or not to strike down the Affordable Care Act, and we know  from her own words that Judge Barrett does not agree with the decision  written by Chief Justice Roberts to uphold the constitutionality of the  Affordable Care Act a few years ago.   She wrote that the Chief Justice had ``pushed the Affordable Care Act  beyond its plausible meaning to save the statute.'' Judge Barrett said  nothing during her confirmation hearing to distance herself from these  words.   And what exactly could the consequences of overturning the ACA be?  Well, for starters, those consequences could mean that nearly 135  million Americans who have a preexisting condition could be charged  more for healthcare, in many cases making their healthcare  unaffordable.   It could mean returning to a time when insurers could design plans  that excluded coverage for contraception and family planning, as well  as conditions like pregnancy, mental healthcare, and substance abuse  treatment.   Overturning the Affordable Care Act could threaten Medicaid expansion  that provides healthcare coverage to over 15 million low-income  Americans, many of them living in some of the most rural parts of  America.   It would mean that young adults under the age of 26 may no longer be  able to stay on their parents' healthcare plans.   It would jeopardize the tax credit that over 9 million Americans  receive to help cover their own healthcare costs.   And that is just to name a few things--just a few. But make no  mistake, overturning the Affordable Care Act in the middle of the  night, in the middle of the worst pandemic in a century, will have  devastating and far-reaching impacts on our healthcare system and  nearly every American, including the more than 8 million Americans who  will be left with a new preexisting condition: the coronavirus.   Sadly, that is what our President and many of our Republican  colleagues are intent on doing as we battle COVID-19 every day and in  every State of our country. Having failed nearly 100 times to repeal or  chip away at the Affordable Care Act in Congress, Donald Trump and many  of our Republican colleagues are now counting on the Supreme Court to  do their work for them, and they are within one vote--one vote--of  achieving their goal--one vote.   A woman's right to make her own personal and intimate healthcare  decisions hangs in the balance with this nomination. During her  confirmation hearing, Judge Barrett refused to say much of anything on  this critical women's rights issue, including whether Roe v. Wade was  correctly decided in 1973.   Interestingly, though, she did cite Justice Ginsburg and the so- called Ginsburg rule and asserted that it prevented the nominee--this  nominee--from indicating how she would rule as a Supreme Court Justice  on these matters. But let's actually look at what Justice Ginsburg said  about Roe v. Wade during her own confirmation hearing in 1993, 27 years  ago. Justice Ginsburg said:         The decision whether or not to bear a child is central to a       woman's life, to her well-being and dignity. It is a decision       she must make for herself. When Government controls that       decision for her, she is being treated as less than a fully       adult responsible for her own choices.    Justice Ginsburg did not deflect or refuse to answer the central  question: Should women have the right to make their own healthcare  decisions? Justice Ginsburg was forthright, and the Senate confirmed  her by a vote of 96 to 3--96 to 3.   Given Judge Barrett's lack of clarity on this critical matter, I am  left to consider her past record and statements. My hope is that Judge  Barrett would uphold nearly 50 years of precedence and maintain this  constitutional right for women. However, my fear is that Justice  Barrett was nominated because she meets Donald Trump's stated litmus  test to overturn this constitutional right that an overwhelming  majority of Americans support.   Voting rights and the integrity of our elections also hang in the  balance with this nomination. Earlier this week, a deadlocked Supreme  Court barely--just barely--upheld a Pennsylvania lower court decision  that allows mail-in ballots in Pennsylvania to be counted in the  upcoming election. The vote was tied 4 to 4, which means the issue is  not settled permanently. It means that Judge Barrett may very well be  the deciding vote on many disputes related to the upcoming election.   How would a Justice Barrett have ruled in the Pennsylvania case?   During her confirmation hearing, Judge Barrett refused to answer  questions about the legality of poll taxes, voter intimidation, voter  discrimination, and whether or not the President can unilaterally move  election day. It strains credulity to believe that Judge Barrett does  not know that poll taxes are unconstitutional, that voter intimidation  is unconstitutional, that voter discrimination is unconstitutional, and  that the President cannot move election day. Why can't he? Because--you  guessed it--it would be unconstitutional, even if he tried.   More than ever, we need Justices on the Supreme Court, along with  judges on other Federal courts, who can be counted on by the American  people to uphold the integrity of the upcoming election and on future  elections.   Based on her testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee earlier  this month, I am not sure that Judge Barrett can be counted on by the  rest of us to ensure that--win or lose--President Trump stays within  the boundaries of the law and abides by the will of the American voters  on November 3.   As it turns out, there is a lot more than an election that may hang  in the balance with this nomination, and that includes the very future  of our planet and its inhabitants.   Over the course of her confirmation hearing, on three separate  occasions--three separate occasions--Judge Barrett refused to  acknowledge the plain  [[Page S6474]]  and indisputable facts that climate change is real and that human  activity is the primary--not the only but the primary--cause of our  current climate crisis, which we see evidence of almost every single  day.   Hurricane-force winds pierced through America's Heartland this  summer, flattening one-third--one-third--of Iowa's crops in a matter of  hours. Our east coast and gulf coast are experiencing one of the most  active hurricane seasons ever recorded, with more tropical storms, more  rainfall, and more rapid intensification. One of our colleagues from  Louisiana told me last month that his State is losing the equivalent of  one football field to the sea every 100 minutes. That is right--not  every week, not every month, not every day. Every 100 minutes, the  equivalent of one football field is lost to the sea.   Last summer, fueled by record heat, long droughts and as many as  12,000 lightning strikes in 36 hours--think about that, 12,000  lightning strikes in 36 hours--wildfires destroyed parts of California  the size of my State. This past week Colorado has witnessed wildfire  destruction that is almost as bad.   That is not all. This year, recordbreaking heat waves simmered the  coldest places on Earth, from Antarctica to the Arctic Circle, where  the temperature reached 100 degrees Fahrenheit for the first time ever.  That is right--100 degrees Fahrenheit along the Arctic Circle.  Temperatures in Alaska reached over 90 degrees Fahrenheit for the first  time in that State's history. Temperatures in Death Valley reached over  134 degrees Fahrenheit--the hottest temperature ever recorded on this  planet. July was the hottest July ever recorded. September was the  hottest September recorded. And, on the heels of the hottest decade on  Earth, this year is on track to be one of the hottest years ever  recorded--this year. And it is not getting better. It is getting worse.    Yet, when she was first asked, simply, if climate change was real,  Judge Barrett responded that she is ``not a scientist.''   I am not a scientist, either. I am, however, the senior Democrat on  the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, and like millions of  Americans, I recognize the simple fact that you don't have to be a  scientist to trust scientists. You don't have to be entrenched in the  studies of science to know that it is gravity which is keeping our feet  firmly on the ground.   When Judge Barrett was later asked by one of our colleagues whether  coronavirus is infectious, Judge Barrett said: ``It's an obvious fact,  yes.''   She was then asked if smoking causes cancer, and Judge Barrett said:  ``Yes, every package of cigarettes warns that smoking causes cancer.''   But then, when asked a third question--whether or not the nominee  believed that climate change is happening, and that it is threatening  the air we breathe and the water we drink--Judge Barrett refused to  acknowledge the simple fact that climate change and global warming are  real. Instead, Judge Barrett asserted that climate change is ``a  contentious matter of debate''--``a contentious matter of debate.''   Climate change is not ``a contentious matter of debate.'' There is  overwhelming consensus among the global scientific community that our  planet is warming, and that warming is caused by carbon pollution,  largely. Climate change is real. We see it every day in this country  and every day on this planet.   It is threatening the air we breathe and the water we drink. The  American people, and the people of our planet, see the effects of  climate change and global warming every single day, and these are  indisputable and undeniable facts, not a matter of debate.   Judge Barrett's views on climate change stand in stark contrast to  the science and the views of the vast majority of the American people  too. They also stand in stark contrast to the views of the late Justice  Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Quite simply, Judge Barrett's views are out of  touch with reality, and that poses a real threat to public health,  environmental quality, and, I think, the very future of this planet.   Let me echo, if I may, the words of President Emmanuel Macron of  France, who just down the hall here at the other end of the Capitol a  couple of years ago stood before a joint session of Congress, and he  called for our country, the United States, to once again lead the world  on climate change. He reminded us, and he said: We have only one  planet.   There is no planet B--no planet B. In fact, I fear there has never  been a more dangerous time to confirm a climate denier to a lifetime  appointment on the Supreme Court. Scientists warn that we are on the  brink of irreversible planetary destruction if we do not begin to  dramatically reduce global warming pollution. Over the next few  decades, the Supreme Court will decide the fate of critical  environmental issues--issues that will aid, or drastically curtail, the  abilities of future Presidential administrations and Congresses to  enact environmental policies that are essential to our survival as a  planet.   By way of contrast, Judge Barrett's predecessor, Justice Ginsburg,  was a critical tie-breaking vote on one of the most important climate  change cases in the Supreme Court's history, called Massachusetts v.  EPA.   Recall with me, if you will, that Massachusetts v. EPA affirmed the  Environmental Protection Agency's authority and duty to regulate  tailpipe emissions of greenhouse gases as a pollutant under the Clean  Air Act.   It also provided the legal underpinning for numerous other Obama  administration climate regulations that the Trump administration has  been hell-bent to destroy.   Just as the Supreme Court was designed by our Founders to remain  above the political fray, our Supreme Court Justices should not fall  prey to the blatant misinformation at the heart of climate denial.  Sadly, during her confirmation hearing, Judge Barrett demonstrated  that, on an issue so critical for the survival of our planet as we know  it, she does not appear to be guided by science and is unlikely to be  guided by the facts when it comes to global warming.   That, my friends, should scare the heck out of us.   These issues that Justice Ginsburg fought so hard to protect over the  course of her life--healthcare, the rights of women to make their own  healthcare decisions, voting rights, and the future of our planet--hang  in the balance with this nomination, and for these reasons, I will not  be supporting the nomination of Judge Barrett.   Let me conclude, if I may, by noting that Justice Ginsburg did some  of her most memorable work in dissent. During her memorial service in  the U.S. Capitol, Justice Ginsburg's rabbi said:         Justice Ginsburg's dissents were not cries of defeat. They       were blueprints for the future.    Justice Ginsburg knew that just because you don't have the votes  doesn't mean you are any less right. Justice Ginsburg knew that a great  dissent will speak to the future and just might eventually become the  majority view.   Today, we may not have the votes to stop this process or vote down  this nominee, but that doesn't make our efforts to fight for fairness  any less right. I could be mistaken, but I believe in my heart the  American people will make their voices heard loud and clear on what I  believe is a sham of a confirmation process, and they will do it on  election day.   Like Justice Ginsburg, the American people are dissenting against  this process and against this nominee, and I believe they will be  voting in record numbers. In fact, they already are.   Judge Barrett may be confirmed, but let history show I tried hard,  both to follow the Golden Rule and the example of Justice Ginsburg, and  I refused to join the majority opinion.   With that, I dissent, but I don't yield the floor. I yield my  remaining postcloture time to the Democratic leader. I yield my  remaining postcloture time to the Democratic leader. And I yield to the  Senator from Washington State, my friend and colleague.
