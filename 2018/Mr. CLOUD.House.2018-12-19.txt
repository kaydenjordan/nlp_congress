 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for recognizing me  tonight.   Mr. Speaker, tonight I speak to the humanitarian and criminal crisis  at our southern border.   This crisis has been permitted to exist because of Congress' failure  to act. For over 30 years, the American people have been promised  results, but they have received empty promises.   We know from history that our southern border wall works. This is not  a new concept. Where we have implemented a wall, we have seen great  success in curbing illicit activity.   Our Nation is a generous nation, one of the most diverse in the  world, and our generosity is being taken advantage of by illegal  cartels across our southern border. These cartels have created a  humanitarian and criminal crisis that abuses the rule of law and costs  innocent lives.   Cartels recruit and send migrants across our border, making thousands  of dollars a person, in a strategy to tax our human resources and  distract from our enforcement against drug trafficking.   As the Representative of the 27th District of Texas, the southern  part of my district is just 2 hours from the border.                                time  2115    I know the good men and women who serve on our southern border, and  they always prioritize life. Cartels know this and take advantage of  it.   Failure to complete a southern border wall and loopholes in our  asylum laws have created a magnet for illegal immigration. According to  DHS, around 80 percent of asylum cases that go to a hearing are  rejected by the judge as illegitimate.   DHS spokesman Tyler Houlton pointed out earlier this year that  smugglers and traffickers understand our broken immigration laws better  than most.   The catch-and-release process, whereby migrants come into the country  and are issued a date to appear in court, often years away, are  released into the interior, and it is driving this humanitarian crisis.  ICE reports that the number of migrants, including many women and  children seeking entry, has increased dramatically in recent years.  They often find themselves at risk for assault and abuse, such as rape,  beatings, kidnapping, and robbery.    =========================== NOTE ===========================        December 19, 2018 on Page H10329 the following appeared: ISIS  reports that the number of migrants, including many women and  children seeking entry, has increased dramatically in recent  years.      The online version has been corrected to read: ICE reports that  the number of migrants, including many women and children seeking  entry, has increased dramatically in recent years.    ========================= END NOTE =========================     Tonight, Mr. Speaker, we are here advocating for an end to the  humanitarian and criminal crisis on our southern border caused by  Congress' failure to act. This means ending the status quo, funding  border security, and closing the loopholes in our broken asylum system.
