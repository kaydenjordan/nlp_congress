 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  order for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kennedy). Without objection, it is so  ordered.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  order for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kennedy). Without objection, it is so  ordered.    Mr. President, I rise to strongly oppose the  nomination  [[Page S676]]  of Betsy DeVos for Secretary of Education.   I want to start by just reading from some letters from some young  constituents that I received.   From one little boy named Theodore:         Dear Senator Gillibrand, I am a public student in PS 3. I       love my school.        Please vote against Betsy DeVos because she's against       public schools. I'm happy here.    From Felix:         Dear Senator Gillibrand, I am a public school student in       New York, and I love my school. Please vote against Betsy       DeVos as Secretary of Education because she is prejudice       against public schools. I am in third grade and am a boy.       Love, Felix.        Dear Senator Gillibrand, my name is Mina, and I am a public       school student. I love my school (PS3), and I hope you vote       against Betsy DeVos because she does not support public       schools. Sincerely, Mina.    These are just three letters out of thousands of letters, phone  calls, and emails from my constituents. I have never heard so much from  my constituents about someone so ill-prepared for the job they have  been nominated for.   I am unconvinced that this nominee in any way would use her position  to actually fight for the 2.6 million students and 200,000 teachers in  the public schools in my State.   She refused during hearings to commit to protecting the Federal  funding that goes to our title I schools which serve students from our  lowest income families. She refused to uphold critical Federal laws,  like the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, in schools that  receive this absolutely necessary Federal funding. She refused to  commit to upholding title IX guidance from the Department of Education,  which has played an instrumental role in addressing the problem of  sexual assault in our schools across the country. She even wavered on  whether guns have any place in and around our schools, she said she  would oppose gun-free school zones. She doesn't have any experience  working as a teacher or as a school administrator at any point in her  career. Instead, she has spent decades advocating for education  policies that would fundamentally undermine our public school education  system.   What kind of message does this send to our students and their  families and our teachers if we put our trust in a person who has  worked so tirelessly throughout her career to weaken public schools?   I am astonished by how little the nominee seems to understand about  the basic needs of New York's schools, teachers, and parents. I am very  disturbed about how out of touch her statements are with basic values.   In New York, we have over 2.6 million students who attend public  schools, including 450,000 with disabilities. We have over 200,000  public schoolteachers.   Ninety percent of all students in our country go to public school.  Public schools serve all kids. They feed them if they show up hungry.  Public schools help all kids with disabilities and don't send them  somewhere else. Public schools help all students reach their God-given  potential, and public schools are held accountable for meeting the  requirements of our Federal education system and essential civil rights  protections, but this nominee has vilified public schools.   Teachers and students around the country have raised their voices  about this nominee, and they have made their views very clear. They do  not want us to confirm Betsy DeVos to lead the Department of Education  because they feel she is not an Education Secretary for all of America.  I have heard from tens of thousands of them. Listening to what my  constituents say, they are pretty concerned.   I would like to read a couple more letters. This one is from a school  social worker in a middle school. She was hired to help underserved  children develop effective executive functioning skills and survive  their day-to-day lives.         My students are resilient, intelligent, loving young women       and men, and they face indescribable hardships that no child       should have to experience.        The ideologies and policies represented by Betsy DeVos and       the Trump administration put my students' futures on the       line.        Please continue to represent and fight for my students by       denying the confirmation of Betsy DeVos for Secretary of       Education.    Here is another letter:         While I teach in a private school setting, my sixth grade       daughter attends a public middle school, and my second grade       son attends a funded special education school to address his       speech and language delays.        We rely on the excellent public schools in our community to       support the learning needs of our children, as do hundreds of       thousands of other families in New York City and millions of       families across the Nation.    Here is another letter from a teacher in one of the poorest school  districts in my State. He wrote:         I not only teach the State-mandated curriculum--we offer       elite educational programming to all those who reside in our       district.        I am honored on a daily basis to know that I have been able       to level the playing field for many students by offering them       the keys to success through their education.        Students who come to us homeless, underfed, victims of       poverty and trauma are given the same access to success as       those more fortunate.        Because of our public school systems, they have been able       to achieve the American dream and achieve all their dreams.    These are real concerns. These are heartfelt worries. This is what  the people of New York are saying and people across this country. We  need to listen to our constituents. We need to serve them. We need to  represent them. We need to listen to our teachers across our States who  work so hard every day to make sure our children can learn and reach  their potential. We need to listen to our families and our students who  have expressed very real fears that this nominee will cause damage to  our public schools.   So I stand with my colleagues from both parties to oppose this  nomination. I will not support the confirmation of someone who is such  a threat to our public school system.   I encourage everyone in this Chamber to think about the students and  teachers in their States who desperately need a leader to run the  Department of Education. I urge all of my colleagues to vote this  nominee down.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.   The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
