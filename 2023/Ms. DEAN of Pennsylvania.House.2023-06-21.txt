 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to  H. Res. 521 because this is not a serious resolution.   This is political theater by the author, who clearly was not here, to  distract from Donald Trump's history of transgressions and now  indictments. It is also an attempt to punish Congressman Adam Schiff  for effectively holding Trump to account.   Congressman Schiff protected us from fascism at home and abroad.  First, on the so-called perfect call, Donald Trump withheld a meeting  and crucial weapons from President Zelenskyy to protect Ukraine from  Russia unless they gave him dirt on now-President Joe Biden.   Mr. Schiff stepped up as chairman of the Intelligence Committee and  eventually as lead manager to defend against executive corruption.   Then, when the former President lost the 2020 election and summoned  his supporters to storm this very Capitol, Mr. Schiff stood up again on  the January 6th Committee to expose the former President's grotesque  role.    Mr. Speaker, I don't know why my colleagues  are so intimidated here, but I think it reveals their weakness.   They are intimidated by a bully, and this censure attempt reveals  they are also intimidated by a patriot and the truth. Lucky us to serve  with Adam Schiff.
