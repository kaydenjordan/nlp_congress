 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and congratulate  the men and women of Naval Air Station Corpus Christi for taking first  place in the U.S. Navy's Installation Excellence Award.   Awarded by the Commander of Naval Installations Command, this  achievement rightfully recognizes Naval Air Station Corpus Christi for  superior performance, installation management, program excellence, and  community outreach.   This honor is a true testament to the hard work and devotion to  mission success that is put forth daily by so many.   Residing along the Corpus Christi Bay, Naval Air Station Corpus  Christi has been home to naval pilot training since 1941. Along with  producing the finest naval aviators in the world, Naval Air Station  Corpus Christi serves as a major hub or naval activity in south Texas.   From the newest graduates arriving from recruit training to the  installation's commander, Christopher Jason, I have witnessed  professionalism and dedication of the individuals who have earned this  distinction.   I thank everyone stationed at NAS Corpus Christi for their service  and extend my congratulations to NAS Corpus Christi on this  achievement.   I wish Captain Jason the best as he represents the U.S. Navy in  competition for the 2022 Commander in Chiefs Award for Installation  Excellence, and I look forward to the NAS Corpus Christi's continued  excellence and achievement, and couldn't be prouder  [[Page H4866]]  to represent this installation, servicemembers, and community.                 Honoring Rockport Mayor Patrick ``Pat'' Rios     Mr. Speaker, today I rise to honor a pillar of our  community, Mayor Patrick ``Pat'' Rios of Rockport, Texas. Pat has led  the city of Rockport as the mayor for the past 4 years and his term  ends this month.   This position was the culmination of his decade-long elected public  service, where he previously served as Ward 3 council member and mayor  pro tem from 2012 to 2018. Before public service, Pat was an  entrepreneur and small business owner. He eventually entered the  healthcare industry and rose to senior levels before his retirement in  2010.   Anyone who has met him knows Pat is a fierce advocate for the city of  Rockport. This was evident from the moment he took the helm in his role  as mayor; a moment that was characterized by Hurricane Harvey's havoc  and devastation in 2017.   The hurricane made landfall along the Charm of the Texas Coast. Under  Pat's leadership, the city that was first hit aggressively moved  forward with the ``first to recover'' mantra that speaks to the heart  of the resolute Texas spirit.   Due to Pat, the city has made remarkable progress in rebuilding and  is poised to be stronger than ever. Pat is a shining example of  community leadership and stewardship. I have greatly enjoyed working  with him, especially in this recovery effort during his tenure as  mayor, and I wish him and his wife, Patricia Ann, and his entire family  the best during his well-deserved retirement from public service.          Honoring World War II and Korean War Veteran Luis A. Valls     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Luis Angel  Valls of Corpus Christi, Texas. Born in 1928 in Sinton, Texas, and  raised in Alice, Luis answered the Nation's call by enlisting in the  United States Navy during World War II.   At the age of 17, he was sent to service in the Pacific Theater. With  the onset of the Korean war, Luis' overwhelming sense of duty and  selfless service saw him answering the Nation's call once more. He  served in the Navy until he was honorably discharged in 1954.   After his Navy service, Luis relocated to Corpus Christi, Texas, and  joined the Corpus Christi Fire Department where he served for 29 years,  being one of the first Mexican Americans to join CCFD.   During his time with the fire department, he was recognized twice for  valor and has the distinction of making the first ambulance call for  the CCFD's newly formed EMT ambulance program.   Luis married the love of his life, Olga Pena, in 1958 in Alice.  Together they had four sons and were happily married for 64 years.   Luis was a proud member of the Veterans of Foreign Wars, the Disabled  American Veterans, and the Pan-American Golf Association. He was a  loyal parishioner of Our Lady of Perpetual Help Catholic Church in  Corpus Christi for over 60 years.   Luis was an avid golfer, deer hunter, and voracious reader of  history, including military, Western and Texas history.   As a proud father and grandfather, his greatest joy during retirement  was spending time with his family. Our Nation is indebted to Mr. Valls.  I ask that you please join me in honoring and remembering his  magnificent life.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
