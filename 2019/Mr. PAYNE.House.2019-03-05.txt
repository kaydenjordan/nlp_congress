 Madam Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the launch of a  wonderful new group in my district, the Multiple Sclerosis Support  Group of Hudson County.   Multiple sclerosis is a progressive immune disorder. For people with  MS, the internal systems designed to keep their bodies healthy wind up  attacking other parts of their body. Their immune system eats away at  the protective covering of their nerves.   Severe cases of MS result in paralysis, vision loss, and diminished  brain function. Nearly a million people in the United States are living  with multiple sclerosis.   The MS Support Group of Hudson County aims to bring people together  to help support, encourage, and uplift people who are diagnosed with  MS, as well as their caregivers, friends, and families.   I am proud of my constituents' work on behalf of the people in their  community. Groups like this serve an important role in society, and I  am honored by their commitment to helping one another.                            ____________________
