 Madam Speaker, I am proud to cosponsor an  amendment to H.R. 1187, a bill that would increase transparency of  publicly traded companies to disclose workplace harassment cases, and I  am pleased to see this amendment passed in the House yesterday.   Workplace harassment is far too common, and the shareholders and  customers of a company should know whether that company fosters a  healthy work culture and that it allows its workers to thrive.   Up to six in seven women in the workplace report having experienced  sexual harassment. Seven of 10 people of color report experiencing some  form of verbal, racial, or ethnic harassment, and those who speak out  usually face retaliation. This amendment would bring to light these  forms of mistreatment and incentivize companies to prevent harassment  in the workplace.   I thank Ms. Frankel for her leadership on H.R. 1187, and I encourage  my colleagues to support this workplace improvement bill, as well as  improving the quality of life.                            ____________________
