 Mr. President, as we continue to debate H.J. Res. 44, a  resolution of disproval to nullify the BLM planning 2.0 rule, I would  like to bring to the attention of my colleagues an editorial published  last week in the Grand Junction Daily Sentinel. It outlines many of the  reasons we should oppose the repeal of the BLM planning 2.0 rule.   I ask unanimous consent that the article be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                  [From The Daily Sentinel, Mar. 1, 2017]                              Aligning Values         Colorado's biggest political guns are marching to the beat       of the same drum, proclaiming the Centennial State is the       perfect new location for the massive Outdoor Retailer Show       which is leaving Salt Lake City over the extreme stance       Utah's political leaders have taken on public lands.        Democratic Gov. John Hickenlooper and U.S. Sens. Cory       Gardner, a Republican, and Democrat Michael Bennet sent a       joint letter Monday to the Outdoor Retailer Show hailing       Colorado's bipartisan commitment to maintaining and       protecting public lands.        Considering that Utah is ground-zero for a movement to       transfer management of public lands from the federal       government to the states, it's not hard for Colorado to claim       that its values are more closely aligned with the outdoor       industry, which relies on public lands for its livelihood.        Colorado could enhance that claim if Gardner and Bennet       refuse to overturn the first major revision of the Bureau of       Land Management's land-use planning process in three decades.        Congress is seeking to overturn BLM's Planning 2.0       initiative under the Congressional Review Act. The House has       already voted to eliminate the rule. If the Senate follows       suit, it will undo an effort to increase public involvement,       improve transparency and promote science-based decision-      making in public-lands planning.        Planning 2.0 is not without its critics. The Western       Governors' Association has asked Congress in a Feb. 10 letter       to ``direct the BLM to re-examine the final Planning 2.0       rule. Any revisions . . . should be crafted collaboratively       with western states.''        But there can be no revisions if the rule is repealed under       the CRA, which is a ``nuclear bomb'' of a legislative tool.       The CRA would not only overturn the rule, but block future       rulemakings that are ``substantially the same'' without prior       approval from Congress.        That means the BLM would be stuck with an antiquated       planning process, hobbling the agency in a way that       reinforces all the negative perceptions that already exist       regarding the way it manages public lands.        Sportsmen's groups, the Pew Charitable Trusts, conservation       groups and the Outdoor Industry Association all support       Planning 2.0. The WGA wants to keep it alive to improve it.        Public lands are the backbone of the outdoor industry,       which contributes $646 billion to the economy annually.        Gardner sponsored the Outdoor Recreation and Jobs Economic       Impact Act, which was signed into law by the president last       year. It requires the Bureau of Economic Analysis to       calculate the economic impact of the outdoor recreation       industry and requires the Commerce Department to provide       Congress with a full evaluation of the outdoor recreation       industry.        He obviously recognizes the importance of the outdoor       recreation industry as a jobs creator and an economic engine.       He should also understand that the industry equates killing       the rule with hampering growth.        The Senate vote may have not any bearing on whether the       Outdoor Retailer Show relocates to Colorado. But supporting       2.0 is a show of good faith that our senators get what's at       stake.    Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. President, I oppose today's resolution to  overturn the Bureau of Land Management planning 2.0 rule.   The Bureau of Land Management is charged with ensuring responsible  use of public lands, which requires extensive land use planning to  balance priorities like recreation, conservation, and energy  development. Planning 2.0 simply updates outdated planning processes  that date back 30 years to provide greater community input and  transparency. This is intended to create plans that work better for all  users, including local communities. It is also meant to reduce the time  it takes to complete the planning process.   Under the new rule, the public is involved in the planning process  early to avoid costly and time-consuming disputes later. The rule  allows for the use of current technology like geospatial data to allow  for more science-based decisionmaking.   Developing planning 2.0 took 2 years and included consideration of  more than 6,000 public comments. With today's resolution, we would  abandon modernization that makes it easier for the public and State and  local governments to be involved in the Federal planning process and  revert to rules that were written in 1983.   A wide range of sportsmen groups, including the Izaak Walton League  of America, the Theodore Roosevelt Conservation Partnership, and Trout  Unlimited have asked us to preserve Planning 2.0. They write:  ``Stakeholders  [[Page S1621]]  from across the multiple-use spectrum agreed that the previous BLM  planning process could be improved. Under the outdated process,  opportunities for public involvement were too few, and the public  didn't learn about agency plans until they were already proposed.''   If we pass this resolution today, BLM will have to go back to that  outdated process and would be prohibited from proposing a rule that is  substantially similar to planning 2.0. I urge my colleagues to vote  against this resolution.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.                                  TrumpCare
