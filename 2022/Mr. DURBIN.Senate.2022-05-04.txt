 Mr. President, last week, my staff found a photo from a  congressional trip I made to Eastern Europe in 1991. In one of the  photos, I was standing in front of a wall. There is a message on the  wall painted in big letters. It reads: ``Freedom for Baltic  Countries.''   I remember that trip. The trip had special resonance for me and my  family. Eight decades earlier, my mother--only 2 years old--she and her  family fled one of those Baltic nations--Lithuania--to escape the  tyranny of czarist Russia, and they found freedom in America.   Here I was--her son--returning to the Baltics in a remarkable moment  in history. You see, 2 years earlier, in August 1989, 2 million  people--I will show you the photo of this because it is historic--2  million people in the Baltic States of Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia  joined hands to form a 373-mile-long Baltic chain of freedom. This  human chain spanned the three nations and sent a clear message that the  Baltic nations wanted to reclaim their  [[Page S2306]]  freedom and their independence from the brutal occupation first by  czarist Russia, then by Nazi Germany, and finally by the Soviet Union.   Months before the fall of the Berlin Wall, the Baltic chain of  freedom forecast the end of the Soviet Union. But who were these  countries to defy the Soviet Union? Countries with barely 3 million  population in Lithuania, 2 million in Latvia, and 1\1/2\ million in  Estonia were setting out to defy the superpower of the Soviet Union.   In February 1990, the people of Lithuania had chosen a new Parliament  in their first free election. The new Parliament voted to restore their  independence and made Lithuania the first Soviet Republic to declare  independence. They were followed quickly by their neighbors, Latvia and  Estonia.   You could feel at that moment when I visited the Seimas, which is the  Parliament of Lithuania, the hope and history in the air, but there was  also a feeling of trepidation and uncertainty. Would these small new  democracies be able to preserve their freedom?    In January 1991, the blowback that many had feared occurred. Soviet  tanks rolled into Lithuania's capital city of Vilnius. They attacked a  crowd of protesters who were armed mainly with prayers and a few old  hunting rifles, killing 13 innocent protesters and injuring hundreds  more. Soviet troops and tanks attacked protesters in Latvia. I remember  visiting Riga and seeing flowers and the candles on one of the walkways  near downtown where a Latvian lost his life standing up for freedom in  their country.   The Soviet troops could not break the determination of the Baltic  people.   In February and March of 1991, the people of these three countries  voted overwhelmingly in support of restoring independence. The United  States recognized the sovereign new democracies later that same year.   Today, these three countries are prosperous, vibrant democracies,  proud members of the European Union and NATO, and supporters of their  Ukrainian neighbors who are facing Putin's monstrous military wrath.   When I visited Vilnius in January of 1991--a month before Gorbachev  attacked with his tanks--I stood with the brave soldiers and ordinary  citizens who filled the square outside the Parliament. They showed me  their little arsenal of weapons. They took me back very quietly and  secretly. It consisted of about 20 old hunting rifles. They were going  to take on the Soviets. The situation seemed desperate and even doomed.  Yet Baltic freedom prevailed.   I think of those days often now.   When Russia launched its unprovoked, unconscionable war, we were told  Kyiv and the Ukrainian Government would fall within weeks or even days.  Our military experts gave us their opinion, and that is what they said.  Two months later, thank God, Kyiv is still free. Volodymyr Zelenskyy is  still Ukraine's President. May God protect him.   Russia has suffered devastating losses on the battlefield and has  been forced to retreat. Its forces are demoralized and in disarray.  Russia's economy is faltering under the weight of the most punishing  sanctions imposed against any nation in modern history.   Just as in the Baltics three decades ago, Russian strongmen have  failed to understand the desire of people--even when they are  outnumbered, if they are determined to be free and choose their own  leaders, they will not be stopped. The Russians have failed to  understand the determination of a community of democracy to stand  together behind them and defeat the brutality and aggression of  Vladimir Putin.   Putin may be able to deceive the people living in Russia for now, but  he cannot lie to the world. We know that the Russian military has  caused horrible devastation. We see it on the news. And they have  committed horrific war crimes against innocent Ukrainian people. One  need only look to the barbaric executions and brutality Russia has  inflicted on the Kyiv suburb of Bucha. After the Russians fled, Bucha's  mayor, Anatolii Fedoruk, described the immediate scenes:         Corpses of executed people still line the Yabluska street       in Bucha. Their hands are tied behind their backs with white       ``civilian'' rags, they were shot in the back of their heads.    Putin had the sickening audacity to honor the military unit  responsible for these crimes, saying this unit had distinguished itself  in the protection of the fatherland.   Russian war crimes have not been limited to this situation.  Throughout Ukraine, investigators are reporting that Russian soldiers  are using rape as a weapon of war and deliberately shelling schools,  hospitals, apartment buildings, emergency food centers, and other  civilian targets. There are reports of summary executions of  individuals and murders of children.   I agree with President Zelenskyy. In his words, he said it is ``time  to do everything possible to make the war crimes of the Russian  military the last manifestation of such evil on earth.''   The world can't tolerate this barbarity, and the United States must  never ever provide a safe haven for anyone who commits war crimes of  this nature or crimes against humanity in Ukraine or anywhere in the  world. For that reason, I am introducing legislation that gives our  government the authority to prosecute non-U.S. citizens who commit such  atrocities in other nations and then seek haven, refuge, or seclusion  in our country.   My bill is called the War Crimes Accountability Act. It closes a  loophole in our current law that prevents our government from  prosecuting war crimes unless they are actually committed in the United  States or by or against U.S. citizens or members of our Armed Forces.   My bill would also make crimes against humanity a crime under U.S.  law so that such perpetrators cannot find--ever--safe haven in this  country. What would this mean in practice? If a Russian soldier  committed war crimes such as those we see here or crimes against  humanity in Ukraine or a person commits such atrocities anywhere in the  world--say in Myanmar or in China--they can be tried under U.S. law and  face criminal, civil, and immigration consequences. It builds on  previous laws I sponsored to make people who commit acts of genocide or  who use child soldiers in war accountable under U.S. law. Those bills  passed the Senate unanimously and were both signed into law by  President George W. Bush.   Despite the heroic efforts of the Ukrainian people, Russian forces  continue to lay siege to the eastern part of that country, bombing  civilians and forcing an even greater humanitarian nightmare.   Last week, U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres traveled to Kyiv.  He witnessed the destruction wrought by Russia, and he said:         When I see those destroyed buildings, I must say what I       feel. I imagined my family in one of those houses that is now       destroyed. . . . I see my granddaughters running away in       panic, part of the family eventually killed.    He went on to say:         The war is an absurdity of the 21st century. The war is       evil.    So when President Biden announced a substantial new aid package for  Ukraine, I said immediately: Count me in. The other day at the Senate  Appropriations Committee on Defense, I asked Defense Secretary Austin  and General Milley, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, about Ukraine's  defense capabilities and the President's new request for aid. Both of  these military leaders emphasized that continued, substantial support  from the United States and its allies will be critical not only for  Ukraine's future but also to reassure our allies in the region, in the  Baltics, Moldova, Poland.   The $33 billion that Biden has asked for aid in Ukraine will help  them withstand the next brutal phase of war and prevent Putin from  spreading this malevolent war into other nations.   Let me conclude with a story about another brave soldier in the ranks  of civilians, standing up to Putin's menace. Her name is Sviatlana  Tsikhanouskaya. She is a leader of the democratic opposition in  Belarus, another former Soviet Republic bordering the Baltics and  Poland.   Last week, Ms. Tsikhanouskaya was in Washington to meet with the  leaders of our government. Senator Shaheen hosted a meeting with her.  Had Putin's puppets in Belarus not rigged the last election, she might  have been elected President--almost certainly would have been. This  photo shows Belarusians protesting that rigged election, risking their  lives to do it, I might add. For months, thousands of Belarusians  protested. Many were arrested and sentenced to long prison  [[Page S2307]]  sentences. I had been there before. The last dictator in continental  Europe is a man named Lukashenka. He has phony elections from time to  time. Anyone with the audacity to run against him is sure to lose by  Lukashenka's count and almost certainly to be imprisoned immediately.   He did that to this lady's--Ms. Tsikhanouskaya's--husband who is now  in jail in Minsk. This photo shows Belarusians with the courage to  protest that rigged election. For months, thousands have protested;  many have been arrested and sentenced. Today, Vladimir Putin is using  Belarus as a staging ground for Russia's assault on Ukraine, but the  Belarusian people have not given up their determination for freedom  either. Hundreds of Belarusians, maybe more, are fighting in Ukraine  today, and we thank them for that courage. Others have helped to blunt  Putin's assault by sabotaging Belarusian train lines and crippling  Russian supply lines. The supplemental aid package that President Biden  has requested for Ukraine, for the weapons to repel Russia's war of  conquest and to give the people of Belarus, the Baltics, Moldova,  Poland, the security they need to realize their dreams of freedom,  dignity, and independence is a statement of the values of America.   I urge my colleagues to come together, waste no time, pass it  quickly, send the Ukrainians what they need to win this war.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    I announce that the Senator from Colorado (Mr. Bennet)  and the Senator from Minnesota (Ms. Klobuchar) are necessarily absent.

His  mission was to put Quincy and Western Illinois on the map. The only  sure way to do that was to personally redraw the maps. So he did.   In the late 1950s, there was not a four-lane highway anywhere within  100 miles of Quincy, IL. Critics called the region: ``Forgottonia.''  Thomas Oakley had more than a good memory. He had a vision, and Western  Illinois was not about to be forgotten.   Any political candidate who paid a visit to Tom's Herald-Whig  editorial board knew what to expect. No complimentary coffee or cool  glass of water until Tom asked the question. With a dead serious look  and his deep bass voice, he skipped the pleasantries.   ``What's your position on completing the four-lane Central Illinois  Expressway all the way to Quincy?''   ``I am for it,'' I quickly answered as a congressional candidate in  1982.   Tom smiled and asked how I liked my coffee. It was the beginning of a  beautiful friendship.   For decades, Quincy and the Tri-States had no greater advocate than  Tom. His indefatigable voice for the region rightfully earned him the  honor of having a 60-mile stretch of the Chicago to Kansas Expressway  highway named after him. From Quincy to Macomb, it is the Thomas A.  Oakley Highway now. He also helped grow his family's media company  Quincy Media, Inc., into the 13th largest media company in the country.  Last month, Tom passed away, and today, we honor the memory and legacy  of my friend.   Tom was a member of the fourth generation of his family to work for  Quincy Media, which operates the Quincy Herald-Whig, the Hannibal  Courier-Post, and WGEM television and radio. Quincy Media has  properties in several other markets as well. He was born to Thomas C.  and Mary Oakley on June 24, 1932. As a young person, he began his  career as a carrier boy for the Quincy Herald-Whig. In summers, he  worked for Quincy Broadcasting and the Quincy Herald-Whig.   After graduating from Quincy High School in 1950, Tom earned a  bachelor's degree in economics from Duke University and joined the U.S.  Air Force in 1954. He served for 3 years, 2 of them flying a B-47  bomber with the Strategic Air Command. Tom was honorably discharged  with the rank of first lieutenant in 1957 and was a captain in the  Inactive Reserves. In 1958, he returned to Quincy and the family  business.   Tom became the president and CEO of Quincy Media in 1969, following  the death of his father. Under his leadership, he led the company  through decades of growth, adding television stations in several  markets and one additional newspaper. Tom also championed efforts to  improve the Quincy infrastructure. He used his personal leadership and  expanding media outlets to promote improving the quality of life in the  region.   For more than 60 years, Tom worked toward developing a highway for  the Tri-States, which had been bypassed by the Eisenhower era  infrastructure boom. He was on an untold amount of committees  throughout his life. Tom helped found the Joint Industrial Development  Commission, the first unified effort to build the economy of the Tri- State region. This was a predecessor of the Great River Economic  Development Foundation, which remains a driving force to improve Quincy  and Adams County.   Tom made things happen. Every Governor since Otto Kerner, who was  elected in 1960, heard about the Western Illinois highway needs from  Tom. He was instrumental in securing funds to complete the Central  Illinois Expressway from Springfield to the Mississippi River at  Hannibal, the Chicago to Kansas Expressway, and the Avenue of the  Saints from St. Louis to Minneapolis. There is now a four-lane bridge  over the Mississippi River at Hannibal, too. He threw his weight behind  projects to  [[Page S2327]]  improve Amtrak, Baldwin Field, locks and dams, and a port district. Tom  worked with elected officials at every level of government, regardless  of party, so Illinois and the surrounding States' residents could have  a better life.   For his work in media and improving the region, Tom received numerous  awards. From the Quincy Chamber of Commerce Hall of Fame to being the  first recipient of the annual Boy Scout community service award, he was  a deeply honored person. In 2020, he was inducted into the Gold Circle  by the Mid-America Chapter of the National Academy of Television Arts  and Sciences, one of television's highest honors.   Tom also was generous financially. The Oakley family made the single  largest philanthropic investment in the history of Quincy University,  focusing on scholarships, academic facility improvements, and support  programs. Earlier this year, Tom announced a $1 million gift to Culver- Stockton College to establish the Tri-State Development Summit at the  school.   Tom inspired a legacy that will continue and channel regional  cooperation. He was fiercely loyal to both his family and his  community, and I am fortunate to call him a friend. We will miss his  leadership. His life was a life well-lived. Tom is survived by his son  Ralph, his daughter Mary, his many grandchildren, and great- grandchildren. Tom, like his beloved Western Illinois, will not be  forgotten.
