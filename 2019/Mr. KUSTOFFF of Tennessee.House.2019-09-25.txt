 Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the ranking  member for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to H.R. 1595, the SAFE  Banking Act. I do want to say, I appreciate the debate that we have had  in our Financial Services Committee, but I think that we need to have  the same debate in the Judiciary Committee.   We all know that over the last several years, States across the  country have passed various laws to legalize marijuana for both  recreational and medical purposes. That flawed approach has created a  patchwork of State laws and regulations that have allowed for the  spread of marijuana use across the U.S.   Proponents of this bill claim that it will provide consistent  guidelines for marijuana companies to do business across our national  finance system. However, my concern is that the legalization will only  provide safe harbor while legitimizing and encouraging more widespread  use of this currently illegal drug.   The reality today is that we are voting to nationally legalize  marijuana throughout our banking system rather than taking the correct  approach, which I believe is to take a vote to legalize what is  currently an illegal substance.   I would ask my colleagues who support this bill to think long and  hard about what you are actually voting on today, because the  consequences will be far-reaching beyond the intent of this bill.
