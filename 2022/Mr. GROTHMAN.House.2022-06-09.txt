 Madam Speaker, America has been through a tough time  the last few weeks due to serious incidents that happened in Buffalo  and in Texas. But last week, I was down at the Mexican border, and I  talked to some Border Patrol guys, who, because we were Congressmen,  brought up what happens when we make it as difficult as possible for  law-abiding people to own guns.   Right now, if you compare Mexico and the United States, Mexico has-- per capita--about five times as many murders as they do in the U.S. Not  5 percent more, not 50 percent more, five times as many. I am sure the  Mexican elected officials who passed those laws making it so difficult  to get a gun thought they were going to have a peaceful paradise down  there.   Right now, many people are running all over each other to say: Let's  pass law. Let's pass this law. Let's take a look and see what happened  in Mexico and whether the sole answer is more laws.   Meanwhile, I have a bill making it more difficult to bring guns into  schools, and right now, that bill is not moving. I think that would  have a good impact.                            ____________________
