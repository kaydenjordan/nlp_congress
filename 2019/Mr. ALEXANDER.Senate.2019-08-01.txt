 Mr. President, as a fellow Commodore and former  Vanderbilt athlete, I would like to congratulate the Vanderbilt  University baseball team on winning the 2019 National Collegiate  Athletic Association Men's College World Series, the second  championship title for the baseball program and the fifth national  championship in Commodore athletic history.   Tim Corbin, in his 17th season as head baseball coach, has built a  program that not only contends each year for college baseball's top  prize, but has developed a culture of excellence among his athletes,  both on the field and off. En route to their second national title,  Coach Corbin's team, also referred to as the Vandy Boys, broke the  Southeastern Conference record with 59 total victories, while also  winning both the regular season and tournament titles. Without  Vanderbilt's seven-member senior class, the Commodores' success could  not have been possible. These seniors provided leadership and stability  to a program that had a target on its back throughout the season.   This achievement is due to the hard work, talent, and teamwork of the  following outstanding student-athletes: Harrison Ray, Cooper Davis,  Philip Clarke, Tate Kolywck, Isaiah Thomas, Ethan Paul, Matt Hogan,  Dominic Keegan, Kiambu Fentress, Austin Martin, Walker Grisanti, Pat  DeMarco, Stephen Scott, Ty Duvall, Tyler Brown, Julian Infante, Ethan  Smith, Patrick Raby, Sterling Hayes, Hugh Fisher, Erik Kaiser, Zach  King, Jackson Gillis, John Malcom, Jake Eder, Justyn-Henry Malloy,  Austin Becker, Mason Hickman, Chance Huff, AJ Franklin, JJ Bleday, Joe  Gobillot, Drake Fellows, Kumar Rocker, and Jayson Gonzalez.   These student-athletes were coached and mentored by a dedicated team  of coaches and athletic department staff, including: Head Coach Tim  Corbin, Associate Head Coach Scott Brown, Assistant Coach Mike Baxter,  Volunteer Coach David Macias, Athletic Trainer Tracy Campbell, Strength  and Conditioning Coach Chris Ham, Director of Baseball Operations  Brooks Webb, Director of Player Development Brandon Barak, Video  Coordinator Josh Ruchotzke, Equipment Manager Kevin Collins, and  Student Managers Jack Goodrum, Chase Casali, Jackson Kelley, and Ethan  Stem.   I would also like to acknowledge Chancellor Nicholas S. Zeppos, Vice  Chancellor for Athletics and University Affairs and Athletics Director  Malcolm Turner, Deputy Athletics Director Candice Storey Lee, and  Associate Athletic Director Phillip Brown for their leadership.   Anchor Down, Commodores. We are proud of you.                            ____________________
