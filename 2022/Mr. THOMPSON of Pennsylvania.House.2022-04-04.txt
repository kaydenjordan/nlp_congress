 Madam Speaker, I rise today to announce  we are one step closer to reducing poverty across the Nation.   In March, the House Committee on Education and Labor passed H.R.  5129, the Community Services Block Grant Modernization Act, on a  bipartisan vote.   I was proud to introduce this bill with the gentlewoman from Oregon  (Ms. Bonamici). The bill would fund the community action agencies that  help address the root causes of poverty in our communities.   These agencies are largely comprised of business and industry  leaders. They provide a safety net for low-income families and  individuals, but even more importantly, they help create opportunities  for people to move from poverty to independence.   Despite the good these agencies do for our communities, the Community  Services Block Grant program has not been reauthorized for 25 years. My  bill will modernize CSBG to provide agencies the ability to tap their  full potential.   Madam Speaker, this program has a long history of bipartisan support  due to the great work it enables. It is my hope that this righteous  bill is brought to the floor in a timely manner.   It is time for Congress to renew our Nation's commitment and further  reduce poverty by reauthorizing CSBG.                            ____________________
