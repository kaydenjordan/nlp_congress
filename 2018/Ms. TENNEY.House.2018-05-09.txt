 Mr. Speaker, this week is Teacher Appreciation Week.   Teachers inspire millions every day by instilling knowledge, evoking  creativity, and motivating students of all ages in the quest for  lifelong learning.   Those who have answered this special call to serve in this wonderful  profession are among the hardest working and most innovative in our  communities. Teachers are special people who lay the foundation for  developing critical thinking skills in our children that will serve  them throughout their lifetime.   Many of us remember well the teachers who made a big difference in  our lives and even encouraged us to take our chosen career path.   I am forever grateful to the teachers who have changed my life, from  my kindergarten teacher, Mrs. LePage, to my third grade teacher, Mrs.  Huerling. These people have inspired me every day as I think about  those wonderful days in elementary school.   Interesting, my son is also a graduate of the same high school and  elementary and junior high as I, the New Hartford High School, and  graduated some 30 years after I did.   During this week, let's take time to remember teachers and their  selfless work and dedication. Mr. Speaker, please join me in  recognizing and honoring the thousands of teachers across the 22nd  District and the Nation for their love and dedication to this noble  profession and this calling that will never be forgotten.                            ____________________
