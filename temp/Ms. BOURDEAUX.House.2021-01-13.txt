 Madam Speaker, I teach a civics class where I point  out that our democracy is not self-executing. It requires people of  good faith and ethics to make it work.   The President has repeatedly challenged Georgia's election results.  But, despite three recounts and many investigations, the results are  clear: Joe Biden won Georgia.   The idea that our election was fraudulent is a lie. Our President  used this lie to incite a violent mob to attack the Capitol.   I ask my colleagues to act with ethics and good faith, to reject  these lies,  [[Page H174]]  and, in this case, to support the Article of Impeachment.
