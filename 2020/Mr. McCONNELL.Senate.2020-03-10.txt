 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  order for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, yesterday evening, the President, the  Vice President, and their task force offered an extensive public  briefing on ongoing efforts to combat this new virus, which has spread  from China throughout the world.   As the Director of the CDC explained, officials are now tracking more  than 500 cases across our country. Nationwide, the risk to any  individual American remains low, but as the Vice President and the  experts reminded us, the time is now for all Americans to engage in  basic commonsense measures and for Americans at heightened risk to take  additional precautions. Detailed recommendations for individuals,  families, and employers are available online at coronavirus.gov.   President Trump also announced that in parallel with the public  health response, his administration is considering ways to mitigate the  impact of the virus on our economy. Senate Republicans look forward to  discussing this with Secretary Mnuchin and the President's team so we  can all consider the best ways to move forward for the American people.  As our government continues to prepare and protect our Nation, I would  urge all of my colleagues, on both sides of the aisle in both Chambers,  to put reflexive partisanship aside and stay focused on our common work  to promote the common good. This virus does not care--does not care-- about partisan divisions.   This disease poses a challenge, no question, but our Nation is  strong, we are well equipped, and we have overcome far, far greater  challenges before. As the Vice President put it yesterday, ``We're all  in this together.''                            ____________________     Madam President, on another matter, this week, we have  the opportunity to pass major legislation to strengthen our domestic  energy. Chairman Murkowski, Senator Manchin, and the Energy and Natural  Resources Committee have assembled a strong, bipartisan bill. I look  forward to passing it.   I was disappointed yesterday when the Senate failed to advance the  legislation and clear a path toward completing the bill. The  committee's product includes about 50 different bills and contributions  from nearly three-fourths of the Members of this body, and contrary to  the Democratic leader's assertions on the floor, I am certainly not  blocking any bipartisan amendment. I have stated right here on the  floor that I hope and anticipate that we will vote on amendments this  week.   Don't be fooled by the finger-pointing. I am not standing in the way  of bipartisan amendments. What is really  [[Page S1642]]  happening is that the Democratic leader is moving the goalposts. There  had been a bipartisan understanding about how to finish this bill, but  yesterday the Democratic leader decided to change his tune and demand a  vote on something outside the scope of the current debate. I hope we  can get past this showmanship, finish this bipartisan legislation, and  send it to the House so we can get it on the President's desk. Let's  don't squander this real opportunity.   Chairman Murkowski's and Senator Manchin's compromise product will  help our Nation move toward greater energy security, energy efficiency,  and energy affordability for years to come--new support for energy  efficiency efforts, new incentives for innovation, new tools to secure  our electrical grid, and new ways to strengthen our domestic supply  chain for important minerals, and on and on and on.   This Chamber got it right last week when it proceeded to the bill by  a vote of 90 to 4. It hasn't suddenly become controversial overnight.  Everyone knows there are plenty of outside issues that Senators do not  agree on. We should let ourselves agree on what we do agree on. Let me  say that again: We should let ourselves agree on what we do agree on  and complete this legislation this week.   Let's keep legislating. Let's get this done. The American people  deserve it.                            ____________________     Madam President, now, on a final matter, this  afternoon all Senators will have the opportunity to attend a briefing  on election security from administration experts who tackle the issue  every day. The FBI Director; the Acting Secretary of Homeland Security;  General Nakasone of the NSA and Cyber Command; the Director of  Counterintelligence at the DNI; and a number of other senior leaders  will come here to the Capitol to discuss this critical subject.   I look forward to hearing more about the significant and strong steps  the Trump administration has taken over the past 3 years to secure our  democracy and punch back against the real and varied foreign efforts to  interfere. I look forward to hearing more about the unprecedented level  of coordination that has connected nonpartisan Federal experts in all  50 States, U.S. territories, thousands of local jurisdictions, and  private sector leaders to make sure the unpreparedness and inaction  that defined the Obama administration's failures in 2016 was not  repeated in 2018 and will not be repeated in 2020 or beyond.   I look forward to hearing about how the record sums of money,  hundreds of millions of dollars that Congress has put aside for direct  grants so States and local election officials can shore up their  systems, are making our democracy safer. I expect I will have more to  say following the briefing. I expect many of our colleagues will, but,  beforehand, I would like to say this: The American people have  confidence in our democracy, as they should. Just last month, a survey  found that more than 70 percent of Americans are confident their State  or local government will conduct a fair and accurate election this  November. Let me say this again. Just last month, a survey found that  more than 70 percent of Americans are confident their State or local  government will conduct a fair and accurate election this November, and  they should be confident about the resilience of our institutions.    Our Nation is strong. The Trump administration has made huge strides.  After 8 years of weakness, this administration's foreign policy has  made it clear to our adversaries that the United States of America is  not going to be pushed around, but the American people also know we  must remain vigilant. As long as Russia and other nations seek to  meddle, we need to be ready.   Election security is critically important to our Nation, and it can  only be handled right if it is handled with good faith and  bipartisanship.   When Washington Democrats use this particular topic as a platform for  demonizing the other side or for pushing tangential policy proposals,  which the left had sought many years--many years--before 2016, everyone  can see right through it. It only signals unseriousness.   So I encourage all my colleagues to attend the bipartisan briefing  today, and then let's preserve that bipartisan spirit and that unity.  Let's focus on fighting against foreign interference, not fighting each  other.   We should not just snap right back into tired, old partisanship. We  should not let Putin or anyone else bait Americans into talking down  our own democracy or sowing more fear and discord among ourselves than  other adversaries could ever hope to do themselves.                            ____________________     Madam President, I understand there is a bill at the  desk that is due for a second reading.    In order to place the bill on the calendar under the  provisions of rule XIV, I object to further proceeding.    I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  order for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I move to proceed to executive  session to consider Calendar No. 587.    Madam President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.    I ask unanimous consent that the mandatory quorum call  be waived.    Madam President, I move to proceed to legislative  session.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the Senate  stand in recess until 5 p.m.   Thereupon, the Senate, at 4:02 p.m., recessed until 5 p.m. and  reassembled when called to order by the Presiding Officer (Mr.  Cassidy).                            ____________________
