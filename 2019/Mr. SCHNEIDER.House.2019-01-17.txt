 Madam Speaker, pursuant to clause 1, rule I, I demand  a vote on agreeing to the Speaker's approval of the Journal.    Madam Speaker, I object to the vote on the ground that  a quorum is not present and make the point of order that a quorum is  not present.    Madam Speaker, I rise to implore the President to stop  holding Federal workers hostage and immediately end this shutdown.   I think every day of the TSA agent I recently spoke with at the  airport. She is now working without pay, a young single mother raising  her 15-year-old daughter. She told me she is really struggling to make  ends meet without her paycheck. Her story is not unique.   A constituent from Mundelein shared that she doesn't know how she  will pay her bills, including her mortgage, and has had to borrow money  from her family.   Another constituent, a Federal employee in Round Lake, has been  working without pay. He wrote: ``Why are we a bargaining tool for  something beyond our control?''   Why indeed, Mr. President?   We may disagree on the best way to secure our border, but we can all  agree that the good women and men working on our Nation's behalf should  be paid for their work--the TSA and FAA workers keeping our skies safe,  the FDA workers keeping our food safe, and the Coast Guard protecting  our borders.   Do the responsible thing: reopen our government, and then let's have  a robust, honest debate about how to secure our borders.                            ____________________
