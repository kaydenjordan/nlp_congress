 DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I rise to express my  strong support for the Build Back Better Act and commend all of those  who played a role in making it happen, especially Speaker Pelosi and  chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, Richard Neal, and all of the  members and staff on that committee.   Build Back Better seriously reduces longstanding poverty among  children. Which children? All children; poor children, Black children,  Brown children, White children, children of disadvantaged families. It  reduces poverty for 4 million children.   Build Back Better will provide pre-school programs for children of  working families across America. It even provides help for individuals  who have prison records so that they can get jobs and go to work.   It is good for America. It is good for every community in America.   Mr. Speaker, I strongly support it, and I urge its passing.    DAVIS of Illinois:        H. Res. 809.
