 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 6620,  the Protecting Critical Infrastructure Against Drones and Emerging  Threats Act.   This much needed measure would direct the Department of Homeland  Security to complete a vulnerability assessment of the threat posed by  Unmanned Air Systems (UAS) to our critical infrastructure assets.   The results of the assessment would be reported to Congress,  providing policymakers with much needed information to better protect  our critical infrastructure assets.   Unmanned Air Systems, or drones, hold great promise, and may one day  change the world as we know it.   As the technology develops however, there is always the risk that  malicious actors may seek to use it to cause harm or destruction.   Drones offer the ability for almost anyone to bypass most physical  security measures of our critical infrastructure facilities.   These facilities, such as nuclear power plants and oil refineries,  depend on physical security and access control to ensure that  operations are secured and remain operational.   Drones could potentially allow a malicious actor to bypass the  security of a facility, carry out an explosive or chemical attack, or  conduct surveillance of prohibited areas.   At a time when our critical infrastructure assets are under constant  attack, and have suffered serious breaches in recent years, we must  take action to ensure that the ability of our citizens and the ability  of federal agencies to carry out their duties are resilient.  [[Page H8752]]    As a long-time advocate of a government that works efficiently for  the people, it is clear that current security practices protecting our  critical infrastructure are neither sufficient nor consistent.   Without an honest effort to even get a obtain view of the security  risks facing critical infrastructure assets we will continue to be  increasingly vulnerable.   While conducting threat assessments like this will harden the  security posture of the federal government and our critical  infrastructure assets, we are still suffering from a shortage of  workers with the requisite skills to secure them.   To address this, I have introduced the Cyber Security Education and  Federal Workforce Enhancement Act (H.R. 1981), which would address our  cyber workforce shortage by establishing an Office of Cybersecurity  Education and Awareness within DHS which will focus on:   Recruiting information assurance, cybersecurity, and computer  security professionals;   Providing grants, training programs, and other support for  kindergarten through grade 12, secondary, and post-secondary computer  security education programs;   Supporting guest lecturer programs in which professional computer  security experts lecture computer science students at institutions of  higher education;   Identifying youth training programs for students to work in part-time  or summer positions at federal agencies; and   Developing programs to support underrepresented minorities in  computer security fields with programs at minority-serving  institutions, including Historically Black Colleges and Universities,  Hispanic-serving institutions, Native American colleges, Asian-American  institutions, and rural colleges and universities.   Mr. Speaker, government agencies and the owners of critical  infrastructure alike continue to struggle to identify the factors and  technologies that put them at risk.   In closing, Mr. Speaker, I urge all members to join me in voting to  pass H.R. 6620, the ``Protecting Critical Infrastructure Against Drones  and Emerging Threats Act''.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 2553, the  ``Know the Lowest Price Act of 2018.''   S. 2553 amends title XVIII of the Social Security Act to prohibit  health plans and pharmacy benefit managers from restricting pharmacies  from informing individuals regarding the prices for certain drugs and  biologicals.   A Prescription Drug Plan (PDP) sponsor and a Medicare Advantage (MA)  organization shall ensure that each prescription drug plan or Medicare  Advantage Prescription Drug (MA-PD) plan offered by the sponsor or  organization does not restrict a pharmacy that dispenses a prescription  drug or biological from informing, nor penalize such pharmacy for  informing, an enrollee in such plan of any differential between the  negotiated price of, or copayment or coinsurance for, the drug or  biological to the enrollee under the plan and a lower price the  individual would pay for the drug or biological if the enrollee  obtained the drug without using any health insurance coverage.   The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) calculated  that if generic substitution worked program-wide, then Part D could  potentially save $5.9 billion a year.   Using generic drugs instead of their brand-name equivalents could  have saved the Medicare Part D program approximately $3 billion in 2016  alone.   In 2016, beneficiaries paid $1.1 billion in out-of-pocket costs of  brand-name drugs, which was almost twice as much as out-of-pocket costs  for generics.   The high cost of prescriptions hits older Americans on fixed incomes  particularly hard, especially for medications designed to treat serious  or chronic conditions where the patient's cost-share can be expensive.   This bill prohibits these outrageous contract arrangements between  Medicare private plans, PBMs and pharmacies and help seniors save money  when they pick up their prescriptions.   Seniors should not have to choose between paying their bills and  taking their medication.   We should make it our mission to put medicine within reach of  patients.   I urge all of my colleagues to vote in favor of S. 2553.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 6368, the  ``Encouraging Small Business Innovators Act,'' which encourages R&D  small business set-asides, to incentivize Small Business Innovation  Research Program (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer Program  (STTR) participants to serve as mentors under the Small Business  Administration's mentor-protege program.   The SBIR program is a highly competitive program that encourages  domestic small businesses to engage in Federal Research/Research and  Development (R/R&D) that has the potential for commercialization.   Through a competitive awards-based program, SBIR enables small  businesses to explore their technological potential and provides the  incentive to profit from its commercialization.   By including qualified small businesses in the nation's R&D arena,  high-tech innovation is stimulated and the United States gains  entrepreneurial capacity as it meets its specific research and  development needs.   STTR is another program that expands funding opportunities in the  federal innovation research and development (R&D) arena.   Central to the STTR program is expansion of the public/private sector  partnerships to include the joint venture opportunities for small  businesses and nonprofit research institutions.   The unique feature of the STTR program is the requirement for the  small business to formally collaborate with a research institution in  Phase I and Phase II.   STTR's most important role is to bridge the gap between performance  of basic science and commercialization of resulting innovations.   As a member of Congress, I have worked to advance policies that  promote business opportunities and business growth because I believe  that this is at the heart of the American dream--small businesses are  the backbone of the American economy.   To this end, I have authored numerous Legislative proposals  empowering small businesses such as the American Rising Act and the  Transitioning Heroes Act, to name a few to provide opportunities for  small businesses.   I have also hosted events to create a platform for entrepreneurial  and small business participants to hear from experts in the industry  and to network with supplier outreach representatives from major  government agencies and corporations.   By finding the right mentors like SBIR and STTR, small business  owners and incubators can learn valuable tools to aid in leading small  businesses to success.   For these reasons, I urge my colleagues to stand with me in the  support of H.R. 6368.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 6382, the  ``Clarity on Small Business Participation in Category Management Act of  2018''.   H.R. 6382 amends the Small Business Act to require the Administrator  of the Small Business Administration to report certain information to  the Congress and to the President.   This bill directs the administrator of the Small Business  Administration to report to congress on: the total amount of spending  government wide in such designation; the number of small business  concerns awarded contracts and the dollar amount of contracts within  such category awarded to each of the following--   1. HUBZone small business concerns;   2. Small business concerns owned and controlled by women;   3. Small business concerns owned and controlled by service-disabled  veterans; and   4. Socially and economically disadvantaged small business concerns.   More than 99 percent of Houston's businesses are considered small.   In 2016, roughly seven businesses in the Houston District received a  loan averaging $500,000 each weekday.   Small businesses are the lifeblood of our economy in Houston and  across America.   Small business was key for the nation's recovery from the recession.   Between the middle of 2009 and the middle of 2013, 60 percent of the  jobs created were from small businesses.   I am committed to producing tangible results in suffering communities  through legislation that creates jobs, fosters minority business  opportunities, and builds a foundation for the future.   Studies have shown that supporting small businesses is good for the  American economy. For every $1 invested, small businesses will  contribute $7 to the economy.   Every American deserves the right to be gainfully employed or own a  successful business and I know we are all committed to that right and  will not rest until all Americans have access to economic opportunity.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 6758,  the ``Study of Underrepresented Classes Chasing Engineering and Science  Success Act of 2018.''   H.R. 6758, also known as the SUCCESS Act, provides recommendations to  promote the participation of women and minorities in entrepreneurship  and the patent system.   H.R. 6758 extends, by eight years, the Patent and Trademark Office's  authority to set its own fees.   As the legislation declares, it is the sense of Congress that the  United States has the responsibility to work with the private sector to  close the gap in the number of patents applied for and obtained by  women and minorities to harness the maximum innovative potential and  continue to promote United States leadership in the global economy.   H.R. 6758 requires the Director of the U.S. Patent and Trademark  Office, in consultation with the Small Business Administration to  conduct a study that identifies publicly available data on the number  of patents annually applied for and obtained by, and the benefits of  increasing the number of women and minority businesses owned by women  and minorities.   The study directed by this bill will guide the legislative  recommendations for how to promote the participation of women and  minorities in entrepreneurship activities and for how to increase the  number of women and minorities who apply for and obtain patents.   Additionally, H.R. 6758:   Requires the study conducted under section 3(a) to be submitted to  the Committees on the Judiciary and Small Business of the House of  Representatives and the Committees on the Judiciary and Small Business  and Entrepreneurship of the Senate within one year of the date of  enactment of the Act; and   Extends, for eight years, the authority for the U.S. Patent and  Trademark Office to set its own fees under Section 10(i)(2) of the  Leahy-Smith America Invents Act.   The Institute for Women's Policy Research reported that in 2016, less  than 20 percent of U.S. patents listed one or more women as inventors,  and under eight percent listed a woman as the primary inventor.   In 2017, the Equality of Opportunity Project found that white  children are three times more likely to become inventors than black  children, and that children from wealthy families are ten times more  likely to have filed for a patent than children from families below the  median income.   One study estimates that GDP per capita could rise up to 4.6 percent  with the inclusion of more women and African Americans in the initial  stages of the process of innovation.   These statistics prove that we need more activity and involvement  from a diverse pool of entrepreneurs and inventors.   I urge all Members to join me in voting in favor of H.R. 6758.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, let me say to the manager of this bill that I am  delighted to stand with him on this very important legislative  initiative. Having been in this body for a period of time, I am  reminded of the AMBER Alert. I was here when it was initiated and  passed by my friend Martin Frost, who was formerly in this body. And  then I believe a lot of work was done on the Silver Alert by our  colleague Maxine Waters. We all worked together, I remember, on  amendments in the House Judiciary Committee on these very issues.   So I rise in support of H.R. 5075, the Ashanti Alert Act of 2018. It  is a commonsense initiative to realize that whoever is missing, we need  to help find those individuals.  [[Page H8819]]    This bill seeks to establish a national communications network within  the Department of Justice to help locate missing adults by providing  assistance to regional and local search efforts.   For our colleagues, obviously, the AMBER Alert dealt with children,  and the Silver Alert dealt with senior citizens over, I believe, the  age of 65. This bill would initiate, facilitate, and promote Ashanti  Alert plans in coordination with States, units of local government, law  enforcement agencies, and other concerned entities with expertise in  providing services to adults. These are laudable goals and, as a  Congress, ones which we have a duty to facilitate.   As of December 31, 2017, the National Crime Information Center  database included records of 55,968 missing adults. In my own hometown,  in the last 3 weeks, two adults went missing who were brother and  sister. First, the brother went missing, and there was absolutely no  sign of that individual. The sister went to look for that individual,  and, of course, then they were both missing.   Tragically, we found, ultimately, that a relative had disposed of and  killed both of them. If we had an alert system, maybe we would have  been able to find them sooner.   In fact, many adults go missing each year who are not found until it  is too late. Such was the case after whom this bill was named, Ashanti  Billie.   At 19 years of age, she was abducted from her workplace in Virginia,  taken across State lines, and later found dead in North Carolina.  Ashanti Billie was too old for the issuance of an AMBER Alert on her  behalf and too young for a Silver Alert.   This bill fills in the gap for people like Ashanti Billie, missing  adults between the ages of 18 and 64, and it does so in coordination  with the Blue Alert communications network, which Congress established.  The Blue Alert establishes a nationwide network of Blue Alerts to warn  about threats to police officers and help track down the suspects who  carry them out.   While drawing on the Blue Alert Network, the Ashanti Alert Act  requires implementing jurisdictions to the established plans and  includes minimum standards and resources that help in this case. Had  these resources been available when Ashanti was abducted, she may still  be here with us today.   For these reasons, I support this legislation, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, could I inquire if the gentleman has  any further speakers.    Will the gentleman yield?    Mr. Speaker, I am concerned that H.R. 5075 does not  explicitly include Native American tribes in the missing adult  communications network that the bill would establish. It is my  understanding that this network would be established and implemented by  the same office at the Department of Justice that implements the Blue  Alert system, which includes outreach to tribal partners to educate  them on that network.   I would like to confirm with the chairman that it is the intent of  Congress that this same outreach to tribes be conducted with respect to  the missing adult communications network.    I thank the gentleman.   Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the remainder of my time.   Mr. Speaker, in closing, let me thank the proponent of this  legislation, Mr. Taylor, for a very thoughtful initiative, one that is  needed. It is tragic when we lose our constituents, but more  importantly, when the families lose their loved ones.   Mr. Speaker, I support this legislation. By coordinating with  existing  [[Page H8820]]  networks, H.R. 5075 will facilitate the establishment of a  communications network for alerts concerning missing adults and have an  impact far beyond what it will take to establish it.   I am heartened by Mr. Chabot's clarification that this bill is  intended to extend to tribal entities and Native American reservations.   This past May, we commemorated the second National Day of Awareness  for Missing and Murdered Native Women and Girls to bring awareness  about how this problem specifically affects Native American  communities. I am hopeful that this bill can help address this very  serious problem, and the overall bill that addresses the need for  families to find their loved ones after the ages of children and before  the ages of senior citizen. We can always do more to help local missing  adults and to save them. There are families in my district right now  who are suffering from the loss of their brother or sister.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5075, the ``Ashanti Alert Act  of 2018.''   This bill seeks to establish a national communications network within  the Department of Justice to help locate missing adults by providing  assistance to regional and local search efforts. The bill would  initiate, facilitate, and promote Ashanti Alert plans in coordination  with states, units of local government, law enforcement agencies, and  other concerned entities with expertise in providing services to  adults.   These are laudable goals and, as a Congress, ones which we have a  duty to facilitate. As of December 31, 2017, the National Crime  Information Center database included records of 55,968 missing adults.  In fact, many adults go missing each year who are not found--until it  is too late.   Such was the case of the young woman after whom this bill is named-- Ashanti Billie. At 19 years of age, she was abducted from her workplace  in Virginia, taken across state lines, and later found dead in North  Carolina. Ashanti Billie was too old for the issuance of an Amber Alert  on her behalf, and too young for a Silver Alert.   The Ashanti Alert Act seeks to fill in the gap for people like  Ashanti Billie--missing adults between the ages of 18 and 64. And it  does so in coordination with the Blue Alert Communications Network,  which Congress established in 2015, under the Blue Alert Act. The Blue  Alert Act established a nationwide network of ``blue alerts'' to warn  about threats to police officers and help track down the suspects who  carry them out.   While drawing on the Blue Alert network, the Ashanti Alert Act  requires implementing jurisdictions to establish plans that include  minimum standards to ensure that resources are used adequately,  accurately and efficiently. Had these resources been available when  Ashanti Billie was abducted, she may still be here today.   For all these reasons, I enthusiastically support this legislation  and encourage my colleagues to support it.    Mr. Speaker, I support this legislation. By coordinating with  existing networks, H.R. 5075 will facilitate the establishment of a  communications network for alerts concerning missing adults and have an  impact far beyond what it will take to establish it.   And I am heartened by Mr. Goodlatte's clarification that this bill is  intended to extend to tribal entities and Native American reservations.   This past May, we commemorated the second National Day of Awareness  for Missing and Murdered Native Women and Girls--to bring awareness  about how this problem specifically affects Native American  communities. I am hopeful that this bill can help address this very  serious problem.   We can always do more to help locate missing adults and to save  lives.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the Ashanti Alert Act of  2018, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to be on the floor with a fellow colleague  in the Judiciary Committee, and we have a similar passion for children  over the years.   I am pleased to be able to acknowledge the work that the Walsh  family, tragically, has had to do in honor of their son, Adam Walsh,  and their reauthorization act, which has had a major impact on child  violent crimes. So, in this set of bills is H.R. 1188, which I intend  to speak on as it relates to protecting our children, but also are  bills  [[Page H8842]]  H.R. 1761, H.R. 1842, and H.R. 1862, which we know would expand unjust  mandatory minimum sentences.                                time  1930    So the Adam Walsh Act established the Sex Offender Registration  Notification Act, often referred to as SORNA, as the national system  for the registration of sex offenders.   Everyone knows the tragic story of young Adam Walsh and the Walsh  family that has committed themselves to years of fighting against  violent sex offenders who have impacted our children. The Adam Walsh  Reauthorization Act, however, that is included in H.R. 6847, reflects  changes recommended to SORNA by the Judiciary Committee when it last  reauthorized the Adam Walsh Act in 2012 to improve the requirements for  States to register sex offenders. States that fail to substantially  implement SORNA are subject to a 10 percent reduction in Federal grants  under the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant.   Commendably, the reauthorization provisions that are included in this  overall omnibus bill will allow States discretion in determining  whether juvenile sex offender information will be publicly accessible  via the internet, a step forward as it relates to comprehensive  criminal justice reform addressing questions that recognize the  difference for juveniles, and it would reduce the time that certain but  not all juvenile sex offenders adjudicated as delinquent are required  to register from 25 years to 15 years.   I welcome these changes as steps in the right direction, which is  what happens when we work in a bipartisan manner, to address some of  the existing concerns with SORNA, which I supported as H.R. 1188 last  year.   Now, what has happened is that we have H.R. 6847 that incorporates a  number of other bills with problematic provisions that would add new  offenses to the criminal code requiring mandatory life imprisonment for  certain repeat sex offenders.   No one is coddling or condoning or supporting any of these heinous  acts or individuals. Under section 3559(e) of title 18 of the U.S.  Code, a defendant who has been previously convicted of a felony,  Federal or State, sex offense committed against a child and who is  guilty of a predicate Federal sex offense against a child must be  sentenced to life imprisonment.   H.R. 6847 would amend H.R. 3559 to add more Federal predicate  offenses on which to base imposition of a life sentence, namely, sexual  contact with a minor. Missing is the fact of not allowing judges to be  involved in the sentencing of these particular offenses.   This bill would also remove the requirement that a Federal predicate  offense relating to coercion or enticement of a minor be related to  prostitution. As a result, this bill would allow coercion or enticement  of a minor into any criminal sexual activity to serve as a basis for  imposition of a mandatory life sentence. Repeat offenders, of course,  would be subject to increased penalties, and, for some offenses, life  imprisonment is appropriate.   Again, however, it is taking away the discretion of the judge in the  review of these matters. Yet Congress should not mandate life  imprisonment as the only sentencing option.   Another set of problematic provisions within H.R. 6847,  unfortunately, results in the expanded imposition of mandatory minimum  sentencing, and so this leads many to be concerned and to be against.   In another addition to the Federal crimes of violence already  included in the statute providing penalties for failing to register as  a sex offender, H.R. 6847 would add State crimes of violence as  predicate offenses that, in turn, would require the imposition of a  mandatory 5-year sentence to be served consecutively to any sentence  imposed for failing to register or comply with sex offender  registration, again, taking away the discretion of the court.   The bill would also add prior military child sex offenses to several  recidivist sentencing provisions, most of which carry mandatory minimum  penalties of at least 15 years to life.   Lastly, the bill would amend section 2251 to create two new offenses  that prohibit causing the production of a visual depiction of a minor  engaged in sexually explicit conduct and the transmission or causing  the transmission of a live visual depiction of a minor engaged in  sexually explicit conduct, such as live-streaming.   In effect, these provisions would add a new class of offenders  subject to mandatory minimum sentencing, specifically 15 to 30 years in  prison. Yet this bill fails to provide any Romeo and Juliet exceptions.  Consequently, the penalties apply even when conduct is consensual and  when the victim and offender are close in age.   For example, if a 19-year-old and 17-year-old videoed themselves  engaged in a sexual act and email the video to their own email account,  the 19-year-old would be subject to mandatory minimums set by section  2251 as amended by this bill. That is why I offered an amendment when  this issue was last heard before our committee.   My amendment would have been the Romeo and Juliet, which would have  simply amended the provision that defines which juvenile adjudications  of delinquency qualify as offenses which trigger mandatory  registration.   As harsh as we need to be on these offenses, I am also concerned that  we look to the reform of the juvenile system and not criminalize acts  between juveniles. It would have added a new requirement that an  adjudication for an otherwise qualifying offense would trigger the  registration only if the judge presiding over the delinquency  proceedings finds that the registration is necessary to protect the  public safety based on a variety of factors.   We all have the same common goal, and that common goal is to protect  our children; but, unfortunately, there are children who are actors in  this, and we want to allow the judge to discern what harsh penalties  they should get. Frankly, my Romeo and Juliet amendment would have  responded to two kids doing what kids sometimes do. Unfortunately,  those provisions were not included.   For far too long, the Federal criminal justice system has relied on  an unsustainable system of mass incarceration that is largely driven by  inflexible mandatory minimum sentences. Mandatory minimums are not  necessary to impose appropriate sentences.    The judge at sentencing has all the information he or she needs to  impose a sentence commensurate with the crime committed and the  culpability of the offender. Therefore, I note the issues that we have  with a good bill and then the imposition of mandatory minimums.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. Scott), the ranking member of the Committee on Education  and the Workforce and former member of the House Judiciary Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, those who commit crimes against children--as I started  out, I have been engaged in the tragedy of Adam Walsh from almost the  very beginning and certainly support that legislation, but we realize  that we must be very vigilant as relates to our children. There is no  quarrel with that.   There is a question of mandatory minimums and the importance of  giving our courts that discretion. So those who commit crimes against  children deserve to be punished, and repeat offenders most certainly  deserve to face increased penalties.   Nevertheless, there is a mass of us who have seen the results of  mandatory minimums that result in mass incarceration. I oppose  mandatory minimum sentencing and, therefore, this legislation. I  believe that judges are best suited to determine just and appropriate  punishment in these matters. It would have been more appropriate to  separate out the Adam Walsh reauthorization legislation.   Even conservative groups agree that expanding the imposition of  mandatory minimum sentences is costly and unjust. Yet, without  mandatory minimum sentences, individuals convicted of serious offenses  would still receive appropriately lengthy sentences.   Mr. Speaker, let me say that again. Yet, without mandatory minimum  sentences, individuals convicted of serious offenses would still  receive appropriately lengthy sentences.   How can we underestimate the judgment of our Federal courts and  others who see these cases and know the dastardliness of them? We  should not create a one-size-fits-all policy approach.   For the foregoing reasons, I would like to have these bills divided  so that we can move on good bills and begin to work together for the  appropriate way to punish, and punish strongly, but not build on the  mountain of mass incarceration.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 6847, the ``Preventing  Child Exploitation Act of 2018,'' for several reasons.   Regrettably, I must oppose this bill because, although it  substantially includes the text of H.R. 1188, the ``Adam Walsh  Reauthorization Act,'' which both the House Judiciary Committee and the  House passed last year, H.R. 6847 also includes the text of three other  bills, H.R. 1761, H.R. 1842, and H.R. 1862 that, although the House  passed last year, would expand the scope of unjust mandatory minimum  sentencing provisions.   The Adam Walsh Act established the Sex Offender Registration and  Notification Act--often referred to as ``SORNA''--as a national system  for the registration of sex offenders.   The Adam Walsh Reauthorization Act, as included in H.R. 6847,  reflects changes recommended to SORNA by the Judiciary Committee when  it last reauthorized the Adam Walsh Act in 2012 to improve the  requirements for states to register sex offenders.   States that fail to substantially implement SORNA are subject to a  10% reduction in federal grants under the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice  Assistance Grant Program.   Commendably, the reauthorization provisions included in H.R. 6847  would allow states discretion in determining whether juvenile sex  offender information will be publicly accessible via the Internet.   And, it would reduce the time that certain, but not all, juvenile sex  offenders adjudicated as delinquent are required to register from 25  years to 15 years.   I welcome these changes as steps in the right direction to address  some of the existing concerns with SORNA, which is why I supported H.R.  1188 last year.   Unfortunately, H.R. 6847 also incorporates a problematic provision  that would add new offenses to the Criminal Code requiring mandatory  life imprisonment for certain repeat sex offenders.   Under Section 3559(e) of Title 18 of the U.S. Code, a defendant who  has been previously convicted of a felony federal or state sex offense  committed against a child--and who is guilty of a predicate federal sex  offense against a child--must be sentenced to life in prison.   H.R. 6847 would amend Section 3559 to add more federal predicate  offenses on which to base imposition of a life sentence, namely sexual  contact with a minor under the age of 12, aggravated sexual contact  with minors between the ages of 12 and 15, and illicit sexual conduct  with a minor abroad by a U.S. citizen.   The bill would also remove the requirement that a federal predicate  offense relating to coercion or enticement of a minor be related to  prostitution.   As a result, this bill would allow coercion or enticement of a minor  into any criminal sexual activity to serve as a basis for imposition of  a mandatory life sentence.   Repeat offenders should, of course, be subject to increased  penalties, and for some offenses life imprisonment is appropriate. Yet,  Congress should not mandate life imprisonment as the only sentencing  option.   Another set of problematic provisions within H.R. 6847 unfortunately  results in the expanded imposition of mandatory minimum sentences.   In addition to the federal crimes of violence already included in the  statute providing penalties for failing to register as a sex offender,  H.R. 6847 would add state crimes of violence as predicate offenses  that, in turn, would require the imposition of a mandatory 5-year  prison sentence to be served consecutively to any sentence imposed for  failing to register or comply with sex offender registration.   And, the bill would also add prior military child sex offenses to  several recidivist sentencing provisions, most of which carry mandatory  minimum penalties of at least 15 years or life.   Lastly, H.R. would amend section 2251 to create two new offenses that  would prohibit causing the production of a visual depiction of a minor  engaged in sexually explicit conduct; and the transmission, or causing  the transmission of, a live visual depiction of a minor engaged in  sexually explicit conduct, such as live streaming. In effect, these  provisions would add new classes of offenders subject to mandatory  minimum sentencing, specifically 15 to 30 years in prison. Yet, this  bill fails to provide any ``Romeo and Juliet'' exceptions.   Consequently, the penalties apply even when conduct is consensual and  when the victim and offender are close in age. For example, if a 19- year-old and a 17-year-old videoed themselves engaged in a sexual act,  then emailed the video to their own email accounts, the 19-year-old  would be subject to the mandatory minimums set by Section 2251, as  amended by this bill.   Unfortunately, the commendable provisions to reauthorize the Adam  Walsh Act in H.R. 6847 are weighed down by the bill's inclusion of  various problematic proposals that will expand mandatory minimum  sentencing.   For far too long, the federal criminal justice system has relied on  an unsustainable system of mass-incarceration that is largely driven by  inflexible mandatory minimum sentencing.   Mandatory minimums are not necessary to impose appropriate sentences.  The judge at  [[Page H8844]]  sentencing has all the information he or she needs to impose a sentence  commensurate with the crime committed and the culpability of the  offender.   Therefore, I must oppose this bill and urge my colleagues to do the  same.   Those who commit crimes against children deserve to be punished and  repeat offenders most certainly deserve to face increased penalties.   Nevertheless, I oppose mandatory minimum sentencing and, therefore, I  must oppose this legislation. I believe that judges are best suited to  determine just and appropriate punishments in these matters.   Even conservative groups agree that expanding the imposition of  mandatory minimum sentences is costly and unjust. Yet, without  mandatory minimum sentences, individuals convicted of serious offenses  would still receive appropriately lengthy sentences, but we should not  create a one-size-fits-all policy approach.   For the foregoing reasons, I urge my colleagues to oppose H.R. 6847.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the House concurrent resolution. I  thank my colleague on the Judiciary Committee for his leadership.   I want to indicate that, first and foremost, this bipartisan  resolution expresses the sense of Congress that child safety should be  the top priority of any custody and parenting court adjudications, and  that courts should resolve safety risks and claims of domestic violence  first, before taking any other interest into consideration.   The resolution also underscores Congress' strong support for the use  of scientific-based evidence in family court, including reliance on  expert professionals with expertise in relevant types of abuse, trauma,  and behaviors of victims and perpetrators by, among other things,  establishing specific standards for the preparation of professional  reports.   This resolution also encourages States to consider models through  which such professional experts can be appointed and paid directly by  the courts as needed, and expresses the sense of Congress that we hold  hearings examining family court practices with regard to the fair  adjudication of children's safety and civil rights.   I think many of us as Members of Congress who deal in family issues,  and as the founder and co-chair of the Congressional Children's Caucus,  and being a student of the Family Protective Services--Child Protective  Services, I have seen more than one case where a child is returned to a  family and gets caught up in the unfortunate practices of that family  situation, that home situation. Yes, they wind up losing their life,  children as young as 1 and 2 and 3 years old, helpless, without being  able to help themselves.   H. Con. Res. 72 acknowledges that the Inter-American Commission on  Human Rights has found that the United States has failed in its legal  obligation to protect women and children from domestic violence.   It certainly seems appropriate, as we debate this, that I ask my  colleagues on the other side of the aisle, and it is not too late, to  join me in putting the Violence Against Women Act on the floor of the  House with over 160 cosponsors that specifically address the question  of domestic violence, domestic abuse. So many of our collaborating  groups from all over the country, both conservative and otherwise, are  arguing and advocating for the passage of the Violence Against Women  Act before its expiration on September 30, 2018. It would be a  complement to this sense of Congress.   In recognition of the fact that the problem of domestic violence is  among the most serious social problems in this country, the resolution  makes a number of important findings in this regard. Child abuse, in  and of itself, is a major public health issue. It costs billions of  dollars annually and, unfortunately, the loss of children's lives.   But the cost of child abuse cannot be measured in simple monetary  terms because, as a study by the Centers for Disease Control tells us,  children who experience adverse childhood experiences are at a greater  risk to develop certain chronic diseases like heart disease and cancer.  The consequences for children who experience abuse and neglect are  long-lasting, long-reaching, and cannot be measured easily.    As this resolution finds, child sexual abuse, too, as horrific as it  is, is a matter that goes routinely underdocumented and underaddressed.  Time and again, research confirms that allegations of domestic  violence, child abuse, and child sexual abuse are often discounted when  it comes to child custody litigation.   This is with family members or guardians of a particular child.  Tragically, abusive parents are often granted custody or unprotected  parenting time, which places children at constant risk. The risk of  abuse to the child increases when a perpetrator of domestic violence  separates from a domestic partner.   Most disturbing is the resolution's finding that documents a minimum  of 568 murders of children in the United States in a 10-year period by  a parent involved in divorce, separation, custody, visitation, or child  support proceedings. In many of these instances, the family courts  granted access to the child by the abusive parent over the objection of  the protective parent.   Finally, this resolution recognizes the need for courts to appoint  well-qualified professionals, at court expense, who will apply  scientifically sound and evidence-based theories to assist in the  adjudication of custody litigation. Because such assistance is not  routinely provided, parents seeking to vindicate their rights in  custody disputes often incur overwhelming debt and may even need to  file for bankruptcy relief as a result. In the United States, this  should be unacceptable.   For these reasons, I encourage my colleagues to join me in supporting  H. Con. Res. 72.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of House Concurrent Resolution 72.   First and foremost, this bipartisan resolution expresses the sense of  Congress that child safety should be the top priority of any custody  and parenting court adjudications and that courts should resolve safety  risks and claims of domestic violence first, before taking other  interests into consideration.   The resolution also underscores Congress's strong support for the use  of scientific-based evidence in family court, including reliance on  expert professionals with expertise in relevant types of abuse, trauma,  and behaviors of victims and perpetrators by, among other things,  establishing specific standards for the preparation of professional  reports.  [[Page H8846]]    This resolution also encourages States to consider models through  which such professional experts can be appointed and paid directly by  the courts, as needed.   And, it expresses the sense of Congress that we hold hearings  examining family court practices with regards to the fair adjudication  of children's safety and civil rights.   House Concurrent Resolution 72 acknowledges that the Inter-American  Commission on Human Rights has found that the United States has failed  in its legal obligation to protect women and children from domestic  violence.   In recognition of the fact that the problem of domestic violence is  among the most serious social problems in this country, the resolution  makes a number of important findings in this regard. Child abuse, in- and-of-itself, is a major public health issue--and it costs billions of  dollars annually. But the ``cost'' of child abuse cannot be measured in  simple monetary terms because, as a study by the Centers for Disease  Control tells us, children who experience ``adverse childhood  experiences'' are at greater risk to develop certain chronic diseases,  like heart disease and cancer. The consequences for children who  experience abuse and neglect are long-lasting and long-reaching and  cannot be measured easily.   As this resolution finds, child sexual abuse, too, as horrific as it  is, is a matter that goes routinely under-documented and under- addressed. But, time and again, research confirms that allegations of  domestic violence, child abuse, and child sexual abuse are often  discounted when it comes to child custody litigation. Tragically,  abusive parents are often granted custody or unprotected parenting  time, which places children at constant risk, and the risk of abuse to  the child increases when a perpetrator of domestic violence separates  from a domestic partner.

In the United States, this  should be unacceptable.   For these reasons, I encourage my colleagues to join me in supporting  House Concurrent Resolution 72.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I might  consume.   Mr. Speaker, first of all, let me certainly thank Mr. Sessions, my  colleague out of Texas, for his very important words and moving  commentary. I thank Congressman Rutherford for his service and  commitment, and the other cosponsors of this legislation, because it  really has more impact.   Let me conclude my remarks by acknowledging a tragedy in my district.  As a hardworking mother was separating from her spouse, it had not yet  gotten to the court, but it is evidence of what can happen. The remarks  of the dad were, ``Bring them over for me to see them one more time.''   And even though the relationship between mom and dad was hostile, mom  wanted to be cooperative, and brought them over and left them for a  moment as she went to her small business.    The next call she got was the shrill of police and neighbors  screaming, and his call to her, the parent's call, the father's call,  and he said, ``Now come over and see your two dead children, because I  have killed them.''   So this is constant throughout the Nation, and we need intervention  and we need recognition of the tragedies that can happen.   So as I previously stated, I strongly support passage of H. Con. Res  72. It is a sober acknowledgement of how family courts in the United  States are failing to protect the very children they are sworn to  protect in cases involving domestic violence, and obviously these cases  have histories of domestic violence. But also as a legislative body, we  have far more effective ways to deal with these problems. They can  complement H. Con. Res. 72.   So I would like to, again, reinforce the bill that was introduced  last July--this July, that I introduced, over 150 cosponsors, I  believe. I introduced a robust bill to reauthorize the Violence Against  Women Act.   This VAWA reauthorization seeks to address the problem of domestic  violence from a holistic perspective by attacking the problem from many  different angles with resources, recognizing all the different  components that are now before us. We need to reauthorize VAWA, not in  any watered down fashion, and we need to do it in complement to H. Con.  Res. 72. And if we hope to make any dent in this very serious problem  and to protect women and children and men who are abused and victimized  day in and day out, this is how we need to do it, pass bills like the  concurrent resolution and also VAWA.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this resolution and join  me in this bipartisan effort as well to pass VAWA.   As I previously stated, I strongly support passage of House  Concurrent Resolution 72. It is a sober acknowledgement of how family  courts in the United States are failing to protect the very children  they are sworn to protect, in cases involving domestic violence.   But, as a legislative body, we have far more effective ways to deal  with these problems than merely passing concurrent resolutions. Last  July, I introduced a robust bill to reauthorize the Violence Against  Women Act. This VAWA reauthorization seeks to address the problem of  domestic violence from a holistic perspective, by attacking the problem  from many different angles. We need to reauthorize VAWA--not in any  watered-down fashion--if we hope to make any dent into this very  serious problem and to protect women, children and men who are abused  and victimized day in and day out.   I urge my colleagues to support House Concurrent Resolution 72.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 6580, the  ``Kerrie Orozco First Responders Family Support Act,'' which amends the  Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 to provide for expedited  naturalization processes for the alien spouses of first responders who  die because of their employment.   This act is named for Kerrie Orozco who died in the line of duty in  May 2015, just a few weeks after giving birth to a premature infant.   Officer Kerrie Orozco was a seven-year veteran of the Omaha Police  Department and a new mother.   As a member of the Metro Area Fugitive Task Force, she was conducting  surveillance just before 1 p.m. that Wednesday, May 20, 2015, when the  suspect being pursued fired at officers after being spotted.   She is remembered not only for her police work but also for her  extensive involvement in community service.   She was active in coaching baseball and had been coaching since 2009  at the North Omaha Boys and Girls Club.   She volunteered with Special Olympics and was president of the Police  Officer Ball to benefit Special Olympics in Nebraska.   Kerrie was a Girl Scout Leader, participated with Shop with a Cop,  and assisted with the Latino Police Officers Easter Egg Hunt.   Shop With A Cop is an annual event where 50 children from the Open  Door Mission shop for their families and for themselves with an officer  at a few local Walmart stores in Omaha.   When she went to work on May 20, 2015, she did not know that she  would not be returning home that night.   Her husband is still waiting for his U.S. Citizenship while he deals  with the heartbreak of his wife's death.   For most immigrants, becoming a United States' citizen is the  culmination of many years of hard work.   Being a citizen offers new opportunity to have a greater say and a  stronger voice in determining our country's future.   There is room in our country for law-abiding individuals from all  over the world to come and be a part of the goodness and greatness that  the United States of America has to offer.   Our first responders put their lives on the line every time they  enter the line of duty.   As the senior member of the House Committees on Judiciary and  Homeland Security and Ranking Member of the Judiciary Subcommittee on  Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Security and Investigations, I am humbled to  call first responders my friends and also my protectors.   I am committed to working tirelessly to assure that they have full  support of Congress in getting the resources and training they need to  protect our communities but also to ensure the welfare of their  families.   This legislation provides the same courtesy that is given to the  families of men and women in uniform who are killed.   The burden on families that have lost a family member is cumbersome  enough on its own.   By enacting this legislation, we can provide an uplifting moment in  their period of grief and sorrow for this generation of spouses and  hopefully ameliorating the situation of future spouses in similar  circumstances.  [[Page H8849]]    For these reasons, I urge my colleagues to stand with me in the  support of H.R. 6580.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1872, the  ``Reciprocal Access to Tibet Act of 2017,'' which promotes access for  United States officials, journalists, and other citizens to Tibetan  areas of the People's Republic of China.   As a co-sponsor of this bill, I am acutely aware of the importance of  this legislation.   The Reciprocal Access to Tibet Act of 2017,'' is the first step in  opening access to Tibet because it would restrict access to China as  long as the government of China restricts access to Tibet.   The act requires the State Department to submit an annual, publicly  available report to Congress that includes a list of individuals  holding specified senior Chinese leadership positions and an assessment  of the level of access Chinese authorities granted U.S. diplomats,  journalists, and tourists to Tibetan areas in China.   In turn, the listed persons shall be ineligible to enter or to be  present in the United States if specified restrictions on foreign  travelers entering Tibetan areas remain in effect.   When we grant Chinese diplomats' access to parts of the United  States, we should take into account the extent to which China grants  U.S. diplomats access to parts of China, including the Tibetan areas.   For far too long have we allowed Chinese officials to enjoy our  freedoms of movement and expression while we condoned with our silence  their draconian restrictions on those very freedoms.   China considers any evidence of Chinese or Tibetans showing loyalty  to or being in communication with the Tibetan government in exile to be  illegal and subject to harsh punishment.   Chinese authorities tightly restrict travel and news media in Tibet.   Individuals who use the internet, social media, or other means to  disseminate dissenting views or share politically sensitive content  face arrest and harsh penalties.   Tibetan cultural expression, which the authorities associate with  separatism, is subject to especially harsh restrictions; those  incarcerated in recent years have included scores of Tibetan writers,  intellectuals, and musicians.   As a nation that stands for basic freedoms of faith and expression,  it is imperative that we do not remain bystanders in the perpetual  struggle for justice and human rights.   This bill is created for the benefit of not only U.S. officials and  workers in human rights who have no access into Tibet, but also  Tibetans living in oppression and in exile who desperately hope every  day for a breath of freedom in the Chinese security apparatus.   For these reasons, I urge my colleagues to stand with me in the  support of H.R. 1872.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 5433,  the ``Hack Your State Department Act''.   This act would direct the State Department to establish what is known  in the cybersecurity community as a `bug bounty' program.   Bug bounty programs, also known as Vulnerability Disclosure Programs,  are comprehensive efforts by an organization to lay out the method by  which members of the public may report any security vulnerabilities to  an entity.   They also lay out which of their resources are covered by this  policy, and how any identified vulnerabilities will be addressed.   At a time when the computer networks of our government are under  constant attack, and have suffered serious breaches in recent years, we  must take action to ensure that the information of our citizens and the  ability of federal agencies to carry out their duties are resilient.   As a long-time advocate of a government that works efficiently for  the people, it is clear that current information security practices of  federal agencies, including the State Department, must evolve to keep  pace with improved standards and policies.   Without an honest effort to seek awareness of the security of the  State Department network, users, and devices, we will continue to be  increasingly vulnerable.   To that end, H.R. 5433 recognizes the importance of a dynamic  approach that will help secure federal networks and data, beginning  with the State Department, as well as provide improved information on  vulnerabilities and security practices across the various agencies.   Without codifying this concrete measure to improve awareness of  federal network security at the State Department, this important agency  will remain vulnerable.   We have seen an unfortunate loss of cybersecurity talent at the State  Department this year.   Further, even despite this, the White House has eliminated the  position of Cybersecurity Coordinator from the National Security  Council.   This occurred even after Federal Risk Determination Reports found  that communication of threat information within agencies is also  inconsistent, with only 59 percent of agencies reporting a capability  to share threat information to all employees within an enterprise so  they have the knowledge necessary to block attacks.   Federal agencies are not taking advantage of all available  information such as threat intelligence, incident data, and network  traffic flow to improve situational awareness regarding systems at risk  and to prioritize investments.   For this reason, earlier this Congress, I introduced H.R. 3202, the  ``Cyber Vulnerability Disclosure Reporting Act'', which was passed by  the full House and is now in the Senate.   H.R. 3202 requires the Secretary of Homeland Security to submit a  report on the policies and procedures developed for coordinating cyber  vulnerability disclosures.   The report will include an annex with information on instances in  which cyber security vulnerability disclosure policies and procedures  were used to disclose details on identified weaknesses in computing  systems that or digital devices at risk.   The report will provide information on the degree to which the  information provided by DHS was used by industry and other  stakeholders.   I would also like to recognize the University of Houston, which has  been recognized by the Department of Homeland Security and the National  Security Agency as a Center of Academic Excellence for the programs in  cybersecurity and cyber defense.   In closing, Mr. Speaker, I urge all members to join me in voting to  pass H.R. 5433, the ``Hack Your State Department Act''.
