 Madam Speaker, I thank the Representative from  Colorado for yielding me the customary 30 minutes, and I yield myself  such time as I may consume.   S. 1098 is intended to ensure borrowers who need to separate their  loans urgently because they are victims of domestic or economic abuse  are not put in further harmful financial situations due to having a  joint consolidation loan that cannot be separated.   Republicans fully support the intention of the bill, and it is  something we should be able to address in a fully bipartisan manner.  However, they are concerned that this bill misses the mark.   According to the Department of Education, this bill could not be  implemented for at least a year or longer. If we want to truly solve  this problem, victims need help immediately.   This bill also broadens the Secretary of Education's authority. It  gives the Secretary the authority to allow for new consolidation loans  if it is in the fiscal interest of the Federal Government but does not  define the term.   In addition, this bill did not receive a hearing in the House  Education and Labor Committee, no discussion, no input, simply  accepting the Senate's version, which was introduced before the  President's announcement of student loan forgiveness.   My Republican colleagues on the Education and Labor Committee have an  alternative bill that will protect victims of abuse, allowing borrowers  to separate their loans immediately rather than waiting up to 18  months.   It also protects taxpayers from potential abuse of authority by the  Secretary of Education by narrowly tailoring the authority to help  those in need. Congress should always be concerned about relinquishing  authority to the executive branch.   This bill also closes all the gaps that exist in the bill that has  been brought up on the floor today. Yet, my colleagues were ignored,  and now we are left discussing an incomplete policy.   Madam Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support this alternative  that would solve the problems without ceding more authority to the  Secretary.   Madam Speaker, I oppose the rule, and I ask the Members to do the  same. I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I point out that the vote that my  colleague does point out regarding this bill in the Senate was before  the President made his announcement regarding student loan forgiveness.   Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr.  Rodney Davis).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, if we defeat the previous question, I will offer an  amendment to the rule allowing for the immediate consideration of H.R.  8749 to repeal the methane emissions and waste reduction incentive  program for petroleum and natural gas systems.   Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment in the Record along with the extraneous materials immediately  prior to the vote on the previous question.    Madam Speaker, just last week, a constituent called  my office with concerns about the President's energy policy. Joshua  hauls gas for a living and said it is the best job he has ever had, but  he worries that President Biden wants to take that away. He asked for  my support and expressed his appreciation for anything that I can do to  protect the industry.   H.R. 8749 is a key piece of that puzzle. It supports American energy  independence and all those who rely on it by protecting the Permian  Basin and the largest secure supply of crude oil in the world.   If the Biden administration gets their way on this issue, production  will be slowed in that region, jobs will be lost, and gas prices will  continue to rise.   Madam Speaker, this Presidential administration is actively working  against the oil and gas industry. They have increased natural gas  production taxes, prevented energy development in Alaska, and made  permitting more difficult.   They are prioritizing supplemental energy technologies like wind and  solar, but the U.S. Energy Information Administration's annual energy  outlook projected that petroleum and natural gas will be the most used  fuels in the U.S. through 2050. We cannot abandon these reliable and  essential sources of energy.    Madam Speaker, I yield 6 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Pfluger), the author of the bill, to further explain the amendment.    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Texas.    Madam Speaker, we did address some of the issues that  we have and the concerns we have regarding the bill that is in front of  us. But we also offered a previous question because we should be  talking about energy.   The American public is concerned about energy independence and what  is happening with energy; how they are going to cool and, in my case,  in Minnesota, how we are going to heat our homes. It gets cold in  Minnesota, and people are concerned about how they are going to heat  their homes this winter and what they will have to cut out of their  family budget if prices continue to rise on heating their homes.   Madam Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from North Dakota  (Mr. Armstrong) to discuss it even further. And it is cold in North  Dakota, too.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time  for closing.   Just before I get into my formal remarks, I just want to mention, we  did a quick Google search, because I know that my colleague from  Colorado just mentioned the dropping gas prices earlier in his  comments. We did a quick Google search, and in 2019, the gas prices in  Colorado were $2.14, and they are currently in 2022, $3.70. So those  gas prices, while you may say they are going down a bit, that is a  significant increase from 2019.   Madam Speaker, S. 1098 is well intentioned, but there are other ways  to accomplish this goal effectively. The current bill will not help  victims of abuse for a year or more. The Republican bill would help  them now.   The bill we are debating today includes vague language that creates  loopholes that would allow the administration to spend billions of tax  dollars on broader loan forgiveness without justification and  oversight. The Republican bill closes this loophole to ensure that  those who really need the help are the ones receiving it.   We owe it to the victims of abuse to have a straightforward and  efficient process to help them, and we owe the taxpayers to protect  their tax dollars.   Madam Speaker, I oppose the rule and encourage Members to do the  same, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.   This is a 5-minute vote.
