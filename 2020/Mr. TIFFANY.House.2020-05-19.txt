 Madam Speaker, I would like to thank Leader McCarthy and  the Members of the Wisconsin delegation in attendance here today. And I  would like to thank Congressman Sensenbrenner for his kind  introduction; I wish him the best as he concludes his years servicing  the people of Wisconsin in the Halls of Congress. Thank you, Speaker  Pelosi, for taking time out of your busy day to conduct this swearing  in.   My message is simple. Ten years ago I was given the great privilege  to represent the people of northern Wisconsin in the State legislature  in Madison. I made one commitment to them, to advance the cause of  freedom and liberty.   Today, I make that same commitment to the good people of northern and  western Wisconsin, to fight for those same enduring ideals that form  the foundation of the American Republican.   Madam Speaker, I wish to thank my mother, Virgal Tiffany who, along  with my deceased father, Pat Tiffany, raised my seven brothers and  sisters in the little town of Elmwood, Wisconsin, with love and  devotion. I am here today, Mom, because of the persistence and  determination you have lived your life by every day. Madam Speaker, I  suspect that she is down in her kitchen right now canning sauerkraut  and pickles just like she has always done as a farm girl. Yes.   And, finally, to my wife, Chris, and our three daughters, Karlyn,  Lexie, and Katherine, they are up in the gallery there. I hope you are  as excited as I am as we turn the pages to a new chapter in our lives.  Thank you for standing with me all of these years.                            ____________________
