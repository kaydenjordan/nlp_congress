 Mr. President, this is not the topic that I came to the  floor to talk about; I will talk about it in a minute. But while the  Senator from Oklahoma is here, I thought I would just respond to what  he was saying--not on the merits of his particular proposal, because I  haven't had a chance to study that yet, but to his plea that this place  start to work again. I couldn't agree more with that sentiment.   The Founding Fathers were very deliberate people, and they understood  that in exercising self-government in the Republic that they were  establishing, which subsequent generations of Americans have made more  democratic over time, that we would have disputes. People these days in  our political system and especially on the cable television at night  seem to be astounded that there are people who don't see the world the  way they see the world. The Founders knew that, by definition, if we  were going to be a self-governing republic, we would have  disagreements, and they set out to form  [[Page S8217]]  an incredibly elegant mechanism to resolve those disputes. It was  elegant on the outside of this Chamber--freedom to assemble, freedom of  speech, freedom of religion, the right to vote--and it was elegant on  the inside of this Chamber. And generations of people who occupied this  place understood that the way it was meant to work was not that you  always got your way all the time and that part of being here was not  just to have disputes but to resolve disputes--and not even our  disputes but disagreements that the country might have for a legitimate  reason--and, on average, hoped that we would move the country forward.   I quite agree that recently--certainly in the time that I have been  here--we have been using this place simply to have disputes, not to  resolve them. That may be OK if we were in North Korea or in the Soviet  Union--the old Soviet Union; it doesn't work in a democratic republic.   I want to finish a little bit of the history that my friend from  Oklahoma talked about. After the Democrats invoked the nuclear option,  which I have said before on this floor is the worst vote that I ever  took as a Senator, the now majority leader pocketed that precedent when  we changed the rules in the middle and used it--used the nuclear option  to change the rules so that now a person gets a lifetime appointment on  the Supreme Court not with 60 votes but with just 51 votes. My issue  with that is that now your party can advance people to the Supreme  Court without any reasonable expectation that my party should take  responsibility for it, or vice versa.   Instead of having potential nominees come here and say: You should  put me on the court because I can attract both Democratic and  Republican votes because I have an open mind, I worry we are going to  have people from both sides say: We are going to have a litmus test for  Supreme Court nominees, which says we either have the most conservative  jurist in the country or the most liberal jurist in the country,  depending on who it is. We have infected the Supreme Court with the  partisanship of this body.   My hope is, we can actually come together on a set of rule changes  that would recognize not just that this place may need to move a little  faster in the 21st century but that we ought to be pushing people  together to work in a bipartisan way on behalf of the country.   Without passing on the merits of the proposal, I thank the Senator  for coming to the floor to talk about--to put it in the vernacular--how  busted this place is.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I wish to talk about the Dreamers.   As I have from the time I was a school superintendent in Denver until  now, I had the opportunity to spend time last weekend or the week  before with a group of Dreamers in Alamosa, a small town in Southern  Colorado.   These meetings are usually occasions for people to lay out their  dreams for the future in America, the only country they know and the  only country they love. This meeting was different than other meetings  I have had recently. Instead of the hope and self-confidence I am so  used to hearing from young people, what I heard was fear, anxiety, and  pain.   Everybody in the group I met the other day came to this country as  undocumented immigrants when they were children, some just months old.  None of them made the decision to come here. They grew up here, and  they know no other country besides the United States of America.   In 2012, they joined 800,000 Dreamers who came forward across the  country to share their information for temporary legal status under the  DACA Program. Over the past 5 years, many of these Dreamers grew into  young adults, finishing school, starting families, launching  businesses. They went about their lives, trusting our government would  keep its word and find a way for them to stay in the only country they  know. Then, in September, President Trump rescinded DACA, throwing  every one of their lives into chaos.   During our meeting in Alamosa, not a single person could share their  story without breaking into tears. One young man, Julio Maldanado, told  me about the iPhone repair business he opened on Main Street. Like so  many immigrants, he poured himself into that enterprise as an  entrepreneur. Thanks to his efforts, it is now not only turning a  profit, it is providing a service to his community and supporting his  family. Now all of that is in jeopardy.   As I said, Julio couldn't tell his story without starting to cry.  When he turned to his business partner who was also there to help, his  partner began crying too. Versions of that played out again and again  in our meetings and in the meetings I have been having here in  Washington, DC, as Dreamers take the risk to travel to Washington to  share their stories--honest dream after honest dream being crushed by  uncertainty, young people trembling in fear.   We hear a lot around this place about how we don't have to act until  the last moment. We don't have to act until March 5. This is not true.  There are so many children, young people, and young adults in my State  who are losing their status as we sit here, unable to accomplish  something everybody seems to say they want to accomplish. The President  says he wants to accomplish it. The Speaker says he wants to accomplish  it. Senators on both sides say they want to accomplish it. We have  created this crisis that President Trump set off when he rescinded  DACA.   This isn't just affecting Dreamers, although that ought to be enough  for us to do the job we are supposed to do. For years, farmers and  ranchers have told us they need workers with clear legal status.  Undocumented workers have told us they face exploitation without legal  resources. Families have told us they fear being split apart and sent  to places they hardly know, and, today, this week, those fears were  confirmed again as we lost another father from Colorado. Just last  week, we had a family torn apart in Colorado.   Melecio Andazola came to America in 1998 as an undocumented  immigrant. Over the last 19 years, he has paid taxes in America, he has  raised four children in America, he has followed the rules. Then, on  Friday, he was deported.   Now it is unclear whether he will ever see his daughter walk across  the stage for her college graduation next spring at Yale, in New Haven.  It is unclear how he will be able to support his four kids. Because of  the choices we have made in Washington, the lives of everyone in that  family have been spun into chaos, like so many other families across  the country.   For years, stories like this have demanded action. That is why the  Senator from Illinois who is here today, Senator Durbin, has led this  charge for so many years, standing on the floor with photos of the  Dreamers from his State and across the United States. It is the reason  I was so honored to have the chance to work with him and six others of  our colleagues back in 2013, the so-called Gang of 8, a group of four  Democrats and four Republicans.   I was just talking with my friend from Oklahoma about how this place  doesn't work. That was an instance where it worked. We came together to  write a bipartisan proposal for immigration reform. Over the course of  8 months, in Washington, we worked through a process that I think would  make every American proud for once--both sides sitting down to solve  problems. The result was a great piece of legislation.   Our bill had more funding for border security, not just a wall but  smart and effective border security. It had more funding for internal  security. It had a pathway to citizenship for the 11 million  undocumented people who are here, including all of the Dreamers. Part  of that bill had the most progressive DREAM Act ever written. It got 68  votes on the floor of the Senate. Not everyone got what they wanted. As  I just said to the Senator from Oklahoma in a different context, it is  unreasonable to expect that here. Each side had to give, but the result  was a great vote. It got almost 70 votes in the Senate, at a time when  you can't pass anything through the Senate.   For the first time in a generation, we had a real opportunity to  resolve our differences on immigration, but as is so often the case in  Washington, politics got in the way. In the House, Republican leaders  denied our bill a simple up-or-down vote, which would have  [[Page S8218]]  passed. They preferred to keep immigration alive as a political weapon  to divide the American people and distract from the real challenges in  our economy.   By the way, the Senator from Illinois will remember this. We heard a  lot of stretching this week about how much economic growth this tax  bill was going to create--0.6 percent here or 0.1 percent over there.  The CBO estimate on the Gang of 8 immigration bill was that by bringing  people out of the shadows and putting them in a position to contribute  legally to the economy, that would have added 3 percentage points to  our GDP, to our Nation's economy over the first 10 years, and five  incremental points over the second 10 years. That would have been a  useful thing to do for our economy.   As a result of what happened--or didn't happen--in the House, the  rhetoric around immigration has just become more toxic, evermore  divisive, evermore unrecognizable in America, a Nation that has  inarguably been made great by immigrants.   As I said, there are a lot of economists who are awfully skeptical  about the economic claims that have been made about this tax bill. If  we look at what happened in 2001 and 2003, when they tried to do it  before, we all know how that story is going to end. On the other hand,  nearly every expert agrees that forcing out the Dreamers would hurt our  economy.   The Cato Institute found that removing the Dreamers would stunt  economic growth by $280 billion. Another study found that comprehensive  immigration reform would grow the economy by $1.5 trillion over 10  years and support nearly 1 million new jobs.   Despite these facts, there has been a lot of talk around here about  how immigrants detract from America or how they somehow leach off the  system and lack our values. Those claims are then used to justify  actions like canceling DACA. It would be hard for me to believe that  anybody making a claim like that had ever sat down with a Dreamer.   Daniela Gomez Castro came to Colorado when she was just a year old.  As a child, Daniela looked up to her grandmother--one of the few women  doctors in her area--and dreamed of following her into medicine. She  took classes in biology and excelled in our public schools, graduating  from Smokey Hill High School in 2015.   To become a doctor, she knew college was the next step, so she  enrolled at the University of Colorado Denver as a prehealth major, and  in between classes, she worked as a nurse's assistant, restaurant  hostess, and student mentor to help cover tuition. Everything was on  track. Then, last year, she learned her legal status meant she couldn't  get a medical license. After working so hard for so long, her dream is  now frozen in place by forces in Washington totally beyond her control.   Today, America--especially places like rural Colorado--is desperate  for physicians. The Association of American Medical Colleges predicts  that, by 2030, we will have a shortage of 100,000 doctors nationwide.  As I say, we are feeling that shortage right now in rural Colorado. We  don't have enough clinics and treatment centers, even as we face an  epidemic of opioid addiction. Two of our counties don't have a single  doctor, and a lot of our rural counties have no primary care doctor or  nurse.   Given that, it doesn't seem to me to make any sense that we should  send Daniela back to a place she doesn't remember and doesn't call her  home, especially when we need her here. That obviously would be cruel,  but my point is, it would also be incredibly shortsighted.   Apolinar Lopez Garcia also came here when he was just a year old. His  family eventually made their way to Greeley, CO. He thrived in school  and joined the Junior ROTC Program in Northridge High School, where he  excelled as a cadet. He relished the ROTC sense of community, self- discipline, and duty, so much so that after graduating from high  school, he wanted to enlist in the U.S. Marine Corps. He filled out the  paperwork and waited, but when the reply came, Apolinar was crushed.  Because of his legal status, the Marines couldn't accept him.   We should think about that. Of all the paths available to a bright,  young person like Apolinar, he wanted to serve the country in uniform.  You don't feel called to serve a place you don't consider home. You  don't feel called to serve a place where you don't share the values, to  defend a community that is not your own. Apolinar's choice flies in the  face of every specious attack we have heard against immigrants in this  debate. He doesn't detract from America.   Apolinar wants to defend America. Daniela wants to treat sick  Americans. Julio wants to create jobs for Americans. They join 800,000  Dreamers who, for years, have invested in America by paying taxes,  starting businesses, and serving their communities. For years, America  has invested in them, by educating them, by training them, and  instilling in them the confidence and love of country we hope for each  new generation of Americans.   It is unimaginable now that we wouldn't find a way to resolve their  status. We can't avoid this any longer. The Senate and the House are so  good at putting off what they should have done last week or last month  or last year. This is not one of those cases anymore.   On each day we do nothing, 112 people are deported. Over 12,000  people have been deported since September. Every one of them represents  a family torn apart, a business shuttered, a payroll not made, an  education interrupted, a dream shattered. In the end, our most basic  job here--lost in this sometimes--is to look out for the next  generation of Americans. Instead of looking after them, we have spent  an entire year trampling over them.   Let's review the record.   With the Dreamers, we have ransomed their futures for political  leverage. We are doing it right now. With our backtracking on climate  change, we have made their futures more dangerous and costly. With our  failure to reauthorize CHIP, we have jeopardized the healthcare of,  among others, 90,000 kids in Colorado who may lose healthcare if we  don't act. Now, with this tax bill, we have handed another $1.4  trillion in debt to people whose futures we are not investing in  because we say we cannot afford to do it--by rebuilding our roads, by  improving our schools, by spurring innovation. Instead, we have taken  another bet on trickle-down economics at a time when we already have a  substantial budget deficit.   That is what brings us here at the end of the year, once again, with  our not having done our work and passing something called a continuing  resolution that no other government enterprise in America gets to do--a  temporary budget that doesn't reflect the priorities of the American  people. In that mix, the Dreamers find themselves caught up in a  political discussion without any assurance that it will be resolved.   The good news is that I know there are Republican colleagues here, as  well as Democrats, who want a solution for the Dreamers. They see in  these young people all of the qualities we cherish as Americans-- family, community, service, enterprise, and patriotism.   I would just say, as we get ready to leave here, that I think we  shouldn't leave here today. I think we should commit to this issue with  our Dreamers. This should be our No. 1 priority together--to figure out  how to get this done so we don't have inadvertent casualties occur.  After a while, something inadvertent has to be advertent because if you  have knowledge of it and if you know what is going to happen, it leads  you to believe that you should have acted. We need to stop the  brinksmanship and the partisanship, and we need to work together to  ensure that their futures will be here in the United States, where we  need them, in the only country they know.   I thank my colleagues for their indulgence.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.    Mr. President, I wish to recognize the 90th birthday of  Albert Ratner on December 26, 2017. Albert has lived a life of faith  and service. Whether as a loving father, life-long philanthropist, or a  successful businessman at Forest City Realty Trust, Albert has worked  tirelessly for his community.   Over his career, Albert has shown a particular passion for giving  back to the Jewish community, improving our schools, and supporting  innovation at the community level.   In Denver, Albert led the charge to transform the Stapleton Airport  into a thriving community center with high-quality, affordable housing,  green spaces, and new schools. Among those schools is Denver's Science  and Technology High School, which has attracted many brilliant students  over the last 13 years. Albert's work to revitalize downtown areas  across the country have earned him numerous awards, including the  National Building Museum Honor Award, the Urban Land Institute's J. C.  Nichols Prize for Visionaries in Urban Development, and the Michigan  State University's Distinguished Alumni Award.   Albert is the proud father of Deborah and Brian, who follow his  lifelong values of service, community, and faith. He is also a loving  husband to Audrey, his wife of 36 years, and before that, to his first  wife, Faye, who tragically died in an automobile accident. On Albert's  90th birthday, we celebrate his accomplished life, one defined by good  humor, compassion, family, and faith.
