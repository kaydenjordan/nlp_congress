 Mr. Speaker, we are in the midst of a terrible mental  health crisis among youth in our Nation. The Centers for Disease  Control and Prevention's recent youth risk behavior survey reveals that  our kids are really struggling.   One in four teen girls reported seriously considering attempting  suicide in 2021, and LGBTQ teens and girls report extremely high levels  of mental distress, violence, and substance abuse.   They need us to stand up for them. They need us to stand with them.  We need to make investments that will actually help. We have real work  to do.   But what do my Republican colleagues have us spending time on this  week? A sham bill that does nothing for our kids. It inserts the  Federal Government between parents and students and schools. It  promotes censorship. It promotes banning books.   It is not about freedom. It is not about protecting kids.   As a former teacher and as a mom, I know that all children deserve a  safe and affirming school environment. When I talk to Vermont families,  which I do all the time, they aren't concerned about these kind of  culture wars. They need us to take our jobs seriously and address the  real everyday concerns. That is why I am in Congress.                            ____________________
