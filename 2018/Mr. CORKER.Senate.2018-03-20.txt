 Mr. President, I wish to thank the Senator from New  Jersey, my good friend, the ranking member of the Senate Foreign  Relations Committee, for his comments.   Today we met with the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, a very impressive  young man who is transforming the country. We talked about the  importance of our relationship, no doubt, but we strongly, strongly  pushed back on what is happening right now in Yemen and asked them to  take strong corrective action. I was there when this occurred, and I  certainly expressed the same.   We also talked about the enrichment they are pursuing and some of the  concerns that exist there. I want to thank the ranking member for his  leadership and the words he just spoke.   Let me just speak to the debate we are having on the floor. This is a  very entrepreneurial move. I don't say that to be pejorative. I know  one of the Members is on the Judiciary Committee that is bringing this  to the floor. I can imagine some highly important judicial issue not  being debated in the Judiciary Committee but just being wafted to the  floor for a debate. I know that is not the way the Judiciary Committee  operates.   One of the other Members is on the Energy and Natural Resources  Committee. I can imagine some complex cap-and-trade bill being offered,  and instead of it being worked through the committee--or some ethanol  bill or some other type of bill--instead of it being worked through the  committee, somebody just decides to bring it directly to the floor.  That is what is happening here today.   I certainly don't shy away from this debate. I appreciate the fact  that Mitch McConnell understood that very few Members of our body-- unless they are on the Foreign Relations Committee, Armed Services  Committee, or happen to take a particular interest--even know much  about what is happening in Yemen, and a lot is happening there. So I  appreciated the briefing that took place last week to give Members a  sense as to what is occurring there, but the proper way to deal with  these issues is to deal with them in committee.   One would think that maybe there is some Yemen legislation that the  committee is holding and not acting on. That is not the case. Any of  these Members could have offered Yemen legislation relative to this  issue, and the committee would take it up. That has not occurred.   So let me tell my colleagues what is happening in the committee. We  have a bill that is being worked on by Senator Young and Senator  Shaheen dealing with this very issue. They are building support. They  are working with the administration to make sure the definitions are  correct, and they have had numbers of people involved with them. We  plan to have a Yemen hearing in the next few weeks to deal with this  issue but also to take up appropriate legislation. That is the way we  typically deal with issues of such importance.   Let me say this: This is an issue of great importance. It not only  affects the tremendous humanitarian crisis that is occurring in Yemen  and the radicalization of the Houthis, supported by Iran--a proxy of  Iran--but also Saudi Arabia's own security. It also affects the way we  deal with other countries. I think many people here understand fully  that right now, or recently, we have been involved in the same kinds of  activities with France, as they have dealt with issues in Mali,  including refueling and helping them some with intelligence issues.   So this is something, again, that we need to take up in a serious  way, and the committee is committed to doing so.   What I hope will happen today is that Members of this body will let  the Foreign Relations Committee do its job and that we will bring a  bill forward that we can properly debate and amend.   I am hoping that later today, when I offer a tabling motion, Members  of this body will respect the members of the Foreign Relations  Committee who deal with this issue and let it go back to committee,  with the commitment that we plan to bring forth legislation to actually  deal appropriately with many of the issues relative to Yemen, Saudi  Arabia, Iran, and ourselves.   Let me mention one other thing. We have been working for some time to  deal with the authorization for the use of military force. It has been  an issue that has been before us for many years. It is the replacement  and revision of the 2001-2002 AUMF that many people in this body have  had concerns about because it has been so long since they were enacted.  We have activities that are taking place around the world still based  on those two authorizations. We have a markup on an AUMF on April 19  scheduled to try to revise so we can give people an opportunity to  weigh in on this issue on the floor.   By the way, the way the AUMF is being constructed at present, when we  go into new countries, when we take on new groups, the Senate would  have the ability to weigh in on those issues.   So I just would like to say to the body and those who are looking in,  we are not shying away from this debate. There has been no legislation  whatsoever that has been held up on this topic. Legislation is being  introduced soon in a bipartisan way to deal with this terrible issue  that is taking place in Yemen.   We are going to have a hearing. We will have a markup. In addition to  that, we are going to have a markup on a new AUMF to deal with the  issues our country is dealing with around the world with al-Qaida,  ISIS, and other entities that have been associated parties.   With that, I just want to let people know that is kind of the way we  deal with things around here. None of us is happy with the current  status, but I think a better way for us to come up with a prudent  solution to what is happening there is to go through the normal  committee process. I hope the other Members of the body will respect  that.   I am glad that, by the way, the ranking member--by the way, this  policy has been taking place in Yemen. It started under the Obama  administration, the same exact policy. The Senate has acted on it by  voting for appropriations, so it is not as if we have not taken action  ourselves. We have done that through the NDAA. We have done that  through various State Department authorizations. So we have acted upon  it. There are concerns about what is happening there. Legislation is  going to be introduced to try to deal with  [[Page S1811]]  this, and that is the way we deal with complicated issues. No one is  shying away from the debate. We just hope to table this and move it  back and deal with it in the orderly, appropriate way.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I have enjoyed hearing the discussion  about the item before us. I must say that I would feel a whole lot  better about this debate if it were focused on our refueling French  jets going into Mali--the same exact debate. I assume these individuals  would consider those to be hostilities, but, somehow or another, that  doesn't rise to congressional approval.   This one, I think, is politically tinged. Saudi Arabia certainly has  issues. They have conducted themselves in manners that we wish were  better. The Crown Prince was here today, and all of us who met with him  ``demarched'' him, if you will, on the conduct relative to Yemen. Yet,  at the same time, we know that because American folks are involved in  refueling and because we are helping, to a degree, with intelligence,  we know that less civilians are being killed there. We know that. We  know that our being there has affected their conduct.   I wish to talk about process here. The sponsors of the resolution,  who I have great respect for, have used a very entrepreneurial method  to bring this to the floor, and I don't say that to be pejorative. They  have reached into the War Powers Act and pulled out something that was  unintended for this purpose. I think everyone understands that, and I  think everyone understands that if we don't table this, we will be  setting a precedent here. It will be a situation of first impression  where from now on, when our Air Force is refueling jets in the air, we  are involved in hostilities. I don't think that is a standard that we  wish to set.   I want to argue this on a different level. It is hard for me to  believe that we would take up an issue of this serious nature and not  allow the committee of jurisdiction to work its will. We had a hearing  last week that Senator McConnell set up for all Senators to come in and  be briefed on Yemen. His stated reason for doing that was that most  people in the Senate don't know much about what is happening in Yemen.  People on the Foreign Relations Committee do, and the people on Intel  do, and the people in Armed Services do. But most of the Senate has not  really been involved recently in that issue.   Typically, the way we work around here is that the committee does its  work. It does its recommendation. It works with the administration, and  you come forth with a piece of legislation. Can we imagine, for  instance, with tax reform, if we just had some kind of entrepreneurial  way of bringing tax reform to the floor without the Finance Committee  working, or bringing  [[Page S1826]]  FISA to the floor without Intel working? That is not the way we are  supposed to do things here.   So we have a bill that is being generated right now--it is a  bipartisan bill--by Jeanne Shaheen and Todd Young. It may not be the  bill we deal with on Yemen, but it is just now being developed.   By the way, I skipped a beat here. I want to refresh people's memory  as to what we are voting on. We are not voting on anything but a  decision to discharge the Yemen issue from the committee without the  committee taking any action, without the committee having any hearings.  This is a vote to say that we are going to skip the Foreign Relations  Committee and we are going to set precedent here on the floor in this  entrepreneurial way and that we have reached into the War Powers Act to  find a clause to bring it to the floor, which was never intended for  this purpose.   So what I would say to people is that a better way of handling this  would be to table this motion, to let the Foreign Relations Committee  do the work that you have assigned the Foreign Relations Committee to  do. We are going to have a hearing on Yemen. We have a piece of  legislation that is being developed in a bipartisan way, with the  Republicans and Democrats, to deal with this issue. Let us work our  will in the appropriate way--by the way, in a way that actually will  generate an outcome.   In addition, I know there are Members on the floor who have been  frustrated, as someone referenced earlier, that the 2001-2002 AUMF is  still being used. The Presiding Officer has been very involved in  trying to develop a new AUMF that would supersede those two AUMFs and  give the Senate and the House the ability to weigh in every 4 years on  these types of actions. We are going to have a markup on a bill that  our Presiding Officer, Senator Kaine from Virginia, Senator Young from  Indiana, and many people have been involved in. That markup is going to  take place on April 19.   So, hopefully, the Senate will not only have an ability to deal with  a real bill on Yemen that actually will generate a real outcome coming  through committee but also will have the ability to deal with an AUMF  that will set aside the fact that for years the Congress has not  weighed in on this issue. To me, that is a much better outcome.   I urge everyone in this body, instead of following this unique  process that is not going to generate an outcome regardless, to allow  the Foreign Relations Committee to do its work and to bring a bill to  the floor that will generate an outcome. I am going to make a motion in  a moment to table it, but I realize there may be one more speaker  before I do so.    Mr. President, yes.    Mr. President, that is correct.   So, in closing, I would just ask--just like every other committee  here in the Senate that hopefully takes its work seriously and does  work especially on important matters like this that affect people's  lives--that this body would think that a better recommendation would be  to table this effort to have this wild West debate on the floor over  the course of the next several hours and, instead of doing it in that  manner, to give the committee of jurisdiction the ability to work its  will with Yemen through hearings, through a process on the committee  that would actually bring a bill to the floor that has been thought  through and where we had worked with other bodies of government to get  it in a place where then it could be amended and dealt with in a more  methodical and appropriate way.   I would like to remind people one more time that we also plan to mark  up an AUMF on April 19 to deal with the lingering issue of having an  open situation where we are still dealing with ISIS and al-Qaida and  others based on something that was authorized to be done in Afghanistan  years ago.   With that, I yield the floor.    Mr. President, very briefly, I just want to set the  record straight. The House of Representatives voted to say that the war  in Yemen is not covered by the 2001-2002 AUMF, and I think this body  would agree. They did not do as was just mentioned by the Senator from  Vermont. As a matter of fact, they decided not to take up this measure  that we are taking up today because they thought it was not a good  measure to take up.   I don't want anybody in this body to think that the House has already  supported this effort. The House not only didn't support it, they  wouldn't take it up because they thought it was damaging to our  country's foreign policy.   I hope that today people will join me in voting to table this motion  and to let the committee do its work as it is supposed to do. Let's  bring something to the floor that will actually have an outcome, and  then let's have a debate down the road on the AUMF--the 2001 and 2002  AUMF--which I hope will be given floor time.   With that, I think all time has expired.   Mr. President, I move to table the Sanders motion to discharge S.J.  Res. 54, and I ask for the yeas and nays.
