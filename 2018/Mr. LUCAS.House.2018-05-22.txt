 Mr. Speaker, it has been 10 long years since I was a  conferee on Dodd-Frank. Since then, I have seen credit markets in my  district and across the country dry up, thanks to the increased  regulations.   That is why I am so happy to be speaking on a bill today that will  roll back some of those burdens.   As I have said over the last decade, Dodd-Frank was not written on  the back of the stone tablets. Dodd-Frank will be addressed in this  bill, S. 2155.   S. 2155 is but the first step in making that perception a reality. It  is the first step in bringing financial markets back to true efficiency  and capacity. And, yes, I mean a first step. There are many more things  this Congress could and should do to bring more relief to small  community institutions across the country.   Every year, small financial institutions in Oklahoma have made the  trek here to ask me for relief, any relief. For the first time, I can  give them positive news, which is, thanks to this bill, sure, there is  more to be done, of course, but things in this bill like changes to  stress testing, risk management protocols, required data disclosure,  among other things, will help those who rely on small banks and credit  unions for their financial needs.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Hensarling for this opportunity to vote  on this bill today.
