 Madam Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  South Carolina (Mr. Rice) for his remarks.    Madam Speaker, I have no further speakers and I am prepared  to close. I reserve the balance of my time.                                General Leave     Madam Speaker, I have no further speakers and am prepared  to close.   It is a real honor to be here today, and the distinguished whip is  correct that this is long overdue, to recognize Joseph Rainey and his  accomplishments.   He fought tirelessly for civil rights and education and opportunity.  He fought for freedom for every working American in this country. To be  here today in Black History Month to recognize his legacy and his  legend, he will not be forgotten, and we ensure that today.   I hope that future generations of South Carolinians and Americans  across the country can be inspired by his courageous leadership here in  this House. I urge my colleagues to support this bill today.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 772, a bill that would name  a Minnesota post office after Jim Ramstad.   From 1968 to 1974, Jim Ramstad served as a member of the Army  Reserve. In 1981, he was elected to the Minnesota State Senate, where  he would go on to serve for 10 years. He was then elected to the U.S.  House of Representatives, where he represented Minnesota's Third  Congressional District.   During his time in Congress, he strove to reduce discrimination  against those suffering from mental health and addiction problems. He  retired from Congress in 2009 and went on to serve as a fellow at  Harvard University and as an adviser to Minnesota's Hazelden treatment  center.   I urge my colleagues to support this bill honoring an inspiring  American leader that proves that everyone deserves a second chance.   Madam Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 813, a bill that would name  an Albuquerque, New Mexico, post office after Jose Hernandez.   Mr. Hernandez enlisted in the Army after graduating from Arizona  State University and was then stationed in Germany and deployed to Iraq  in 2003.   After his discharge from the Army, Jose Hernandez moved to New Mexico  and began working at the U.S. Postal Service as a civil engineer and  letter carrier.   In 2009, he was tragically killed while protecting a mother in a  domestic dispute. He intervened to try to peacefully end the fight, but  was shot by the woman's son. His hometown mourns this tragic loss.   I urge my colleagues today to support this legislation honoring a  true American hero.   Madam Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 208, a bill to name a  Mississippi post office for Colonel Carlyle ``Smitty'' Harris.   Smitty Harris enlisted in the Air Force in 1951, and would later go  on to serve for 28 years as a pilot instructor, operations officer, and  faculty member at the Air War College.   In 1965, while on a combat mission over North Vietnam, Smitty's F-105  was struck and he was forced to bail out over North Vietnam where he  was captured.   He spent the next 8 years as a prisoner of war, where he was confined  in various prisons and tortured. During his time in prison, he is known  for creating the tap code, which POWs used to communicate secretly  between cells.   After nearly 8 years as a prisoner of war, he returned home to the  U.S. and to his loving family. His son called him his hero and role  model. But the truth is, he is every American's hero.   He has earned numerous medals and accolades for heroic service on  behalf our Nation. Those include: two Silver Star Medals, three Legion  of Merits, the Distinguished Flying Cross, two Bronze Stars for valor,  two Purple Hearts, and two Air Medals.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues today to support this legislation  in recognition of this great American hero, and I reserve the balance  of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Mississippi (Mr. Kelly).                                time  1645     Madam Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I am  prepared to close.
