 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Collins), my  friend, for yielding me the customary 30 minutes for debate.   Mr. Speaker, I stand here today with the rest of my Democratic  colleagues in utter amazement at the dizzying dysfunction exhibited by  our friends across the aisle. For reasons beyond understanding, we have  to vote on the reauthorization of section 702 of the Foreign  Intelligence Surveillance Act because late last year the Republican  leadership chose to prioritize massive tax cuts for their wealthy  donors over the safety of American citizens.                                time  1500    Like so many other important issues, House Republicans decided to  punt on the reauthorization of 702 by simply extending it to January 19  of this year, coincidentally, the same date the government will  possibly shut down.   Mr. Speaker, as a former judge and the former vice chairman of the  House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, I do occupy a unique  vantage point in the ongoing debate between the need to steadfastly  protect the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution while also ensuring  that those in the intelligence community have the tools they need to  keep our country safe from those who wish to do us grave harm.   Putting the finer points on this debate aside for a moment, I can  tell you with complete certainty that such a debate deserves to be  lengthy and thorough, neither of which have happened here.   I was concerned to learn, if not a bit dismayed, that the House  Intelligence subcommittee which has oversight jurisdiction of the  National Security Agency did not hold a single hearing on today's bill.  In fact, the full committee did not even hold a single hearing on this  important piece of legislation.   Think about that. As the Republicans approached the need to discuss  the reauthorization of one of the more important tools to fight  terrorism that, simultaneously, brings along legitimate and important  Fourth Amendment concerns, the majority, in all their wisdom, thought  it prudent to hold exactly zero hearings on such an important matter.  That is a brazenly inept way to govern.   To add insult to injury, I am told that members of the committee were  given about 36 hours to read the bill before having to vote it out of  committee.   A side note here: the bill they were given 36 hours to review is not  actually the bill we have before us today because the majority had to  use a Rules Committee print to fix some of the most troublesome parts  of the original bill in order to obtain my friend Ranking Member Adam  Schiff's support. Mr. Speaker, without a doubt, that support did not  come easily, and important changes were made to the bill as it was  presented to the committee in its original form.   For example, Mr. Schiff was able to ensure the Republicans' unmasking  language was removed from today's bill. The removal of such language  ensures that one of the Republicans' most heinous political stunts is  not codified into law. This was and is a significant improvement.   Moreover, the Republicans removed the controversial expansion of the  definition of ``agent of foreign power,'' which concerned privacy and  technology groups.   Today's bill also addresses what is known as ``abouts'' collection.  This is the collection of communications that are not to or from a  target but, rather, communications that merely reference the target.  The NSA, itself, shut down this collection method earlier this year.   The legislation before us today will allow such collection to resume,  but only if the NSA first devises a way of doing so that addresses  privacy concerns, obtains permission from the Foreign Intelligence  Surveillance Court, and Congress does not object after a 30-day review  period.   Now, this may seem to be a better option than what I am sure many, if  not most, Republicans wanted, which is the full-scale reimplementation  of ``abouts'' collection, but considering how much difficulty the  majority has in simply keeping the lights on around this place, I think  it is fair to question their ability to provide meaningful oversight in  just 30 days. Again, this is simply evidence for the need to return  back to regular order under which bills are fully and fairly  considered.   Regardless of where one comes down on this issue, I can assure you  that there are Members on both sides of the aisle that are sick and  tired of being shut out of important policy discussions concerning  subjects like those before us today.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the distinguished  gentlewoman from California (Ms. Lofgren), my friend from the Judiciary  Subcommittee on Immigration and Border Security.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I am amused by my friend from the Rules Committee's  assertion that today, because of protests with reference to DACA,  members of my party were protesting that concern.   I am also amused that they are in the majority, and she accuses us of  delaying, when, in fact, this measure was scheduled 2 or 3 months ago  and could have been brought to the floor, but, no, they were busy about  tax cuts, and so they didn't get around to allowing for this important  matter to be brought to the floor.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the gentlewoman from California  (Ms. Lofgren) to respond to the gentleman from Georgia.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee), the ranking member of the Judiciary  Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Security, and Investigations  and a good friend of mine.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentlewoman from Texas.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from Washington (Mr. Heck).    Mr. Speaker, I would advise that I have no further  speakers and I am prepared to close.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, the United States House of Representatives is known as  the people's House, yet the people's representatives continuously are  shut out of policy discussion after discussion. They are shut out of  writing bill after bill, and they are shut out of offering any  meaningful amendments.   Quite simply, Mr. Speaker, if the people's representatives are shut  out, then the people are shut out. If you look around at how the  majority is running this place, through a historically closed process,  the result is not at all pretty.   I have some advice for my Republican friends. If, like this side of  the aisle, you spent more time working on policies that help the  American people instead of the wealthy and rich corporations who are, I  might add, doing just fine, you would likely not only see more  legislative successes, but you would be able to spend more time on  important issues like this critically important issue, the extension of  section 702.   Mr. Speaker, as is clearly evident, Democrats remain ready to work in  a bipartisan manner to accomplish all that remains left to do for the  American people. We are ready to fund the government and provide for  smart investments for the future of our country.    We are ready to pull the hundreds of thousands of DREAMers out of  unnecessary limbo and provide them with the status they deserve. We are  ready to go forward with comprehensive immigration. We are ready to  provide the funding and authorization needed to give millions of low- income children the health insurance they need. We are ready to fix our  roads and our bridges and our railways and air trafficking. We are here  and waiting, but time is running out.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote on the rule, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
