 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to remember the life of  Jennifer Irvine. She attended the Route 91 festival in Las Vegas on  October 1.   Jennifer Irvine devoted her life and career to defending people in  family court and criminal court. She opened her own law firm in  downtown San Diego, California, where she worked tirelessly to defend  each of her clients.   In her free time, Jennifer loved snowboarding, hot yoga, cats, and  sailing. She had even earned a black belt in tae kwon do. She hoped to  one day learn indoor rock climbing and to later experience skydiving.   Jennifer is remembered by all those who knew her as loyal, fierce,  and passionate. She had a genuine devotion for helping people and was  always driven to be her best self.   I would like to extend my condolences to Jennifer Irvine's family and  friends. Please note that the city of Las Vegas, the State of Nevada,  and the whole country grieve with you.                            ____________________
