 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    First, Mr. President, I would like to speak about the  upcoming vote on the Equal Rights Amendment.   As we all know, the story of American democracy has been a hard but  inexorable march toward greater equality--equality regardless of race,  equality regardless of social status, equality regardless of marital  status, and equality regardless of sex. That march began at the  founding of our country, when Abigail Adams reminded her husband to  ``remember the ladies'' when drafting the Constitution, which fell,  unfortunately, on deaf ears.   It was a march that drew great numbers during the convention at  Seneca Falls, NY, in 1848, and found expression in the abolitionist  movement. That march took a bold step 100 years ago, when Alice Paul  and Crystal Eastman drafted the original iteration of the Equal Rights  Amendment and came before Congress for the first time.   Let that great march toward equality take the next bold step today  when the Senate votes to take up this bipartisan resolution on the ERA.   This resolution is as necessary as it is timely. America can never  hope to be a land of freedom and opportunity so long as half its  population is treated like second-class citizens.   So 100 years after the ERA first came to Congress, the work is not  done. The fight has yet to be won. The march continues. And we have a  chance to take this next step forward.   The resolution is simple. It removes the arbitrary deadline for State  ratification of the ERA that was imposed in the 1970s.   Today, 38 States have ratified the ERA, as required by the  Constitution.  [[Page S1404]]  But because two States acted only recently, after the deadline set by  Congress, the ERA remains unratified.   Today's resolution says this deadline shall be in effect no more and,  by doing so, recognizes that a sufficient number of States have now  acted for the ERA to become the 28th Amendment to the U.S.  Constitution.   There is no good reason--none--for this Chamber, this Congress, and  this Nation to bind itself to limitations set 50 years ago. The  Constitution itself imposes no such barrier. By keeping this barrier in  place--this 7-year barrier--all we are doing is needlessly obeying  skewed rules set by politicians who are long gone and whose views ought  not to rule the day any longer.    In 2023, we should move forward to ratify the ERA with all due haste  because, if you look at the terrible things happening to women's rights  in this country, it is clear we must act. To the horror of hundreds of  millions of American people, women in America have far fewer rights  today than they did even a year ago. The protections of Roe v. Wade are  gone, thanks to the MAGA majority on the Supreme Court. Over a dozen  States have near-total abortion bans and millions of people have to  travel hundreds of miles just to access reproductive care. That is  sickening.   That is why the Senate, today, should vote in favor of advancing this  ERA resolution so we can bring our Nation one step closer to greater  justice, greater equality, and a more perfect union.   Again, let that great march toward equality take the next bold step  today.   I thank Senators Cardin and Murkowski, as our lead sponsors--it is a  bipartisan bill--and all Members who have championed this resolution. I  will proudly vote yes on this measure.                        Limit, Save, Grow Act of 2023    Mr. President, now on default, yesterday, House Republicans passed,  through the narrowest possible margin, a bill that amounts to a little  more than a hard-right ransom note to the American people.   Republicans' ``Default on America Act,'' DOA, cannot possibly be  called a real ``plan'' for resolving the default crisis. The DOA reads  more like a threat coming directly from the House Freedom Caucus:  Either Republicans will force a default on the debt, or they will force  steep cuts, highly unpopular with the American people, for law  enforcement, veterans, families, teachers, and kids.   Let's be perfectly clear. The Republicans' ``Default on America Act''  does nothing to actually resolve the looming debt crisis, and it has no  hope of ever becoming law. If anything, the House's actions have made  the likelihood of default more likely. It locks the House into an  unacceptable position and pulls us even further apart.   This shows the real solution is a clean, bipartisan plan to avoid  default. It is the same one both parties have adopted many times  before. That is the solution, not this ``Default on America Act'' that  is going nowhere.   If Republicans want to sell this terrible agenda to the American  people, they should make their case in talks about the budget and  appropriations, where it belongs, not by using the full faith and  credit of the United States as a hostage.   Let me say that again. The Republicans' ``Default on America Act''  does nothing to resolve the default crisis and, in fact, makes it only  more likely. The ``Default on America Act,'' which the House just  passed, is not a step forward but rather a costly step backward.   Speaker McCarthy has claimed for months he wants to negotiate on  avoiding default, but, according to reports, he is saying the opposite  behind closed doors.   Per at least one GOP House Member, Speaker McCarthy called this  radical bill ``a floor, not a ceiling.'' That is what he told the hard- right Members whose votes he needed. The Speaker has reportedly  promised his right flank that, moving forward, he will oppose any  measure that doesn't have every single hard-right priority considered  in this bill.   In other words, to say this bill is ``a floor, not a ceiling'' is a  threat to make the GOP bill even more extreme and avoid any  alternative.   If these reports are true--and Speaker McCarthy has made clear he has  no intention of negotiating--the Speaker can't say his bill is ``a  floor, not a ceiling'' and also claim he wants to negotiate. This is  rather a hostage-taking tactic, and this ``Default on America Act'' is  the ransom note forced on us by a hard-right, unrepresentative small  group in the House of Representatives who have leverage because of the  rules there.   The GOP should realize that the American people will object to steep  cuts to education, law enforcement, veterans' care, and border security  that the DOA bill proposes.   So for all the effort the GOP spent trying to pass their bill,  unfortunately, we are not any further along to resolving the debt  ceiling crisis, and, if anything, we have taken a costly step backward.   It all brings us back to the place where we have been since the very  beginning. The only real solution to avoiding a catastrophic default is  the same solution that both parties have adopted in the past: Come  together for a clean plan to avoid default, with no ransom notes, no  ``floors,'' and no brinksmanship.   Democrats will not allow this ``Default on America Act'' to become  law.                               SAFE Banking Act    Mr. President, finally on safe banking, yesterday, Senators from both  sides of the aisle--I met with them repeatedly--reintroduced the SAFE  Banking Act.   SAFE Banking would ensure cannabis businesses that operate in States  with legal cannabis have equal access to critical banking  infrastructure. Clearly, this bill has provisions particularly aimed at  helping minority business owners who are at a critical disadvantage in  the cannabis industry.   Right now, the norm for the cannabis businesses is to operate on all  cash, and that is simply not fair. It exposes them to too many risks  and stifles their opportunities to grow.   Congress should be in the business of promoting entrepreneurs,  promoting job growth, not holding these things back.   I have worked very hard to make progress in SAFE Banking Plus, and  the work will continue, but I have also made it clear that one of my  top priorities to ensure SAFE Banking passes is that it contain  critical criminal justice provisions--most importantly, expunging  criminal records for certain low-level marijuana offenses.   We have a moral responsibility in Congress to undo the terrible  damage caused by the War on Drugs. It almost always has affected people  of color. So I am going to work very hard with my colleagues to make  sure criminal justice provisions are a part of SAFE Banking when it  reaches the floor.   I thank all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle. We have met  numerous times, and I think everyone is working in good faith,  including Senators Merkley, Daines, Brown, Sullivan, and Paul--a  bipartisan group if there ever was one.   I look forward to working with my colleagues--Democrat and  Republican--to make progress on SAFE Banking Plus this Congress, and I  hope this portends more bipartisan cooperation on future cannabis  legislation.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I enter a motion to reconsider.    Mr. President, let me explain. I switched my vote to no,  not because I am not strongly for ERA--I wanted to bring it to the  floor--but it will allow us to go back and cast a vote again in the  future. This issue is too important, so we are not giving up. So I am  moving to reconsider so I can bring it back up at a later time.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
