 Madam President, first let me say a word to my colleague  from Tennessee.   It is good to see you, and it is a good social distance. I thank you  for your presentation. We may not agree on everything, but we do agree  on some things, and we are working together on the issues that affect  Tennessee, Illinois, and many other places, to increase the number of  medical professionals available in small towns and rural America.   As we go through this public health crisis, it reminds us that we  need to keep focused on that, and she and I will continue to work on  that. I thank her for her bipartisan cooperation. That is a timely  issue with or without the current crisis we face, and I look forward to  her successful completion on that bipartisan issue.   Madam President, my daughter called me yesterday from New York and  talked about her first day in the classroom. You see, our grandkids go  to public schools in Brooklyn, and they are, of course, closed, and the  kids are back home. Well, yesterday was the first day there was to be  remote learning using laptop computers. So my son-in-law took my  grandson and my daughter took my granddaughter into separate rooms and  spent 3 or 4 hours in that made-up classroom. My daughter said: This is  harder than I ever imagined.   So it is a reminder, No. 1, of how much we owe it to teachers every  single day, and not with 1 child, usually with more than 1-15 to 30 in  a classroom. Let us also remember that the learning process is  critically important as we go through this health crisis. I hope all  parents will try--I know my daughter and her husband are trying--to  help the kids keep up with their learning process. In some places, it  is hard. Kids don't have access to computers or may not have remote- learning possibilities. But it is something that is essential, and I  thank the teachers and school districts that are trying to put it  together.   Janice Jackson, who is the head of the Chicago Public Schools, called  me just a few days ago, and we talked about how they were implementing  this in the city of Chicago and how they are trying to distribute  school lunches. It is an awesome responsibility.   Let's give special thanks to those who are working overtime to try to  make sure our kids can keep up with the learning process and some of  the basics in life, like feeding them to make sure they have something  for lunch and breakfast, if not more.   I can go through the long list of people to thank, which I have done  before, starting with those in healthcare--nurses, doctors, lab  technicians, and others working in senior citizen facilities, our first  responders, and many like them. Let us not forget that every single day  while we isolate, they are forced to break isolation and to come to  help those in need, and we can never thank them enough.   So what is going on in the U.S. Senate? If you hear the other side of  the aisle, there is a suggestion that we lost our opportunity, that we  are wasting time and nothing is happening. They argue that we have had  two votes in a row--Sunday afternoon and then yesterday--to decide not  to debate on the floor the McConnell bill which was produced. The  argument is that we can't waste a second, that we need to get to the  serious business of helping people across America and turning our  economy around.   I just want to say for the record that I left the office not 30 or 40  feet away of the Democratic leader, Senator Schumer. I didn't go and  see him because he is in active negotiations at this minute with  Treasury Secretary Mnuchin, representing the White House. He is in  communication with the Speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi, about the  progress being made, and, as he said on the floor yesterday, he feels  positive and optimistic about the outcome. I do too.   This is an awesome undertaking. Consider for a minute that the bill  we are trying to style and craft literally is larger than 1 year's  Federal budget for domestic discretionary spending, and we are doing it  in a matter of days. When it comes to the Federal budget, we spend a  year--sometimes longer--putting it together. In this case, we are  writing a bill of that magnitude in a matter of days because it is a  compelling challenge and should happen.   The argument on the other side of the aisle is that we wasted our  opportunity here, that we should have agreed to the McConnell bill that  was brought forward for a vote on Sunday and got on with it. But many  understood that there was a fundamental flaw in the process Senator  McConnell started.   When he suggested that we needed this third bill, it was after we had  passed two previous bills.   The first one, the President asked, if you will remember--it seems  like ancient history--about 3 weeks ago, the President asked for $2  billion to deal with coronavirus. Many of us thought that was totally  inadequate, and we put our heads together on a bipartisan basis with  the President and raised it to $8 billion. We did it in a timely way,  and we did it in a bipartisan fashion. It probably shocked people  across America who have limited high regard for Congress to start with.   Quickly thereafter came a need for another bill. We upped the amount  from $8 billion to $100 billion in that second bill. It passed in the  early morning hours of last Saturday--just last Saturday. What happened  in the Senate? Well, the Senate didn't move on the bill until Wednesday  of last week. So we are talking about waiting 4 days when we could have  considered the bill in the Senate and didn't move forward with it  because we didn't have consent requested or given. But it has been done  that way before. It doesn't have to physically make it across the  rotunda. So 4 days passed, and last Wednesday, Senator McConnell called  for this vote, and it passed--$100 billion.   Then he announced we would start crafting this third bill. If you  notice the calendar days we are facing here, it hasn't been a week  since that announcement, and we are considering a bill of the size and  magnitude the likes of which we have never seen in a single  undertaking. It is a bill for authorization and appropriation that may  range somewhere north of $1.5 trillion. Why is it that big? Because the  problem is that big, if not larger. That is why we are trying to do  this the right way.   When Senator Schumer was told by Senator McConnell we were moving  toward this third bill, his first response was the right one: Let's do  it as we did with the first two. Let's have a bipartisan, bicameral  approach. He suggested bringing together the four corners, as we call  them here--the Democratic and Republican leaders of the House and  Senate, together with the White House, sitting down at the table to  craft this bill.   Senator McConnell refused. He said: We will start this as an  exclusively Republican Senate bill. We will ask our task forces to  write something. We will get back to the Democrats in the Senate later.   No mention was made of the involvement of the House.   Well, after some 48 hours, we were presented with the proposal from  the Republican side. In fairness, there were parts of it that were  bipartisan in the McConnell bill. I think of the effort that Senator  Cardin of Maryland and Senator Rubio of Florida put into the whole  question of dealing with small business and the problems that they are  facing with this massive public health crisis. They have come up with  what I consider a good approach--a good approach that literally could  help 50 to 60 million small businesses across America. There were  others involved in the conversation--Senator Wyden, Senator Graham, and  others. It was bipartisan--start to finish--and I believe we are this  close to coming up with this bipartisan proposal.   However, the other provisions in the McConnell bill were not as  bipartisan, and there reached a point where Senator McConnell announced  that that was the end of the story. He was bringing the McConnell bill  to the floor without further negotiation. That came as a surprise  because there were elements that the Democrats were asking for and  insisting on that really were fundamental.  [[Page S1982]]    So a vote was taken this last Sunday afternoon, and we decided, as a  caucus, to argue on the Democratic side that there were fundamental  elements missing in the McConnell proposal and we wanted to include  them. So we voted no in going forward on the McConnell proposal.   At that point, we didn't stalk off and fold our arms and say: That is  it; we are not part of the process. Senator Schumer and the leaders in  our caucus did exactly the opposite. We sat down with the White House,  with the Treasury Secretary, and started engaging on those issues of  importance, and, within a few hours, we involved the Speaker of the  House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi.   Time and again, I have noticed over the last several days that  Senator McConnell and others have come to the floor and complained that  Speaker Pelosi was part of this negotiation process. If you go back to  that pamphlet of how laws are made, you understand that this is not a  unicameral legislature. Both the House and the Senate need to pass a  measure for it to be sent to the President. So the involvement of the  House leaders--starting, of course, with the majority, Speaker Pelosi,  and including Mr. McCarthy of California, representing the minority--is  an integral part of this process, and it should be. I don't understand  why it is so unnerving for so many Republican leaders to consider  sitting down at a table with this woman from California who happens to  be the Speaker of the House and the leader of the majority, who is  essential if we are going to get this done in a timely way. I think she  should be part of it.   She has been following the progress that is being made with Senator  Schumer, Mr. Mnuchin, and Senator McConnell. She has made positive  statements in the hopes that we can reach a point where we have a  bipartisan agreement, and that would speed this up, as it should be. So  we involved the House of Representatives in this conversation at the  earliest stage, not after we have finished the Republican measure that  Senator McConnell wanted to bring to the floor, but after we have  completed a bipartisan measure that is one that she may be able to take  to the House of Representatives for consideration and maybe even a  unanimous consent on the floor.   So what are the items that we are now negotiating, and where do they  stand? The first item--and we made it clear on the Democratic side-- that is essential is that we deal with the healthcare system across  America. The Governor of New York, Governor Cuomo, announced yesterday  that he wishes that every hospital in New York would increase its  capacity by 50 percent. Then, he went on to say: I really mean 100  percent. But 50 percent is so that they have enough bed space for those  who are likely to come in seeking help facing this COVID-19 virus. We  can understand that if a great State like New York--and even Illinois,  for that matter--has to anticipate this dramatic increase in patients,  our system could be easily overwhelmed.   So the Democrats have said from day one that we want to make that the  highest priority in this third bill. We want to make sure we put money  in there for hospitals and for healthcare to respond to this crisis,  and I will tell you that progress has been made. Since the negotiation  between Senator Schumer and Treasury Secretary Mnuchin has been under  way, we have made progress, and I hope that if we can hold it, we will  have a dramatic increase in the amount of money that was originally in  the McConnell bill for this purpose when it comes to hospitals.   I also want to say a word about the unemployment insurance. This is a  proposal that comes from the Democratic side but has been embraced by  many Republicans as well, and the notion behind it is that those  workers who cannot go to work, because there is no work to be done or  they have been furloughed or lost their jobs, would have access to the  highest levels of unemployment compensation in our Nation's history.  Now, we think that this is a significant change and even a significant  restructuring of unemployment insurance to reflect the current crisis  we face.   I don't run away from this issue of restructuring. I have heard many  Republican critics, but when it comes to unemployment insurance, we  are, in fact, restructuring it. The payments that were generally made  in my State of Illinois and in other States were just not sufficient  for those to maintain a family and pay their bills during times of  economic crisis. So we have started moving toward an amount for  individual workers closer to what they were paid at work, and we  believe that this should be done over a long period of time. To say 3  months is enough may be a rosy scenario, which we hope will occur, but  it may not. We want to give these workers the assurance that they can  keep their families together and pay their basic bills, even if they  are not going to work because of this public health crisis, which we  are facing.   Is that restructuring? I think it is. Is it necessary? Certainly, it  is, and it has been agreed to on a bipartisan basis. That is one of the  things that we don't believe the McConnell bill, originally proposed to  us on Sunday, really addressed in a fulsome and complete way.   We have made it our kind of standard on the Democratic side to make  certain that we measure every proposal for economic recovery against  the workers and working families of America--not what it does in the  boardroom but what it does in the family room of individual families  who still get those bills in the mail and still face the pressures of  being out of work and wondering if there is enough money to get by.   We know that a majority of Americans do not have savings of $400 or  more. Many of them live week to week, not paycheck to paycheck, and we  want to make certain that they have that peace of mind. We have  measured every proposal for economic recovery against working families  in America and against the individual workers and the challenges they  face.   There has been a complaint that we raised the issue of collective  bargaining. We want to make certain that when we give money to  corporations, it does not change the status of the workers whom they  have bargained with over the years. We are going to wait, of course,  for another day to consider future contracts and work contracts, but  for the time being, we want to make certain that whatever money is  going into the corporation respects the existing rights of workers  under their collective bargaining agreements. I don't think that is a  radical notion. Corporations are going to continue to operate under the  laws of America. I think that the workers should be entitled to the  rights that have been granted to them under their collective bargaining  agreements, and that is basically the bottom line for us when it comes  to collective bargaining   When it comes to loans to corporations, that is where we have a  serious problem with the McConnell bill. There was a provision in  Senator McConnell's bill, which he calls a bipartisan bill--and I  acknowledge that, in part, it was--but there was a provision that was  far from bipartisan. It was a provision which said when it came to  loaning money to corporations, the Treasury Secretary could waive the  disclosure of that loan for up to 6 months. That is unacceptable to me,  and it was to most of us on the Democratic side.   We believe that if billions of dollars are flowing through the  decision of the Treasury Secretary to individual corporations, there  should be transparency and accountability: Who is receiving the money,  under what conditions, and what is going to happen with the money that  is being sent--taxpayer money that is being sent--for this purpose?   So we have insisted, as we sit down in negotiation here, for this  accountability and transparency when it comes to these massive  amounts--billions of dollars--that could be transferred by the decision  of one person in the administration. I don't think that is too much to  ask. We should be held accountable as Members of the Senate and the  House of Representatives for the money that is appropriated when we  allocate it, and the administration should be held to the same basic  standard.   We also believe that when it comes to the basic standards, we have  been burned once and don't want to be burned a second time. For those  of us who voted for past legislation to give money to corporations, we  want to make certain that that is for the good of the economy and the  good of the  [[Page S1983]]  workers. Sadly, in the past, we have seen, under tax bills and other  provisions that were supposed to benefit the economy, that they ended  up being a windfall for executives and corporations in terms of stock  buybacks and dividends. Yes, we are holding a standard that buybacks  should not be part of the future of any corporate assistance. We should  be dealing with this to help the workers and help the economy but not  to line the pockets of those who are at the highest levels of corporate  governance. I don't think that is a radical idea. I think most  Americans agree with it, and it is one of the things that we continue  to argue for.   I see my friend Senator Carper has come to the floor. We served in  the House of Representatives together, and then he took a little  vacation and became Governor of the State of Delaware and then returned  to service at the Federal level in the Senate. He knows, as all of us  do, that Governors across the United States and mayors and presidents  of county boards, for example, are making exceptional sacrifices to  fight this battle against this coronavirus. They are spending a lot  more money on public health matters than they ever anticipated. They  are seeing more claims at our State level for unemployment insurance  than they have seen in history, and many of them are facing fiscal  budgetary problems because of it. It is so obvious. We have seen  dramatic leadership when it comes to the Governors.   One of our colleagues of the House, Mike DeWine, now the Republican  Governor of Ohio, has made some, I think, significant, important, and  good decisions for his State. Some of those have involved more spending  by the State of Ohio than he ever could have anticipated. The same  thing is true for J.B. Pritzker in the State of Illinois. I talk to him  virtually every single day. We text many times during the day, and I  know that he is spending money that he thinks is necessary to save  lives in Illinois.   So the point I am making is that we want to make sure that the bill  that emerges helps State and local governments with the fiscal problems  they face because of this economic and healthcare crisis. I don't think  that is unreasonable. I think it is the right thing to do, and I hope  that we can include it. That is why the original proposal in the  McConnell bill did not go far enough and why we have continued to  negotiate up to this minute   I might raise an issue of difference between myself and the Senator  from Tennessee, who was on the floor just a few moments ago. She had  suggested that we shouldn't involve ourselves in issues that really  have nothing to do with COVID-19, and she used as an example the  administration and execution of elections.   Well, I will tell you, we went into a debate just a week or so ago in  Illinois as to whether to go forward with the primary election. We  decided in Illinois to do it, and it wasn't easy at all. They decided  in Ohio to postpone the primary election. The point I am getting to is  that the conduct and timing of elections relates directly to COVID-19,  whether there are enough people who will be able to vote and enough  people to serve as judges in polling places.   So I don't know if that is being debated in the other room, but we  should bring that issue up, because we want to make sure that, in this  democracy, the most fundamental element of a free and democratic  election is going to occur. I encourage all of my friends and family to  vote by mail and vote early. We can do it in our State. In some States  you can't. I hope we can find a mechanism to guarantee that elections  really do reflect the sentiment of the American populace.   Is that related to COVID-19? You bet it is. It is basic. And whether  it is included in this bill or in a later bill, I don't think we should  ignore it.   Finally, let me say a word about the President's press conference  last evening. I watched it, and I watched it because the news reports  leading up to it raised a question as to whether the President was  going to change America's strategy when it comes to dealing with this  coronavirus. The current strategy, of course, is social distance, to  make sure that you are isolating yourself as much as possible, and when  in the presence of others, you don't stand too close, and wash your  hands over and over. Those are the fundamentals. I mean, we hear those  recommendations, and I think they are sound.   But now there is a suggestion from the President that we may take a  different course. I don't know what he will finally decide, but I will  stand with the public health experts--Dr. Fauci and others--who believe  that the best way to slow the growth of this infection rate in our  country is by using some form of social distance and isolation of  individuals and families. It is a great personal sacrifice and burden  for many families to go through this, I know, but if, at the end of the  day, we can reduce the number of people who suffer or die from this  virus, it is worth the sacrifice, as far as I am concerned.   Presidents, in times of national crisis, are expected to be credible,  with clarity and consistency. I hope the President will remember that  as he makes his decision on policy.   Don't follow somebody talking on cable TV and their recommendations.  Follow the experts in public health who have dedicated their lives to  saving the lives of others. Even though it may not be politically  popular to continue with this current social distancing, it is an  approach which I believe has been proven in many other countries around  the world to work successfully.   The notion that we are doing damage to our economy, of course, is  being heard. The number of unemployment claims may reach historic and  record-breaking highs, but the fact is, if we don't deal with the  underlying cause of our economic chaos, and that is this virus, and  deal with it effectively, sadly, we are going to see the economic  situation in this country deteriorate even more in the future.   I am going to close my bottom line with this: We believe that the  first two measures passed related to COVID-19 were done in a timely and  bipartisan manner. They have been done in an effort to make sure the  American people know that we can overcome our political differences and  actually come together in a bipartisan way to serve this Nation, as we  were sworn to do.    There have been differences along the way. This bill that we are  currently considering is one of such magnitude that we have never seen  anything like it in the history of Congress in terms of the dollar  amounts that are being debated now. We want to make certain that we do  everything in good faith that we can to have a good negotiation and a  bipartisan negotiation involving the House, the Senate, and the White  House in the hopes that we can get this done and come up with a truly  bipartisan package.   The original bill--I mentioned four or five particulars--was lacking,  from our point of view. I am happy to report that, in most of these, we  have made progress since the early decision not to move forward with  the McConnell bill. But there is more work to do.   I think it is naive to believe this is the last piece of legislation  that will be needed. We don't know where America will stand in 30, 60,  or 90 days. But whatever it takes--whatever it takes--we need to come  together as a nation, put aside political differences, and agree on a  strategy that serves the best interests of families across our country,  red and blue States alike, and do it here in Washington as well.   Engaging the House of Representatives in the earliest stages of these  negotiations just makes common sense. Whatever we agree to here has to  head over to the House of Representatives for approval as well. So  let's involve the Speaker, involve the Republican leader in the House-- the four corners that Senator Schumer asked for at the earliest stage  of this conversation. To me, that is the best way to achieve it.   For those who see an empty Chamber and wonder if work is being done,  as I mentioned earlier, just across the hallway, Senator Schumer, who  may come to the floor in a moment to give us an update, has been  negotiating around the clock with the White House and with Senator  McConnell to come up with a better bipartisan package to move forward  from this point.   I am going to close now with just one point I would like to make, and  that is that many of my colleagues are joining Senator Portman and me  in cosponsoring what we have called the remote voting amendment in the  Senate rules. It is complex because it is the first of its kind where  we are discussing using  [[Page S1984]]  modern technology to meet our constitutional responsibilities and  obligations. The reason, of course, is obvious. We shouldn't be  gathering on the floor in groups. We have been warned by the Centers  for Disease Control not to do that. Yet we do it because we have very  few alternatives.   So I am hoping we can work with the Parliamentarian and with the  officers of the Senate to come up with something that is bipartisan,  makes sense, and protects the integrity of voting on the floor of the  U.S. Senate.   We need to do our jobs, even in times of national crisis, whether it  is a public health crisis or a threat of terrorism. Let us devise a  way--let's work hard on it--that both the Senate and, I hope, the House  can agree on that respects the rules and traditions of the Senate but  gives us options that make more sense in this time of special peril.   I yield the floor.                      Recognition of the Minority Leader
