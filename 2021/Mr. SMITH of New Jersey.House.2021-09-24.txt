 For the first time ever by Congressional  statute, this legislation would legally enable the violent death of  unborn baby girls and boys by dismemberment, decapitation, forced  expulsion from the womb, and deadly poisons for any reason until birth.   This bill will nullify every modest pro-life restriction ever enacted  by the States, including women's right-to-know laws in 35 States,  parental involvement statutes in 37 States, pain  [[Page H5148]]  capable unborn child protection laws in 19 States, waiting period laws  in 26 States, and more.   This bill constitutes an existential threat to unborn babies.    Madam Speaker, this bill is far outside the American mainstream and  goes far beyond Roe v. Wade.   This bill constitutes an existential threat to unborn children and to  the value of life itself.   For the first time ever by congressional statute, H.R. 3755 would  legally enable the violent death of unborn baby girls and boys by  dismemberment, decapitation, forced expulsion from the womb, deadly  poisons, or other methods at any time until birth.   A significant majority of Americans are deeply concerned about  protecting the lives of unborn children.   A 2021 Marist Poll found that 65 percent of Americans want Roe v.  Wade reinterpreted to either send the issue to the states or stop  legalized abortion.   Of that 65 percent majority of Americans--40 percent of Democrats  would ``allow certain restrictions on abortions as determined by each  state.''   If enacted, this bill will nullify every modest prolife restriction  ever enacted by the states including: women's right to know laws in 35  states; parental involvement statues in 37 states; pain capable unborn  child protection laws in 19 states; and waiting period laws in 26  states, and more.   Seventy percent of Americans, according to the 2021 Marist poll,  oppose abortion if the child will be born with Down syndrome--with over  half of those who identify as pro-choice (56 percent), opposed, or  strongly opposed to abortion due to the expectation a child will be  born with Down syndrome. Americans seek to ``embrace'' and not  ``erase'' those babies identified as having an extra chromosome.   H.R. 3755 overturns state laws that protect children with Down  syndrome as well.   The U.S. Supreme Court majority in Roe v. Wade wrote: ``We need not  resolve the difficult question of when human life begins.''  Sidestepping that threshold question and giving no benefit of the doubt  to the child, they went on to legalize and enable abortion on demand.   For decades, abortion advocates have gone to extraordinary lengths to  ignore, trivialize, and cover-up the battered baby-victim.   But today, thanks to ultrasound, unborn babies are more visible than  ever before.   Modern medicine today treats unborn children with disability or  disease as a patient in need of diagnosis and treatment.   Birth is an event--albeit an important one--but not the beginning of  life.   Regarding international law, the bill falsely states that ``Core  human rights treaties ratified by the United States protect access to  abortion.''   In fact, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights,  which the U.S. has ratified, is concerned about unborn children being  killed. It states in Article 6 that ``Every human being has the  inherent right to life'' and that ``No one shall be arbitrarily  deprived of his life.''   It goes on to declare that the ``sentence of death . . . shall not be  carried out on pregnant women.'' The ICCPR creates an exemption from  execution for pregnant women, recognizing that their unborn children  have an independent claim to legal protection, as do all unborn  children.   The legislation under consideration by the House today is deceptively  titled the Women's Health Protection Act of 2021. Abortion is not  health care unless one construes the precious life of an unborn child  to be analogous to a tumor to be excised or a disease to be vanquished.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding. I thank him for his leadership. And I thank the gentlewoman  from Washington (Mrs. Rodgers) for her extraordinary efforts on behalf  of the unborn. It has been, frankly, a team effort, and what a team.   Mr. Speaker, the legislation under consideration by the House today  is deceptively titled the Women's Health Protection Act of 2021.

A significant majority of Americans are deeply concerned about  protecting  [[Page H5166]]  the lives of unborn children. A 2021 Marist poll found that 65 percent  of Americans want Roe v. Wade reinterpreted by either sending the issue  back to the States, or to stop legalized abortion. Of that 65 percent  majority of Americans, 40 percent of Democrats would ``allow certain  restrictions on abortions as determined by each State.''   If enacted, this bill will nullify nearly every modest pro-life  restriction ever enacted by the States, including Women's Right to Know  laws in 35 States, parental involvement statutes in 37 States, the  pain-capable unborn child protection laws in 19 States, waiting periods  in 26 States, and so much more.   Seventy percent of Americans, Mr. Speaker, according to the 2021  Marist poll, oppose abortion if the child will be born with Down  syndrome. Of over half of those who identify as pro-choice, 56 percent  oppose or are strongly opposed to abortion due to the expectation the  child will be born with Down syndrome.   Americans seek to embrace and not erase those babies identified as  having an extra chromosome.   H.R. 3755, however, overturns State laws that protect children with  Down syndrome.                                time  1300    Regarding international law, the bill falsely states that: ``Core  human rights treaties ratified by the United States protect access to  abortion.''   That is absolutely untrue. In fact, the International Covenant on  Civil and Political Rights, which the United States has ratified, is  concerned about unborn children being killed. It states, in Article 6,  that ``every human being has the inherent right to life'' and that ``no  one shall be arbitrarily deprived of his life.''   It goes on to declare that the sentence of death--in other words,  capital punishment--shall not be carried out on pregnant women. Why?  The ICCPR creates an exemption from execution for pregnant women,  recognizing that their unborn children have an independent claim to  legal protection, as do all unborn children.   Many women have been seriously harmed by abortion. The Silent No More  Awareness Campaign and many other initiatives throughout this country-- and this never gets reported on by the press, never gets focused upon  so people are more aware of this help out there, both within the church  as well as in a nonsectarian point of view, to help women who are post- abortive and who are suffering and suffering so immensely.   A few years ago, Linda Shrewsbury, an academic African American with  a degree from Harvard, who had an abortion, said at an event right here  on Capitol Hill: ``The lies that brought me to that day and to its  sorrowful aftermath are crystal clear in my mind--falsehoods and  deceptions that concealed the truth about abortion. Lies planted in my  thinking by clever marketing and media campaigns and endless repetition  led to a tragic, irreversible decision--the death of my first child.''   She goes on to say: ``I really didn't understand back then. At age  20, I had no inkling of the mental and emotional darkness I was about  to enter. I couldn't have grasped the immense psychological toll''  abortion ``would take for years and into the future--unrelenting tears,  guilt, shame, and depression. After spending many years in denial, I  did eventually find healing.   ``When I understood and rejected distortions about fetal development,  doublespeak about choice, rights, and planned and wanted children, I  understood the reality and victimhood of my aborted child.   ``I understood the absence of moral basis for choosing to disentitle  an innocent human being of life. When I embraced the truth, the truth  set me free, and I, finally, gained inner peace.''   She goes on to say: ``It is past time to lance the national wound of  abortion with truth. The high culture--thought leaders, media,  celebrities--that brought us abortion seem vested beyond extraction. I  dreamed of the volcano of abortion truth that could erupt one day from  the grassroots--women and men and their relatives witnessing to their  suppressed emotion, unspoken trauma, and lived pain. With abortion  denial ended, we as a society could then reconnect with reality and  life.''   Mr. Speaker, the United States Supreme Court majority in 1973, in Roe  v. Wade, wrote, in pertinent part: ``We need not resolve the difficult  question of when human life begins.'' Sidestepping that threshold  question and giving no benefit of the doubt to the child, they went on  to legalize and enable abortion on demand.   For decades, right up to this very moment, abortion advocates have  gone to extraordinary lengths to ignore, trivialize, and cover up the  battered baby victim. But today, thanks to ultrasound, unborn babies  are more visible than ever before.   When a woman is carrying a child, the first baby pictures, those that  often end up on the refrigerator in celebration, are of the ultrasound  pictures, not of the newborns--they follow later--but the ultrasound  pictures of that little boy or that little girl or the twins.   Today, science informs us that birth is an event--albeit a very  important one--but an event in the life of a child. It is not the  beginning of life.   Modern medicine today also treats unborn children with disability or  disease as a patient in need of diagnosis and treatment. There has been  an explosion in interventions that have saved children's lives and  mitigated many, many problems that they may face when the disability,  for example, was not caught early.   Unborn babies are society's youngest patients and deserve benign,  life-affirming medical interventions. All unborn babies deserve our  respect and our love, not death by abortion.    Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend from  Texas for his leadership.   I do believe and see this--I know it is not represented on the floor  of this House when it comes to our good friends and colleagues on the  Democrat side, but there is a serious movement in the direction of  embracing life, including the unborn child.   Like I said, some of those polls that have come out in recent days,  if you just ask the question pro-choice versus pro-life, you don't get  much insight. But when you break it down under what circumstances that  child's life could be lost to abortion, huge majorities--not just for  late-term abortion opposition--but huge majorities in America are  clearly trending in favor of life. That is, like I mentioned, those  with Down syndrome, 70 percent want that child to be given life. For  those who are without Down syndrome, there are huge majorities as well.   On funding, not only the Marist poll but the other polls show as well  that 6 out of 10 Americans do not want their taxpayer dollars being  used for funding of abortion.   Just a few weeks ago, we passed legislation and appropriations bills,  during the summer, that are pending over on the Senate side that would  eviscerate the Hyde amendment, an amendment I first offered in 1983  called the Federal Employees Health Benefits  [[Page H5167]]  Program Abortion Ban, legislation to say that taxpayers don't want to  be complicit in, as I said before, chemical poisoning, dismemberment  abortions, the methods that are used routinely by the abortionists to  kill that baby.   It is an assault on life. It is an assault on the weakest and the  most vulnerable. We need to be caring for the weakest and most  vulnerable.   You hold a child in your hand, and especially if you go to a NICU and  look at these preemies--and you know that personally, Mr. Gohmert,  through your personal experience. You look at those children, and they  are in desperate need of love and concern and good medical  interventions that affirm their life and not take it. They are just so  helpless.   You know, all the glib talk about choice--choice to do what? Kill a  baby. I think we have to be so honest.   As I said with Linda's story--and there are thousands of stories like  that of women who have been harmed. Often, there is relief when the  abortion is over--not all the time. But it kicks in over time, either  whatever method was used or just how old would that child be today.   The beauty of these outreaches to post-abortive women is that they  are nonjudgmental. It is all about loving the woman and helping the  woman. My wife, Marie, and I know many post-abortive women.   Alveda King, the niece of Dr. Martin Luther King, had two abortions.  She is now strongly pro-life, and she made the statement in a speech  where she asked how we can honor the legacy and the dream of her uncle,  Martin Luther King, if we murder the babies.   But she and so many others reach out in love and compassion to those  women and say: That is over. Yes, the baby is gone, but we love you,  and we care for you.   I have been in this movement, the pro-life movement, for 49 years. I  got involved in 1972, my first year in college. I have often thought if  people just knew the truth, like Linda said in her testimony, they  would run out of the abortion clinics.   Bernard Nathanson, the founder of NARAL, one of the biggest pro- abortion organizations in the country, he is one of the three who  founded it, along with Lawrence Lader and Betty Friedan. Bernard  Nathanson wrote in the New England Journal of Medicine that he came to  the agonizing conclusion that he had presided over 60,000 deaths, and  he became a pro-lifer. He said if wombs had windows--and that is what  ultrasound is. We can now see that child moving, sucking his or her  thumb. It just explodes the myth that somehow these children are not  human and alive.    They have a wake and sleep cycle. They exchange the breathing that  they have been doing with the amniotic fluid and building up of their  lungs for air at birth. It is the magnificent continuum of life that  starts at conception.   Again, as I said a moment ago, birth is an event, just an event that  happens in life. We have many events. That is a big one. We all  remember our birthday, but it is not the beginning of life. These  children deserve respect.   Again, I thank Mr. Gohmert for his leadership.   I say to anyone who may be listening, there is Project Rachel, within  the Catholic Church; the Silence No More Awareness Campaign; and all of  these efforts being made across the country and the world to reach out  to post-abortive women.   Then there are the pregnancy care centers, some 3,000 of them  throughout the country, that do nothing but say we love them both. We  want mother and baby to be assisted, and that includes after the child  is born.   I have gotten to know many of those people. They are mostly women who  run them. It is all about love in action. They care so completely for  those women and their families, and they stay with them. Some of the  women who run them are post-abortive themselves, so they know the agony  that could occur if the abortion is procured.   The pro-life movement is all about affirming life in a nonjudgmental  way. Like I said, I have been in it for about half a century. We need  to do more, and we need to reclaim the protection of life in our law  and policy.    The parental involvement laws which would be  overturned by this legislation deal with abortion, not with birth  control. Just abortion. There is a bright line of demarcation between  the two.   I remember meeting with a woman from Virginia who testified here on  Capitol Hill, and at the time she called her group Mothers Against  Minor Abortion, and the way she discovered that her daughter had an  abortion was when she was hemorrhaging in her bed.   She went into the young girl's room and was shocked to find that she  was, you know, very, very, very at risk, and quickly got her to the  hospital. Thankfully, things turned out okay.   You know, the modest bills that would be overturned by this  legislation--I mean, I am the prime sponsor of the bill here in the  House to protect pain-capable children. We have had votes on that in  the past. Trent Franks sponsored that in the past. That is at 20 weeks.  We know beyond any reasonable doubt that at least at 20 weeks, and  maybe before, an unborn child feels pain.  [[Page H5168]]    Dr. Sunny Anand, who is not even a pro-life pain specialist, has said  that sometimes that pain can be far in excess of what a newborn or any  less would feel because the pain receptors are so close to the skin, to  the exposed area.   When the dismemberment process begins, the arm or the leg or some  other body part is literally hacked off that child. Nobody wants to  talk about that. They talk about choice. That obscures the fact that it  is a violent procedure. As that is happening, the child feels pain  until that child, either through shock or death, no longer feels it,  then a dismemberment abortion goes on, and they don't feel it anymore.   I mean, I don't like pain. I don't think anybody in this Chamber  does. That is why we take analgesics and all kinds of pain relievers,  to mitigate pain when we feel it.   That child gets no such intervention, and he or she suffers an  excruciatingly painful process as they are being dismembered.   We need a national debate on abortion like never before. The news  media needs to cease its enabling of a narrative that is truly false  that completely trivializes the unborn child, acts as if they don't  exist because, obviously, they do. We need to be, I think, trying to  protect the weakest and most vulnerable.   I hope we have many more debates like today. Not less, but more. We  need more light and scrutiny being brought to this issue. Many women  have spoken up who have been harmed. At the annual March for Life,  several of the Silent No More Awareness women have spoken. And what  courage that takes to stand up and tell your story, and often with  family present to see this. We are really, hopefully, going to pivot.   I respect our friends on the other side of the aisle. I believe that  we need to always keep it civil. But, again, those children, they are  facing a death sentence.   As someone who is against capital punishment, even when there is a  commission of a capital crime, capital punishment for the unborn must  end.   I thank you and I yield back to my friend.
