 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass  the bill (S. 2629) to establish cybercrime reporting mechanisms, and  for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  S. 2629         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Better Cybercrime Metrics       Act''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress finds the following:        (1) Public polling indicates that cybercrime could be the       most common crime in the United States.        (2) The United States lacks comprehensive cybercrime data       and monitoring, leaving the country less prepared to combat       cybercrime that threatens national and economic security.        (3) In addition to existing cybercrime vulnerabilities, the       people of the United  [[Page H3869]]       States and the United States have faced a heightened risk of       cybercrime during the COVID-19 pandemic.        (4) Subsection (c) of the Uniform Federal Crime Reporting       Act of 1988 (34 U.S.C. 41303(c)) requires the Attorney       General to ``acquire, collect, classify, and preserve       national data on Federal criminal offenses as part of the       Uniform Crime Reports'' and requires all Federal departments       and agencies that investigate criminal activity to ``report       details about crime within their respective jurisdiction to       the Attorney General in a uniform matter and on a form       prescribed by the Attorney General''.       SEC. 3. CYBERCRIME TAXONOMY.         (a) In General.--Not later than 90 days after the date of       enactment of this Act, the Attorney General shall seek to       enter into an agreement with the National Academy of Sciences       to develop a taxonomy for the purpose of categorizing       different types of cybercrime and cyber-enabled crime faced       by individuals and businesses.        (b) Development.--In developing the taxonomy under       subsection (a), the National Academy of Sciences shall--        (1) ensure the taxonomy is useful for the Federal Bureau of       Investigation to classify cybercrime in the National       Incident-Based Reporting System, or any successor system;        (2) consult relevant stakeholders, including--        (A) the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency of       the Department of Homeland Security;        (B) Federal, State, and local law enforcement agencies;        (C) criminologists and academics;        (D) cybercrime experts; and        (E) business leaders; and        (3) take into consideration relevant taxonomies developed       by non-governmental organizations, international       organizations, academies, or other entities.        (c) Report.--Not later than 1 year after the date on which       the Attorney General enters into an agreement under       subsection (a), the National Academy of Sciences shall submit       to the appropriate committees of Congress a report detailing       and summarizing--        (1) the taxonomy developed under subsection (a); and        (2) any findings from the process of developing the       taxonomy under subsection (a).        (d) Authorization of Appropriations.--There are authorized       to be appropriated to carry out this section $1,000,000.       SEC. 4. CYBERCRIME REPORTING.         (a) In General.--Not later than 2 years after the date of       enactment of this Act, the Attorney General shall establish a       category in the National Incident-Based Reporting System, or       any successor system, for the collection of cybercrime and       cyber-enabled crime reports from Federal, State, and local       officials.        (b) Recommendations.--In establishing the category required       under subsection (a), the Attorney General shall, as       appropriate, incorporate recommendations from the taxonomy       developed under section 3(a).       SEC. 5. NATIONAL CRIME VICTIMIZATION SURVEY.         (a) In General.--Not later than 540 days after the date of       enactment of this Act, the Director of the Bureau of Justice       Statistics, in coordination with the Director of the Bureau       of the Census, shall include questions relating to cybercrime       victimization in the National Crime Victimization Survey.        (b) Authorization of Appropriations.--There are authorized       to be appropriated to carry out this section $2,000,000.       SEC. 6. GAO STUDY ON CYBERCRIME METRICS.         Not later than 180 days after the date of enactment of this       Act, the Comptroller General of the United States shall       submit to Congress a report that assesses--        (1) the effectiveness of reporting mechanisms for       cybercrime and cyber-enabled crime in the United States; and        (2) disparities in reporting data between--        (A) data relating to cybercrime and cyber-enabled crime;       and        (B) other types of crime data.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous materials on S. 2629.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 2629, the Better Cybercrime  Metrics Act. This legislation improves our understanding and tracking  of cybercrime so that we can do more to prevent it.   A 2018 Gallup Poll found that 1 in 4 Americans had been a victim of  cybercrime. And I might say that it has exponentially grown during the  pandemic. From stolen financial information, to system-wide shutdowns,  to ransomware attacks, these crimes harm our families, our businesses,  and our government.   The Council of Economic Advisers estimates that malicious cyber  activities cost our economy as much as $109 billion in 2016, and  experts believe these costs are growing. The COVID-19 pandemic has  increased opportunities for cybercrime with increases in remote work  and the time people are spending online. Hackers also took advantage of  our recovery efforts, stealing identities to file fake unemployment  claims or fraudulent loan applications. And again, in the midst of  other innocent Americans not being able to secure those dollars, and  not being able to secure unemployment claims because of the fake  process that clouded this system.   Many of the victims of these scams only learned that they were  attacked when they went to file genuine claims and were told had  already been submitted using their names or businesses.   Sadly, cybercriminals often target older Americans. In 2020, people  over 60 accounted for the most complaints of any age group as collected  by the FBI Internet Crime Complaint Center. People over 60 also had the  greatest losses, with over $966 billion lost to cybercrime in 2020.   We must do more to protect Americans from cybercrime, and that starts  with a better understanding of what it is and how it occurs. The Better  Cybercrime Metrics Act will gather experts in law enforcement,  business, and technology to create a taxonomy of cybercrime so we can  define it and classify it in a uniform way.   This legislation also adds cybercrime to two important law  enforcement tools used to track crimes: The National Incident-Based  Reporting System and the National Crime Victimization Survey. Together,  these provisions will ensure that law enforcement has a complete  picture of when and where cybercrime occurs and who is harmed by it.   Finally, this bill directs the Government Accountability Office to  conduct a study on reporting mechanisms for cybercrime and the  disparities in cybercrime data relative to other types of crime data.  Together, this legislation will put in place the tools to clearly  define and classify cybercrime, to track cybercrime, and to better  understand this serious threat.   Mr. Speaker, it is a very serious threat. And in addition to the  monetary damages, people have been personally and psychologically  impacted by losses, by lack of employability, by being rejected, for  some of these claims having to be delayed when the individual who needs  it is desperate and experiencing a desperate economic condition, to  find that they have been, in essence, gamed by a cybercriminal. We must  stop this.   And as I said earlier, one of the most vulnerable populations are  individuals over 60. And really when you find those in their seventies,  eighties, nineties, who have lived their lives, supported this Nation,  and become victims of cybercrime, it is something that compels you to  really want to stop this threat.   I commend Senators Brian Schatz and Thom Tillis for their work on  this bipartisan legislation. I also thank Representative Abigail  Spanberger for her leadership on the House companion to this bill. I  was proud to stand with her in introducing the House companion, along  with our Republican colleagues, Representative Blake Moore and  Representative  Andrew Garbarino.   We must give law enforcement the tools to keep pace with new  technology and to get a step ahead of the threats faced by our ever- evolving world. This bill takes an important step in that effort, and I  urge my colleagues to support it.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  [[Page H3870]]                                  Memorandum Excerpt       To: Members of the House Judiciary Committee      From: The Honorable Jerrold Nadler, Chairman, Committee on           the Judiciary      Re: Markup of H.R. 4977, the ``Better Cybercrime Metrics           Act''; H.R. 55, the ``Emmett Till Antilynching Act'';           H.R. 5338, the ``Radiation Exposure Compensation Act           Amendments of 2021''; and H.R. 5796, the ``Patents for           Humanity Act of 2021''      Date: Tuesday, December 7, 2021        On Wednesday, December 8, 2021 at 10:00 a.m. in 2141       Rayburn House Office Building, the House Judiciary Committee       will mark up the following measures: H.R. 3359, the       ``Homicide Victims' Families' Rights Act of 2021''; H.R.       4977, the ``Better Cybercrime Metrics Act''; H.R. 55, the       ``Emmett Till Antilynching Act''; H.R. 5338, the ``Radiation       Exposure Compensation Act Amendments of 2021''; and H.R.       5796, the ``Patents for Humanity Act of 2021''.             II. H.R. 4977, the ``Better Cybercrime Metrics Act''         H.R. 4977, the ``Better Cybercrime Metrics Act'' would       improve the U.S. government's understanding, measurement, and       tracking of cybercrime. The bill would direct the Department       of Justice to work with the National Academy of Sciences, in       consultation with relevant stakeholders, to develop a       taxonomy of cybercrime that could be used by law enforcement       to ensure that the National Incident-Based Reporting System       (NIBRS), or any successor system, include cybercrime reports       from federal, state, and local officials. It also directs the       Bureau of Justice Statistics to include questions relating to       cybercrime in the National Crime Victimization Survey. The       bill also directs the Government Accountability Office (GAO)       to report on the effectiveness of current cybercrime       reporting mechanisms and highlight disparities in reporting       data between cybercrime data and other types of crime data.       This bipartisan bill was introduced on August 6, 2021 by       Representative Abigail Spanberger (D-VA) and currently has 18       cosponsors. An identical Senate companion, S. 2629 (Schatz-      HI, Tillis-NC, Cornyn-TX, Durbin-IL), was marked up by the       Senate Judiciary Committee on November 18 and favorably       reported on a unanimous voice vote. The Chairman will offer       an amendment in the nature of a substitute to H.R. 4977.                            A. General Background         Cybercrime continues to be a significant threat to       businesses, governments, and individual Americans. Cybercrime       includes a broad range of conduct including phishing,       ransomware, identity theft, and data breaches.\1\ A recent       survey found one in five Americans have been victims of       ransomware.\2\ The COVID-19 pandemic created new       opportunities for cybercrime, including COVID-related       phishing and malware, with 35.9% of the world's COVID-19       cyber threats occurring in the United States.\3\ Cyber       attackers mainly rely on phishing attacks, which is the most       common attack as measured by the number of victims.\4\       Attackers also use online tools for extortion, data breaches,       identity theft, extracting ransoms, email compromise schemes,       impersonating charities and government actors, and other       schemes.\5\ Researchers attribute the rise in attacks to the       increase in remote work and the lower security protections at       one's home compared to an office.\6\        Cybercrime is costly and harms individuals, government       entities, and businesses across a broad range of industries.       The average data breach in 2020 cost companies $3.83 million       dollars.\7\ Email compromise schemes, in which email accounts       are compromised to conduct unauthorized transfers of funds,       accounted for over $1.8 billion in losses in 2020.\8\ In the       first six months of 2021, six ransomware organizations hacked       292 organizations and stole $45 million dollars.\9\       Organizations that experienced cybercrime this year include       the Colonial Pipeline, the Steamship Authority of       Massachusetts, JBS Foods, and the Washington D.C.       Metropolitan Police Department.\10\ As shown by the gas       shortage due to the Colonial Pipeline breach, these attacks       can shut down critical infrastructure, create shortages,       increase the cost of goods and services, and cost       organizations money from both operational shutdowns and       paying ransoms to hackers.\11\ Likewise, the December 2020,       SolarWinds attack targeted SolarWinds' 300,000 customers and       endangered the cybersecurity of many federal government       agencies, including the Department of Defense, as well as 425       of the U.S. Fortune 500 companies.\12\ Cybercrime harms       businesses across all industries, but it had a particular       effect on companies responding to the COVID-19 pandemic by       disrupting COVID-19 supply chains and the government's       efforts to address the spreading virus.\13\        Bad actors gravitate to cyber-attacks because of the       anonymity the internet provides and the low chances of       getting caught. The detection and prosecution rate of cyber       criminals in the United States is .05%.\14\ Given the       difficulty in tracing and prosecuting these crimes, it is       important to further study and track them so that we can work       to prevent cybercrime. H.R. 4977, the Better Cybercrime       Metrics Act will provide law enforcement with the tools to       uniformly classify and track cybercrime, furthering the       government's understanding of this serious problem and       building the foundation for improved cybercrime prevention       efforts.     B. Section-by-Section Analysis for the Amendment in the Nature of a                                 Substitute         Section 1. Short Title. Section 1 sets forth the short       title of the bill as the ``Better Cybercrime Metrics Act.''        Section 2. Cybercrime Taxonomy. Section 2 requires, within       90 days of the passage of the Act, the DOJ and the National       Academy of Sciences to develop a taxonomy that can be used by       law enforcement to categorize and track cybercrime, and       requires that the taxonomy be presented to Congress. The bill       authorizes $1,000,000 to carry out this section.        Section 3. Cybercrime Reporting. Section 3 requires, not       later than 2 years after the passage of the Act, the DOJ to       establish a category in the National Incident-Based Reporting       System to enable the collection of cybercrime and cyber-      enabled crime reports from Federal, State, and local       officials, incorporating the taxonomy developed under Section       2 as appropriate.        Section 4. National Crime Victimization Survey. Section 4       requires cybercrime to be added to the National Crime       Victimization Survey. The bill authorizes $2,000,000 to carry       out this section.        Section 5. GAO Study on Cybercrime Metrics. Section 5       directs the GAO to do a study on the current reporting       mechanisms of cybercrime and the disparities in data between       (A) data relating to cybercrime and cyber-enabled crime; and       (B) other types of crime data.

Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman  from Virginia (Ms. Spanberger), who was astute enough to be able to  offer the companion bill, and I thank her for her leadership and career  leadership on these issues.    Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I reserve  the balance of my time.                                time  1700     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, let me just take an opportunity to thank Congresswoman  Spanberger for the knowledge she brings to this issue and to this  legislation. We have already said that this is not a harmless crime.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record Cybercrime predictions for 2022:  Deepfakes, cryptocurrencies, and misinformation, to further emphasize  the lack of the harmlessness that it is. It is harmful. One sentence  says it all: Fake news 2.0 and the return of misinformation campaigns.  They cite in particular COVID-19. I think all of us can attest to the  terrible damage that was done during the pandemic with the huge issues  of the question of COVID and the vaccination. Fake vaccine passport  certificates were on sale for $100 to $125, and the volume of  advertising groups and group sizes publishing sellers and multiplied  over and over again.                    [From the Future, December 4, 2021]     Cybercrime Predictions for 2022: Deepfakes, Cryptocurrencies, and                               Misinformation                             (By Maya Horowitz)         While cybercriminals continue to leverage the impact of the       COVID-19 pandemic, they  [[Page H3872]]       will also find new opportunities to attack such as deepfakes,       cryptocurrency and mobile wallets.        In 2021, cyber criminals adapted their attack strategy to       exploit vaccination mandates, elections and the shift to       hybrid work, to target organizations' supply chains and       networks for them to achieve maximum disruption.        The sophistication and scale of cyberattacks will continue       to break records and we can expect a huge increase in the       number of ransomware and mobile attacks. Looking ahead,       organizations should remain aware of the risks and ensure       that they have the appropriate solutions in place to prevent       them without disrupting their normal business flow. To stay       ahead of threats, organizations must be proactive and leave       no part of their attack surface unprotected or unmonitored or       otherwise risk becoming the next victim of sophisticated,       targeted attacks.                    Global cybercrime predictions for 2022       Fake news 2.0 and the return of misinformation campaigns        The claim of `fake news' surrounding contentious issues has       become a new attack vector over previous years without people       really understanding its full impact. Throughout 2021,       misinformation was spread about the COVID-19 pandemic and       vaccination information. The black market for fake vaccine       certificates expanded globally, now selling fakes from 29       countries. Fake `vaccine passport' certificates were on sale       for $100-120 and the volume of advertisement groups and group       sizes publishing sellers multiplied within the year. In 2022,       cyber groups will continue to leverage these types of fake       news campaigns to execute cybercrime through various phishing       attacks and scams.        In addition, prior to the 2020 US presidential election,       Check Point researchers spotted surges in malicious election-      related domains and the use of ``meme camouflage'' aimed at       shifting public opinion. In the run-up to the US midterm       elections in November 2022, we can expect to see these       activities in full effect and for misinformation campaigns to       return on social media.      Cyberattacks targeting supply chains        Supply chain attackers take advantage of a lack of       monitoring within an organization's environment. They can be       used to perform any type of cyberattack, such as data       breaches and malware infections.        The well known cybercrime--SolarWinds supply chain attack       stands out in 2021 due to its scale and influence, but other       sophisticated supply chain attacks have occurred such as       Codecov in April, and most recently, Kaseya. Kaseya provides       software for Managed Service Providers and the REvil       ransomware gang exploited the company to infect over 1,000       customers with ransomware. The group demanded a ransom of $70       million to provide decryption keys for all affected       customers.        Supply chain attacks will become more common and       governments will have to establish regulations to address       these attacks and protect networks. They will also look into       collaborating with the private sectors and internationally to       identify and target more threat groups operating on global       and regional scales. In 2022, expect to discover more about       the global impact of the infamous Sunburst attack.      The cyber `cold war' intensifies        The cyber way is intensifying, and taking place online as       more nation-state actors push Western governments to continue       to destabilize society. Improved infrastructure and       technological capabilities will enable terrorists groups and       political activists to further their cybercrime agendas and       carry out more sophisticated, widespread attacks.       Cyberattacks will increasingly be used as proxy conflicts to       destabilize activities globally.      Data breaches are larger scale and more costly        Going into 2022 we will see an increase in data breaches       that will be larger scale. These breaches will also have the       potential to cost organizations and governments more to       recover. In May 2021, a US insurance giant paid $40 million       in ransom to hackers. This was a record, and we can expect       ransom demanded by attackers to increase in 2022.                Technology cybersecurity predictions for 2022       Mobile malware attacks increase as more people use mobile           wallets and payment platforms:        In 2021, 46 percent of organizations had at least one       employee download a malicious mobile application. The move to       remote work for almost entire populations across the world       during the COVID-19 pandemic saw the mobile attack surface       expand dramatically, resulting in 97 percent of organizations       facing mobile threats from several attack vectors. As mobile       wallets and mobile payment platforms are used more       frequently, cybercrimes will evolve and adapt their       techniques to exploit the growing reliance on mobile devices.      Cryptocurrency becomes a focal point for cyberattacks           globally        When money becomes purely software, the cybersecurity       needed to protect us from hackers stealing and manipulating       bitcoins and altcoins is sure to change in unexpected ways.       As reports of stolen crypto wallets triggered by free       airdropped NFTs become more frequent, Check Point Research       (CPR) investigated OpenSea and proved it was possible to       steal crypto wallets of users by leveraging critical       security. In 2022, we can expect to see an increase in       cryptocurrency related attacks.      Attackers leverage vulnerabilities in microservices to launch           largescale attacks        The move to the cloud and DevOps will result in a new form       of cybercrime. With microservices becoming the leading method       for application development, and microservices architecture       being embraced by Cloud Service Providers (CSPs), attackers       are using vulnerabilities found in microservices to launch       their attacks. We can also expect to see large scale attacks       targeting CSPs.      Deepfake technology weaponized        Techniques for fake video or audio are now advanced enough       to be weaponized and used to create targeted content to       manipulate opinions, stock prices or worse. As in the case of       other mobile attacks that rely on social engineering, the       results of a phishing attacks can range from fraud to more       advanced espionage. For instance in one of the most       significant deepfake phishing attacks, a bank manager in the       United Arab Emirates fell victim to a threat actor's scam.       Hackers used AI voice cloning to trick the bank manager into       transferring $35 million. Threat actors will use deepfake       social engineering attacks to gain permissions and to access       sensitive data.      Penetration tools continue to grow        Globally in 2021, 1 out of every 61 organizations was being       impacted by ransomware each week. Cybercrime through       ransomware will continue to grow, despite the efforts of law       enforcement to limit this growth globally. Threat actors will       target companies that can afford paying ransom, and       ransomware attacks will become more sophisticated in 2022.       Hackers will increasingly use penetration tools to customize       attacks in real time and to live and work within victim       networks. Penetration tools are the engine behind the most       sophisticated ransomware attacks that took place in 2021. As       the popularity of this attack method grows, attackers will       use it to carry out data exfiltration and extortion attacks.     Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the article:  ``Ho, Ho, Ho, Holiday Scams'' FBI Portland. During the 2020 holiday  season, this article says this FBI Internet Compliance Center received  more than 17,000 complaints regarding the nondelivery of goods  resulting in losses of more than $53 billion.                   [From FBI Portland, December 1, 2021]                         Ho, Ho, Ho, Holiday Scams!                           (By Beth Anne Steele)         If you're doing online shopping this holiday season, be on       the lookout for scammers trying to steal a deal, too!        During the 2020 holiday shopping season, the FBI Internet       Crime Complaint Center (IC3.gov) received more than 17,000       complaints regarding the non-delivery of goods, resulting in       losses of more than $53 million. The FBI anticipates this       number could increase during the 2021 holiday season due to       rumors of merchandise shortages and the ongoing pandemic.        ``Oftentimes when we talk about cyber crimes, we are       referring to massive intrusions into financial institutions       or ransomware attacks against large providers. Smaller cyber       scams run by individuals or groups can be just as frustrating       and difficult for families this time of year when all you       want to do is provide the perfect gift for your family. The       best thing you can do to be a savvy shopper is to know what       scams are out there and take some basic precautions,'' says       Kieran L. Ramsey, special agent in charge of the FBI in       Oregon.        Here's a look at some of the more common scams:        Online Shopping Scams:        Scammers often offer too-good-to-be-true deals via phishing       emails, through social media posts, or through ads. Perhaps       you were trying to buy tickets to the next big concert or       sporting event and found just what you were looking for--at a       good deal--in an online marketplace? Those tickets could end       up being bogus. Or, perhaps, you think you just scored a       hard-to-find item like a new gaming system? Or a designer bag       at an extremely low price? If you actually get a delivery,       which is unlikely, the box may not contain the item you       ordered in the condition you thought it would arrive. In the       meantime, if you clicked on a link to access the deal. you       likely gave the fraudster access to download malware onto       your device, and you gave him personal financial information       and debit/credit card details.        Social Media Shopping Scams:        Consumers should beware of posts on social media sites that       appear to offer special deals, vouchers, or gift cards. Some       may appear as holiday promotions or contests. Others may       appear to be from known friends who have shared the link.       Often, these scams lead consumers to participate in an online       survey that is designed to steal personal information. If you       click an ad through a social media platform, do your due       diligence to check the legitimacy of the website before       providing credit card or personal information.        Gift Card Scams:        Gift cards are popular and a great time saver. but you need       to watch for sellers who say they can get you cards below-      market value. Also, be wary of buying any card in a  [[Page H3873]]       store if it looks like the security PIN on the back has been       uncovered and recovered. Your best bet is to buy digital gift       cards directly from the merchant online. Another twist on       this scam involves a person who receives a request to       purchase gift cards in bulk. Here's how it works: the victim       receives a spoofed email, a phone call, or a text from a       person who they believe is in authority (such as an executive       at the company). The fraudster tells the victim to purchase       multiple gift cards as gifts. The victim does so and then       passes the card numbers and PINs to the ``executive'' who       cashes out the value.        Charity Scams:        Charity fraud rises during the holiday season when people       want to make end-of-year tax deductible gifts or just wish to       contribute to a good cause. These seasonal scams can be more       difficult to stop because of their widespread reach, limited       duration and, when done online, minimal oversight. Bad actors       target victims through cold calls, email campaigns,       crowdfunding platforms, or fake social media accounts and       websites. Fraudsters make it easy for victims to give money       and to feel like they're making a difference. The scammer       will divert some or all the funds for personal use, and those       most in need will never see the donations.        Tips to Avoid Being Victimized:        Pay for items using a credit card dedicated for online       purchases, checking the card statement frequently, and never       saving payment information in online accounts.        Never make purchases using public Wi-Fi.        Beware of vendors that require payment with a gift card,       wire transfer, cash, or cryptocurrency.        Research the seller to ensure legitimacy. Check reviews and       do online searches for the name of the vendor and the words       ``scam'' or ``fraud.''        Check the contact details listed on the website to ensure       the vendor is real and reachable by phone or email.        Confirm return and refund policies.        Be wary of online retailers who use a free email service       instead of a company email address.        Don't judge a company by its website. Flashy websites can       be set up and taken down quickly.        Do not click on links or provide personal or financial       information to an unsolicited email or social media post.        Secure credit card accounts, even rewards accounts, with       strong passwords or passphrases. Change passwords or       passphrases regularly.        Make charitable contributions directly, rather than through       an intermediary, and pay via credit card or check. Avoid cash       donations, if possible.        Only purchase gift cards directly from a trusted merchant.        Make sure anti-virus/malware software is up to date and       block pop-up windows.        What to Do if You Are a Victim:        If you are a victim of an online scam, the FBI recommends       taking the following actions:        Report the activity to the Internet Crime Complaint Center       at IC3.gov, regardless of dollar loss. Provide all relevant       information in the complaint.        Contact your financial institution immediately upon       discovering any fraudulent or suspicious activity and direct       them to stop or reverse the transactions.        Ask your financial institution to contact the corresponding       financial institution where the fraudulent or suspicious       transfer was sent.     Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the article:  ``Without major changes, more Americans can be victims of online  crime'' The Hill. ``When you turn on the TV or read the newspaper, it  is hard to ignore headlines: `Colonial Pipeline a Victim of Massive  Ransomware Attack.' `50 Million People Affected by T-Mobile Data  Breach.' `Hackers Exploit SolarWinds to Spy on U.S. Government  Agencies.' ''                       [From The Hill, Aug. 30, 2021]   Without Major Changes, More Americans Could Be Victims of Online Crime                    (By Rep. Abigail Spanberger (D-VA))         When you turn on the TV or read the newspaper, it's hard to       ignore the headlines: ``Colonial Pipeline a Victim of Massive       Ransomware Attack.'' ``50 Million People Affected by T-Mobile       Data Breach.'' ``Hackers Exploit SolarWinds to Spy on U.S.       Government Agencies.''        These major attacks represent a serious threat to our       economy and our national security. After the Colonial       Pipeline attack impacted thousands of our neighbors in       Central Virginia, I was adamant about how our government must       vastly improve its efforts to undercut the activity of       hackers, protect critical infrastructure, and strengthen our       cybercrime prevention efforts.        But the story of cybercrime in 2021 goes far beyond these       news-making cyberattacks--it extends into our communities,       our neighborhoods, and our homes.        If you are a family banking online, a business managing       your employees' payroll information, or a senior accessing       federal benefits on the internet, you are no stranger to       thinking about how a cyber breach or attack could affect you.       Even worse, you might already be one of the millions of       Americans whose personal data has been compromised, money or       identity stolen, or safety put at risk.        In 2018, Gallup found that nearly one in four U.S.       households has been a victim of cybercrime--making it the       most common crime in America. To confront cybercriminals and       their enablers, we need to have a better understanding of       these incidents. However, many of these cases--a vast       majority of these crimes--are not properly reported or       tracked by law enforcement Often, they are not measured at       all.        By some estimates, the Federal Bureau of Investigation       (FBI) may only collect about one in 90 of all cybercrime       incidents in its Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3)       database. The lack of information about cyber and cyber-      enabled crime is divorced from what Americans are actually       facing on a day-to-day basis an increased risk of cybercrime.       What's more, these crimes are rising at an alarming rate.        Compounding this challenge is the fact that federal, state,       and local governments do not have a comprehensive, effective       system to measure cybercrime. In 2021--decades after the dawn       of the internet age--we remain woefully unprepared to prevent       or respond to the next generation of cyberattacks.        Accountability for these crimes--and protection against       them--can't fully take shape until we have a clear picture of       the current state of play. For this reason, we need to take       real steps to improve how we track, measure, analyze, and       prosecute cybercrime.        Earlier this month, I introduced the bipartisan Better       Cybercrime Metrics Act, which would allow our federal       government and law enforcement to better track and identify       cybercrime, prevent attacks, and go after perpetrators. This       bill would strengthen our understanding and our defenses       against the phishing attempts, extortion, ransomware, and       identity theft that are plaguing everyday Americans.        As a former federal law enforcement agent, I understand       that local and state police and sheriff's departments are       often strained for resources and time. And as a former CIA       case officer, I recognize the importance of gathering as much       information as possible about potential threats--so that we       can prevent attacks on American citizens and American       businesses.        If signed into law, the Better Cybercrime Metrics Act would       improve our cybercrime metrics, anticipate future trends, and       make sure law enforcement has the tools and resources they       need.        Our bill would require federal reporting on the       effectiveness of current cybercrime mechanisms and highlight       disparities in reporting data between cybercrime data and       other types of crime data.        Additionally, it would require the National Crime       Victimization Survey to ask questions related to cybercrime       in its surveys--and it would make sure that the FBI's       National Incident Based Reporting System include cybercrime       reports from federal, state, and local officials.        Notably, our bill would also require the U.S. Department of       Justice to contract with the National Academy of Sciences to       develop a standard taxonomy for cybercrime. These metrics       could be used by law enforcement across the board.        I was proud to introduce this legislation alongside my       colleagues U.S. Reps. Blake Moore (R-Utah), Andrew Garbarino       (R-N.Y.), and Sheila Jackson Lee (D-Texas). Clearly, there is       consensus for these reforms and protections across the       political spectrum.        In the Senate, a companion bill is being led by Sen. Brian       Schatz (D-Hawaii). Joining him are Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), John       Cornyn (R-Texas), and Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.). I am       proud to have their partnership on this important, bicameral       effort.        With this legislation and an improved understanding of the       threats ahead, we can prevent more Americans from becoming       targets--or victims--online.     Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the article  titled: ``U.S. Military Has Acted Against Ransomware Groups, General  Acknowledges.''                [From the New York Times, December 5, 2021]  U.S. Military Has Acted Against Ransomware Groups, General Acknowledges                           (By Julian E. Barnes)         Simi Valley, Calif.--The U.S. military has taken actions       against ransomware groups as part of its surge against       organizations launching attacks against American companies,       the nation's top cyberwarrior said on Saturday, the first       public acknowledgment of offensive measures against such       organizations.        Gen. Paul M. Nakasone, the head of U.S. Cyber Command and       the director of the National Security Agency, said that nine       months ago, the government saw ransomware attacks as the       responsibility of law enforcement.        But the attacks on Colonial Pipeline and JBS beef plants       demonstrated that the criminal organizations behind them have       been ``impacting our critical infrastructure,'' General       Nakasone said.        In response, the government is taking a more aggressive,       better coordinated approach against this threat, abandoning       its previous hands-off stance. Cyber Command, the N.S.A. and       other agencies have poured resources into gathering       intelligence on the ransomware groups and sharing that better       understanding across the government and with international       partners.  [[Page H3874]]         ``The first thing we have to do is to understand the       adversary and their insights better than we've ever       understood them before,'' General Nakasone said in an       interview on the sidelines of the Reagan National Defense       Forum, a gathering of national security officials.        General Nakasone would not describe the actions taken by       his commands, nor what ransomware groups were targeted. But       he said one of the goals was to ``impose costs,'' which is       the term military officials use to describe punitive       cyberoperations.        ``Before, during and since, with a number of elements of       our government, we have taken actions and we have imposed       costs;'' General Nakasone said. ``That's an important piece       that we should always be mindful of.''        In September, Cyber Command diverted traffic around servers       being used by the Russia-based REvil ransomware group,       officials briefed on the operation have said. The operation       came after government hackers from an allied country       penetrated the servers, making it more difficult for the       group to collect ransoms. After REvil detected the U.S.       action, it shut down at least temporarily. That Cyber Command       operation was reported last month by The Washington Post.        Cyber Command and the N.S.A. also assisted the F.B.I. and       the Justice Department in their efforts to seize and recover       much of the cryptocurrency ransom paid by Colonial Pipeline.       The Bitcoin payment was originally demanded by the Russian       ransomware group known as DarkSide.        The first known operation against a ransomware group by       Cyber Command came before the 2020 election, when officials       feared a network of computers known as TrickBot could be used       to disrupt voting.        Government officials have disagreed about how effective the       stepped-up actions against ransomware groups have been.       National Security Council officials have said activities by       Russian groups have declined. The F.B.I. has been skeptical.       Some outside groups saw a lull but predicted the ransomware       groups would rebrand and come back in force.        Asked if the United States had gotten better at defending       itself from ransomware groups, General Nakasone said the       country was ``on an upward trajectory.'' But adversaries       modify their operations and continue to try to attack, he       said.        ``We know much more about what our adversaries can and       might do to us. This is an area where vigilance is really       important,'' he said, adding that ``we can't take our eye off       it.''        Since taking over in May 2018, General Nakasone has worked       to increase the pace of cyberoperations, focusing first on       more robust defenses against foreign influence operations in       the 2018 and 2020 elections. He has said that his commands       have been able to draw broad lessons from those operations,       which were seen as successful, and others.        ``Take a look at the broad perspective of adversaries that       we've gone after over a period of five-plus years: It's been       nation-states, it's been proxies, it's been criminals, it's       been a whole wide variety of folks that each require a       different strategy,'' he said. ``The fundamental piece that       makes us successful against any adversary are speed, agility       and unity of effort. You have to have those three.''        Last year's discovery of the SolarWinds hacking, in which       Russian intelligence agents implanted software in the supply       chain, giving them potential access to scores of government       networks and thousands of business networks, was made by a       private company and exposed flaws in America's domestic       cyberdefenses. The N.S.A's Cybersecurity Collaboration Center       was set up to improve information sharing between the       government and industry and to better detect future       intrusions, General Nakasone said, although industry       officials say more needs to be done to improve the flow of       intelligence.        General Nakasone said those kinds of attacks are likely to       continue, by ransomware groups and others.        ``What we have seen over the past year and what private       industry has indicated is that we have seen a tremendous rise       in terms of implants and in terms of zero-day vulnerabilities       and ransomware,'' he said, referring to an unknown coding       flaw for which a patch does not exist. ``I think that's the       world in which we live today.''        Speaking on a panel at the Reagan Forum, General Nakasone       said the domain of cyberspace had changed radically over the       past 11 months with the rise of ransomware attacks and       operations like SolarWinds. He said it was likely in any       future military conflict that American critical       infrastructure would be targeted.        ``Borders mean less as we look at our adversaries, and       whatever adversary that is, we should begin with the idea       that our critical infrastructure will be targeted:' he told       the panel.        Cyber Command has already begun building up its efforts to       defend the next election. Despite the work to expose Russian,       Chinese and Iranian efforts to meddle in American politics,       General Nakasone said in the interview that foreign malign       campaigns were likely to continue.        ``I think that we should anticipate that in cyberspace,       where the barriers to entry are so low, our adversaries are       always going to be attempting to be involved;'' he said.        The recipe for success in defending the election, he said,       is to provide insight to the public about what adversaries       are trying to do, share information about vulnerabilities and       adversarial operations, and finally take action against       groups trying to interfere with voting.        While that might take the form of cyberoperations against       hackers, the response can be broader. Last month, the Justice       Department announced the indictment of two Iranian hackers       the government had identified as being behind an attempt to       influence the 2020 election.        ``This really has to be a whole-of-government effort,''       General Nakasone said. ``This is why the diplomatic effort is       important. This is why being able to look at a number of       different levers within our government to be able to impact       these type of adversaries is critical for our success.''     The roll call goes on and on and on.   I thank my colleagues for their words of support for this bipartisan  legislation. I believe the time is now. We are going to continue this  journey. This is not the last legislative initiative, that is why we  will be holding a hearing tomorrow with the representative from the FBI  because this is a growing continuing project and problem. If I might  use the terminology, we will have to re-image constantly.   This legislation is also supported by law enforcement groups and  those with particular expertise in cybercrime, including the National  Fraternal Order of Police, the Major Cities Chiefs Association, and the  National Association of Police Organizations, the National White Collar  Crime Center, and the Cybercrime Support Network.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Senator Schatz, Senator Tillis, and as I  indicated, our colleague, Representative Spanberger for their  leadership on this bipartisan legislation. I am glad to have joined it  and I urge all of my colleagues to join me in supporting it.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 2629, the  ``Better Cybercrime Metrics Act.''   This legislation improves our understanding and tracking of  cybercrime so that we can do more to prevent it.   A 2018 Gallup poll found that one in four Americans has been a victim  of cybercrime.   From stolen financial information, to systemwide shutdowns, to  ransomware attacks, these crimes harm our families, our businesses, and  our government.   The Council of Economic Advisers estimated that malicious cyber  activities cost our economy as much as $109 billion in 2016, and  experts believe these costs are growing.   The COVID-19 pandemic has increased opportunities for cybercrime,  with increases in remote work and the time people spend online.   Hackers also took advantage of our recovery efforts, stealing  identities to file fake unemployment claims or fraudulent loan  applications.   Many of the victims of these scams only learned they were attacked  when they went to file genuine claims and were told that one had  already been submitted using their name or business.   Sadly, cyber criminals often target older Americans. In 2020, people  over 60 accounted for the most complaints of any age group, as  collected by the FBI Internet Crime Complaint Center.   People over 60 also had the greatest losses, with over $966 million  lost to cybercrime in 2020.   We must do more to protect Americans from cybercrime, and that starts  with a better understanding of what it is and how it occurs.   The Better Cybercrime Metrics Act will gather experts in law  enforcement, business, and technology to create a taxonomy of  cybercrime so that we can define it and classify it in a uniform way.   This legislation also adds cybercrime to two important law  enforcement tools used to track crimes, the National Incident-Based  Reporting System and the National Crime Victimization Survey.   Together these provisions will ensure that law enforcement has a  complete picture of when and where cybercrime occurs, and who is harmed  by it.   Finally, this bill directs the Government Accountability Office to  conduct a study on reporting mechanisms for cybercrime, and the  disparities in cybercrime data relative to other types of crime data.   Together this legislation will put in place the tools to clearly  define and classify cybercrime, to track cybercrime, and to better  understand this serious threat.   I commend Senators Brian Schatz and Thom Tillis for their work on  this bipartisan legislation. I also thank Representative Abigail  Spanberger for her leadership on the House companion to this bill. I  was proud to stand with her in introducing the House companion, along  with our Republican colleagues, Representative Blake Moore and  Representative Andrew Garbarino.  [[Page H3875]]    We must give law enforcement the tools to keep apace with new  technology and to get a step ahead of the threats faced by our ever- evolving world.   This bill takes an important step in that effort and I urge my  colleagues to support it.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass  the bill (H.R. 3359) to provide for a system for reviewing the case  files of cold case murders at the instance of certain persons, and for  other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 3359         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Homicide Victims' Families'       Rights Act of 2021''.       SEC. 2. CASE FILE REVIEW.         (a) In General.--The head of an agency shall review the       case file regarding a cold case murder upon written       application by one designated person to determine if a full       reinvestigation would result in either the identification of       probative investigative leads or a likely perpetrator.        (b) Review.--The review under subsection (a) shall       include--        (1) an analysis of what investigative steps or follow-up       steps may have been missed in the initial investigation;        (2) an assessment of whether witnesses should be       interviewed or reinterviewed;        (3) an examination of physical evidence to see if all       appropriate forensic testing and analysis was performed in       the first instance or if additional testing might produce       information relevant to the investigation; and        (4) an update of the case file using the most current       investigative standards as of the date of the review to the       extent it would help develop probative leads.        (c) Certification in Lieu of Review.--In any case in which       a written application for review has been received under this       Act by the agency, review shall be unnecessary where the case       does not satisfy the criteria for a cold case murder. In such       a case, the head of the agency shall issue a written       certification, with a copy provided to the designated person       that made the application under subsection (a), stating that       final review is not necessary because all probative       investigative leads have been exhausted or that a likely       perpetrator will not be identified.        (d) Reviewer.--A review required under subsection (a) shall       not be conducted by a person who previously investigated the       murder at issue.        (e) Acknowledgment.--The agency shall provide in writing to       the applicant as soon as reasonably possible--        (1) confirmation of the agency's receipt of the application       under subsection (a); and        (2) notice of the applicant's rights under this Act.        (f) Prohibition on Multiple Concurrent Reviews.--Only one       case review shall be undertaken at any one time with respect       to the same cold case murder victim.        (g) Time Limit.--Not later than 6 months after the receipt       of the written application submitted pursuant to subsection       (a), the agency shall conclude its case file review and reach       a conclusion about whether or not a full reinvestigation       under section 4 is warranted.        (h) Extensions.--        (1) In general.--The agency may extend the time limit under       subsection (g) once for a period of time not to exceed 6       months if the agency makes a finding that the number of case       files to be reviewed make it impracticable to comply with       such limit without unreasonably taking resources from other       law enforcement activities.        (2) Actions subsequent to waiver.--For cases for which the       time limit in subsection (g) is extended, the agency shall       provide notice and an explanation of its reasoning to one       designated person who filed the written application pursuant       to this section.       SEC. 3. APPLICATION.         Each agency shall develop a written application to be used       for designated persons to request a case file review under       section 2.       SEC. 4. FULL REINVESTIGATION.         (a) In General.--The agency shall conduct a full       reinvestigation of the cold case murder at issue if the       review of the case file required by section 2 concludes that       a full reinvestigation of such cold case murder would result       in probative investigative leads.        (b) Reinvestigation.--A full reinvestigation shall include       analyzing all evidence regarding the cold case murder at       issue for the purpose of developing probative investigative       leads or a likely perpetrator.        (c) Reviewer.--A reinvestigation required under subsection       (a) shall not be conducted by a person who previously       investigated the murder at issue.        (d) Prohibition on Multiple Concurrent Reviews.--Only one       full reinvestigation shall be undertaken at any one time with       respect to the same cold case murder victim.       SEC. 5. CONSULTATION AND UPDATES.         (a) In General.--The agency shall consult with the       designated person who filed the written application pursuant       to section 2 and provide him or her with periodic updates       during the case file review and full reinvestigation.        (b) Explanation of Conclusion.--The agency shall meet with       the designated person and discuss the evidence to explain to       the designated person who filed the written application       pursuant to section 2 its decision whether or not to engage       in the full reinvestigation provided for under section 4 at       the conclusion of the case file review.       SEC. 6. SUBSEQUENT REVIEWS.         (a) Case File Review.--If a review under subsection (a)       case file regarding a cold case murder is conducted and a       conclusion is reached not to conduct a full reinvestigation,       no additional case file review shall be required to be       undertaken under this Act with respect to that cold case       murder for a period of five years, unless there is newly       discovered, materially significant evidence. An agency may       continue an investigation absent a designated person's       application.        (b) Full Reinvestigation.--If a full reinvestigation of a       cold case murder is completed and a suspect is not identified       at its conclusion, no additional case file review or full       reinvestigation shall be undertaken with regard to that cold       case murder for a period of five years beginning on the date       of the conclusion of the reinvestigation, unless there is       newly discovered, materially significant evidence.       SEC. 7. DATA COLLECTION.         (a) In General.--Beginning on the date that is three years       after the date of enactment of this Act, and annually       thereafter, the Director of the National Institute of Justice       shall publish statistics on the number of cold case murders.        (b) Manner of Publication.--The statistics published       pursuant to subsection (a) shall, at a minimum, be       disaggregated by the circumstances of the cold case murder,       including the classification of the offense, and by agency.       SEC. 8. PROCEDURES TO PROMOTE COMPLIANCE.         (a) Regulations.--Not later than one year after the date of       enactment of this Act, the head of each agency shall       promulgate regulations to enforce the right of a designated       person to request a review under this Act and to ensure       compliance by the agency with the obligations described in       this Act.        (b) Procedures.--The regulations promulgated under       subsection (a) shall--        (1) designate an administrative authority within the agency       to receive and investigate complaints relating to a review       initiated under section 2 or a reinvestigation initiated       under section 4;        (2) require a course of training for appropriate employees       and officers within the agency regarding the procedures,       responsibilities, and obligations required under this Act;        (3) contain disciplinary sanctions, which may include       suspension or termination from employment, for employees of       the agency who are shown to have willfully or wantonly failed       to comply with this Act;        (4) provide a procedure for the resolution of complaints       filed by the designated person concerning the agency's       handling of a cold case murder investigation or the case file       evaluation; and        (5) provide that the head of the agency, or the designee       thereof, shall be the final arbiter of the complaint, and       that there shall be no judicial review of the final decision       of the head of the agency by a complainant.       SEC. 9. WITHHOLDING INFORMATION.         Nothing in this Act shall require an agency to provide       information that would endanger the safety of any person,       unreasonably impede an ongoing investigation, violate a court       order, or violate legal obligations regarding privacy.       SEC. 10. MULTIPLE AGENCIES.         In the case that more than one agency conducted the initial       investigation of a cold case murder, each agency shall       coordinate their case file review or full reinvestigation       such that there is only one joint case file review or full       reinvestigation occurring at a time in compliance with       section 2(f) or 4(d), as applicable.       SEC. 11. APPLICABILITY.         This Act applies in the case of any cold case murder       occurring on or after January 1, 1970.       SEC. 12. DEFINITIONS.         In this Act:        (1) The term ``designated person'' means an immediate       family member or someone similarly situated, as defined by       the Attorney General.        (2) The term ``immediate family member'' means a parent,       parent-in-law, grandparent, grandparent-in-law, sibling,       spouse, child, or step-child of a murder victim.        (3) The term ``victim'' means a natural person who died as       a result of a cold case murder.        (4) The term ``murder'' means any criminal offense under       section 1111(a) of title 18, United States Code, or any       offense the elements of which are substantially identical to       such section.        (5) The term ``agency'' means a Federal law enforcement       entity with jurisdiction to engage in the detection,       investigation, or prosecution of a cold case murder.        (6) The term ``cold case murder'' means a murder--  [[Page H3876]]         (A) committed more than three years prior to the date of an       application by a designated person under section 2(a);        (B) previously investigated by a Federal law enforcement       entity;        (C) for which all probative investigative leads have been       exhausted; and        (D) for which no likely perpetrator has been identified.       SEC. 13. ANNUAL REPORT.         (a) In General.--Each agency shall submit an annual report       to the Committees on the Judiciary of the House of       Representatives and of the Senate describing actions taken       and results achieved under this Act during the previous year.        (b) Report Described.--The report described in subsection       (a) shall include--        (1) the number of written applications filed with the       agency pursuant to section 2(a);        (2) the number of extensions granted, and an explanation of       reasons provided under section 2(h);        (3) the number of full reinvestigations initiated and       closed pursuant to section 4; and        (4) statistics and individualized information on topics       that include identified suspects, arrests, charges, and       convictions for reviews under section 2 and reinvestigations       under section 4.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on the bill under  consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I support H.R. 3359, the Homicide Victims' Families'  Rights Act of 2021, and urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan  legislation, which establishes a procedure for families of murder  victims in cases investigated at the Federal level to continue to  pursue justice for their murdered family member when the trail has gone  cold. There is nothing more devastating for a family to live without  answers in the midst of a violent death of their loved one.   This legislation gives a designated family member the right to  request a review of their murdered loved one's case file after 3 years.  Unfortunately, 4 out of 10 murder victims' families in this country  never receive any closure in the loss of their family member.   FBI data shows the percentage of homicides cleared by an arrest or  other means has declined significantly from 1965 to today, while the  number of unsolved homicides grows by the thousands nationwide every  year.   In 2019, four Texas cities cleared 40 percent or less of reported  homicides, according to the FBI statistics. Low clearance rates lead to  low confidence in law enforcement and reduce citizen cooperation, which  led to even lower clearance rates. The backlog of cases and low  clearance rates disproportionately affect murder victims who are poor,  undereducated, unemployed, and Black, and without resources to pursue  this with a private investigator or with an extended legal team. They  are left to their own devices. Mr. Speaker, you know what that is,  remorse, sadness, devastation, family breaks-ups, loss that can never  be repaired.   Poor Black and Brown victims and their families tend to receive less  attention to their cases from law enforcement than those of other  socioeconomic backgrounds and racial groups, and their cases go  unsolved. This, of course, however, impacts Americans across the board.  The pain is deep without easing, without ceasing. This legislation is  important. This disparate treatment is unacceptable as well. We can and  we must provide justice for all victims and their families.   Mr. Speaker, I hope this legislation will set a new tone--eliminating  disparate treatment--impacting vulnerable communities of poor Black and  Brown families who never receive closure, while serving as a model for  State, local, and Tribal governments where the vast majority of  unsolved murders lie, and as well, help all Americans no matter what  their condition and station in life and no matter where they live.   H.R. 3359 will require Federal law enforcement agencies to use fresh  eyes--and I have seen this actually work--to complete a case file,  review, and determine if a full reinvestigation could lead to new  probative investigative leads.   This legislation will encourage equitable treatment of victims and  their families by requiring that Federal law enforcement, including the  victims' families in the case file review and reinvestigation process.  That means notifying them and giving them hope; provide written  certification to a designated family member if a final review is not  necessary; update that family member throughout the case file review  and full reinvestigation; and meet with and discuss the evidence with  that family member if a full reinvestigation is not pursued.   There is nothing like closure. It has been shown that cold case  investigations can be very effective by using agents and investigators  who have never worked the cases before, and by deploying up-to-date  investigative techniques. Cold case investigations help take violent  criminals off the street and to bring closure.   Let me take note of the fact that the Judiciary Committee as a whole  is very active in pursuing the issue of cold cases to the extent that  this Department of Justice has established a unit that works on it. I  would say, however, an infusion of energy and excitement and  utilization of this effort would be welcomed because this is an  important message and effort for our families.   In 2010, the FBI and a cold case detective began a joint  reexamination of the death of Ellen Beason in 1985, whose remains were  found south of Houston in an area called the killing fields. Almost 30  years later, the cold case detective requested x-rays of the body which  showed that the woman's skull had been cracked on both sides from a  forceful blow. Her body had never been x-rayed.   The main suspect in the murder was finally convicted of involuntary  manslaughter in 2014. He was sentenced to 20 years in prison, and was  named as the leading suspect in the murder of other women found in the  killing fields, though he was never charged.   H.R. 3359 mandates that a law enforcement agency must conduct a full  reinvestigation like the one that brought justice to Ellen Beason's  family if probative investigative leads result from a full  investigation. How necessary this is for mourning and very, very  devastated families.   This bipartisan legislation represents an important step in fostering  renewed hope for families and is supported by a broad array of  advocates, including the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association,  the National Organization of Parents of Murdered Children, the National  Coalition Against Domestic Violence, and the Association of Prosecuting  Attorneys.   Mr. Speaker, I am so grateful to Congressman Eric Swalwell, a member  of the House Judiciary Committee, for his passion on this issue and his  astute continued effort on this bipartisan bill that will bring light  and hope to families of victims who seek justice for their loved ones.    Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill  today, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Swalwell), the author and leader of this bill. I thank  him so much for his very astute leadership.    Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to yield 2 minutes to  the distinguished gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. Cicilline), a member  of the Judiciary Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Let me thank the gentleman from Oregon for his support of this  legislation; and as well, again thank Mr. Swalwell for that commitment  to helping families who are typically desperate for help in these cold  cases.   Let me cite as a comparison that does not deal with the end of a  case, but it does deal with the intervention of the Federal Government,  the FBI, in particular, on a child predator case in a local  neighborhood, where local law enforcement were doing their very best.   But when we were able to reach out to the FBI, although the case was  not cold in its conclusion, it was cold in its investigation, its  current investigation, and the FBI did bring new and fresh eyes to help  us with that terrible case.   So when we have cases that are a cold case, the backlog of cold case  murders continues to grow, and I think this legislation means a lot to  these families. When they grow cold, this means that thousands of  murderers evade prosecution and continue to walk the streets, able to  commit more crimes and possibly more murders, while thousands of  mothers, fathers, husbands, wives, sons, and daughters, have yet to  find closure in the loss of their loved ones.   And let me just say, Mr. Speaker, I think you realize, that pain is  so deep, and it never goes away. That is why this bill is so important.  This legislation would result in more closed cases, justice for  victims, closure for their families, and greater faith in law  enforcement.   Mr. Speaker, again I want to indicate that this bill is important. I  thank my colleagues for supporting this bill in a bipartisan manner,  and I ask them to join me in supporting this bill today.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I support H.R. 3359, the ``Homicide  Victims' Families' Rights Act of 2021,'' and urge my colleagues to  support this bipartisan legislation, which establishes a procedure for  families of murder victims, in cases investigated at the federal level,  to continue to pursue justice for their murdered family member when the  trail has gone cold.

H.R. 3359 will require federal law enforcement agencies, using  ``fresh eyes,'' to complete a case file review and determine if a full  reinvestigation could lead to new probative investigative leads.   This legislation will encourage equitable treatment of victims and  their families by requiring that federal law enforcement: (1) include  the victim's family in the case file review and reinvestigation  process; (2) provide written certification to a designated family  member if final review is not necessary; (3) update that family member  throughout the case file review and full reinvestigation; and (4) meet  with and discuss the evidence with that family member if a full  reinvestigation is not pursued.

I ask that my colleagues join me in supporting this bill today.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass  the bill (H.R. 1621) to amend section 3661 of title 18, United States  Code, to prohibit the consideration of acquitted conduct at sentencing,  as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1621         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Prohibiting Punishment of       Acquitted Conduct Act of 2021''.       SEC. 2. ACQUITTED CONDUCT AT SENTENCING.         (a) Use of Information for Sentencing.--        (1) Amendment.--Section 3661 of title 18, United States       Code, is amended by inserting ``, except that a court of the       United States shall not consider, except for purposes of       mitigating a sentence, acquitted conduct under this section''       before the period at the end.        (2) Applicability.--The amendment made by paragraph (1)       shall apply only to a judgment entered on or after the date       of enactment of this Act.        (b) Definitions.--Section 3673 of title 18, United States       Code, is amended--        (1) in the matter preceding paragraph (1), by striking       ``As'' and inserting the following:        ``(a) As''; and        (2) by adding at the end the following:        ``(b) As used in this chapter, the term `acquitted conduct'       means--        ``(1) an act--        ``(A) for which a person was criminally charged and with       regard to which--        ``(i) that person was adjudicated not guilty after trial in       a Federal, State, or Tribal court; or        ``(ii) any favorable disposition to the person in any prior       charge was made, regardless of whether the disposition was       pretrial, at trial, or post trial; or        ``(B) in the case of a juvenile, that was charged and for       which the juvenile was found not responsible after a juvenile       adjudication hearing; or        ``(2) any act underlying a criminal charge or juvenile       information dismissed--        ``(A) in a Federal court upon a motion for acquittal under       rule 29 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure; or        ``(B) in a State or Tribal court upon a motion for       acquittal or an analogous motion under the applicable State       or Tribal rule of criminal procedure.''.       SEC. 3. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS.         The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous materials on H.R. 1621.    I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I am very proud to support H.R. 1621, the Prohibiting  Punishment of Acquitted Conduct Act, which offers a solution to a long- identified problem within our criminal justice system.   This bill provides necessary reform to current Federal sentencing  practice that allows judges to sentence defendants based on conduct for  which a jury has found them not guilty.   The Sixth Amendment to the Constitution provides that anyone accused  of a crime shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public jury trial,  while the Fifth Amendment provides that no person shall be deprived of  life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.   These provisions mean that the government is bound to move each and  every element of an offense for which a defendant is charged beyond a  reasonable doubt during a jury trial, or that defendant must admit each  element of an offense to support a plea of guilty. Absent that, those  offenses are not found guilty, if you will, to the individual.   Notwithstanding this constitutional obligation, Federal judges  routinely nullify not guilty verdicts rendered by juries and sentence  defendants to significantly higher penalties based on acquitted  conduct.   In its current form, 18 U.S.C. 3661 prohibits any limitation of the  conduct a judge may consider when sentencing a defendant, even when a  jury has determined that there was insufficient evidence to prove the  defendant committed the charged offense; it seems clearly a  constitutional violation.   Additionally, under the concept of ``relevant conduct,'' the U.S.  Sentencing Guidelines allow judges to consider a range of conduct,  including dismissed charges, uncharged conduct, and acquitted conduct  when imposing sentences. Again, might I say, seemingly a very unfair  direction given without limitations, and certainly without adherence to  the constitutional amendments.   The fact-finding made by judges at sentencing is based on a lower  evidentiary standard than at trial--that is, by a preponderance of  evidence--which many scholars defined as a 50 percent chance that a  claim is true.   The reform proposed in this bill ensures that judges punish  defendants on facts proven beyond a reasonable doubt, criminal  standard, the higher evidentiary standard of proof required during a  jury trial, which some scholars attach a value of 90 to 95 percent  surety.   Justice Ginsberg, a moderate liberal who became more liberal in later  years, joined Justice Thomas and Justice Scalia, a staunch  conservative, in his dissent in Jones v. United States, lamenting the  failure of the Court to determine if the Sixth Amendment is violated  when judges impose sentences based solely on judge-found facts.   While the Sentencing Guidelines suggested prison sentences from 27 to  71 months for the three defendants in the case, the trial judge  imposed--if you can believe it--overwhelming sentences of 180, 194, and  225 months, based on the conduct the prosecution failed to prove.   Justice Scalia's often-quoted dissent was issued more than 7 years  ago. Yet nothing has been done about this unjust, undemocratic practice  and, really, unconstitutional, which diminishes the sanctity of the  jury trial, the standard of reasonable doubt, which any layman can tell  you. When you ask them what the standard is for proving guilt or  innocence in a criminal trial, everybody knows the words, ``with  reasonable doubt.''   Can you imagine? That is not the case.  [[Page H3881]]    The public check on the government's power and the overall integrity  of the criminal justice system must be maintained.   H.R. 1621 would restore fairness to jury trials by amending Section  3661 to ban consideration of acquitted conduct at sentencing unless the  conduct is considered for mitigation purposes.   Though I wish we were doing more to advance substantive criminal  justice reform, I am happy to support this bipartisan bill that  addresses an acute need while restoring the basic propositions of due  process and the right to a trial by jury.   I want to express enthusiastic support and appreciation to  Representative   Steve Cohen, chair of the Subcommittee on the  Constitution, Civil Rights and Civil Liberties, for his commitment to  justice and for taking the lead on this significant, bipartisan bill,  along with Representative Kelly Armstrong.   A broad coalition of advocates support this measure, including--R  Street Institute, the ACLU, The Innocence Project, Brennan Center for  Justice, the American Bar Association, Families Against Mandatory  Minimums, The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, and the  Federal Public and Community Defenders.   It is for that reason I hope that the Senate will take up this bill  and pass the House version as soon as possible.   I ask my colleagues to support this bill and to continue working on  additional measures to make our justice system more equitable and more  transparent. I look forward to coming to the floor with those  initiatives.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Tennessee (Mr. Cohen), the author of this legislation; the chairman of  the Subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil Rights, and Civil Liberties  of the Committee on the Judiciary; and a strong advocate for justice.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   I thank the gentleman from Oregon for supporting this legislation. He  cited a number of judges and courts who added their support to this  important legislation.   Mr. Cohen's eloquence was in the efforts he has made to help those  who have suffered injustice.   We thank Congressman Armstrong for his work as well. The fact that  they are speaking in tandem speaks loudly on this floor.   As I close, I include in the Record the dissenting opinion of  Justices Scalia, Thomas, and Ginsburg, with simple comments from their  opinion:   ``On petitioners' appeal, the D.C. Circuit held that even if their  sentences would have been substantively unreasonable but for judge- found facts, their Sixth Amendment rights were not violated.''   That was found by the D.C. Circuit.   ``We should grant certiorari to put an end to the unbroken string of  cases disregarding the Sixth Amendment.''   So, you are more than affirmed that the Sixth Amendment in these  cases is patently disregarded.   I include in the Record the Supreme Court dissent on the Jones v.  United States case.                     SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES     Joseph Jones, Desmond Thurston, and Antwuan, Ball v. United States      ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF                APPEALS FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT                  No. 13-10026.--Decided October 14, 2014         The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.        Justice Scalia, with whom Justice Thomas and Justice       Ginsburg join, dissenting from denial of certiorari.        A jury convicted petitioners Joseph Jones, Desmond       Thurston, and Antwuan Ball of distributing very small amounts       of crack cocaine, and acquitted them of conspiring to       distribute drugs. The sentencing judge, however, found that       they had engaged in the charged conspiracy and, relying       largely on that finding, imposed sentences that petitioners       say were many times longer than those the Guidelines would       otherwise have recommended.        Petitioners present a strong case that, but for the judge's       finding of fact, their sentences would have been       ``substantively unreasonable'' and therefore illegal. See       Rita v. United States, 551 U.S. 338, 372 (2007) (Scalia, J.,       joined by Thomas, J., concurring in part and concurring in       judgment). If so, their constitutional rights were violated.       The Sixth Amendment, together with the Fifth Amendment's Due       Process Clause, ``requires that each element of a crime'' be       either admitted by the defendant, or ``proved to the jury       beyond a reasonable doubt.'' Alleyne v. United States, 570       U.S. __, __ (2013) (slip op., at 3). Any fact that increases       the penalty to which a defendant is exposed constitutes an       element of a crime, Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466,       483, n. 10, 490 (2000), and ``must be found by a jury, not a       judge,'' Cunningham v. California, 549 U.S. 270, 281 (2007).*       We have held that a substantively unreasonable penalty is       illegal and must be set aside. Gall v. United States, 552       U.S. 38, 51 (2007). It unavoidably follows that any fact       necessary to prevent a sentence from being substantively       unreasonable--thereby exposing the defendant to the longer       sentence--is an element that must be either admitted by the       defendant or found by the jury. It may not be found by a       judge.        For years, however, we have refrained from saying so. In       Rita v. United States, we dismissed the possibility of Sixth       Amendment violations resulting from substantive       reasonableness review as hypothetical and not presented by       the facts of the case. We thus left for another day the       question whether the Sixth Amendment is violated when courts       impose sentences that, but for a judge-found fact, would be       reversed for substantive unreasonableness. 551 U.S., at 353;       see also id., at 366 (Stevens, J., joined in part by       Ginsburg, J., concurring) (``Such a hypothetical case should       be decided if and when it arises''). Nonetheless, the Courts       of Appeals have uniformly taken our continuing silence to       suggest that the Constitution does permit otherwise       unreasonable sentences supported by judicial factfinding, so       long as they are within the statutory range. See, e.g.,       United States v. Benkahla, 530 F. 3d 300, 312 (CA4 2008);       United States v. Hernandez, 633 F. 3d 370, 374 (CA5 2011);       United States v. Ashqar, 582 F. 3d 819, 824-825 (CA7 2009);       United States v. Treadwell, 593 F. 3d 990, 1017-1018 (CA9       2010); United States v. Redcorn, 528 F. 3d 727, 745-746 (CA10       2008).        This has gone on long enough. The present petition presents       the case the Court claimed to have been waiting for. And it       is a particularly appealing case, because not only did no       jury convict these defendants of the offense the sentencing       judge thought them guilty of, but a jury acquitted them of       that offense. Petitioners were convicted of distributing       drugs, but acquitted of conspiring to distribute drugs. The       sentencing judge found that petitioners had engaged in the       conspiracy of which the jury acquitted them. The Guidelines,       petitioners claim, recommend sentences of between 27 and 71       months for their distribution convictions. But in light of       the conspiracy finding, the court calculated much higher       Guidelines ranges, and sentenced Jones, Thurston, and Ball to       180, 194, and 225 months' imprisonment.        On petitioners' appeal, the D.C. Circuit held that even if       their sentences would have been substantively unreasonable       but for judge-found facts, their Sixth Amendment rights were       not violated. 744 F. 3d 1362, 1369 (2014). We should grant       certiorari to put an end to the unbroken string of cases       disregarding the Sixth Amendment--or to eliminate the Sixth       Amendment difficulty by acknowledging that all sentences       below the statutory maximum are substantively reasonable.    I will say that the failure to address this issue  for so many years has contributed to the epidemics of overincarceration  and mass incarceration, weakened the finality that a jury trial is  meant to provide, and undermined overall public confidence in our  justice system.   I really think this legislation has exposed some incredulous behavior  because most people believe that you are sentenced on the reasonable  doubt convictions as opposed to additional sidebar conversations that  may come to the judge's attention in terms of other offenses.   Today, we consider a simple, narrowly tailored bill that builds on  our bipartisan effort to create a fair justice system. This bill will  make sure that defendants are punished only for the conduct that  prosecutors are able to prove at trial, consistent with the  constitutional guarantees of due process and the right to a trial by  jury of their peers, and consistent with the principles on which  country was founded.  [[Page H3883]]    Before I close, I join with my colleague from Tennessee's remarks and  indicate the deepest sympathy to the family of the dean, Congressman  Don Young. He is a voice--and I speak in the present. His presence was  larger than life. He spoke to everyone. His booming voice is something  that I am certainly going to find a great loss, as well as his love and  passion for not only his family and his great State but also for this  institution.   I don't know if we will ever find an institutionalist such as Don,  but we can certainly follow in his footsteps and his desire for order  when he cited the words ``regular order.''   We were blessed by having him here, and may he rest in peace.   Mr. Speaker, I ask that my colleagues join me in supporting this  bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass H.R. 1621, the  ``Prohibiting Punishment of Acquitted Conduct Act of 2021, as amended.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5  legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on H.R. 1621.   Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.                              Opening Statement    Mr. Speaker. I am proud to support of H.R. 1621, the ``Prohibiting  Punishment of Acquitted Conduct Act,'' which offers a solution to a  long-identified problem within our criminal justice system.   This bill provides necessary reform to current federal sentencing  practice that allows judges to sentence defendants based on conduct for  which a jury found them not guilty.   The Sixth Amendment to the Constitution provides that anyone accused  of a crime shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public jury trial,  while the Fifth Amendment provides that no person shall be deprived of  life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.   Together these provisions mean that the Government is bound to prove  each and every element of an offense for which a defendant is charged  beyond a reasonable doubt during a jury trial, or that a defendant must  admit each element of an offense to support a plea of guilty.   Notwithstanding this constitutional obligation, federal judges  routinely nullify not guilty verdicts rendered by juries and sentence  defendants to significantly higher penalties based on acquitted  conduct.   In its current form, 18 USC Sec. 3661 prohibits any limitation of the  conduct a judge may consider when sentencing a defendant, even when a  jury has determined that there was insufficient evidence to prove the  defendant committed the charged offense.   Additionally, under the concept of ``relevant conduct,'' the U.S.  Sentencing Guidelines allow judges to consider a range of conduct,  including dismissed charges, uncharged conduct, and acquitted conduct  when imposing sentences.   The fact-finding made by judges at sentencing is based on a lower  evidentiary standard than at trial--that is by a preponderance of the  law--which many scholars define as a 50% chance that a claim is true.   The reform proposed in this bill ensures that judges punish  defendants based on facts proven beyond a reasonable doubt--the higher  evidentiary standard of proof required during jury trials, which some  scholars attach a value of 90 to 95% surety.   Justice Ginsburg moderate-liberal who became more liberal in later  years, joined Justice Thomas and Justice Scalia, a staunch  conservative, in his dissent in Jones v. United States, lamenting the  failure of the Court to determine if the Sixth Amendment is violated  when judges impose sentences based solely on judge-found facts.   While the Sentencing Guidelines suggested prison sentences from 27 to  71 months for the three defendants in the case, the trial judge imposed  sentences of 180, 194, and 225 months, based on conduct the prosecution  failed to prove.   Justice Scalia's often-quoted dissent was issued more than seven  years ago.   Yet nothing has been done about this unjust, undemocratic practice,  which diminishes the sanctity of the jury trial, the public check on  the government's power, and the overall integrity of the criminal  justice system.   H.R. 1621 would restore fairness to jury trials by amending Section  3661 to ban consideration of acquitted conduct at sentencing unless the  conduct is considered for mitigation purposes.   Though I wish we were doing more to advance substantive criminal  justice reform, I support this bipartisan bill that addresses an acute  need while restoring the basic propositions of due process and the  right to trial by jury.   I thank our colleague, Representative Steve Cohen, for his commitment  to justice and for taking the lead on this significant, bipartisan bill  alongside Representative Kelly Armstrong.   A broad coalition of advocates support this measure, including R  Street Institute, the ACLU, The Innocence Project, Brennan Center for  Justice, the American Bar Association, Families Against Mandatory  Minimums, the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, and  Federal Public & Community Defenders.   It is my hope that the Senate will take up and pass the House version  of this bill soon.   I ask my colleagues to support this bill and to continue working  together on additional measures to make our justice system more  equitable and more transparent.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R.  4738, the ``COVID-19 American History Project Act.''   This bill directs the American Folklife Center at the Library of  Congress to establish the COVID-19 American History Project which will  collect and make publicly available individual stories and records of  experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States.   The bill includes a requirement to collect video and audio histories  and testimonials of those who were affected by the pandemic.   Mr. Speaker, the United States will soon reach a grave milestone. As  of 9 o'clock this morning, there have been 974,277 American deaths from  COVID-19. In the coming weeks, we will reach 1,000,000 deaths.   However, I believe that only focusing on that horrific number, though  nonetheless important, makes us forget about who we lost.   Therefore, with this time I would like to tell the stories of my  fellow Houstonians who sadly passed because of this unprecedented  public health crisis.   The stories I will be recounting are all courtesy of Houston Public  Media, of whose journalists I have been a strong supporter.   Knowing that his daughter would be unable to walk at her college  graduation commencement due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Dr. Carlos  Araujo-Preza threw his daughter, Andrea Araujo, a belated graduation  celebration with her close friends and family in late October. She said  he really put in the effort to give her the best ceremony he could.   Dr. Araujo-Preza always went out of his way to make sure his daughter  and her brother were taken care of, despite a busy work schedule at  Tomball Regional Hospital. The siblings and their father spent their  weekends together binge-watching movies and TV shows together.   But in 2020, Andrea Araujo was forced to spend her 23rd birthday  without her father.   Araujo-Preza was two weeks away from receiving his first round of the  COVID-19 vaccine before he passed away. He died Nov 30, 2020, at the  age of 51.   He knew at a young age he was meant to pursue a career in the medical  field. Coming from a family of doctors himself, Araujo-Preza was viewed  as a loving caregiver and someone his patients could always rely on.   Araujo-Preza was the leading doctor at his hospital who specialized  in plasma research, while also distributing COVID-19 vaccines to  nurses.   ``His colleagues were fans of him,'' she said. ``They loved when he  came into work.''   He would go out of his way to give his personal phone number to  patients and would accommodate their needs at any time of day. Araujo  said her father would wake up as early as 3 a.m. to go into work.  Araujo-Preza would sleep in the hospital for days and sometimes weeks  at a time to always be on call for his patients.   Now, Araujo said she tries to live by a saying her father used to  share in Spanish: ``The sun always rises the next day.'' Araujo-Preza  would tell his children to not let daily challenges in life hold them  back. Because, he said, as life goes on, you should too.  [[Page H3887]]    ``I feel like people always say, `with time, things get better', but  I've noticed it's quite the opposite,'' she said. ``Every day gets  harder.''   That story was courtesy of Emily Jaroszewski at Houston Public Media.   The next story is one that is especially close to my heart: Dick  Cigler from the University of Houston.   Those who were mentored by Dick Cigler would tell you he left a  lasting impression as one of the most influential staff members at the  Daily Cougar--a highly regarded champion of free speech at the  University of Houston's newspaper.   ``He taught us about the importance of journalism,'' said Tanya  Eiserer, an Emmy-award winning reporter for WFAA in Dallas and former  Daily Cougar student editor. ``He really taught us the importance of  doing the right thing, doing it for the right reasons; and standing up  for the underdog.''   Nowhere was that more evident than when, in the 1990s, a group of UH  journalists wrote a series of articles challenging the decreased  university budget for UH downtown students and the increased budget for  subsidiary campuses.   Dick allowed the students to voice their concerns brazenly.   ``He didn't try to, you know, tell us to back down,'' Eiserer said.  ``He ran interference, and they knew that we were an independent news  operation.''   Eiserer remembers Cigler as being a listening ear and a guiding  mentor when she transferred from Baylor University to UH. She regarded  him as one of the people who helped her become the reporter she is  today.   ``I learned how to be a journalist at the Daily Cougar,'' said  Eiserer. ``I would not give that time back for all the money in the  world.''   Cigler worked as Director of UH's Student Publications department,  now known as the Center for Student Media, for 23 years until his  retirement in 2010.   His impact on the Daily Cougar can be felt to this day.   Cigler died on Jan. 24, 2021, at the age of 79. He leaves behind his  two daughters Kerri Runge and Michelle Cigler.   That story was courtesy of Myrakel Baker at Houston Public Media.   The last individual I want to mention is someone who is a local hero  but should be a national one. That person was John Bland.   More than 60 years ago, a group of Texas Southern University students  took seats at the lunch counter at Weingarten's Supermarket at 4110  Almeda Road, knowing they wouldn't be served.   It was Houston's first sit-in, and that spring, Black college  students in cities across the country forced the beginning of an end to  racial segregation--at lunch counters, department stores, and city  halls.   One of the TSU students at the sit-in was John Bland, a 20-year-old  who spent the rest of his life working to advance civil rights and  equal opportunity.   Bland worked as a bus operator at HouTran, now called Metro, and he  spent more than 50 years organizing with the Transport Workers Union.  He served as a vice president of the Texas State AFL-CIO, a president  of the Houston chapter of the Coalition of Black Trade Unionists, a  precinct judge, and a member of the Houston Police Department Citizen  Review Committee.   ``When workers would doubt their ability to beat the odds and make  change, Mr. Bland would say, `When we fought for integration in the  1960s, they arrested me 27 times, jailed me, and fined me, but that  didn't stop us,' '' Hany Khalil, Executive Director of the Texas Gulf  Coast Area Labor Federation, said.   Bland died on July 9, 2020, at the age of 80. He leaves behind his  wife, Betty Davis Bland, and their two daughters and grandson.   That story was courtesy of Jen Rice at Houston Public Media.   I wish I could mention every Houstonian and honor their lives because  they all deserve it. They were mothers, wives, fathers, husbands, sons,  daughters, and so much more. They will all be missed and are not just  another number.   It is for that reason, Mr. Speaker, that I strongly support H.R. 4738  and urge my colleagues to support it as well.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 3294, a bill to  place in the Capitol or on the Capitol Grounds a statue to honor  Associate Justice of the Supreme Court Sandra Day O'Connor and a statue  to honor Associate Justice of the Supreme Court Ruth Bader Ginsburg.   Justice Sandra Day O'Connor was the first woman nominated to the  United States Supreme Court by President Ronald Regan and was the 102nd  appointee to the position.   Justice O'Connor served from September 25, 1981, until her retirement  on January 31, 2006.   During her tenure on the court, Justice O'Connor was often the  crucial swing vote in 5-4 decisions that included many of the most  controversial issues of our time.   Justice O'Connor has had a long and distinguished career as a public  servant, including three terms as an Arizona State Senator, and serving  as a judge on the Superior Court of Maricopa County, and the Arizona  Court of Appeals.   Associate Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg was the second woman appointed,  and the first Jewish woman, to preside on United States Supreme Court.   Justice Ginsburg was appointed to the court by President Bill Clinton  on August 10, 1993 and served on the court until her death on September  18, 2020.   Justice Ginsburg was an advocate for woman's rights long before she  was appointed to the court. She co-founded the Women's Rights Project  at the ACLU.   In the words of the late Justice Ginsburg, ``women's rights are an  essential part of the overall human rights agenda, trained on the equal  dignity and ability to live in freedom all people should enjoy.''   These women broke down barriers that once stood in the way of  equality. Their determination and persistence allowed for women across  the nation to fight for their rights and achieve their dreams.   Their sacrifices paved the way for many firsts en the Federal bench.  Justice Sonia Sotomayor was the first Hispanic woman to be appointed to  the position, and just last month, Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson was the  first African American woman to be nominated to the court.   Although these are monumental steps for women and gender equality,  there is still much work that needs to be done.   It is our duty as Members of Congress to acknowledge and commemorate  these inspiring Supreme Court Justices. The two statues in our nation's  Capital will honor the lives and legacies of these two pioneering  women. Moreover, by celebrating Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Justice  Sandra Day O'Connor we celebrate the impact of women nationwide and  showcase these two leaders as remodels for future generations. I urge  all my colleagues to support S. 3294.
