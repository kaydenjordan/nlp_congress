 Mr. Speaker, I want to extend my congratulations to  my friend from New Jersey for his work on this and so many other  issues, and for his constant dedication to this Congress.   I also sit on the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee with  Congressman Frelinghuysen. I just want to thank the gentleman for his  leadership, hard work, and his years of travel around the world to make  sure that the men and women in our military are safe and protected and  have the equipment that they need. So I thank the gentleman for all his  service.   I rise in support, Mr. Speaker, of this conference agreement. Once  again, we see that the Congress can pass decent legislation when  Republicans and Democrats, House and Senate, all work together to reach  a bipartisan agreement instead of one party trying to make all the  decisions behind closed doors. This bill and these bills reflect that.   The bill we are sending to the President's desk takes care of our  veterans; it funds our civilian and military infrastructure and energy  needs; and it pays for the operations of the legislative branch  institutions essential to our democracy. Almost every agency in the  legislative branch division of this bill receives its full budget  request.   One of the highlights of the bill is the funding for the Government  Accountability Office, which works to root out waste, fraud, and abuse  governmentwide. With so many safeguards having failed against  mismanagement and corruption in our government over the past few years,  the GAO is more important than ever.   By providing the resources for the GAO to take another step toward  restoring its pre-sequestration capacity, we are helping to save  taxpayers money and prevent some of the worst abuses of the  administration.   Another key accomplishment in this measure is the restoration of the  dedicated funding for paid internships in the House of Representatives.  I also want to thank the gentlewoman from New York and the gentleman  from New Jersey for helping make that possible.   It has been 25 years since we have had a paid internship program here  in the United States Congress. Once more, when a young person from a  middle-class family comes to Washington, D.C., and desires to enter  public service, they can worry a little bit less about the costs here  in Washington, D.C., for rent and grocery bills, and compete with other  applicants based on merit instead of economic background, which is just  a matter of basic fairness.                                time  1515    There are so many other issues.   One more, Mr. Speaker, that I would like to mention in this bill is  that we have ensured we are doing all we can to address the epidemic of  harassment and discrimination that has existed since time immemorial  but rightly showed up in the headlines in the last year or two.   The Office of Compliance is given over $1.3 million more than last  year so they can have the resources to tackle the problem and to handle  the increased workload we have given them by expanding their  jurisdiction. In the near future, we expect their mission to expand  further, and these funds will help them prepare for that.   Again, I extend my sincere thanks especially, again, to Chairman  Frelinghuysen, who is leaving, Nita Lowey, Chairman Fortenberry,  Senator Daines and Senator Murphy, and so many others.   Also, thank you to the staffs on both sides, including Anne Sokolov,  Ryan Keating, Adam Berg, Jenny Panone, Tim Monahan, and Reyn Archer,  for making this bill possible and, as Congressman Simpson said, for the  long hours that they have put in over the August recess to make this  happen.
