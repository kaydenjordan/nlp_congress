 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support  of the Green New Deal, which I am proud to cosponsor with Senator  Markey and Representative Ocasio-Cortez.   We are in a climate emergency, and we must work together to fight  back and build an economy for everyone, an economy that just doesn't  meet the threats of climate change but also directly invests in our  communities.   Everyone deserves safe water to drink, clean air to breathe, and a  healthy place to live. Right now, we are not just failing the next  generation; we are failing Americans today.   This impacts all of us, from low-income communities that have been  victims of environmental injustice to the millions of people whose  livelihoods depend on agriculture. We must be prepared to lead and  understand the link between housing and climate justice.   Our cities need active and green public transit and walkable  neighborhoods. We can build a sustainable future and create good union  jobs.   Our country needs a Green New Deal, and I pledge to keep fighting for  those values every single day.                            ____________________
