 Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight to recognize my dear  friend and chief of staff, Maytee Sanz.   This week, the Congressional Hispanic Leadership Institute, CHLI,  will honor Maytee with the Stephen Vermillion Congressional Staff  Appreciation Award.   Oftentimes--most of the time--Members of Congress receive the praise  for the excellent work of their staff. That has certainly been the case  with Maytee. Leading my staff, Maytee has been instrumental in the  effective functioning of my office and keeping our policy priorities on  track and connected to the community.   Maytee started working with me since my early days in the Florida  Legislature, a long time ago, and rose from her role as my district  aide to become my congressional chief of staff. Along the way, she  earned both her master's and bachelor's degrees from NSU, Nova  Southeastern University, in addition to finding time to mentor many  young men and women who have come through our office.   The CHLI Stephen Vermillion award is much-deserved, and South Florida  has been well-served by having Maytee at the helm of our office.   Felicidades, Doctora Sanz.                            ____________________
