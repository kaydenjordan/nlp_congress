 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I want to begin by thanking the  Senator from Illinois. Not only did she serve this country, she  sacrificed for this country. I for one, as I see her rolling up and  down the aisles and through the halls, am just so proud and so thankful  for her, for her family, for her work, and particularly I thank her for  these comments. I think the Senator is very worthy, and I am delighted  to be her colleague.   Mr. President, I, too, rise in strong opposition to the confirmation  of Steven Bradbury to serve as general counsel in the Department of  Transportation.   Steven Bradbury has a troubling history of disregard for United  States and international law and seems unable to offer objective legal  analysis. Both of these troubling characteristics were on display when  he helped justify the CIA's torture program.   I was on the Intelligence Committee during this period of time--and  still am--and one of the things we wanted to see were the Office of  Legal Counsel memoranda. The OLC memos were never given to us, although  individuals from the Department came and spoke to us about them.   Steven Bradbury was head of the Justice Department's Office of Legal  Counsel from 2005 to 2009. During that time, he wrote four legal  memos--finally declassified, finally here--and this is what they look  like. Those memos provided the legal foundation for waterboarding and  other interrogation techniques that were tantamount to torture.   The first memo, written on May 10, 2005, concludes that the use of  so-called enhanced interrogation techniques was lawful. This memo,  which addressed torture techniques including waterboarding, was written  to replace the previous classified Office of Legal Counsel opinions.   The second memo, also written on May 10, found that the use of  multiple interrogation techniques would not violate U.S. law because  there would be no severe mental pain or suffering, just physical  distress.   The third memo, written on May 30, 2005, reaffirmed a previous OLC  opinion that the CIA's use of torture, such as waterboarding, was not  prohibited by the Convention against Torture, so long as it was done  overseas. That memo also concluded that constitutional prohibitions  against cruel, unusual, and inhumane treatment or punishment did not  apply.   The fourth memo, written on July 20, 2007, concluded that the  continued use of six enhanced interrogation techniques by the CIA,  including forced nudity and extended sleep deprivation, did not violate  the Detainee Treatment Act or the War Crimes Act or the Geneva  Conventions.   By writing these four memos, Bradbury not only provided the feeble  foundation upon which the CIA violated well-established law and  military doctrine, he also endangered U.S. troops--as the Senator from  Illinois has pointed out--betrayed our country's values, and  compromised our standing as a world leader.   The tactics used by the CIA were not only more brutal than was known,  they also didn't produce actionable intelligence. We have a 7,000-page  document, with 32,000 footnotes, which took 6 years of reviewing cables  and information--all factual, not declassified, and a summary was  declassified--and to date, nothing in it has been contradicted.  Capturing terror suspects and torturing them in secret facilities  failed. Period.   Among Bradbury's many troubling conclusions in these memos were that  neither the Constitution's prohibitions against inhumane treatment nor  the U.N. Convention Against Torture applied to the CIA's activities  outside U.S. territory. That is interesting.   Even more troubling, Bradbury's 2007 memo was written with the  purpose of evading congressional intent. It is stunning that the head  of the Office of Legal Counsel would knowingly work to find loopholes  in the law to justify the use of torture.   On October 5, 2005, the Senate voted 90 to 9 to approve the Detainee  Treatment Act of 2005. This law stated: ``No individual in the custody  or under the physical control of the United States Government,  regardless of nationality or physical location, shall be subject to  cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment.''   However, less than 2 years later, Bradbury's fourth torture memo  explicitly allowed the CIA to continue many of the abusive  interrogation techniques that Congress clearly intended to prohibit in  the Detainee Treatment Act of 2005. These include forced nudity and  extended sleep deprivation. This should be a disqualifier for  [[Page S7204]]  continued service in the U.S. Government, regardless of the position, I  believe.   It is true that Congress settled this matter in June of 2015 when,  thanks to Senator McCain, we voted overwhelmingly to prohibit torture  in that year's National Defense Authorization Act, but that doesn't  change the fact that Bradbury did his best to bypass Congress a decade  earlier by writing those torture memos.   It is also true that as general counsel of the Transportation  Department, Bradbury wouldn't be tasked with duties connected to  detainees. But by ignoring the intent of Congress in order to justify  the CIA's continued use of torture, Bradbury ignored the law to achieve  a desired result and that is unacceptable.   Even the Justice Department found fault with Bradbury's actions.  After the OLC torture memos came to light, the Department of Justice  conducted an investigation of the facts and the circumstances  surrounding those memos and DOJ's role in the implementation of the CIA  interrogation program.   On June 29, 2009, the Justice Department found ``serious concerns''  about the objectivity and reasonableness of Bradbury's work. This  included evidence that he gave into pressure in order to produce  opinions that would allow the CIA torture program to continue.   The Department of Justice report cited several Bush administration  officials who believed Bradbury was producing opinions with the goal of  allowing the program to continue.   Jim Comey, who served as Deputy Attorney General at the time of  Bradbury's memos, said there was significant pressure from the White  House--specifically Vice President Cheney and his staff--to allow the  program to continue. Comey said that one would have to be ``an idiot  not to know what was wanted.'' Comey also said that in his opinion,  Bradbury knew that ``if he rendered an opinion that shut down or  hobbled the [interrogation] program the Vice President . . . would be  furious.''   John Bellinger, who in 2007 served as legal advisor to Secretary of  State Condoleezza Rice, wrote to Bradbury and stated that he was  ``concerned that the [2007 Bradbury] opinion's careful parsing of  statutory and treaty terms'' would be considered ``a work of advocacy  to achieve a desired outcome.''   The DOJ was also concerned that Bradbury relied too heavily on the  CIA's reviews of its own interrogation program, which of course were  positive.   During a time when we needed independent voices in government to  check the CIA's actions, Bradbury failed to rise to the occasion. He  failed to fulfill the responsibilities of his position.   The Senate twice refused to confirm Bradbury as Assistant Attorney  General for the Office of Legal Counsel during the Bush administration  because of this very issue. Nothing has changed since that time. I urge  my colleagues to oppose his nomination.   Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.
