 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, as millions looked forward to an early  summer weekend, Virginia Beach, VA, became the latest community where  lives were shattered by violence. Twelve workers at the Virginia Beach  Municipal Center were shot and killed when a lone gunman--a fellow  employee--opened fire on Friday afternoon. Some of the victims had  worked for the city for decades, one for just under a year. All of them  leave behind a grieving community that must now try to make sense of  the senseless. And several more of their colleagues were injured.   As the community rallies behind those in grief and shock, the Nation  is also learning about the selfless heroism of the law enforcement  officers who bravely brought the violence to an end. Four officers  moved quickly through the municipal building that housed 400 workers.  They quickly located the  [[Page S3147]]  shooter, hemmed him in to prevent further innocent casualties, and  engaged him in a firefight. Reportedly, one officer was actually shot  but was spared serious injury due to his bulletproof vest.   Thanks to their bravery, about 45 minutes after the shooting began,  the suspect was in police custody.   Such stories of courage strike us as remarkable. They inspire  gratitude and remind us of humanity's best, just as we are faced with  its worst. They should also be occasions to remember just how many men  and women across America put on their uniforms every day and report to  work, knowing they might be called on for heroism just like this.  Hundreds of thousands of police officers and other first responders  across our Nation protect and serve every day.   I know that all of my colleagues join me in prayer and solidarity for  the victims of this evil violence, for their families, and for all of  the first responders who stand ready to jump between their neighbors  and harm's way.                           Remembering Thad Cochran    Mr. President, on Thursday morning, we received sad news out of  Oxford, MS. Our friend and distinguished former colleague, Senator Thad  Cochran, had passed away.   Thad took retirement a little more than a year ago to focus on his  health and his family. That day concluded a truly remarkable career in  the history of the Senate: seven terms; nearly four decades; the second  longest serving Senator from Mississippi; and the tenth longest serving  Senator, period, in American history.   To put it all another way, when Senator Cochran first arrived in  1978, only one of our current colleagues was here to witness it. The  other 99 of us are all newer at this club than Thad was.   Such a storied career was far from guaranteed when Thad decided to  give politics a try back in the early 1970s. I have always enjoyed the  story about his very first run for Congress.   Remember, Mississippi had only had one other Republican Congressman  since Reconstruction. So when this young rising-star lawyer asked Rose  how she might like being married to a Congressman, here was her  response: ``I don't know, which one?''   If Thad's presence here in Congress at one point seemed improbable,  it quickly became difficult to imagine Capitol Hill without him. His  fruitful career produced a huge number of legislative accomplishments  and a sterling reputation as a thoughtful, measured, and effective  leader. He chaired the Appropriations Committee, the Agriculture  Committee, and the Republican conference. He was at once a powerful  force within our ranks and a trusted friend and partner to many of our  friends across the aisle as well.   In just the past few days, the authors of eulogies and tributes have  enjoyed noting all the ways that Thad seemed to embody a whole region  and era, as though he had come right out of central casting. One  obituary talked up the ``traditional catfish fries,'' ``homespun  politics,'' and ``Southern charm.'' Another newspaper described his  ``Southern gentility'' as a ``courtly'' and ``understated style,''  seeming to suggest that approach was at odds with his impressive and  powerful perch.   It is true that over seven terms in this body, Chairman Cochran  appeared on ``Meet the Press'' only twice. To say he did not crave a  national spotlight would certainly be an understatement. He was just  too busy racking up progress for the people of Mississippi and for the  country--busy managing the appropriations process; busy finding new  ways to elevate historically Black colleges and universities with  scholarship opportunities, research grant funding, and new initiatives;  busy working across the aisle on matters of national security, like the  bipartisan Cochran-Inouye National Missile Defense Act; busy using his  voice to champion the concerns of farmers and rural communities,  clearing obstacles on commodity pricing and wetlands conservation.   Thad was so confident in American agriculture that he used it as a  tool for international development. Now overseas farm delegations learn  U.S. techniques firsthand through the Cochran Fellowship Program.    As much as the long list of achievements continued to grow, Thad  Cochran's character and his values stayed steady. Thad may not have  followed his schoolteacher parents into the education business, but he  sure did take us all to school. His colleagues learned firsthand that a  dogged work ethic and compassionate friendship are not incompatible  here. His constituents learned that their ``quiet persuader'' kept his  promises. And the Nation learned from a first-rate example of humility  and grace in public service.   So while we mourn that we no longer have our friend Thad in this  life, we should also celebrate all of those lessons he taught us and  celebrate the fact that they aren't going anywhere.   On Thad's last day in the Senate, he left us with a remarkable  farewell statement. In it, he noted that John Stennis, another long- tenured Mississippian, had previously used Thad's desk and had signed  it, per Senate custom. But while Senator Stennis had noted his start  date in 1947, he never wrote down any end date on the other side of the  dash. ``Perhaps there is symbolism there,'' Thad wrote in his farewell,  ``that our service does not end when we depart this Chamber.''   Isn't that the truth? When it comes to Thad Cochran, his legacy and  his example are part of this place for good. His impact continues. His  service still inspires all of us.   I want to close with a reference to one more part of Thad's farewell.  Here are his very last words in the Congressional Record, the capstone  to 45 years of statesmanship. This is what he said:         I will now return to my beloved Mississippi and my family       and my friends there. I will miss this stately Chamber and       this city. I will not miss the power or politics. I will miss       people: you, my colleagues. . . . I trust, if your travels       bring you to Oxford, MS, you will not hesitate to visit and       join me for a refreshment on the porch. We can listen to the       mockingbirds together.    That was our colleague--gracious, generous, always with his home  State and his fellow Mississippians at the top of his mind and deep in  his heart.   Today, at the State capitol in Jackson, Mississippians gathered to  return the favor. Thad Cochran is at the top of their minds. He is deep  in their hearts, and, most importantly, our friend is on his way to a  just reward in his Father's house.   So the Senate today sends our condolences and our prayers to Thad's  wife Kay; his two children, Clayton and Kate; his grandchildren; and  many, many friends. We stand together in remembering our good friend.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that  notwithstanding rule XXII, at 5:45 p.m. on Tuesday, June 4, the Senate  resume legislative session, the Judiciary Committee be discharged, and  the Senate proceed to the consideration of S.

Thereupon, the Senate, at 6:55 p.m., adjourned until Tuesday, June 4,  2019, at 10 a.m.
