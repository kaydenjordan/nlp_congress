 Mr. President, today I would like to take a moment  to recognize and honor the life of a great South Carolinian and  American veteran, Mr. Elijah ``Yockie'' DeLee, who departed this life  on July 20, 2017.   Elijah was a lifelong resident of Dorchester County, SC, where he  worked tirelessly as a beloved deacon at Surprise Baptist Church. He  was drafted into the Vietnam war shortly after graduating high school  and showed perseverance until he was honorably discharged. He possessed  an entrepreneurial spirit and followed his passion for drag racing to  help open South Carolina's first minority-owned dragway: Dorchester  Dragway. He continued his business endeavors with the opening of DeLee  One Trucking Company, still a staple in Dorchester today. In success,  Elijah always exemplified respect, humility, and generosity.   For many in Dorchester, he will be remembered for his relentless  spirit, tenacity for life, and heart for people. He never met a  stranger and was always eager to lend a helping hand. Yockie loved and  adored his family, and next to God and his faith, they were always his  top priority in life. He was a true provider, mediator, demonstrator,  and imitator of Godly character. He will surely be missed among family,  friends, and the community of Dorchester as a great American and South  Carolinian.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I would like to congratulate and  honor New Light Beulah Baptist Church in Hopkins, SC, for their 150th  anniversary, which will be celebrated on August 11 to 13, 2017.   New Light Beulah Baptist Church was established in 1867 when 665  African-American members of Beulah Baptist Church chose to separate  from the White members and began independent rule. Despite the  sanctuary burning to the ground in 1916, the church thrived and  expanded. Since then, several other churches have been formed out of  New Light Beulah Baptist. In 2015, the members accepted Dr. Malcolm  Taylor as their pastor, and over 360 members call New Light Beulah  their place of worship today.   In August 2017, New Light Beulah Baptist Church will be the first  African-American church in the lower Richland community to be  registered in the National Register of Historic Places. The church has  remained committed to its mission, and I encourage all South  Carolinians to recognize the rich history of the church and its  contribution to the Palmetto State. I acknowledge and celebrate the  church's 150 years of independence as a congregation faithfully serving  their community.                            ____________________
