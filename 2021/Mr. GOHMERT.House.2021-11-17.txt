 Madam Speaker, I looked at the video anime and was  trying to figure it out. I couldn't see it. I am told if you stop it  frame by frame, you can see what my Democrat friends are talking about.  I couldn't see it. I tried to freeze-frame, and I saw what I was told  was supposed to be our colleague, Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez. I was  insulted for her. If that is supposed to be her, that is really unfair.   Madam Speaker, I didn't see the violence being talked about. We  should not condone violence. The reason it is so hard to sit here and  listen to the condemnation from the other side is because when there  was violence against us, there was no condemnation.   My wife and I went to a speech at the White House, and I have yet to  hear anybody condemn the attempted violence on us. We were chased for  two blocks. Rand Paul was on TV when he was chased because he had  cameras and Secret Service around him. We didn't have that.   If it weren't for a guy popping up and opening a locked door, we  would have--I told Kathy: Look, I am afraid they are going to get here  before this door is opened. You run on down to Pennsylvania Avenue.  There are cops down there. They will be beating on me; you just get  away.   Nobody has condemned all that violence that I have ever heard.   This is where we ought to be able to come together. Oh, and by the  way, people who committed violence and did crimes in this building need  to be punished. For many of them, the most serious crime was  obstructing an official session of Congress.   I didn't know it was a crime in 2016, but most of the Democratic  Party committed a felony right here in this Chamber by obstructing an  official session of Congress, not 6 hours like January 6, but 26 hours.
