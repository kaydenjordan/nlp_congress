 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize an individual  I recently had the pleasure of having a conversation with, a singer- songwriter who, more importantly, is a tremendous supporter of our  troops, John Ondrasik of Five for Fighting.   John started Five for Fighting in 1995, and shortly thereafter rose  to  [[Page H6188]]  fame after releasing the Grammy-nominated ballad ``Superman''. While  written and released well before 9/11, ``Superman'' became something of  an anthem during the tough days following 9/11.   As our Nation came together as one, ``Superman'' struck a chord with  the survivors and families of those we lost on that terrible day, as  well as our troops serving around the world. And its lyrics resonated  with people and comforted those who needed it the most.   Mr. Speaker, since then, John has been deeply involved with our  troops. He has performed at dozens of USO shows for our servicemembers  overseas and also works with several veteran-oriented charities. John  has spent the past two decades writing deeply personal songs that  include social messages that make an emotional connection and invoke  the human spirit.   Some of these songs are included on the ``CD for the Troops'' project  which is a collection of 13 songs from top artists, including John's,  that was compiled specially for U.S. military members.   Since 2007, John has distributed over 1 million copies of ``CD for  the Troops'' to servicemembers and their families around the world as a  way of thanking them for the sacrifices that they have made and  continue to make.   John's support of the U.S. Armed Forces is unwavering and, like many  of us, when he saw the devastating images coming out of Afghanistan  during the onset of the U.S. withdrawal in August, he was horrified.  Terrified mothers were throwing their babies over barbed wire fences  and men were clinging on to military aircraft as they lifted off, all  in an attempt to flee the Taliban. How could this be happening?   John then did what many musicians in pain do. He sat at his piano and  he wrote a song. He penned ``Blood on My Hands'' which is a song that  mourns the Americans who died and the ones who were left behind in  Afghanistan due to the failures of the administration. ``Blood on My  Hands'' encapsulates the emotions that I and many Americans felt  following the terrorist attacks in Kabul that killed 13 U.S.  servicemembers and dozens of Afghani allies. Similar to ``Superman's''  effect on people post-9/11, ``Blood on My Hands'' went viral and  quickly became an anthem for veterans and servicemembers in the wake of  the deadly attacks in Kabul.   Mr. Speaker, many people cautioned John not to release the song.  Still, he kept coming back to the idea that this song sent an important  moral message about the disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan. John  says of ``Blood on My Hands'': ``It's not a political song. It is a  moral message about promises that we made to people there, that we  promised to protect, that we left there. We broke our promise. It's  about accountability and admitting when you make mistakes because  that's how you can rectify them and learn not to do them again.''   Mr. Speaker, I could not agree more with this sentiment. What  happened to no person left behind? We put American citizens, SIV  holders, and Afghan allies' lives at risk. The United States of America  and this administration broke that promise to these people. The  administration's decisions surrounding the withdrawal will go down, I  believe, as one of the worst foreign policy decisions in American  history. As a result, American lives were needlessly lost.    It is time our leaders reflect on the mistakes that were made and  take accountability for failures so that we can do better for the  American people and our allies in the future.   Mr. Speaker, John's work is evidence of the power that music holds.  It brings people from different corners of the world together. It  transcends time, and I am confident that John's song, ``Blood on My  Hands'', will do just that.   We will never forget 9/11 and, in the same vein, we can never forget  the heroes who fought in the subsequent 20-year war in Afghanistan.  Thanks to brave storytellers like John Ondrasik, we won't forget these  heroes.   Mr. Speaker, John is a true patriot, and I applaud and admire his  courage to stand up for what he believes in, and even more so, demand  accountability from our Nation's leaders.                            ____________________
