 Mr. Speaker, first built in 1884 in south  Orange County, Cook's Corner has become a historic and iconic staple in  California's 40th Congressional District in Trabuco Canyon for local  residents, motorcycle enthusiasts, and for tourists from all over  southern California and from all over the Nation.   On August 23, 2023, our community was rocked by a horrific shooting  at Cook's Corner that resulted in three deaths and six wounded.   We are grateful for our local law enforcement, especially the Orange  County Sheriff deputies and first responders who responded quickly at  the scene.   As our community mourns and picks up the pieces, we also know we are  stronger together.   Today, I rise with bipartisan Members of our California delegation  and ask all Members to join me in a moment of silence in the memory of  the victims: Tonya Clark of Arizona; Glen Sprowl, Jr., of Stanton; and  John Leehey of Irvine; and in solidarity with the communities that I  represent.                            ____________________
