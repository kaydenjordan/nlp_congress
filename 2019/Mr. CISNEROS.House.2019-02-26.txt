 Mr. Speaker, this emergency declaration  unconstitutionally attempts to override Congress. The Constitution  clearly grants Congress the power of the purse. This declaration took  place after weeks of negotiations which resulted in Congress rejecting  the President's wall in a bipartisan manner.   This declaration could take billions of dollars of disaster relief  aid from families, endanger military construction, and impact our  military readiness. There is no national emergency at the southern  border, only a humanitarian crisis created by our President.   This President has repeatedly taken actions that undermine our  country's ability to defend against real threats to national security.   Congress must act as a check on the President's abuse of executive  power. Congress has the opportunity to defend and protect the  Constitution and assert its role as a coequal branch of government, and  it must do so in order to set a precedent and protect our democracy.   It is absolutely unacceptable that military families and communities  across this country should be made to suffer from this unlawful and  dangerous action. That is why I urge my colleagues to vote in support  of this resolution and move forward with ending this fake national  emergency.
