 Madam President, I come forward today to  recognize the chief executive officer of the Regional Transportation  Commission of Southern Nevada, Tina Quigley, who, after over 14 years  of dedicated service, announced her retirement this year.   Tina Quigley has been a visionary during her tenure at the Regional  Transportation Commission of Southern Nevada. Her forward thinking and  planning for the future has led the RTC to be named one of the most  efficient transit providers in the Nation. Her leadership has helped  Southern Nevada reap the benefits of an advanced transportation system  that has helped attract tourists, residents, and new businesses.   Ms. Quigley has over 25 years of experience in transportation  management. She has consistently been on the leading edge of improving  how residents, workers, and visitors travel the Las Vegas Valley. With  a rapidly growing population of 2.1 million residents and more than 42  million annual visitors, that is no small task. Her determination in  pushing for technological advancements, forging partnerships, and  strategizing for the future have positioned the region for ongoing and  sustained economic growth.   Ms. Quigley is also a licensed pilot and earned her bachelor of  science degree in aviation business and planning from Embry Riddle  Aeronautical University. She is a former manager of one of the Nation's  busiest airports, McCarran International Airport, and has amassed an  impressive number of professional achievements throughout her career.   The incredible work that Ms. Quigley has done for Southern Nevada has  not gone unrecognized. She has earned numerous awards for her  leadership, innovation, and vision. These awards include but are not  limited to the Woman of Distinction Award for Government Services by  the National Association of Women Business Owners, the Carolyn M.  Sparks Founders Award from the Nevada International Women's Forum, and  the 2012 Women in Transportation award from Metro Magazine.   Ms. Quigley has also remembered to give back to her community and has  directed her energy, passion, and commitment into bettering the Las  Vegas Valley. She serves on a multitude of boards and committees in  Southern Nevada, including as chairperson of the Desert Research  Institute Foundation, which supports the nonprofit environmental  science research branch of the Nevada System of Higher Education.   Today, I celebrate the many contributions of Tina Quigley to the city  of Las Vegas and to the Southern Nevada community. Her service is as an  example to all of us who wish to innovate, serve, and better our  communities.                            ____________________
