 Mr. Chair, I recognize my dear friends,  Chairman Womack and Ranking Member Hoyer, and I do mean that in the  truest sense of the word, for their work on this bill, which does  contain several of my priorities.   I do want to respond quickly to the chairman's comments about the  border really being the problem with fentanyl coming across into the  United States and that it is not necessary to fund the Office of  National Drug Control Policy.   When you focus on safety, making sure that you can keep people safe  from harm that they can't avoid on their own, we need layers of  protection. So it is a fool's errand to cut an office like the Office  of National Drug Control Policy because we aren't doing enough, in your  mind, to handle drug entries into the country from the border. It is  ``both/and'' when it comes to safety, not ``either/or.''   Unfortunately, this bill, although it does contain several of my  priorities, has so many misguided, toxic, and extreme provisions that  it will make us all less safe and careens our government once again  toward a shutdown.   This is a bill that is rather unsung. I always try to come and talk  about this bill. It does have a whole lot of acronym agencies that have  far reach into Americans' protection, security, and safety. It is so  important that we make sure we shine a little bit of a spotlight on it  as a result.   This bill does prioritize reducing pool and spa deaths by providing  $2.5 million for programs authorized under my Virginia Graeme Baker  Pool and Spa Safety Act, for which I appreciate the chairman's help. As  the leading cause of unintentional death for children under 5 in the  United States, drowning is clearly a public health threat that we must  confront.   However, sadly, overall this bill makes all of our constituents less  safe. This bill handcuffs consumer watchdogs, leaving hardworking  families more vulnerable to fraud or dangerous deadly products. It guts  the Consumer Product Safety Commission's already paltry budget,  slashing resources at an agency that has a major focus on protecting  children and families. We need  [[Page H5555]]  to keep families safe, not make them nervous to choose products when  they walk down the aisles of a store.   On top of protecting scammers and cheats, this bill hurts public  servants and threatens our national security.   How does it do that? The same Republicans who claim to support our  national defense and Armed Forces would cut the National Security  Council in this bill and the Office of Terrorism and Financial  Intelligence.   The same Republicans who boast how tough they are on heroin and  fentanyl actually cut the Office of National Drug Control Policy in  this bill.   Don't believe Republicans who claim to be the party of law and order,  either. This bill actually underfunds multiple levels of our Federal  courts and the public defenders. This bill basically waves white-collar  criminals right on through to do their sketchy business by cutting the  SEC and the FTC.   If you want to empower scammers and cheats or get more robocallers  bothering you at home by ringing your phone off the hook, vote for this  bill, but if you want to protect families, vote against it.    Mr. Speaker, it is with a heavy heart that I  rise to honor the life and legacy of Dr. Brenda C. Snipes.   This powerful and inspirational woman gave 55 years of her life as a  public servant to our schools, to our democracy, and to the people of  Broward County, Florida.   She moved to Florida in 1964 with her husband, each beginning their  careers as educators, and she eventually became principal of C. Robert  Markham Elementary School before retiring in 2003.   Soon after, Governor Jeb Bush appointed Dr. Snipes as supervisor of  elections, where she served for four terms.   Dr. Brenda, as she is affectionately known by so many, is celebrated  for many achievements, but I will mention just one:   She helped register more than 50,000 local high school and college  students to vote during her tenure.   A champion of voter education, awareness, and outreach, Dr. Brenda  Snipes was not only a leader in our community, she was a friend of over  two decades.   Mr. Speaker, her impact and commitment to the people of Broward  County will never be forgotten.   Rest well, my friend.                            ____________________
