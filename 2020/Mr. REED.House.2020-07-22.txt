 Madam Speaker, I rise today to join with my colleagues on  the other side of the aisle to express my condolences and express the  spirit that John Lewis represented to all of us.   John Lewis was a humble man. I knew John serving on the Ways and  Means Committee with him.   I traveled with my colleague, Mrs. Bustos, from Illinois down to  Selma, Alabama, on that 50th anniversary day. And I will tell you, one  of the moments that inspired me the most in my tenure here in Congress  was not just that day, when we walked across the Edmund Pettus Bridge  arm in arm in celebration of his victory over hatred, but it was the  following day, when we sat at the doors of the Montgomery, Alabama,  State Capitol, and I saw the daughter of Governor Wallace express to  John an apology for the sins of yesterday. And John, in typical John  Lewis fashion, stood up and embraced her when she said: ``I'm sorry.''   John Lewis epitomizes the best of the human race. John Lewis was an  inspiration to all of us.   My predecessor, my mentor, Amo Houghton, who served in my seat for 18  years, expressed to me early on in my tenure: ``Get to know John Lewis.  Get to know and listen to his story.'' And I will tell you, that is  some of the best advice I received from his friend, Amo Houghton.   And so I come here tonight to express my grief, but most importantly,  my hope that the spirit of John Lewis does not die with us tonight. The  spirit of John Lewis, who is now resting with the glory of God, will  shine down upon us and improve this institution, improve each of our  souls, and inspire us, the way that he did, as that proud, quiet,  humble giant of a human being that inspired me and will continue to  inspire me to search for our better angels each and every day.   So to my colleagues on the other side, I join you in your grief, but  we are united in our love for the great John Lewis.
