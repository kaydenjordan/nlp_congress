 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Virginia and  thank him for his leadership--also, the Speaker and the ranking member.   According to the National Women's Law Center, based on today's wage  gap, a woman who works full-time year-round would typically lose  $406,280 over her 40-year career. This means a woman making the median  national salary for women would have to work almost 9 years longer than  her male counterpart.   Mr. Speaker, 58 years after the enactment of the Equal Pay Act, full- time working women still earn 82 cents on average for every dollar a  man earns, amounting to a yearly gap of almost $20,000. They, too,  raise children. They, too, have overhead.   In this pandemic year, we have found that 2 million women have lost  their jobs. We know that Hispanic women earn 55 cents, Native-American  women 60 cents, and African-American women, on average, only 63 cents.   It is time now to put this paycheck fairness bill on the desk of the  President of the United States. It modernizes and strengthens the Equal  Pay Act, which is what the Lilly Ledbetter Act was, and brings the  country one step closer to ensuring that women can receive equal pay  for equal work.   Mr. Speaker, I ask for support of this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, as an original cosponsor, a senior member of the  Committees on the Judiciary, on Homeland Security, on the Budget, and a  member of the Democratic Working Women's Task Force, I rise in strong  support of H.R. 7, the landmark Paycheck Fairness Act, which  strengthens and closes loopholes in the 1963 Equal Pay Act, including  providing effective remedies for workers who are not being paid equal  pay for equal work.   I thank my colleague, the Chair of the Committee on Appropriations,  Congresswoman DeLauro, for introducing the Paycheck Fairness Act in  every Congress since 1997, which enabled me join her as an original  cosponsor all during those years as we fought shoulder to shoulder for  women's equality and empowerment.   Mr. Speaker, in January 2009, the Democratic-led 111th Congress sent  to the President's desk the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, the first  bill signed into law by President Obama, which restored the critical  rights of workers to challenge unfair pay in court.   Now, a Democratic-led House will push for enactment of another  critical fair pay bill--the Paycheck Fairness Act that strengthens  current law.   When House has been controlled by a Democratic majority, the Paycheck  Fairness Act has passed several times--including in the 110th Congress,  the 111th Congress, and the 116th Congress, when it passed by a  bipartisan vote of 242 to 187 on March 27, 2019, before dying in then- Senate Majority Leader McConnell's legislative graveyard.   This is the year to finish the job and send this critical legislation  all the to President Biden's desk for signature.   Mr. Speaker, as every woman Member of Congress knows, as our mother,  sisters, daughters, and sorors in the workplace know all too well, the  impact of the wage gap grows throughout a woman's career.   According to the National Women's Law Center, based on today's wage  gap, a woman who worked full-time, year-round would typically lose  $406,280 over a 40-year career.   This means a woman making the median national salary for women would  have to work almost nine years longer than her male counterpart to make  up this lifetime wage gap.   Mr. Speaker, 58 years after the enactment of the Equal Pay Act, full- time working women still earn just 82 cents, on average, for every  dollar a man earns, amounting to a yearly gap of $10,157 between full- time working men and women.   The wage gap is also even larger for women of color.   Hispanic women on average earn only 55 cents for every dollar paid to  white, non-Hispanic men.   Native American women on average earn only 60 cents for every dollar  paid to white, non-Hispanic men.   African American women on average earn only 63 cents for every dollar  paid to white, non-Hispanic men.   The National Partnership for Women and Families has calculated that  $10,157 for a median family in America means more than 9 additional  months of rent or 13 additional months of childcare.   Indeed, if women were paid the same as men, the poverty rate for all  working women would be cut in half and the poverty rate for working  single mothers would be cut by nearly half.   Because of loopholes in the law and weak sanctions for violations,  the Equal Pay Act of 1963 has not provided the tools to truly combat  unequal pay.   The Paycheck Fairness Act modernizes and strengthens the Equal Pay  Act and brings the country one step closer to ensuring that women  receive equal pay for equal work in the following ways:   1. Requires employers to prove that pay disparities exist for  legitimate, job-related reasons and puts the burden on employers to  show the disparity is not sex-based, but job-related and necessary;   2. Bans retaliation against workers who voluntarily discuss or  disclose their wages;   3. Ensures women receive the same robust remedies for sex-based pay  discrimination available to those subjected to discrimination based on  race and national origin;  [[Page H1817]]    4. Removes obstacles in the Equal Pay Act to facilitate a wronged  worker's participation in class action lawsuits that challenge systemic  pay discrimination;   5. Makes improvements in the Equal Employment Opportunity  Commission's (EEOC's) and the Department of Labor's tools for enforcing  the Equal Pay Act;   6. Provides assistance to all businesses to help them with their  equal pay practices, recognizes excellence in pay practices by  businesses, and empowers women and girls by creating a negotiation  skills training program; and   7. Prohibits employers from seeking salary history in determining  future pay, so that pay discrimination does not follow women from job  to job.   Finally, equal pay is not simply a women's issue, but a family issue.   Two-thirds of mothers are either the sole breadwinner or a co- breadwinner in the household, so their earnings are vital to their  families.   When women bring home less money each day, it means they have less  for the everyday needs of their families--groceries, rent, childcare,  and doctors' visits.   The Paycheck Fairness Act is strongly endorsed by a coalition of more  than 200 organizations, including AAUW, National Women's Law Center,  National Partnership for Women and Families, National Organization for  Women, National Committee on Pay Equity, MomsRising, UltraViolet,  Center for Law and Social Policy, The Leadership Conference on Civil  and Human Rights, NAACP, League of Women Voters, U.S. Women's Chamber  of Commerce, AFL-CIO, SEIU, United Steelworkers, AFSCME, American  Federation of Teachers, National Education Association, International  Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, American Psychological  Association, Anti-Defamation League, and many more.   I urge all members to join me in voting to pass H.R. 7, the Paycheck  Fairness Act of 2021, to ensure effective remedies for workers who are  not being paid equal pay for equal work.    Madam Speaker, I rise today to show exuberance and  excitement and congratulations to the young men at the University of  Houston who entered into the Final Four for the first time in 37 years.   Congratulations to Coach Sampson and these very fine young men, who  had not only the ability and skill on the basketball court, but  character and determination and hard work. We are so proud of them in  the city of Houston, and certainly of the University of Houston. We  congratulate them for standing up, marching onto that court, and  dunking that ball.   Congratulations to the University of Houston basketball team entering  the Final Four at the NCAA. We are excited about their success, and we  congratulate them over and over and over again. Congratulations to the  Cougars, University of Houston basketball team.                            ____________________
