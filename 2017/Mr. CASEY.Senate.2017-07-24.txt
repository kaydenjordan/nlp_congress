 Mr. President, I rise tonight to speak about the  healthcare legislation. I am grateful for the remarks of our colleague  from Illinois, the great leader that he is, talking not only about the  impact on his home State but on our country.   I think a lot of us, especially in the last couple of weeks, have had  an opportunity both to debate healthcare and, probably more  importantly, when we go home to be on the road, to go to places where  folks are thinking about it very intensively.   Many people I had a chance to interact with and, really, to listen to  on the road were folks in small towns and rural areas, especially, who  probably didn't ever imagine they would have to engage in this kind of  a discussion or debate. Coming into a conference room to have a  discussion or a roundtable about healthcare is not what they do every  day. They don't necessarily sit around to talk about a public policy  issue. They usually have so much in their lives that keeps them busy  and so many concerns and so many challenges that are weighing them down  that they don't have any opportunity to have these kinds of  conversations.   Many of them felt obligated to have these conversations. Many of them  were motivated to speak out because of what would happen in their lives  and usually in the life of someone in their family.   When I was in a number of counties the last couple of weeks,  especially in rural areas, you would hear from a lot of moms and dads  about their children, usually in this context: What will the Medicaid  cuts mean for my child? In many cases, the child has a disability or  more than one. Sometimes there is a series of complex disabilities-- plural--and the mom or the dad is there to talk about it.   In these discussions, you hear a combination of sentiments and a  combination of information. You hear sometimes a cataloging of what  their daily life is like, what they do when they wake up in the morning  and have to get that child or that young person ready for school if  they have a disability or more than one disability. These parents  become experts in all kinds of medical terminology and prescription  drugs, and they become experts in assistive technology or equipment  that allows their son or daughter to lead as full a life as possible.   For these families, this is real life. This isn't some debate in  Washington that we engage in here. This is about real life. That is why  the issue of Medicaid, I think, has been so prominent.   If we learned one thing over the last couple of months, it is that  some people in Washington might have thought that Medicaid could be  described as a ``them'' program. That is for someone else who is far  away, and I don't have to worry about that. We found out that Medicaid  is an ``us'' program. Medicaid is an American program.   It is one of the ways we come together as a nation and say: You are  up against something that I might not be up against. You have a  challenge that I might not have, but I am going to do my part to  support that program to give you a chance.   If you are a child with a disability, we come together as a  community, as a nation, and say we are going to help that child. We are  going to do everything possible to make sure that child can lead a full  life.   For many folks who are low income--they are working, but they don't  have a very high income and don't have employer coverage--we say in  that instance: You are someone we should try to help with a program  that provides healthcare--Medicaid.   We say to seniors, if we believe, as we do, that you have given us so  much--whether you fought our wars or worked in our factories or both,  or taught our children, built the Nation, or built the middle class,  and did all kinds of things for us--the least we can do is to make  sure, if you need extra help getting into a nursing home or getting the  benefit of long-term care, Medicaid will be there for you, without a  doubt.   It is only until recently that a lot of those same families have had  to ask the question: Will that program called Medicaid--that ``us''  program, not a ``them'' program--be there for my child who has a  disability? Will that program be there for me and my family, because  our income is such that we qualify for Medicaid and we need that help?  Will that Medicaid be there for that older citizen who has given us so  much, given so much to their family, given so much to the Nation? Will  that program continue to be there to give them that little bit of extra  help they might need to get into a nursing home?   Unfortunately for a lot of them, it is not a little bit. It is a lot,  because they need that much help to have the benefit of long-term care.   I have read a number of letters on the floor over the weeks and  months, and I will continue to do that. It is remarkable, though, how  people have put their own stories on paper or they have been  interviewed by a local newspaper or they have been on local television,  or even national television, talking about their lives, talking about  their children, talking about their worries, and also giving us the  benefit of their hopes and their dreams for their children. They are  hopes and dreams that would be thwarted in some instances by a vote we  could take here. They are hopes and dreams that in some cases would be  absolutely shattered if we took the wrong step on Medicaid and the  wrong step on healthcare.   Obviously, I am not a supporter of the legislation before us. It  seems like every time there is a change made, the legislation is either  no better or a lot worse. The number of uninsured doesn't seem to  budge.   The latest Congressional Budget Office determination--this is dated  July 20, last Thursday. It is a letter from the Congressional Budget  Office, from  [[Page S4143]]  Director Keith Hall to Senator Mike Enzi, the chairman of the Senate  Budget Committee. I am quoting from page 4. The Congressional Budget  Office says in this letter:         According to CBO and JCT's estimates, in 2018, 15 million       more people would be uninsured under this legislation than       under current law. The increase in the number of uninsured       people relative to the number under current law would reach       19 million in 2020 and 22 million in 2026.    That is what the CBO tells us. Once again, we have that same number-- that stubborn number--22 million people uninsured, and 15 of the 22  becoming uninsured in 2018, next year. It is an immediate impact, the  likes of which and the gravity of which we can't even begin to imagine.  Imagine that, in the course of 1 year or maybe 1\1/2\ years, 18 million  people in the country are losing their healthcare, just when we made  the advancement of having 20 million people covered between the time  the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act was passed and just in  the last year or so.   We have made all that progress forward on coverage. One of the  consequences--one of many but one of the consequences of this  legislation--would be to wipe all that out. It is two or three steps  forward and several steps backward. That alone makes no sense.   As I said, when people come to meetings across the State about this  bill, it is remarkable what they will tell you about their own  challenges. It has to be very difficult to stand in front of a group of  relative strangers--and sometimes with media there--and express to you  or express to the people in the room or to the people listening in an  interview or otherwise their innermost fears. That has to be  disturbing. It must be difficult to do, but they feel compelled to do  it because they have never had to worry like this--never had to worry  in the course of their lifetimes about a direct threat to the  healthcare of their children, a direct threat to the healthcare that  their family has.    I have notes here from a meeting just a couple of weeks ago. I will  not say who the parents are; I don't have their permission. But I will  say this: It was a parent in a county that is considered rural, a  family that seems to be relatively secure in terms of their employment  and everything else in their lives. After describing what Medicaid  means to their family because they have a child with a disability, the  mom talked about her own insurance. This is a common theme. The parent  or parents have a good job or sometimes two good jobs, and they have  insurance in most cases. Yet, because of the severity of the disability  of their child, they have to have Medicaid. There is no choice. There  is no way with 20 jobs that they could pay for the services that child  needs--services, therapies, treatments. The good news is, we live in a  country that has those available, but a lot of that will be ripped away  if we pass this legislation.   Here is what this mom said when talking about what she is determined  to do for her child. She said: It is not negotiable. That is what she  said about what is provided to her child. She said that these are  necessities. These aren't extra things. These aren't just add-ons to  some other healthcare. These are absolute necessities. Then she went  through and itemized and cataloged all the ways and all of the tools  and benefits that her family receives from Medicaid so that her child,  who has a severe disability, might have a shot to lead as full a life  as possible.   The idea that this mother or anyone like her should have to come to a  meeting in the United States of America and have to make an argument as  to why those services should be preserved for her son or her daughter  or any other member of her family--the idea that she should even have  to make that argument is insulting to us as a country. We would be a  different country if Medicaid were changed in the way some folks around  here want to change it.   I have used the word ``decimation.'' That is exactly what it is. It  would be decimation, and a lot of families' lives would be destroyed.  This is real life for these families.   Even if someone could prove that a year from now or 5 years from now  or 10 years from now, that mother and her family would be somehow  walled off or protected--even if you could guarantee that, it is still  wrong because she shouldn't have to worry for a minute. She should have  no uncertainty about whether her child is going to have Medicaid going  forward--her child with a profound disability. There should be no  question. That child should get Medicaid today, tomorrow, and as long  as they need it for the rest of their life because we are a great  country. We do that in America. We can do it over and over again.   We can have the strongest economy. We can have the strongest  military, and we can take care of those families, no matter what, no  questions asked, whatever it takes because that is who we are as  Americans. But there are some people around here who just don't believe  that. To use that mom's word, they think it is all negotiable--that if  it is the right year and the numbers line up, maybe we can help you.   We need a tax cut, apparently. That is what they argue. They need a  tax cut for wealthy folks, so Medicaid is going to pay for that. To say  that is insulting is a gross understatement. That is obscene. That is  as close to uttering an obscenity as anything I can think of. So you  bet we are going to fight when it comes to those kinds of decisions-- fight against those kinds of cuts.   I mentioned that I had been on the road a good bit and have spent a  lot of time in counties that are rural counties in Pennsylvania. Just  to give you an example of the numbers, I live in a State that has 67  counties, and 48 of the 67 are rural. Those are our Pennsylvania  counties. If you add up all of the individuals in those 48 rural  counties in Pennsylvania who got insurance by way of the Medicaid  expansion--or received insurance in the marketplaces in the intervening  years between passage of the ACA and currently--just in those 48  counties, over 278,000 people have healthcare--278,266. I use a precise  number because right down to the 66, it matters. Every single one of  those individuals in those 48 rural counties should have an ironclad  guarantee that no bill will pass the U.S. Senate that will rip away  their healthcare, not for one person. That should be our promise to  them.   That is the number of people covered, right? With the Medicaid  expansion plus the marketplace, 278,266 residents of rural Pennsylvania  are covered. If the Senate bill passed, here is at least one estimate  of what would happen to those rural counties: 151,000-plus people. I  will not use the exact number because it is an estimate. The estimate  is that around 150,000 people would lose their health insurance. You  move forward in rural Pennsylvania by over 278,000 people; then you  take two steps backward and rip healthcare away from 150,000 in rural  Pennsylvania. I haven't gotten to the big population centers. That is  the reality in Pennsylvania.   Then if you break it down even further--these are just 11 rural  counties that I visited in the month of July in addition to other  counties. In 11 rural Pennsylvania counties--these are counties with  very small populations. One of them, Forest County, which I was in this  weekend, has a little more than 7,000 people in its total population.  In these 11 rural Pennsylvania counties, 54,180 people have healthcare  today because of Medicaid expansion, plus those who got it through the  marketplace, so 54,180 get healthcare. What is the estimate of who  would lose if the bill passed? It is 32,410. Let's call it 30,000,  roughly, because it is an estimate. So 54,000 gain; then you rip it  away from 30,000. Does that make any sense at all? Does that help the  country? How are we stronger after that? How are we better off as a  country or, in my case, as a State? How are the people of our  Commonwealth better off when 30,000 in 11 rural counties lose their  coverage--or 150,000 in 48 rural counties?   I know I am over my time, and I will wrap up because we have  colleagues here. This is a pivotal moment. To say it is a pivotal  moment for the Senate is a big understatement, but it is also, I think,  a pivotal moment for the country. We are going to be on a different  path than we have been for a long time. Usually what happens over time  is that you are expanding protections, enlarging the number of people  who are the beneficiaries of protections of one kind or another. In  this case, we would be going in the wrong direction.   I hope our colleagues will think long and hard before they vote yes  either to move forward to debate on a bill that is  [[Page S4144]]  deeply flawed or to vote for the bill itself.   I yield the floor.
