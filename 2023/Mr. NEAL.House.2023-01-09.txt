 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to this  legislation, the so-called rules package.   I can't wait for that term limits vote. When you ask Members on the  Republican side who have been here for 20 or 30 years to then codify  their votes that say that you can only be here for 12, try explaining  that one back home when you have a four-seat majority.   This is an extreme proposal that is in front of us. If they follow  the logic to its manifestation, this will pit Social Security,  Medicare, and Medicaid against defense spending. Our seniors will be  sold out; our military will be sold out; and the full faith and credit  of the United States will be under threat, all in a quest to organize  the House.   The gentleman from South Dakota, a nice enough fellow, said people  are making a lot about the chaos that ensued here over 4 days,  particularly last Saturday morning. Was the gentleman denying that he  was here, for the country to witness what happened here?   This is part of a rules package that is being foisted upon the  American people by a small minority within the Republican Party, and we  ought to turn it down.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 23. My friend from  Nebraska suggested a number of issues that we intend to challenge  during the course of the next half hour, based upon the facts.   This is theater tonight, Mr. Speaker. If we didn't get enough of the  entertainment factor last week, we are going to proceed with it again  this evening.   Mr. Speaker, 87,000 IRS agents, let me debunk that right away. There  are regular retirements of up to 8,000 a year, we are replacing them.   How about the methodology of a computer upgrade, an investment in  technology, more modeling, or should we have an IRS that operates the  way Southwest Airlines did last week--to the dismay of the American  family.   This is a messaging bill, Mr. Speaker. The message that they choose  to send--and let everybody understand this, the first bill that they  have submitted, according to the Congressional Budget Office, adds $114  billion to the Federal deficit. Legislation number one.   They don't want a fairer tax administration. They think it is bad for  some of their supporters. You know what they're attempting to do  tonight is bad for middle-class families, it is bad for small  businesses, who are then asked to pay more when the people at the top  don't pay their fair share.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from Charles Rossotti,  the former IRS Commissioner.                                                     March 1, 2020.      Hon. Richard Neal,      Chairman, Committee on Ways & Means,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Neal: I was IRS commissioner from 1997 to       2002. At the time, Congress passed a major bill that produced       some important, long-lasting reforms, including converting       the IRS to electronic filing and improving treatment of       taxpayers.        I believe there is a major modernization opportunity today       that could efficiently recover a large amount of revenue. It       could gradually shrink the tax gap, while also easing burden       for millions of taxpayers who interact with the IRS.        I am enclosing my article in Tax Notes, entitled ``Recover       $1.6 Trillion, Modernize Tax Compliance and Assistance,''       which explains this opportunity.        I would be happy to talk further to you or your staff about       this opportunity.            Sincerely,                                               Charles O. Rossotti,      Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 1997-2002.                                   ____                     [From Tax Notes Federal, Mar. 2020]       Recover $1.6 Trillion, Modernize Tax Compliance and Assistance                          (By Charles O. Rossotti)                                I. The Problem         Last year the federal government failed to collect $574       billion of taxes that were legally due but not paid. That's       equal to more than half the budget deficit and, remarkably,       is equal to more than all the income taxes paid by 90 percent       of individual taxpayers.        No business would tolerate such a gigantic financial loss,       so why is it accepted in the government?        Columnist George Will captured a widespread view when he       recently wrote that ``shrinking the tax gap . . . is a       decades-old aspiration in Washington that would have been       accomplished already if it were possible.''        This resignation in the face of massive revenue loss is a       self-fulfilling prophecy. The perception that nothing can be       done to reduce the loss rationalizes inaction, which allows       the loss to grow year after year.        The tax gap has indeed been around for a long time, but       very little has been done to fix it.        As the economy and the tax system have become bigger and       more complex, the resources provided to the IRS have been       regularly cut. These cuts have been made in small but steady       increments over the past 25 years. They have served in some       ways to validate complacency about the tax gap, which, while       growing in dollar amount, has remained relatively constant as       a percentage of taxes due. The implicit conclusion of many       observers is, ``If IRS budgets can be cut and the IRS       continues to maintain the status quo, maybe nothing the       IRS does really makes much difference.'' That conclusion       is demonstrably false.        Most taxes continue to be collected without IRS       intervention for two reasons: First, most taxpayers have no       choice but to pay because their taxes are withheld or their       income is clearly reported; and second, about 85 percent of       the public has a positive attitude toward tax compliance.        These factors still allow a substantial proportion of       taxpayers to fail to pay what they owe, producing an ever-      increasing tax gap.        In the limited number of cases in which the IRS audits       returns, it directly collects additional revenue that exceeds       the cost of enforcement. A recent study by Natasha Sarin and       Lawrence Summers showed that revenue collected from audits       declined proportionately as audits were reduced. Taking a       broader, top-down view, IRS enforcement  [[Page H78]]       activities in fiscal 2017 produced $56 billion in revenue, of       which $12 billion was from auditing, while the entire IRS       enforcement budget was $4.7 billion.        Although traditional IRS enforcement activities do produce       revenue that reduces the tax gap, these results are not       entirely inconsistent with the perception that there is no       way to make a big reduction in the gap. Again taking a top-      down view, if all of IRS auditing produces $12 billion of       revenue, doubling the audit rate would reduce the current tax       gap by only about 2 percent if the revenue increase were       proportionate. While an extra $12 billion of revenue per year       would be considered a big gain on almost any scale, it is       only a dent in the massive amount of the tax gap.        Although not a justification for failing to do more with       traditional means to recover taxes from those who don't pay,       these facts emphasize the importance of new approaches to       shrink the tax gap. This report proposes a program, Tax       Compliance and Assistance 2020 (TCA 2020), to put the tax gap       on a reliably declining path, recovering an estimated $1.6       trillion over the first 10 years while also improving service       to all taxpayers.                              ii. a new approach         TCA 2020 proposes two major reforms: adding third-party       reporting of some income that is not now reported, and using       new technology to transform the IRS compliance and assistance       process.        Because the biggest part of the tax gap is from income       that's not reported to the IRS by third parties, some       additional reporting will help identify the missing income.       However, the IRS today cannot use all the information it       already receives, and significant areas of noncompliance are       barely addressed, so more reporting alone will not solve the       problem.        New technology will make it possible for the IRS to rapidly       assess all returns and sources of information, identify       likely areas of noncompliance, and assist in efficient       follow-up. It will gradually transform the IRS process for       compliance and taxpayer assistance.        This new approach will improve the way millions of       taxpayers interact with the IRS, and no additional reporting       would be required for individuals who receive modest income       from sources like home businesses or driving.        This proposal does not require the invention of new       technology, but rather application of new methods already       used in government and industry, including methods used on a       limited scale in the IRS today.        This proposal is based on more than 50 years of business       and government experience that I gained as a company founder,       CEO, director of 20 public and private companies, IRS       commissioner, and member of President George W. Bush's tax       reform panel, and through service on nonprofit boards and       government committees. Almost all of these ideas have been       previously advanced in some way by others, but TCA 2020 is my       own integration of those ideas with practical ways to       implement them. I was ably assisted in this work by Michael       Udell of the District Economics Group and other experts in       tax and technology.                      iii. summary of estimated results         If these proposals were implemented starting in 2020, we       estimate the results would be as shown in the Estimated       Results table. The method and details are provided in       Appendix A, Exhibit 1, to this report, which is available on       our website.        As the new proposals are implemented, the gain would       steadily increase, reducing the unmitigated tax gap by about       29 percent in the 10th year and gaining a 10-year total of       about $1.6 trillion. In subsequent years, the gain would       continue to grow both in dollars and as a percentage of the       unmitigated gap.        This new approach to address the tax gap would not require       a proportional increase in the IRS budget. We estimate that       the revenue gained would be 16 to 33 times the additional       cost to implement it.                        iv. understanding the tax gap         The tax gap is not a result of a taxpayer's judgment or       interpretation of the tax code. It's a matter of many       taxpayers not paying all of what they legally owe, and the       government allowing that noncompliance to continue.        The tax gap therefore constitutes a large loss of revenue       that's not intended by the tax code. It is intrinsically       unfair, because it's a financial advantage that only       noncompliant taxpayers receive.        An IRS study of tax returns filed from 2011 to 2013 found       that the net tax gap per year was $381 billion. This is the       amount that should have been paid under the law but wasn't,       even after IRS enforcement efforts. The tax gap grew to an       estimated $574 billion in 2019, applying the same ratios of       income as in the last IRS study.        This huge revenue loss doesn't even include revenue lost       from large corporations that skillfully exploit the many       arcane provisions of the tax code to reduce their taxes but       usually remain in technical compliance. Only 5 percent of the       IRS estimate of the tax gap was from large corporations.        In the years studied, after IRS enforcement, about 14       percent of the amount that taxpayers initially failed to pay       was eventually collected. The remaining 86 percent represents       an opportunity to increase revenue solely from taxpayers who       should have paid anyway.        Unfortunately, the fraction of revenue recovered from the       tax gap has remained low and stable for many years. Although       some revenue could be gained simply by doing more auditing,       substantial progress will require new methods, which are       possible today only because of advances in technology.      A. Unreported Income by Individuals        The largest source of the tax gap is from individual       taxpayers who fail to report all the income they receive from       a business they own, rather than income they receive from       others as wages, interest, or dividends.        The key difference between these sources of income is that       income reported to both the IRS and the taxpayer by payers       such as an employer or bank is easy for the taxpayer to       report accurately and for the IRS to verify.        The stark difference in compliance accuracy depending on       the degree of independent reporting is shown in Figure 1 from       the IRS compliance study.        As also shown in the figure, it's not necessary to have       perfectly accurate reporting to make a big difference in       compliance accuracy. Of income that is subject to little or       no reporting, 55 percent is not reported, while only 17       percent of income that is subject to some reporting is not       reported.        Nor is it necessary for the IRS to increase reporting about       taxpayers who earn small amounts of business income from       occasional business activities like babysitting and home       businesses.        Sole proprietor income constitutes the majority of income       in the low-visibility category. Taxpayers with less than       $25,000 in sole proprietor business income comprise about 70       percent of the returns but represent only 14 percent of       reported income and a somewhat greater proportion of the tax       gap from underreported income.        TCA 2020 recommends that these small-income taxpayers be       exempt from any increased reporting requirements.        Taxpayers with more than $25,000 of business income would       be required to report to their bank and on their returns the       bank account or accounts in which their business income is       deposited. Taxpayers who had only income that's already       reported to the IRS by employers, banks, or customers (on       documents such as the familiar Form W-2 or Form 1099)       wouldn't have to do anything except check a box on their       return.        The banks that were designated by taxpayers as receiving       their business income would be required at year-end to       provide the taxpayer and the IRS with a summary report of       deposits received and disbursements made in these accounts,       including those from credit card payments. This would be a       report similar to the Form W-2.        The taxpayer would attach a schedule to the tax return       reconciling the total amounts reported by the bank with the       income and expenses reported on the tax return. For example,       if the cash received in the bank account was greater than the       amount reported on the return, the schedule would itemize the       difference. The IRS would design a form for this       reconciliation schedule that any bookkeeper could complete.        This process wouldn't require taxpayers to change anything       about their banking arrangements and wouldn't restrict any       banking transactions. Taxpayers wouldn't be required to       isolate their business bank accounts from their personal       accounts, although many do have separate accounts, and others       might choose to do so out of convenience.        Instituting this increased bank and taxpayer reporting       would alone improve the accuracy with which taxpayers report       business income. Past experience shows that when additional       specific data is required, taxpayers improve their own       reporting.        For example, in 1988, when taxpayers were first required to       list the Social Security numbers of dependents claimed as       exemptions, more than 42 million fewer dependent exemptions       were claimed than in 1986, on just over 100 million returns.       This equates to almost half a claim dropped per return filed,       before the IRS did anything with the data.        Additional reporting, while an essential element, is only       one part of the TCA 2020 program. The most significant gains       would be made possible only by a much more effective IRS       compliance process enabled by modern technology that applies       newer analytical techniques to larger volumes of data.        With additional bank and taxpayer data, together with data       already collected from third parties, the IRS could more       readily detect which returns likely had significant       unreported income and follow up with more precisely targeted       taxpayer communication or auditing. In fact, much of the       follow-up could also be automated. This modernized process is       described in more detail later.        These reforms would also increase the amount of income       recovered where some limited reporting already occurs, such       as for capital gains and partnership income reported on       individual returns.        We estimate that if this proposal had been fully effective       in 2019, it would have generated approximately $97 billion in       revenue. However, as discussed later, we estimate that its       effectiveness would phase up over a 10-year period.      B. Passthrough Businesses        Unlike most corporations, many private businesses do not       pay tax as a business. Instead, their owners pay tax on the       income of their business on their individual returns.       Businesses organized in this way are called passthroughs       because the business income is passed through to the owners.        The IRS designates three categories of passthrough       businesses: sole proprietorships,  [[Page H79]]       partnerships, and S corporations. Sole proprietorships report       their business income on a schedule attached to the owner's       individual return, while S corporations and partnerships are       legal entities that file separate returns.        The amount of business income produced by passthrough       entities has steadily and vastly increased in the last 40       years, as shown in Figure 2: Twenty-five years ago,       corporations, which pay tax directly, accounted for almost       all the income produced by significant-sized businesses.       Today passthrough entities account for almost as much income       as corporations.     Mr. Speaker, he points out in the opening paragraph of a  tax notes special. By the way, those of us in the tax world know what  tax notes means. He said that last year, this would be 2021, the  Federal Government failed to collect $574 billion of taxes that were  legally due but not paid. That is equal to more than most of the  Federal deficit. If they want to reduce the Federal tax deficit, we  should do a better job with tax compliance, which, after all, is the  basis of a representative democracy.   Mr. Speaker, 86 percent of the American people pay their taxes every  year on time. Do you know why? Because they get paid in wages and it  comes from withholding taxes, that is what it is about.   The American people are wise to what is being presented here tonight.  We live in a two-tier tax system. Wage earners follow the rules.  Wealthy billionaires, they get to skirt their responsibilities. That is  what we are being asked to vote on tonight.   IRS funding has been stagnant, staffing levels have dropped. Have you  tried getting an IRS office on the phone?   How many times will we continue to let those at the top get away  without paying their share?   We lose out on--just think of it again--almost $600 billion a year in  unpaid taxes. It is very sophisticated tax planning that is done by  high-priced attorneys and CPAs. It is estimated that this could be up  to $7 trillion because we score items over the course of 10 years.   What might this funding pay for?   How about Social Security? How about Medicare? How about a strong  military? How about a child tax credit that could be expanded? How  about universal paid family and medical leave? How about bringing down  healthcare costs?   The audit rates amongst millionaires have declined by 70 percent  since 2010. Let me repeat that for anybody who didn't get that. The  audit rate for millionaires has declined by 70 percent since 2010.   Low-income workers who receive the earned income tax credit, they are  audited more now than taxpayers who are making over $1 million a year.   All we are asking for is fairness in the distribution of the  responsibilities as to how we pay for government. There is a different  set of standards across the land now. And to point that out to you once  again--what is our commitment to America?   It should be based on a fair tax system that collects what is due  from those who ought to be paying.   The former IRS Commissioner, a Republican, Charles Rettig, he pointed  out that he was fully in support of the legislation that we were  offering because the IRS is continually out-maneuvered and out-gunned  by sophisticated efforts from tax lawyers and CPAs.   We have to put American families over the politics in the  distribution of theater that we are witnessing tonight. See through  this legislation and vote ``no.''   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Texas  (Mr. Doggett), who intends to talk about the tax gap.    Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the Statement of the  Administration Policy opposing H.R. 23.                     Statement of Administration Policy     H.R. 23--To rescind certain balances made available to the Internal                              Revenue Service         The Administration strongly opposes H.R. 23, to rescind       certain balances made available to the Internal Revenue       Service (IRS). The bill would rescind funding passed in the       Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) that enables the IRS to crack       down on large corporations and high-income people who cheat       on their taxes and evade the taxes that they owe under the       law.        This reckless bill would increase the deficit by nearly       $115 billion over 10 years per an estimate by the       Congressional Budget Office by enabling wealthy tax cheats to       engage in additional tax fraud and avoidance. To be clear,       the Treasury Secretary has already directed that none of the       additional IRS resources be used to increase audit rates       relative to historical levels for small businesses or       households with incomes below $400,000. Far from protecting       middle-class families or small businesses, H.R. 23 protects       wealthy tax cheats at the expense of honest, middle-class       taxpayers. Each year the top one percent hides about 20       percent of their income from the government so they can get       away with not paying any tax on it. That means that working       people--who report 99 percent of their income to the IRS--pay       a larger share of collected taxes than they should. Not only       does it shift the tax burden from the wealthy to the middle-      class, it would also make it harder for middle-class families       and small businesses to get timely tax refunds and other       important services from the IRS, by rescinding billions in       funding for IRS information technology and operations.        With their first economic legislation of the new Congress,       House Republicans are making clear that their top economic       priority is to allow the rich and multi-billion dollar       corporations to skip out on their taxes, while making life       harder for ordinary, middle-class families that pay the taxes       they owe. That's their agenda; not lowering costs or cutting       taxes for hard working Americans--as President Biden has       consistently advocated.        If the President were presented with H.R. 23--or any other       bill that enables the wealthiest Americans and largest       corporations to cheat on their taxes, while honest and hard-      working Americans are left to pay the tab--he would veto it.    Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a CBO score for this  bill that is showing that it will add $114 billion to the Federal  deficit over the next 10 years.

The Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010 establishes budget-reporting and enforcement procedures for legislation affecting direct spending or revenues. The net changes in outlays and revenues   that are subject to those procedures are shown above. The Congressional Budget Office adheres to laws and Congressional rules concerning the federal budget and to a set of principles (called the Scorekeeping Guidelines) created by the Congress.   Those principles guide how the House and Senate Budget Committees, the Congressional Budget Office, and the Office of Management and Budget attribute budgetary effects to legislation, with   the goal of promoting consistent treatment of estimated effects among those agencies. (For more information on those guidelines, see Congressional Budget Office, CBO Explains Budgetary   Scorekeeping Guidelines, January 2021, www.cbo.gov/publication/56507.) When a provision in an authorization bill provides funding for administrative or program management activities, such as when the IRS receives additional funding for administrative activities,   spending of those amounts can result in increases in receipts. Guideline 14, however, directs scorekeepers to exclude those increases when estimating the budgetary effects of proposals that   would provide additional mandatory funding for such activities. Guideline 14 was adopted in part to avert cases in which possible, but uncertain, receipts were used to offset near-term increases in spending resulting from the same bill. That guideline is   asymmetrical, however. That is, even though increased receipts cannot be credited to a bill that would increase administrative funding, estimated receipt losses that might result from a   decrease in such funding are included in the estimated budgetary effects. H.R. 23 would rescind unobligated funds provided by paragraphs (1)(A)(ii), (1)(A)(iii), (1)(B), (2), (3), (4), and (5) of section 10301 of Public Law 117-169. CBO estimates that the bill would   decrease outlays by $71 billion and decrease receipts by $186 billion over the 2023-2032 period. Both of those effects are included in accordance with Guideline 14.     Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record an op-ed piece from  the former IRS Commissioner Charles Rettig, a Republican, titled: ``IRS  sets the record straight: We're going after tax evaders, not honest  Americans.''                    [From Yahoo! Finance, Aug. 25, 2022]  IRS Sets the Record Straight: We're Going After Tax Evaders, Not Honest                              Americans: Op-Ed                           (By Charles P. Rettig)         As the nation's tax administrator, the IRS plays a unique       role in our nation. It can be a difficult job. After all,       does anyone really like paying taxes? Of course not. But       they're essential to fund the roads we drive on, the schools       our children attend, support our military and so much more.       Unfortunately, given the nature of this work and historical       stereotypes, the IRS is often perceived as an easy target for       mischaracterizations of what  [[Page H81]]       IRS employees do--and that's exactly what's happened in       recent weeks.        The recent debate over providing badly needed funding to       the IRS is filled with outright false suggestions about what       the agency and our hardworking employees do--as well as how       the additional resources will be handled.        The bottom line is this: These resources are absolutely not       about increasing audit scrutiny on small business or middle-      income Americans. The investment of these important resources       is designed to support honest, compliant taxpayers. Our       investment is designed around a Treasury directive that audit       rates do not rise relative to recent years for households       making under $400,000.        We all want a fair and impartial system where everyone       contributes their fair share, no more and certainly no less.       A robust, visible tax enforcement effort focused on high-end       tax evaders and those supporting them is a priority.       Underpayments by tax evaders shift the burden of operating       our great country onto honest, hard-working Americans who       follow the law. With this new law, honest taxpayers will see       badly needed, meaningful service improvements at the IRS. The       IRS should be able to answer the phones and process       information--including tax returns--in a timely manner.       Enhanced IT systems and taxpayer services will mean that       honest taxpayers will be better able to comply with the tax       laws, ultimately resulting in a lower--yes, lower--likelihood       of being audited and a reduced burden on them.        To set the record straight on this important legislation       and dispel any lingering misperceptions, here are some key       facts to keep in mind:        False Statement: The IRS is hiring 87,000 armed special       agents to harass taxpayers.        Reality: Absolutely false. The majority of new hires the       IRS makes will be those who answer the phones, work on       processing individual tax returns or go after high-end       taxpayers or corporations who are avoiding their taxes. Less       than 1 percent of new hires will be in our IRS Criminal       Investigation (IRS-CI) area, which currently has a total of       about 2,100 special agents and is currently hiring about 300       more.        These CI special agents investigate criminal tax violations       typically related to money laundering, Bank Secrecy, National       Security and National Defense matters. They have been       involved in dismantling terrorist financing efforts and       criminal cartels as well as eliminating child exploitation       operations in the Dark Net that led to the arrests of       hundreds of people throughout the world. They do not perform       civil tax administrative functions such as audits of tax       returns. They are law enforcement officers, and every       American should be extremely proud they are on our team.        False Statement: All IRS employees--and those being hired       under the new legislation--will carry firearms.        Reality: Again, absolutely false. More than 97 percent of       IRS employees do not carry weapons. This includes key civil-      side enforcement personnel, including revenue agents,       examiners and others involved in audits and compliance work.       Less than 3 percent of IRS employees--expressly limited to       Criminal Investigation special agents--carry firearms. IRS       Criminal Investigation oversees the entirety of the work       related to criminal violations of the tax law and other       financial crimes. This is consistent with other federal law       enforcement agencies.        False Statement: The additional funding will be used to       hire more auditors to ``shake down'' average taxpayers.        Reality: False. Wage-earning taxpayers like firefighters,       construction workers, teachers and police officers are among       the most compliant taxpayers, given that their incomes come       from Forms W-2 and 1099. These resources are absolutely not       about increasing audit scrutiny on small businesses or       middle-income Americans. Instead, the additional resources       will also be focused on large corporate and high net-worth       taxpayers to enforce laws already on the books that the IRS       does not have enough resources to pursue.        False Statement: The new legislation will be a massive       overnight expansion of the IRS.        Reality: False. This funding--which will be spread over 10       years--will add employees over time as we modernize our       operations with meaningful technological enhancements. In       addition, the IRS has one of the oldest workforces in       government, and staffing has been in a deep decline for many       years. More than 50,000 employees will retire in the next few       years, leaving the foundation of the tax system that the       nation relies on at risk. We've been losing 10,000 employees       a year.        Overall, current IRS staffing is far below historical       norms. In 1992, the IRS had 117,000 employees--38,000 more       than today. Back then, the agency was dealing with fewer       taxpayers; the U.S. population has grown almost 30 percent       since 1992.        False Statement: This new funding will allow overreach by       the IRS, putting agents on every street corner and prying       into people's personal financial lives.        Reality: False. This funding will allow the IRS to better       serve the nation's taxpayers--and ultimately meet the       critical needs of our country. Our employees care and, like       others in government, take an oath to support our country. We       take pride in hiring veterans, people with disabilities and       people from all walks of life and from every corner of our       country. Many of our employees, including myself, are members       of a military family. And all of our employees reflect the       taxpayers we serve.        I am an extremely proud American, a member of a proud       military family, and simply will not accept baseless, harmful       assertions against the interests of our country and the       proud, hard-working employees of the IRS.        Everyone should know this about IRS employees: We care, a       lot, about this country and you.     Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Thompson), who is a much-valued member of the Ways and  Means Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Kansas, my friend.  He just pointed out that the people at the bottom are audited more than  the people at the top. That is precisely the point that we are  attempting to make here during the course of the next few minutes.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), who is the former majority leader.    Mr. Speaker, let me congratulate Mr. Smith, incidentally,  on his recent elevation to become the chairman of the Ways and Means  Committee. We look forward to a productive session during the next  couple of years.   Mr. Speaker, I include into the Record a blog post by the Center on  Budget and Policy Priorities summarizing the fact check that has  repeatedly debunked the false claim that we just heard a few seconds  ago, that the IRS is going to hire 87,000 new agents immediately.       [From Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, January 9, 2023]    House GOP's First Bill: A Misleading Gambit To Protect Interests of                             Wealthy Tax Cheats                              (By Chuck Marr)         House Republicans have announced that their first       legislative priority is to rescind nearly all of the       Inflation Reduction Act's $80 billion in ten-year funding for       the IRS, while repeating falsehoods and inflammatory rhetoric       about how that funding will be used. While the Republicans       have launched a campaign about a false ``army'' of 87,000       agents, the debate should focus on one accurate and alarming       number: the IRS has 2,284 fewer skilled auditors to handle       the sophisticated returns of wealthy taxpayers than it did in       1954. The decade-long, House Republican-driven budget cuts       have created dysfunction at the IRS, where relatively few       millionaires are now audited. If House Republicans succeed in       rolling back this critically needed funding and maintaining       this dysfunction, the IRS would be woefully understaffed,       hindering its ability to administer the tax code and collect       legally owed taxes--particularly from high-income and high-      wealth taxpayers. On behalf of honest taxpayers, policymakers       should reject the House Republican effort to protect wealthy       tax cheats.        The IRS workforce is composed of civilian public servants,       such as accountants and customer service representatives, who       collect nearly all the federal revenue to fund  [[Page H83]]       our government, from Medicare and Social Security to our       armed forces. Its skilled auditors, also known as revenue       agents, are highly trained to handle sophisticated tax       returns of wealthy people and multinational corporations. All       of these IRS employees perform a core function of government,       are central to the workings of our democracy, and work on       behalf of honest taxpayers.        Republican IRS critics, however, have constructed a       narrative around the IRS workforce becoming an ``army'' of       87,000 ``armed agents'' whose enemies are ``hardworking       American families and small businesses.'' This rhetoric is       false and dangerous.        Fact checkers have repeatedly debunked the 87,000 figure,       which comes from a prior Treasury estimate that it would use       new funding to hire 87,000 total staff over the next ten       years, including IRS employees in all departments, not just       skilled auditors. These are people who answer phones, process       returns, program computers, as well as a fraction--albeit an       important one--who audit complex tax returns.        The House GOP campaign ignores the reality of today's IRS--      which has resulted from the sharp budget cuts that       Republicans have pushed since 2010--as well as the harm that       would flow from rescinding much of the Inflation Reduction       Act's new IRS funding. The upcoming debate needs to cut       through the obfuscation of the House Republican campaign and       focus on honest and pertinent numbers.        Consider, in 2021, the IRS had 8,321 skilled auditors.       That's 40 percent fewer than the agency had in 2010, the year       before House Republicans were in the majority and began       driving the last decade of steep IRS budget cuts.        Moreover, it's 2,284 fewer revenue agents than the IRS had       in 1954--not a typo. The last time the IRS had fewer revenue       agents than it has today was in 1953. Today's economy is       seven times larger than it was in 1953 and our population has       more than doubled since then. Today's tax returns of wealthy       people and large multinationals are more complex and global,       which take more time for auditors to review.        As a result of these budget cuts and fewer skilled       auditors, audit rates have plummeted for wealthy individuals       and large corporations.        For the largest corporations (those with more than $1       billion in assets), the audit rate fell by more than half       between 2010 and 2017. For millionaires, the audit rate fell       by roughly 77 percent over the same period. Preliminary audit       data for 2018 and 2019 suggest that the audit rate may have       declined over 90 percent between 2010 and 2019.        House Republicans want to scare people with their false       claims about how the IRS would use the new resources. But the       reality is that, today, the IRS skilled audit staff is 2,284       smaller than in 1954, only a tiny fraction of millionaires is       audited, and large multinationals can hire large squads of       lawyers to easily overwhelm the resources of the IRS. One       only needs to skim President Trump's tax returns, the       indictment of convicted tax cheat Paul Manafort, and a       ProPublica investigation of how Facebook outgunned the IRS to       grasp the resources necessary to be serious about enforcing       our tax laws and how reckless it would be to keep the number       of skilled auditors at 1950s levels, as the House Republicans       would do.        Honest taxpayers and business owners deserve better. They       deserve an IRS that processes their tax returns and tax       refunds efficiently, answers the phone when they call with       questions, and ensures that the wealthy and profitable       corporations are paying the taxes they legally owe.        A key element of a healthy, functioning democracy is a       transparent tax system that is fairly enforced so that people       and corporations pay what they owe and the well-heeled and       powerful cannot flout their responsibility to pay their       taxes.        Efforts to protect wealthy tax cheats and purposely       undermine the IRS's ability to enforce tax laws are anti-      democratic and should be resoundingly rejected.     Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a FactCheck.org  article confirming that not all of the 87,000 people who will be hired  are going to work on enforcement.                    [From FactCheck.org, Aug. 18, 2022]  IRS Will Target `High-Income' Tax Evaders with New Funding, Contrary to                             Social Media Posts                              (By Brea Jones)                                  QUICK TAKE         The Inflation Reduction Act includes $79 billion for the       IRS. Social media posts misleadingly claim the IRS will now       hire ``87,000 new agents'' to investigate average citizens.       But most new hires will provide customer services, and       enforcement efforts will be aimed at ``high-income and       corporate tax evaders,'' a Treasury Department spokesperson       said.                                  FULL STORY         President Joe Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act--a       climate, health care and tax package--into law on Aug. 16.        The legislation includes roughly $79 billion for the IRS       over 10 years. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office       projects that the enhanced IRS enforcement funded by the law       will generate an additional $204 billion in revenue over 10       years. That represents additional taxes that are owed under       existing laws, but which go unpaid.        Treasury Department officials say not all new hires will       work on enforcement and increased revenues won't come from       middle-income earners. Treasury Secretary Janet L. Yellen       directed IRS Commissioner Charles P. Rettig not to use the       new funding to increase enforcement of taxpayers earning less       than $400,000. The IRS is a bureau of the Treasury       Department.        ``Specifically, I direct that any additional resources--      including any new personnel or auditors that are hired--shall       not be used to increase the share of small businesses or       households below the $400,000 threshold that are audited       relative to historical levels,'' Yellen wrote in an Aug. 10       letter to Rettig. ``This means that, contrary to the       misinformation from opponents of this legislation, small       business or households earning $400,000 per year or less will       not see an increase in the chances that they are audited.''        But Republican members of Congress and social media users       have spread the false claim that the new law will be used to       hire ``87,000 new IRS agents.''        Sen. Ted Cruz, in an interview on Fox News that was posted       to Facebook, got it doubly wrong when he claimed that       ``87,000 new IRS agents'' will be going after small       businesses and regular Americans.        ``And, by the way, these IRS agents aren't there to go       after billionaires,'' Cruz said. ``They're there to go after       you. They're there to go after your small business.''        But, as we will explain later, not all of the new hires       will be ``agents.'' There's a big difference between IRS       agents, such as revenue agents and special agents, and the       workers who make up the bulk of the IRS staff. And, as we       said, the Treasury Department has directed the IRS not to       focus on small businesses and those earning less than       $400,000.        Some versions of the claim suggest that the 87,000 new       ``agents'' will be armed--but, as we've written before, only       ``special agents'' who investigate criminal violations of the       tax code are authorized to carry firearms.        Rep. Matt Gaetz took it one step further, calling it       ``bizarre'' that the IRS bought $700,000 worth of ammunition       between March and June 1 of this year. He suggested that the       purchases are part of a ``broader effort'' to get ammunition       off the market. But, as we will detail later, the purchases       this year are in line with past years, according to       government data.        Some of the claims about the IRS on social media were tied       to an unrelated event--the FBI search of former President       Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago home in Florida.        ``The IRS is coming for you. The DOJ is coming for you. The       FBI is coming for you. No one is safe from political       punishment in Joe Biden's America,'' the official Twitter       account for the House Judiciary Committee Republicans       tweeted.        But Rettig, the IRS commissioner, wrote in a letter to       lawmakers on Aug. 4 that the resources obtained with the       funding from the Inflation Reduction Act ``are absolutely not       about increasing audit scrutiny on small businesses or       middle-income Americans.''        ``Other resources will be invested in employees and IT       systems that will allow us to better serve all taxpayers,       including small businesses and middle-income taxpayers,''       Rettig said.                  Funds for Customer Service and Enforcement         A Treasury Department report from May 2021 estimated that a       similar $80 billion investment proposed in Biden's American       Families Plan would have allowed the IRS to modernize and       restore the ``IRS enforcement capability'' in several ways--      including by hiring 86,852 full-time employees. That's where       the claim about hiring ``87,000 new agents'' apparently comes       from.        The 2021 report said the $80 billion investment to restore       the IRS would be broken down into two components: ``a       dedicated stream of mandatory funds ($72.5 billion over a       decade) and a program integrity allocation ($6.7 billion over       a decade).''        The $6.7 billion program integrity allocation will be used       for ``the hiring and retention of at least 5,000 new       enforcement personnel,'' the 2021 report said. ``The       mandatory funds are allocated over a 10-year horizon. They       provide enforcement resources, including a significant       investment in revitalizing the IRS's examination of large       corporations, partnerships, and global high-wealth and high-      income individuals.''        Over the past decade, the IRS has lost 40 percent of its       ``complex revenue agents''--agents who handle complicated tax       returns of large businesses and corporations and go after       high-end tax evaders--as its budget has been gutted,       according to a Treasury Department spokesperson. ``Today, the       IRS has the same number of IRS revenue agents for complex       work as it had in WWII,'' the spokesperson told us in an       email.        Over the next five years, the IRS is expecting to lose up       to 52,000 employees to attrition, the Treasury Department       spokesperson told us in a phone interview. Most of the new       hires will replace the outgoing employees and will be on the       service side of the IRS.        ``The majority of hires made with these resources fill       positions of the 50,000 IRS employees who are on the verge of       retirement. Of the net new hires, the majority are hired to       improve customer services--from upgrading IT to answering       phone calls,'' the Treasury Department spokesperson said.        The IRS might net about 30,000 new hires, as a result of       the number of retirements and new funding. But the IRS hasn't       yet released estimates for how many new employees the  [[Page H84]]       agency could hire with funding from the Inflation Reduction       Act. The IRS is expected to release the final numbers and       breakdown in the coming months.        ``The resources to modernize the IRS will be used to       improve taxpayer services--from answering the phones to       improving IT systems--and to crack down on high-income and       corporate tax evaders who cost the American people hundreds       of billions of dollars each year,'' the spokesperson said.       ``The majority of new employees will replace the standard       level of staff departures over the next few years and will be       hired to improve taxpayer services. The agency will 'also       bring on experienced auditors who can take on corporate and       high-end tax evaders, without increasing audit rates relative       to historical norms for people earning under $400,000 each       year.''        A White House spokesperson told us in an email, ``both       Treasury Secretary Yellen and the IRS Commissioner have been       explicit that these funds will be used for the wealthiest       taxpayers and not those making less than $400,000 per year.       These resources will improve technology and customer service,       which will make it less likely that honest taxpayers get       audited.''                   Spending on Ammunition and Armed Agents         Gaetz, a Republican from Florida, raised concerns in June       that the IRS spent $700,000 on ammunition from March to June       of this year, and he introduced the Disarm the IRS Act in       July.        Gaetz described the ammunition acquisition as ``bizarre''       in a recent interview. Others have also echoed the claim.        But that's not an unusual amount of money for the IRS to       spend on ammunition and is on par with what has been spent in       previous years for the IRS Criminal Investigation division,       which was established in 1919.        IRS Criminal Investigation is the sixth-largest federal law       enforcement agency in the U.S. But it's a small unit of the       IRS overall, less than 3 percent of its total workforce,       according to the Treasury Department spokesperson.        The IRS Criminal Investigation division doesn't perform       routine IRS audits on average Americans.        ``The bulk of IRS's tax administration work is done by       civilian auditors and revenue collectors,'' Justin Cole, a       spokesman for the IRS Criminal Investigation division, told       us in an email. ``IRS Criminal Investigation oversees the       entirety of the work related to criminal violations of the       tax law and other financial crimes.''        The division investigates cases related to money       laundering, cybercrime, bank secrecy, national security,       national defense and narcotics organizations--a large reason       for the need for firearms and training. The division is       famously known for the arrest of American gangster AL Copone.       More recently, the division has been involved in the task       force that is tracking the assets of Russian oligarchs.        ``In order to carry out their daily duties, which include       search warrants and arrests, CI special agents carry       firearms,'' Cole said.        Using usaspending.gov, the official source of U.S. spending       data and the site used by Gaetz, we found that the IRS has       spent $816,248.90 so far in the fiscal year 2022 for ``duty       ammunition'' from Vista Outdoor Sales. That's a little less       than last fiscal year ($842,989,60) and slightly more than in       fiscal 2020 ($761,265,40). (All amounts are ``total       obligations,'' as of Aug. 18.)        The majority of the recent $725,460.10 spending went for       handgun ammunition and equals about 2,545 cases of       ammunition--``just enough for Special Agent handgun       qualifications,'' Cole said. ``CI purchases the minimum       amount of ammunition necessary to cover training and firearms       qualifications for its law enforcement employees.''        The IRS spent an average of $712,500 on ammunition for       fiscal years 2010 to 2017, according to a 2018 report to       Congress by the Government Accountability Office on firearms       and ammunition purchases by federal law enforcement agencies.        ``There are about 3,000 employees in [the IRS Criminal       Investigation division], 2,100 of which are special agents       and the remaining professional staff. Only special agents       carry firearms,'' Cole said.        In 2021, there were 2,046 special agents, who ``are among       the most highly trained financial investigators in the       world,'' according to the 2021 annual report.        The number of special agents in the division hasn't changed       much in five years, according to the division's annual       reports. In 2017, there were 2,159 special agents. But the       number of special agents has declined substantially since       2009, when the bureau had 2,725--as we noted 12 years ago       while addressing a misleading claim about the IRS hiring       ``16,500 new agents.'' That's a 33 percent decrease from 2009       to 2021.        New special agents complete six months of training,       including firearms training.        The IRS is not the only government agency that purchases       guns and ammunition for enforcement officers. The 2018 GAO       report lists several other agencies that make those       purchases, such as the Food and Drug Administration, the       National Institutes of Health and the Veterans Health       Administration.     Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Connecticut (Mr. Larson) who is a distinguished member of the Ways and  Means Committee.    Mr. Speaker, that is precisely the point that we have  attempted to make. Customer service is not occurring because the IRS  has been cut by 30 percent over the last 15 years.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from the IRS  Commissioner to the House of Representatives confirming that the IRS  will not raise audit rates on those making under $400,000 a year.                                         Department of the Treasury,                                        Internal Revenue Service,                                     Washington, DC, August 4, 2022.        Dear Member of the House of Representatives, It has been       the greatest honor of my professional life to spend the last       four years at the helm of the IRS. I am struck each day by       the commitment of dedicated IRS employees to helping American       families. And our employees have done all that without the       tools to do so effectively. For too long, the agency has not       had the resources that it needs to ensure the tax laws are       enforced fairly and that Americans receive the level and       quality of service they deserve. We are the greatest country       in the world, yet the agency that touches more Americans than       any other continually struggles to receive sufficient       resources to fulfill its important mission.        The resources in the reconciliation package will get us       back to historical norms in areas of challenge for the       agency--large corporate and global high-net-worth taxpayers--      as well as new areas like pass-through entities and       multinational taxpayers with international tax issues, where       we need sophisticated, specialized teams in place that are       able to unpack complex structures and identify noncompliance.        These resources are absolutely not about increasing audit       scrutiny on small businesses or middle-income Americans. As       we've been planning, our investment of these enforcement       resources is designed around the Department of the Treasury's       directive that audit rates will not rise relative to recent       years for households making under $400,000. Other resources       will be invested in  [[Page H85]]       employees and IT systems that will allow us to better serve       all taxpayers, including small businesses and middle-income       taxpayers. Enhanced IT systems and taxpayer service will       actually mean that honest taxpayers will be better able to       comply with the tax laws, resulting in a lower likelihood of       being audited and a reduced burden on them.        Large corporate and high-net-worth taxpayers often engage       teams of sophisticated representatives who pursue unsettled       or sometimes questionable interpretations of tax law. The       integrity and fairness of our tax administrative system       relies upon the ability of our agency to maintain a strong,       visible, robust enforcement presence directed to these and       other similarly situated taxpayers when they are       noncompliant. These important efforts also support honest       taxpayers who voluntarily comply with their filing and       reporting requirements.        The IRS has fewer front-line, experienced examiners in the       field than at any time since World War II, and fewer       employees than at any time since the 1970s. Advances in       technology have been helpful but have not kept pace with the       ever-increasing responsibilities and challenges facing the       IRS. As a result, the IRS has for too long been unable to       pursue meaningful, impactful examinations of large corporate       and high-networth taxpayers to ensure they are paying their       fair share. This creates a direct revenue loss from evaders       and lessens the potential to deter others from pursuing a       similar path of noncompliance. Every American should support       a fair and impartial system of tax administration supported       by an appropriately resourced tax administrator. In fact, the       continued success of our country depends, in part, upon the       success of the agency in appropriately, fairly and       impartially enforcing the tax laws and in providing       meaningful, impactful services to every American.        As an extremely proud American, I'm grateful for your       support of the IRS and our dedicated employees. I cannot be       forceful enough in emphasizing that these resources will be       transformative for the agency and for American taxpayers. I       am available to meet with you at your convenience to discuss       the foregoing.            Thank you,                                                 Charles P. Rettig.     Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from  Secretary Yellen to the IRS Commissioner, directing the IRS not to use  any additional funding to increase audits on small businesses and  households earning less than $400,000 a year.                                        Department of the Treasury,                                       Secretary of the Treasury,                                    Washington, DC, August 10, 2022.      Charles P. Rettig,      Commissioner, Internal Revenue Service,      Washington, DC.        Dear Commissioner: The Inflation Reduction Act includes       much-needed funding for the IRS to improve taxpayer service,       modernize outdated technological infrastructure, and increase       equity in the tax system by enforcing the tax laws against       those high-earners, large corporations, and complex       partnerships who today do not pay what they owe.        These crucial investments have been a focus of the Biden       Administration since the President's first day in office, and       I was heartened to see the legislation pass the Senate this       weekend.        Notwithstanding the changes that arose because of       Republican challenges during the Byrd process, I write today       to confirm the commitment that has been a guiding precept of       the planning that you and your team are undertaking: that       audit rates will not rise relative to recent years for       households making under $400,000 annually.        Specifically, I direct that any additional resources--      including any new personnel or auditors that are hired--shall       not be used to increase the share of small business or       households below the $400,000 threshold that are audited       relative to historical levels. This means that, contrary to       the misinformation from opponents of this legislation, small       business or households earning $400,000 per year or less will       not see an increase in the chances that they are audited.        Instead, enforcement resources will focus on high-end       noncompliance. There, sustained, multiyear funding is so       critical to the agency's ability to make the investments       needed to pursue a robust attack on the tax gap by targeting       crucial challenges. like large corporations, high-net-worth       individuals and complex pass-throughs, where today the IRS       has resources to initiate just 7,500 audits annually out of       more than 4 million returns received.        This is challenging work that requires a team of       sophisticated revenue agents in place to spend thousands of       hours poring over complicated returns, and it is also work       that has huge revenue potential: indeed, an additional hour       auditing someone making more than $5 million annually       generates an estimated $4,500 of additional taxes collected.       This is essential work that l know the IRS is eager to       undertake.        For regular taxpayers, as you emphasized last week, the       result of this resource infusion will be a lower likelihood       of audit by an agency that has the data and technological       infrastructure in place to target enforcement resources where       they belong--on the high end of the income distribution,       where the top 1 percent alone is estimated to not be paying       $160 billion in owed taxes each year. That's important as a       matter of revenue-raising, but it's also essential as a       matter of fairness.        Crucially, these resources will support a much-needed       upgrade of technology that is decades out-of-date, and an in       vestment in taxpayer service so that the IRS is finally able       to communicate with taxpayers in an efficient, timely manner.       I look forward to working with you on creating new digital       tools to allow taxpayers to get information from the IRS       instantaneously and on improving taxpayer service, so the       agency is well-equipped to answer calls when they come in.        This historic investment in our tax system will accomplish       two critical objectives. It will raise substantial revenue to       address the deficit; and it will create a fairer system,       where those at the top who do not today comply with their tax       obligations find it far less easy to do so, and where all       taxpayers receive the service from the IRS that they deserve,       and that your dedicated workforce is eager to deliver. The       importance of the work ahead cannot be overstated.            Sincerely,                                                   Janet L. Yellen.     Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Oregon  (Mr. Blumenauer), a very capable member of the Ways and Means  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New  Jersey (Mr. Pascrell), who is sure to offer clarity to this important  issue.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Davis), a very capable Member from Chicago.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New  York (Mr. Higgins), an individual whose knowledge of the economic  system in America is unsurpassed.    Mr. Speaker, the challenge that was offered by the  gentlewoman from California is as simple as this: We are weaponizing  billionaires not to pay their fair share. That is what is happening.   What we are asking here is the simplicity of allowing people at the  very top to pay their fair share.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Alabama (Ms.  Sewell), a capable and valued member of the Ways and Means Committee.                                time  2000     Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Chu), a very capable member of the Ways and Means  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Wisconsin (Ms. Moore), a very capable member of the Ways and Means  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Michigan (Mr. Kildee).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. Beyer), a very successful businessman and entrepreneur.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Evans), a very distinguished member of the Ways and  Means Committee.                                time  2015     Mr. Speaker, I think part of that new recruiting class at  the IRS is going to simply answer the phones. That would be helpful, a  step in the right direction.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr.  Schneider), a CPA who really knows something about compliance.    Mr. Speaker, a reminder that the 87,000 is over 10 years.  The $80 billion is over 10 years. That is $8 billion a year for  replacement of those who retire, who leave the service of the IRS.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from California (Mr.  Panetta), another very capable member of the Ways and Means Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Gomez), not only a very capable member of the committee  but, last week, during those 4 days here of utter chaos, he carried  that child around this Chamber. During those 4 days, I think the child  grew by 2 inches. That is how long we were there.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Texas  (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Sherman), who is a CPA, I believe.    Mr. Speaker, as my friend, the gentleman from Nebraska  pointed out, with the Presidential audit system, Joe Biden overpaid his  taxes. I hope the Record will reflect that, that the Democratic  President overpaid his taxes, and the IRS wisely made sure that he had  the proper refund.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms.  Kaptur), the longest serving woman in the history of Congress.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time for the  purpose of closing.   Mr. Speaker, this has been an edifying debate. But as Harry Truman  noted, let's just talk about the facts. Let's debunk the argument that  we are hiring 87,000 armed IRS agents to go knocking on doors in the  middle of the night.   This is a substantial investment in technology. This is a substantial  investment in customer service. Yes, the $80 billion is over 10 years.  That is $8 billion a year to improve customer service. That is what we  are talking about.   At least 8,000 agents retire from the IRS every year. We are simply  replacing them. You know, in our school systems back home, when 200  teachers retire, we replace 200 teachers. That is what we are doing  here with the IRS.   They make this preposterous argument that all of a sudden, next week,  87,000 armed--because you always have to use the language that is  incendiary enough to get people worked up around here--that 87,000  armed agents in the dark of night will be hounding innocent taxpayers,  despite what Janet Yellen said about no taxpayer making under $400,000  a year is going to be targeted.   Mr. Rossotti, the former IRS commissioner, not me, said at least $574  billion a year goes uncollected. He is a Democrat. A Republican IRS  commissioner, Mr. Rettig, who we worked with, said it might be a  trillion dollars a year that goes uncollected, a Donald Trump  appointee, who stated that and raised that issue a number of times in  front of the Committee on Ways and Means.   Let me make a point that I raised earlier. Tax compliance in a  representative democracy is a fundamental commitment to civilization  and first-class services.   So by not collecting this revenue, are we going to say down the road,  well, maybe we will cut Social Security; maybe we will cut Medicare;  maybe we will cut Medicaid; or maybe we will cut the American military.   Now, we all know that in this discussion that the facts are very  clear here. They have been upset with the IRS for a long period of  time. We all remember the Lois Lerner episode, even though the facts in  that case pointed out that the advocates on the right and the left were  audited at the same rate. That is a fact.   So as we close this argument out, let's stand up for the honest  taxpayers in America and make sure that the IRS that currently cracks  down on the EITC will be able to actually address some of the  complexities of modern tax law, which we all agree, by the way, the  system is far too complex, but I have been through that argument many  times here, as well.   This fear-mongering that you are hearing tonight about upgrading the  technology and software investments at the IRS for the purposes of  modeling for better tax compliance is just that. It is fear-mongering.   All we want is a set of rules that is applicable to all as it relates  to tax collection. This is not anything other than simply suggesting  that there is a fairness that is applied to the Internal Revenue  Service, so that they might address and make sure that those at the  very top are complying with the same laws we ask the wage earners  through withholding to address every single day.   Thanks for a spirited debate, Mr. Speaker, and to our friends on the  other side.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.   This is a 5-minute vote.
