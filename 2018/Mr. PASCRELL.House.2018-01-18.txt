 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the 2018 XXIII  Olympic Winter Games being hosted in Pyeongchang, South Korea, next  month. I am proud of the many Korean Americans in the Ninth  Congressional District who make the USA a better place to live.   The Olympic Games serve as a forum for the international community to  come together to build a peaceful world. In order to be a competitor in  the Olympic Games, nations across the globe have to embody the values  and ideals of friendship, solidarity, and fair play. It is no different  in the diplomatic arena.   Without these core values, the spirit of fair competition is eroded.  The common bond that brings nations from all over the world to compete  and build friendships serves as a forum to promote tolerance and  understanding. Promoting these ideals is critical to these increasingly  troubled times, and I believe the results can make our world a more  peaceful place.   The upcoming Winter Olympic Games presents a significant opportunity  for the United States of America to lead the fight against  international conflicts and to promote peace. This is our legacy.   Our Nation can use this opportunity to work with the international  community in a way that shows that we can come together in the spirit  of healthy competition, regardless of our differences.   With the long shadow being cast by the provocations of Pyongyang and  rhetoric from our own administration, the Olympic Winter Games came at  the right time. They are an opportunity for the United States to speak  out in support of resolving the current conflicts on the Korean  Peninsula.   While there are many issues facing the international community, all  can agree the growing threat of nuclear conflict presents the most  immediate danger. In order to deescalate the growing threat, and in the  spirit of the Olympic Games themselves, I hope that our athletes'  presence in South Korea will serve as a symbolic representation that  our differences can be worked out on a neutral field.   Further, it is reassuring that North Korea will participate in the  upcoming Winter Olympics. If the reports are true, it will be  encouraging to watch the two countries' athletes march together at the  opening ceremony under a unification flag. That surpasses the  consequences of empty rhetorical threats. We can do better than that.    It took the Winter Olympics to thaw the ice between the two nations,  who have not met in 2 years. This is a welcome sign of easing tensions  after months of alarm over North Korea's nuclear program.   As a result, this year's Olympic Games are already off to a great  start. The Games will continue to be a reminder that, regardless of  where someone is from, we can still set our differences aside for a  better world, just like the first athletes who came together to start  the Olympic tradition.   It is my expectation that the Republic of Korea will host a  successful 2018 XXIII Olympic Winter Games and that the hard work and  dedication of the Korean people to this endeavor will be remembered by  the international community.   Finally, Mr. Speaker, I look forward to watching the men and women  representing the United States of America bring home the gold.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, this habit of short-term funding  extensions and kicking the can down the road--I heard that a few  times--are irresponsible and have to stop. We need a long-term funding  bill.   Democrats have come to the table and offered bipartisan solutions.  Republicans have dismissed them. Let's put a bill to help the DREAMers  on the floor.   This leadership is acting out of fear, and their intransigence and  incompetence is going to lead to a shutdown.   Instead of using 9 million kids as a bargaining chip, I bet the  majority could pass a permanent children's health extension today.  There are 9 million children at risk of losing health coverage, 200,000  of them in my home State of New Jersey, and we could save $6 billion.   I cannot believe that this bill has an unpaid-for delay of the  medical device tax, Mr. Speaker. That was part of the Affordable Care  Act. That industry agreed to pay that tax. We just did a tax bill for  corporations that added over $2 trillion in deficit.   Last I checked, medical device companies are corporations.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.    What are we doing putting it in place in a tax law and  a budget bill now and then a month later?   Just this week, The New York Times ran a piece titled: ``Can Your Hip  Replacement Kill You?''   The article describes a man named Dr. Stephen Tower, who was given an  artificial hip with a defect in the device.   It is in your bill.   Doctors had to do a second surgery. They found cobalt leaking from  the device, causing a condition called metallosis, destroying muscle,  tendons, ligaments, harming Dr. Tower's heart and brain as well.   Despite Dr. Tower's complaints to colleagues and the manufacturer,  they continued to market it.   How dare the Speaker of the House question why we want DACA in this  legislation when he has got a bill that--32 million Americans use  medical devices. There is no Federal FDA test for most of those  devices.                                time  1730    They have got the court, they bribed doctors, and it is in your bill,  but we could not take care of those 800,000 people. Mr. Speaker, we  need a different issue.
