 I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, the most important words of our  Constitution are the first three words: ``We the people.'' That is the  mission statement of our Constitution.   Our Founders did not seek to design a government that would enable  the powerful and the privileged to make rules to benefit themselves.  They didn't say: We want to have a Constitution that enables the  wealthy and the well-connected to take away the riches of this country  at the expense of the people. No, they laid out the vision ``We the  people.'' They put that mission statement in supersized font, so even  if you were reading the Constitution from across the room, you would  understand its core mission--a core mission that unfortunately has been  sabotaged in the Citizens United decision, which, instead of pursuing  government of, by, and for the people, instead of providing what  Jefferson called the equal voice, mother principle of America--that  each citizen should have an equal voice--proceeds to give the powerful  the reins of power through unlimited third-party campaign spending.   The corruption of our democracy is in full gear, and we see it  through the bills that are coming to this floor--bills to wipe out  healthcare for 22 to 30 million Americans, a bill that passed that  borrows $1.5 trillion from our children and proceeds to give that money  virtually entirely--more than 80 percent--to the very richest  Americans. I encourage my colleagues to think about how we have a  responsibility under our oath of office to fight for this vision of  America, not a corrupted ``we the powerful'' vision of America.    As we address the issues that people care about at the kitchen table,  it comes down to four basic things. It comes down to education,  housing, living-wage jobs, and healthcare. Eisenhower said: ``Because  the strength of our nation is in its people, their good health is a  proper national concern.''   We have worked to design improved healthcare systems, lower costs,  higher quality, and improved accessibility. We have come a long way  through the ACA, the expansion of Medicaid, and the establishment of  competitive marketplaces for insurance. Indeed, in Oregon, we reduced  the uninsured rate from 15 percent to 5 percent. That is a huge stride  forward. We increased our resources in our rural healthcare clinics,  our rural hospitals, and our urban healthcare clinics and our urban  hospitals. We strengthened the healthcare system, but it is not enough.  We still have 41 million adults in this country who are underinsured.  We have 30 million who remain completely uninsured.   That is why, today, I am delighted to join with my colleague Senator  Chris Murphy to introduce the Choose Medicare Act. Every American  deserves the promise of access to a popular, affordable, high-quality  healthcare option. Fortunately, we have such an option. It is called  Medicare. It is time-tested. It is well-vetted. It is admired and  desired by our seniors.   Today, Chris Murphy and I are introducing the Choose Medicare Act,  which creates a Medicare option for all, putting consumers and  businesses in the driver's seat on the pathway to universal healthcare.  With the Choose Medicare Act, we affirm that here in America,  healthcare is not a privilege for the wealthy and well-connected. It is  a right and a fundamental value to have healthcare for all.   I am pleased that we have been joined in introducing this today with  nine of our colleagues as original cosponsors: Senator Baldwin, Senator  Blumenthal, Senator Booker, Senator Harris, Senator Heinrich, Senator  Shaheen, Senator Schatz, Senator Gillibrand, and Senator Udall. Thank  you to each and every one of these original cosponsors, who believe in  the vision of improving our healthcare system.   We appreciate the groups that worked to help forge this vision to put  meat on the bones of this idea: PCCC, which was involved from the very  beginning with insights, CREDO, Daily Kos, Democracy for America,  MoveOn, and Families USA. We appreciate their endorsement of this plan.   When we were talking about Medicare for All, many folks said: How do  you create the transition? And back during the ACA discussions, we did  debate reducing the age of Medicare to 55. We had 60 votes for it in a  week but lost our 60th vote.   We wrestled with this vision. How do you create the transition? Well,  folks come to my townhalls--and I hold a lot of them. I have held well  over 300 during the 10 years I have been serving in the Senate. They  come and say: We have this great healthcare plan, Medicare. Why can't  we buy into it? Why not give us the advantage of its efficiency and  cost control, its low-administrative costs and high-quality healthcare?   That is exactly what Chris Murphy and I are putting forward along  with our cosponsors--that vision of a Medicare option for all. That is  a ``we the people'' bill. That is not a bill for the powerful and  privileged. That is not government by the wealthy and well-connected.  This is about the fundamental issue people wrestle with around the  kitchen table--the complexity and the cost of our healthcare system. I  am on Medicaid today, but I have earned a little too much, so am I off?  How do I get on the exchange in the middle of the year? How do I sign  up for those tax credits? What if I don't get that right? What if the  correspondence gets lost in the mail or misfiled, which seems to  happen? Why can't we have a simple, seamless system?   Well, we have one--Medicare. Folks say: Why can't we participate? You  can, if we pass this bill. It makes sense to create this public option  competitor. What we have seen for States that have a public option in  their provision for workplace insurance is that the costs come down  dramatically. That certainly happened in my home State of  [[Page S2266]]  Oregon. It happened on the other coast in Rhode Island. It has happened  around this country.   Lyndon Johnson, when he signed the bill for Medicare, said:         It calls upon us never to be indifferent toward despair. It       commands us never to turn away from helplessness. It directs       us never to ignore or to spurn those who suffer untended in a       land that is bursting with abundance.    Medicare is high-quality coverage for 58 million Americans. It has  bargaining power, low administrative costs, and high respect by  participants.   What does the Choose Medicare Act do? Well, it covers all that  Medicare covers today, and then, because it would be open to people of  all ages, it throws in pediatric and reproductive healthcare and builds  those networks. It strengthens the exchanges by strengthening the tax  credits so that the middle class is not stranded when it comes to the  affordability of healthcare. It extends those tax credits from 400  percent of poverty to 600 percent of poverty, reaching further into the  middle class to make that transition--to make healthcare affordable on  the exchange. It strengthens, certainly, Medicare itself, by putting a  cap on the out-of-pocket costs.   For all those who are in traditional Medicare, their Medicare  improves as well. It provides the ability to drive down the cost of  drugs by giving Medicare the ability to negotiate those prices. That is  certainly a very important feature.   Here we have something that is very popular with the public. When the  public is asked ``Would you like to see the opportunity for every  single American to be able to buy into Medicare, have that as an  option; it is a voluntary option, but an option,'' overwhelmingly, they  say yes. Democrats say yes. Republicans say yes. Independents say yes.  They would like to have that option. The more they learn about how a  public option has driven down costs, the more they say that this is  needed.   We not only make it possible to buy it on the exchange, we make it  possible for self-insured companies to take advantage of Medicare. We  make it possible for employers in regular companies, who are buying  other healthcare plans for their employees, to consider buying a  Medicare plan. So this reach is broad and deep.   That is the type of ``we the people'' legislation we should be  considering on the floor of this Senate--not a healthcare bill designed  to destroy healthcare for 22 to 30 million people, as we saw last year  courtesy of our majority, not a plan to borrow $1.5 trillion from our  children and to give it away to the very richest Americans, the  biggest, boldest bank heist seen in American history--perhaps in world  history. That is the type of bank heist you would expect out of  corrupt, Third World governments, not here in the United States of  America, which tells you just how corrupt our election process has  become, with Citizens United allowing unlimited billionaire dollars  into our campaign system.   We have to fight to take back the vision of our Nation, the ``we the  people'' vision of our Nation. It has been stolen. It has been  corrupted, and we have to take it back. When we take it back, we are  going to put bills on the floor of this Senate that are about the  fundamentals for families, living-wage jobs, public education and  public college education, affordable quality classrooms, and the cost  of housing, which is completely out of reach, and, certainly, profound  substantial improvements to our healthcare system.   Again, I thank Chris Murphy for partnering in this project. I  supported Bernie Sanders' Medicare for All, and I love that vision.  Chris Murphy supported Brian Schatz's bill to be able to buy into  Medicaid. We don't have an identical healthcare profile, but what we  sought together is the option of buying into Medicare, which is a  complete win for the American people and a complete win for our  healthcare system.                            ____________________     Mr. President, the most important words of our  Constitution are the first three words: ``We the people.''
