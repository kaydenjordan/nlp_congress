 Mr. Speaker, today I want to recognize the Food Bank of  Eastern Michigan, an incredible nonprofit organization in my hometown  of Flint that is working to end hunger in the communities across my  district. Each year, the food bank distributes more than 28 million  pounds of food through 22 counties.   In addition to providing that assistance, the food bank is doing  important work to study poverty in America. It is clear through their  work that the way we measure poverty in America doesn't give us the  full picture. The way we look at poverty is incomplete.   Many families in Michigan technically are above the Federal poverty  level, but those families struggle to meet their basic needs, like a  roof over their head, enough food on the table, and paying their  utility bills.   Congress has to do more to end poverty in this country. Instead of  cutting childcare programs, healthcare, and ending tax incentives like  the Earned Income Tax Credit, let's help families be self-sufficient.  Let's focus on creating good jobs, raising their wages, supporting  families with income that allows them to not focus just on the basic  needs.   This is something that we have to do. We are the richest country on  the planet. We ought to be able to end poverty in America.                            ____________________
