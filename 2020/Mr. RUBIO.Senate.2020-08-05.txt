 Mr. President, as chairman of the Senate Committee  on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, each week I recognize a small  business that exemplifies the American entrepreneurial spirit at the  heart of our country. It is my privilege to recognize a family-owned  small business that builds high-quality projects and is actively  involved in several community organizations. This week, it is my  pleasure to honor JWR Construction Services, Inc., of Deerfield Beach,  FL, as the Senate Small Business of the Week.   In 1985, Jerry DuBois and William Gallo founded JWR Construction  Services in Deerfield Beach, FL. Recognizing a need for well-built  commercial buildings, they combined Jerry's project management  expertise and William's architectural skill to start their general  contracting and construction management firm. From the beginning, Jerry  and William established passion, respect, ownership, service, and  safety as the core values of their company. They prioritized customer  service and community involvement.   Over the next 35 years, JWR Construction finished construction  projects throughout Florida. They have built affordable multi-family  housing, healthcare facilities, and senior living centers, along with  commercial and industrial facilities. Notably, JWR Construction has  completed projects for the University of Miami, Johnson & Wales  University, Nova Southeastern University, and Florida Atlantic  University.   JWR Construction creates dignified work for their employees and  contractors, ensuring social mobility and supporting the skilled  trades. They emphasize hiring veterans including Jerry's son, Dustin,  who is a U.S. Navy veteran. Dustin served for 5 years as a machinist  mate and special warfare combatant-craft crewman. He joined the family  business in 2009 and currently serves as its chief operating officer.   Through their leadership and service, JWR Construction has advocated  for the contracting industry and south Florida community. In addition  to earning several local industry awards, JWR Construction is active in  the Associated Builders and Contractors Florida East Coast chapter,  with two members serving on the local 2020 board of directors. JWR  Construction has partnered with dozens of community organizations,  including the Boys and Girls Club, the Deerfield Beach Little League  team, and the Broward Navy Days. Jerry serves on the board of  Rebuilding Together Broward, which revitalizes homes for low-income  individuals, especially veterans.   Like many Floridian small businesses, JWR Construction Services  stepped up to support its community during the coronavirus pandemic.  When the Deerfield Beach Housing Authority hosted its seventh Annual  Destination Graduation for local low-income high school seniors, JWR  Construction helped organize a drive-through graduation celebration.  They provided a laptop for each graduating student, donating a total of  $14,000 in graduation gifts.   When the U.S. Small Business Administration launched the Paycheck  Protection Program, Jerry and William applied immediately. The PPP  provides forgivable loans to impacted small businesses and nonprofits  who maintain their payroll during the COVID-19 pandemic. In April 2019,  JWR Construction received a PPP loan, which enabled them to keep 37  employees paid and allowed them to safely continue their essential work  in south Florida.   JWR Construction Services is an incredible example of how hard work  and strong values can create a business that is both successful and  beneficial to the community that it serves. I commend their important  work. Congratulations to Jerry, William, Dustin, and the entire team at  JWR Construction Services. I look forward to watching your continued  growth and investment in the south Florida community.                            ____________________
