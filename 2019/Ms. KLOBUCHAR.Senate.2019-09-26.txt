 Mr. President, today, along with Senator Tina  Smith of Minnesota, I rise to acknowledge the passing of a longtime  advocate, mayor, and friend, International Falls Mayor Bob Anderson,  who died unexpectedly on September 20, 2019. Described by those who  knew him as the ``voice and face of International Falls,'' Bob spent  five decades in public service to the hometown and community he loved.   A lifelong resident of International Falls and graduate of Rainy  River Community College, Bob spent 51 years working for the local Boise  paper mill, including 25 as the public affairs manager for the Boise  Cascade Corporation.   Bob was passionate about his community, and his love was reflected in  his years of dedication to the airport, hospital, Highway 53 Task  Force, the county, anything and everything connected to his beloved  International Falls. He truly left his mark on his beloved hometown  from his seats on the city council, the chamber of commerce, and as its  devoted mayor--serving first from 1968 to 1986 and then elected again  in 2013. And he still wasn't done; he had made clear that he was fully  intending to seek another term next year.   Bob was also dedicated to improving communities across Minnesota  through decades of service on numerous statewide committees and  advocacy organizations, including as a president of the League of  Minnesota Cities, as a member of the Minnesota Forestry Association,  and as chairman of our Lessard-Sams Outdoor Heritage Council.   He also chaired the International Falls-Koochiching County Airport  Commission for over 30 years, helping to secure Federal grant money for  the airport that serves as a major corridor between the ``icebox of the  Nation'' and those who flock to the area to hunt, fish, and enjoy the  beauty of northern Minnesota. Earlier this year and in large part due  to Bob's efforts, the International Falls Airport opened a brand new  terminal.   The airport was just one of the many legacies Bob leaves behind. In  the words of Representative Rob Ecklund of International Falls, ``You  can't go anywhere in northern Minnesota without seeing his fingerprint  on it, from airports to roads. He left a tremendous lasting imprint.''   We are thankful we were able to work with Bob on so many of these  projects--from economic development initiatives to youth programs--and  will  [[Page S5746]]  always remember him as a tireless champion for small towns and the  outdoors.   In his final state of the city address, delivered just weeks ago, Bob  summed up progress in his community, saying ``There is a lot of  sunshine and a few dark clouds, but overall it's positive.'' We hope  during this time of loss for both our State and Bob's family, his wife  Carol, three children, and five grandchildren will take solace in  remembering all the sunshine Bob blessed us with.                            ____________________
