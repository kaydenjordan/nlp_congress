 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H. Res. 246.  This resolution, modeled on legislation passed  [[Page H7184]]  by the New York City Council, is fully consistent with the First  Amendment and affirms the rights of those who support the global BDS  movement to voice their opinions. Importantly, it also puts Congress on  Record rejecting this misguided and deceptive movement that is neither  progressive in its conduct nor pro-peace in its ultimate mission.   BDS proponents advocate for a complete boycott of Israeli businesses,  individuals, and institutions--including academic institutions, which  are supposed to be bastions of intellectual freedom--hypocritically  seeking to deny all Israeli citizens the same rights and freedoms that  BDS supporters claim that they themselves are denied.   Not only does the movement, at times, invoke anti-Semitic tropes and  seemingly promote violence, it unfairly blames one party in the  Israeli-Palestinian conflict and does nothing to promote direct  negotiations to achieve a two-state solution, which is the only path to  a fair peace.   In fact, the founder of the movement, when asked whether BDS would  end when Palestinians were able to establish their own state, flatly  says ``no.'' That tells you everything you need to know, Mr. Speaker.   Instead of promoting peace and a two-state solution, the mission of  BDS is clear: to delegitimize Israel, regardless of its policies or  conduct, and to deny the Jewish people, and only the Jewish people, the  right of national self-determination.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this resolution.
