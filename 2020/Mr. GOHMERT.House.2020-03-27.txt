 Mr. Speaker, it is interesting hearing all this talk  about we have got to do it now, we have got to do it now. It has been  delayed since last weekend because of our friends across the aisle.   Also, regarding the bill that we previously passed, it exempted the  big corporations we are now hearing are so evil. So we need to get our  story consistent here.   But thank goodness the President put a travel ban in while some were  trying to conspire, spy, and impeach. He kept being persistent, and, as  a result, there are fewer people with the disease.   Now, $2 trillion is vastly too much money, but I spent much of the  night reviewing all of the sunsets in the bill. I am satisfied that  most of them will prevent most of the waste, but there are some pet  projects in here.   Mr. Speaker, it is time to turn back to the God that so many have  turned from and then use the tools we have got to help those who have  been put in jeopardy. I will vote for the bill.
