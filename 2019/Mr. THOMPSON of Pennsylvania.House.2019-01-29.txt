 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  a tremendous business in Armstrong County, Bergad Specialty Foams.   Bergad Specialty Foams is a leading producer of polyurethane foams.  It recently celebrated the completion of a 50,000-square-foot building  expansion.   This is phase 1 of a long-range facility expansion, which will  increase production capacity to meet customer demand for its growing  line of specialty foams. It will also allow the company to accommodate  the production of several new product lines.   The expansion includes state-of-the-art CNC cutting equipment and  streamlined fulfillment and shipping areas, in addition to a secure  manufacturing area to accommodate the requirements of the consumer  technology industry.   Mr. Speaker, Bergad Foams makes specialty cushioning materials that  span several markets, including medical, cosmetic, oil and gas  production, high-end consumer electronics, and transportation and  aircraft.   I congratulate Paul Bergad, president of Bergad Incorporated, on the  outstanding business he has built in Armstrong County, Pennsylvania.   When they broke ground on this project, he refused the ceremonial  golden shovel and, instead, fired up his excavator to take out the  first bucket of dirt. Clearly, Mr. Bergad is a man who isn't afraid to  roll up his sleeves and get to work.   With this new addition, the manufacturing area totals more than three  acres under one roof, making it one of the largest manufacturing  facilities in the county.   Phase 2 of the expansion is expected to begin in about 18 months and  will add an additional 35,000 square feet to the facility. With these  expansions, Bergad Incorporated said they expect to hire an additional  30 employees.   Mr. Speaker, this is very welcome news in Armstrong County, where  Bergad Specialty Foams has its laboratory, manufacturing, fabrication,  tooling, warehousing, and sales division, all located at its Kittanning  facility.   Since Bergad Specialty Foams opened operations there in 1999, the  mission has been to ``exceed, not meet'' the standards of the industry  and the expectations of its clients. Mr. Speaker, the ever-expanding  product lines and expansion surely note that Bergad Specialty Foams is  not only living up to its lofty goals, but surpassing them.   I wholeheartedly congratulate Mr. Bergad on this outstanding  achievement, and I wish him the best as his company continues to  flourish in Armstrong County.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  the incredible role mentors play in the lives of young people.   January is National Mentoring Month, which brings national attention  to the need for mentors. Individuals, businesses, government agencies,  schools, faith communities, and nonprofits can all engage their  constituents to become mentors for the next generation of leaders.   When children have strong role models in their lives, they grow up to  be good neighbors and good citizens. As a co-chairman of the  Congressional Career and Technical Education Caucus, I know firsthand  how essential mentors are for students seeking a career in technical  education.   From agriculture to the arts, from marketing to manufacturing, CTE  programs work to develop America's most valuable resources: its people.  CTE has established itself as a path that many high-achieving students  choose in pursuit of industry certification and hands-on skills that  they can use right out of high school, in skills-based education  programs or in our colleges.   Many CTE instructors are mentors who inspire students to reach their  full potential and follow their dreams wherever they may lead.   Mr. Speaker, I thank every mentor in America for providing students  the guidance and confidence that they need to find success.                            ____________________
