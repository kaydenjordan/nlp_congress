 Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend for yielding.   At times like these, my good friend who chaired the Oversight and  Reform Committee, on which I also serve, was compelled to be a strong  leader, but that is who Elijah was anyway.   Elijah Cummings was known for calling out his Republican colleagues  on countless issues, from the Census to the treatment of children  coming across the border.   Yet, Chairman Cummings always took a principled stand whenever he saw  the strong against the weak. Elijah Cummings' strong sense of principle  was reinforced by his commanding presence, booming voice, and  convincing sense of rectitude.   Yet, the presence of the passing of Chairman Cummings drew widespread  sympathy and comment from the very Republicans in this House he most  opposed. It is Republicans who give the best witness to Chairman  Cummings' resolute fairness. Even as he held the gavel, he always let  his adversaries have their say. Afterward, of course, he took them all  to the cleaners.   Tragically, we have lost Elijah Cummings when this House perhaps most  needed his principled leadership.   Our Committee on Oversight and Reform, which he chaired, is one of  the committees deeply involved in the impeachment inquiry. Almost every  day, Republicans and Democrats are sitting in to hear testimony and ask  questions of witnesses during this investigation stage of the  impeachment inquiry.   Elijah Cummings' legendary evenhandedness will be most missed and  sought after by all who are looking for a role model and for best  practices for the rare impeachment inquiry and, for that matter,  hereafter.   Let us always remember our good friend, Elijah Cummings.
