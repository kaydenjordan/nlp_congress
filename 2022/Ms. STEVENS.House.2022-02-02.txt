 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this bill. I  rise in support of American supply chains. I rise in support of the  American workforce. I rise in support of advanced manufacturing. I rise  in support of autoworkers who are waiting for those chips.   I thank the incredible chairwoman from the Science, Space, and  Technology Committee, Congresswoman Johnson.   We ask ourselves often as policymakers what the world is going to  look like in 10 years, in 20 years, in 30 years, what we can do today  to ensure that my neighbors in southeastern Michigan are on a strong  path to succeed right here and now for the rest of the 21st century.  The Democrats have come yet again to save the day and get the job done  for our economy.   The America COMPETES Act--this legislation that we are debating today  will answer the big questions. It will secure our competitive edge for  generations to come. It is an investment in our people. And it reflects  on our ability to reach higher, think deeper, and invent solutions to  not only today's problems but tomorrow's challenges as well.   I will always bet on the American workforce. My job in Congress is to  connect people to the tools that unlock our future, and those tools are  in this bill, turbocharging America's leadership in science and  technology, a doubling of scientific investment, and a plan for our  supply chains, including how we address climate change.   It also mends the acute stressors that we are all feeling today. I  was talking to my car dealership just yesterday, and they are scared of  being out of work.   Let's get this done as of today.   Over the past 30 years, the U.S. manufacturing capacity for  semiconductors has collapsed. The crazy thing is that the U.S. led the  world in inventing them.   Let's come together. Let's get this done.
