 Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished gentleman  and my good friend from Maryland for yielding me the customary 30  minutes, and I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, the rule before us today provides for consideration for  three pieces of legislation that are laser-focused on a President who  has not been in office for almost 2 years now.   Meanwhile, yesterday's CPI reading came in higher than expected,  registering an 8.3 percent year-over-year increase. That is another 40- year high, literally the highest in my lifetime.   It is abundantly clear that Democrats are focused on their efforts of  political gamesmanship, hoping to distract the American people from the  absolute failures of the Biden administration.   Let's just go through these bills. The first bill, H.R. 302, makes it  even harder for the President to remove insubordinate Federal employees  in policy-making roles. All this legislation accomplishes is further  shielding unelected career bureaucrats from accountability to the  American voter, who are footing the bill for their salary. The Federal  Government should be responsive to the voters and their elected  Representatives, not the whims and the ideological leanings of  unelected bureaucrats.   Additionally, this rule provides for consideration of H.R. 2988, the  Whistleblower Protection Improvement Act. Let me start by just saying  that the need to protect whistleblowers is one of the most bipartisan  points of agreement in Congress. However, this legislation does nothing  to protect actual whistleblowers. There is a significant difference  lost in this bill between retaliation against legitimate whistleblowers  and the consequences in response to unacceptable actions taken by a  government employee.   Finally, the rule provides for consideration of H.R. 8326, Ensuring a  Fair and Accurate Census Act. Yet, this bill does everything but ensure  a fair and accurate Census. Specifically, H.R. 8326 provides the  director of the Census Bureau with unprecedented power and authority to  make all operational, statistical, and technical decisions for the  Census.    Further, this bill constrains the ability of future Censuses to  include critical questions, including a citizenship question, ensuring  that future Censuses will be unfair and inaccurate.   Instead of focusing on real-life issues facing everyday Americans,  House  [[Page H7807]]  Democrats this week are focusing on three bills that are completely  irrelevant to the multiple crises created by Joe Biden's policies.   In fact, two of these bills have already passed in the House this  Congress in larger packages. The failed policies of the far left and  the Biden administration have plunged our economy into a recession.  And, yes, it is a recession. They have stolen wages from the American  workforce, they have destroyed seniors' retirement savings, and they  have left families with the highest food prices since 1979. Let me  repeat that. Grocery prices surged 13 percent in August, the largest  increase in over 40 years.   Mr. Speaker, 80 percent of Americans say that inflation is the most  important issue facing the country, but you wouldn't know it by the  bills the Democrats are prioritizing and running on the floor this  week.   I think it is time my Democratic colleagues listened to the people  and work with Republicans on real economic solutions, rather than  doubling down on these dangerous, reckless, out-of-control spending and  far-left policy bills, the same policies that have created the crises  that we are now facing.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose this rule, and I reserve  the balance of my time.                                time  1315     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I will double down on the comment that these bills are  irrelevant. They are absolutely irrelevant in that two of them are  superfluous. One has already passed. One passed in an amendment to the  NDAA, and the other one is an unprecedented grant of authority to the  Census, which is completely inappropriate. So, yes, these bills, I  would argue, are irrelevant.   Do you know who would think they are irrelevant? Any person you talk  to on the street. If you go up to somebody filling up their gas tank,  and you ask them about these three bills, these are irrelevant to their  lives. They are worried about the price of gas.   If you ask somebody at a grocery store who is trying to feed a family  about these bills, these bills are irrelevant to their grocery bill.   If you are talking about real wages and fighting the loss of wages  and inflation, these bills are irrelevant to that. A lot of blue-collar  workers want wages to increase like they did under the last  administration, not decrease like they are today.   So, yes, these bills are absolutely irrelevant to everyday Americans.   But let's just talk about the high cost of inflation. Inflation is  the top concern reported by businesses and voters alike. However,  instead of working to lower costs for businesses and workers, the SEC  proposed burdensome new rules requiring businesses to disclose  extensive climate-related data and additional climate risks.   That is why if we defeat the previous question, I will personally  offer an amendment to the rule to immediately consider H.R. 8589, which  would prohibit the SEC's woke climate rule from ever moving forward.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment into the Record, along with any extraneous material,  immediately prior to the vote on the previous question.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume  to the gentleman from the Commonwealth of Kentucky (Mr. Barr), my good  friend, to explain the amendment.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume for just a few points in rebuttal.   Mr. Speaker, we keep hearing that inflation is a global issue, like  somehow it is not Biden's fault and the fault of far-left Democrats-- which it is.   The reason why this is a global issue--and remind my friends on the  other side of the aisle--is because we are the world's largest GDP. We  also just happen to be the world's reserve currency.   So, of course, when we have inflation, the world will have it. That  is just economics. So it is amazing how the principles of economics are  just cherry-picked to make points. But I would remind my colleagues of  those two facts. In short, we are exporting the inflation.   Now, as far as what we are doing to cause the inflation, well, it is  pretty simple. We have injected trillions of dollars into the economy.  That causes inflation. And then to double down on the failed policy,  Joe Biden unilaterally, and I would argue unconstitutionally, canceled  the debt of a swath of college students so you now have even more  liquidity in the market because of them.   And the sick irony here is that the guy that is driving the pickup  truck, the guy that went to school to be a plumber, an HVAC repairman,  that guy is now subsidizing the lawyer who is driving to his downtown  job in a BMW. That is what is so perverse about what is happening.   Now let's just talk about gas prices.   My colleague and my friend from Maryland said gas prices are down.  Yeah, they are down from like a week ago; they are not down from  January 2021 when they were less than $2.50 a gallon. So let's continue  to move that goalpost.   You can't argue that gas prices are up. Americans know gas prices are  up. They are feeling the pain at the pump. They are also feeling it in  the higher cost of all energy and food.   Finally, blaming Putin on gas prices and issues. Yeah, Putin is  partially to blame, but who encouraged Putin to invade Ukraine? That  would be Joe Biden by his surrender of Afghanistan.   Let me be clear that any weakness on the foreign stage is an  indication of aggression. When Joe Biden showed weakness by abandoning  the Bagram Air Base, by leaving our allies on the ground to predations  of the Taliban, that was weakness, and Putin seized on that to invade  Ukraine.   Instead of giving the Ukrainians the MiGs they needed, the proper  military supplies they needed, we decided to go halfway. Joe Biden  didn't fully commit. Now we have a protracted war in Ukraine, which is  going to lead to a humanitarian crisis not only in Central  [[Page H7810]]  Europe but all across Africa, for example, and higher energy prices  here.   Mr. Speaker, but that is all traced back to Biden being weak on  foreign policy.   Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman  from Kentucky (Mr. Barr).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I let my good friend from Maryland know that I like him,  too, and I would certainly clarify the remarks on Putin.   I will denounce Putin right now. Remember, I was the one calling in  the beginning of this conflict for a no-fly zone to be established led  by the United States. I don't think there is anybody more hawkish on  Russia and the Ukraine issue than myself on this side of the aisle. So,  to say that I was up here defending Putin is ludicrous.   We, of course, needed to beat Putin. We should have been much more  engaged from the beginning of this conflict, not just to send a message  to the Russians but to send a message to the Iranians and a message to  the Chinese vis-a-vis Taiwan. But I could go on.   I would say it is a total mischaracterization of my position to say  that I am up here saying good things about dictator Putin.    I remind my friend from Maryland about the history of this building.  In 1814, it was literally burned to the ground. In the seventies,  Puerto Rican separatists stormed in and detonated a bomb. So, let's  just get the historical context in place.   As far as denouncing violence, everyone on this side of the aisle has  denounced political violence consistently. The inconsistency is from my  friends from across the other side of the aisle who cherry-pick when  they denounce political violence.   I remember that during the entire summer of 2020, my friends across  the aisle treated the destructive BLM and antifa protests that caused  $2 billion worth of damage, they treated those protesters with kid  gloves. You had the current Vice President paying the bail for the  protesters. You had the gentlewoman from New York, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez,  saying: ``The whole point of protesting is to make people  uncomfortable. . . . To folks who complain protest demands make others  uncomfortable, that is the point.'' Those are the words of the  Democrats, not of us. We could go on.   Chris Cuomo, CNN host: ``Please, show me where it says protesters are  supposed to be polite and peaceful.'' The last time I checked, that was  a Democrat.   New York BLM cofounder Hawk Newsome said in response to Eric Adams  trying to put plainclothes police officers on the street: ``There will  be riots; there will be fire; and there will be bloodshed.''   It sounds to me that the political violence and the support for the  rhetoric that is coming to support political violence and upheaval are  coming from one side of the aisle, the Democrat side of the aisle.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr.  Barr) for more rebuttal.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers. I am  prepared to close, and I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, as I mentioned earlier, the CPI just released yesterday  shows that prices have increased 8.3 percent from August of last year.  Real wages are down 2.8 percent. The cost of electricity has  skyrocketed 15.8 percent. That is the most since 1981, the most since I  was alive.   As of August, nearly one quarter of all Americans reported forgoing  basic needs like food and medicine just to be able to afford their  energy bill. This number will only get worse because we are going to  face even higher costs to heat our homes this winter, with natural gas  prices nearing a 14-year high.   Yet, Democrats want to focus their efforts on, again, I would call  it, irrelevant legislation that has already passed the House. It will  not provide any relief to American workers and American families.   For these reasons, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the  previous question and to vote ``no'' on the rule.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
