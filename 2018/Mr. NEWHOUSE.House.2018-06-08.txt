 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the 136th  anniversary of the Yakama Nation Treaty of 1855.   On June 9 in 1855, the United States entered into an agreement with  the confederated tribes and bands of the Yakama Nation. This treaty  marked the beginning of a successful relationship between the Yakamas,  the Federal Government, and the people of Central Washington State.   I am proud to display a copy of the treaty of 1855 in my office here  in Washington, D.C. as a reminder of the Federal Government's  obligations.   The Yakama Nation's presence and influence is evident in my district.  The Yakama Nation Museum and Cultural Center provides students and  visitors an inside look at the history and the values of the Tribes.  The newly opened Yakama Warriors Association's Veterans Center provides  resources and assistance to veterans on or near the Yakama Reservation.  Events and celebrations bring communities together to honor and  preserve the Yakama Nation's cultural traditions.   Mr. Speaker, I am grateful for the Yakamas' input as I work to  represent all of Central Washington, and I look forward to continuing  to ensure their voices are heard on the important decisions that affect  the land that we all love.                            ____________________
