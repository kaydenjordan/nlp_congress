 Madam Speaker, I was unavoidably detained. Had I been  present, I would have voted ``nay'' on rollcall No. 235.    Mr. Speaker, last week I had the incredible privilege to  participate in the groundbreaking for the new Redding VA Outpatient  Clinic.   This will serve veterans all over northern California with the  increased size and space as well as the increased capabilities of the  new clinic, which include allergy, immunology, rheumatology, and  additional telemedicine rooms being available. Also, increased  radiology service will include fluoroscopy capabilities. This is a good  sign for being able to better care for our veterans in northern  California.   I would also like to point out one of the driving forces in seeing  this clinic happen in the Redding area, and that would be our former  State Senator Maurice Johannessen. This has been his vision and his  dream for a long time: to help our veterans in northern California.   So my hat is off in appreciation to my friend Maurice, and we will  attend, together, the ribbon-cutting before too much longer.   So, indeed, congratulations for the good work to VA and Senator  Johannessen and everybody else who had a hand in it.                            ____________________
