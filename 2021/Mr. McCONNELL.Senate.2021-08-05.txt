 Mr. President, earlier this week, the Senate proudly  and unanimously passed a resolution awarding a Congressional Gold Medal  to the U.S. Capitol Police along with other law enforcement personnel  who helped defend this institution on January 6.   Today, President Biden will sign this resolution into law, and the  brave men and women who served that day will receive the highest honor  that Congress can bestow.   With the home of our representative democracy literally under attack,  the officers of the Capitol Police, their colleagues from the DC  Metropolitan Police, and others made huge, huge sacrifices to keep all  of us safe.   On January 6, Congress got a firsthand reminder of a reality that  many American citizens face every day; that the brave men and women of  law enforcement really are the thin blue line standing between peace  and chaos.   I am so proud we are adding our own colleagues in blue to the list of  extraordinary Americans that Congress has honored with its gold medal.   So thank you and congratulations.                            ____________________     Now, Mr. President, on a completely different matter,  we are more than a year from the technical end of the COVID-19  recession.   There are more than 9 million job openings in the country, the most  in American history by far. Three safe and effective vaccines are  easily available all across our country, free of charge, for any adult  who wants one. Medical contraindications are rare, and CDC data tell us  that, once somebody is fully vaccinated, their risk of dying from  COVID-19 absolutely plummets right down to the normal range of risk  that we implicitly face on a daily basis. Vaccines may not magically  eliminate the virus overnight, but the evidence tells us that vaccines  can eliminate the degree to which the virus represents a unique crisis.   We may not be entirely out of the woods--the Delta uptick makes that  clear--but it is time to stop governing as if we were trapped in a  permanent economic meltdown. It factually is simply not the case, but  the Democratic Party's far-left flank is resisting this simple fact.  They were counting on this terrible but temporary pandemic to be their  Trojan horse for permanent socialism. So they don't want to admit that  the vaccines are transitioning COVID from a crisis into a challenge-- case in point, the surreal episode that has unfolded this past week  over evictions.   For a year and a half now, the government has basically told  landlords they have little or no recourse if tenants stop paying the  rent. This isn't just about massive corporations that some think could  eat losses forever; family businesses who own one or two units have had  to keep paying their bills, their taxes, and their mortgages the whole  time.   Congress already sent billions of dollars to States for rental  assistance. The problem is with State governments that have been  pathetically slow to get the money out, but when some Socialist House  Members fail to convince their own fellow Democrats to extend this  nationwide socialism through legislation, they somehow prevailed on  President Biden through PR stunts--PR stunts.   One day before the President's announcement, his senior adviser said  the President had ``double-, triple-, quadruple-checked'' whether he  had the legal authority to do this, and he concluded he did not. The  President himself admitted that legal scholars find his position  untenable, but he still caved and did it.   The far left wants to turn this terrible but temporary pandemic into  a Trojan horse for permanent socialism, and the administration is  letting them call the shots                            ____________________     Mr. President, in just a few days our colleagues will  start ramming through yet another--another--reckless taxing-and- spending spree: trillions more in inflationary spending when families  just want good jobs and stable prices.   But there is something funny happening. Even as Democrats crow about  how all this spending is so good and so needed, they are petrified to  vote for the credit limit increase that would make it possible.   The Democrats are about to tell Republicans to go take a hike and  start teeing up trillions more dollars in borrowing and spending, of  course, without a single Republican vote. Ah, but at the same time,  they are extolling the virtues of their latest socialist shopping list,  they are afraid to up the limit on their credit card. They want  Republicans to give them political cover for the partisan debt bomb  that they will go right on to detonate with zero input from us. My  colleagues are so mixed up on this, it is almost comical.   The sums that we borrowed and spent through 2020--through last year,  through the last administration, through the actual economic  emergency--were largely covered by the previous debt suspension that  just expired, but Democrats want a new debt limit increase for the new  borrowing and the new spending that they willfully piled up since they  took power: about $2 trillion back in March, trillions more sometime  soon.   So they want to unleash another reckless taxing-and-spending spree  with zero Republican input--oh, oh--but when the bill comes, they say  it is time to split the check. When the bill comes, it is time to split  the check. Initiating another budget reconciliation process in a 50-50  Senate is as willfully partisan, as ``go it alone'' as it gets,  especially in a Senate that keeps proving we can do bipartisan work.   So, look, if our colleagues want to ram through yet another reckless  taxing-and-spending spree without our input, if they want all this  spending and debt to be their signature legacy, they should leap at the  chance to own every bit of it.   So let me make something perfectly clear: If they don't need or want  our input, they won't get our help. They won't get our help with the  debt limit increase that these reckless plans will require. I could not  be more clear. They have the ability. They control the White House;  they control the House; they control the Senate. They can raise the  debt ceiling, and if it is raised, they will do it                            ____________________     Mr. President, now, on another matter, this week,  Senate Republicans are saying goodbye to some all-star staffers.   Nick Rossi, the chief of staff to our whip, Senator Thune, has spent  15 years mastering the ins and outs of the Senate.   This former FBI agent has used his Harvard Law horsepower to steer  offices, committees, and our entire conference in the right direction.  Our whip  [[Page S5894]]  has had a whip-smart right-hand man. I won't be able to top his boss's  wonderful tribute remarks from yesterday, so I won't even try, but I  did just want to add my own brief thanks and congratulations.   I have gotten to see Nick's great work up close. Senator Thune and I  have a standing Monday meeting to plan the week. It is a very small  meeting with very few staff. Nick has been in that room, and, every  time, I have been glad he was. It is a rare thing in Washington to meet  someone who is probably almost one of the smartest people in the room  but who also never lets you know it, but Nick combines brilliance and  humility in just that way.   So my staff and I join Senator Thune and the whole Senate in bidding  Nick a fond, if reluctant, farewell.   Thank you, sincerely, for your fine, fine service.                            ____________________     Now, Mr. President, on one final matter, when you have  served in the Senate as long as I have, you get to hire and work with a  lot of talented people, and when you find rock stars, you try to hang  onto them. As a result, when a key staff member moves on, it often  means reflecting on an extended Senate career of many years, including  shared memories of old war stories going back ages.   Andrew Ferguson is a different case.   It was only 2 years ago that I hired Andrew to be my chief counsel.  He has only been in the Senate about 3 years. By the standards of this  place, he is a spring chicken. But it has only taken Andrew this short  time to leave a stunningly outsized imprint on my work, on our  conference, on the judiciary, and on everyone who has gotten to work  alongside of him as well.   So, a few days before Andrew concludes his Senate service, I am both  happy for the opportunity to share how this happened and really, really  sorry that I have to do it.   The chief counsel in my leadership office handles a portfolio that is  almost comically large: judicial confirmations, law enforcement and  crime, immigration and border security, some constitutional questions  that intersect with the separation of powers, others that intersect  with national security, sometimes arcane Senate history. It takes a  lawyer's lawyer with expertise in our laws and Constitution and someone  who can feel out the politics, the personalities, and the shades of  gray that drive a political body.   One look at Andrew's resume told me that qualification No. 1 was,  clearly, no problem--UVA Law; clerked on the DC Circuit; clerked for  Justice Thomas; experience in the private sector--a lawyer anybody  would be glad to hire.   Oh, but what about the second qualification?   Like I said, Andrew wasn't a long-serving Senate hand. He arrived at  Judiciary in time to help Chairman Grassley notch a win for the country  and the sanity of the Senate with the confirmation of Justice  Kavanaugh. He had only just been promoted to Chairman Graham's top  nominations counsel when I poached him.   Well, Andrew stepped into this complex role, and, boy, did he  flourish.   He became a go-to leader for committees and offices across the  Republican side, a key Senate liaison to both the executive and  judicial branches. He added to his lawyerly chops and grew into a  strategic adviser of the first-rate. Our Republican conference is a big  tent with a range of visions, but Senators from across the conference  have come not just to trust Andrew's judgment, but they seek it out.   Andrew's impact has been truly dramatic. I do not believe any other  Senate staffer played a more crucial role in the last two Supreme Court  confirmations combined. He was our side's field general in confirming  Justice Barrett. Our majority spent 4 years rebuilding the kind of  Federal judiciary that our constitutional order requires. Andrew played  an indispensable part.   The last couple of years have brought all sorts of unusual national  challenges. The 2 years that Andrew has spent with us feel more like  10. We faced scenarios that would have sounded like wild law school  hypotheticals. Who would have guessed we would be fighting to protect  Americans' religious freedom while the government battled an airborne  virus? But our chief counsel invariably brought us up to speed on  whatever the day would bring with a good head, a big heart, and great  humor. And if the topic was new to him, a big stack of library books  were on his desk.   It might sound like Andrew was just very dedicated to his job. That  is not totally unusual. But that doesn't fully capture it. See, I have  come to believe he is simply this intense about absolutely everything.  Andrew takes work very seriously, but he also takes his faith  seriously, and he takes family seriously. He treasures the upbringing  that his parents, Roy and Susan, provided for him and his two brothers.  He takes his interests seriously, his hobbies. There is an intense,  infectious enthusiasm for all of it, a kind of good-natured aggression.   Now, as his colleagues will attest, all this intensity can yield,  actually, entertaining results. If, for example, you took a stroll by  Andrew's desk, you would often hear him shouting--shouting--excitedly  at a colleague, but you would generally genuinely have no clue whether  he is strongly disagreeing with the person or just agreeing with them  with great gusto. He could be discussing the law, but it might also be  Roman history or the Protestant Reformation or the merits of some TV  comedy or his weekend plans involving the lawful exercise of his Second  Amendment rights. Whatever the subject, you would get maximum  enthusiasm, maximum force of nature, and everybody in earshot usually  learns some new fact and shares a big laugh.   Different people enjoy this line of work for different reasons, but  for Andrew, I think politics and policy matter so much because ideas  and principles matter so much. That is why one of the most darkly funny  and cynical people on our team has also been one of the most earnest  and idealistic. Everything is worth thinking through. Everything is  worth taking seriously because principles matter, the rule of law  matters, and our country matters. That is why we come to work every  day.   A lot of people first come to Washington with a warrior mentality,  but the rhythms of this city sometimes lull folks into a somewhat  calmer mixture. But, believe me, as I suspect the entire Senate can  attest by now, we need not worry that Andrew Ferguson will be lulled  into a calmer anything.   So, my friend, you may be leaving the trenches for now, but we both  know there is no chance you will be able to stay away forever. You are  going to miss the good fight, and I can say with personal certainty  that the fight is going to miss you as well. Thank you for the law  lectures. Thank you for the laughs. Thank you for an outstanding job  for our country. Job well done.                            ____________________
