 I ask unanimous consent that my remarks be completed  prior to the vote.    Madam President, I rise today to proudly vote for the  confirmation of Jamel Semper to the U.S. District Court of New Jersey.   Mr. Semper, whom I personally recommended to President Biden, is  exceptionally well-qualified for this position, and you don't have to  take my word for it. Mr. Semper received strong, bipartisan support on  the Judiciary Committee. So there is no reason he shouldn't enjoy that  same bipartisan support here on the Senate floor.   For more than 15 years, Mr. Semper has tirelessly sought justice for  the residents who call New Jersey home. Indeed, it is the central theme  that runs throughout Mr. Semper's career--an unwavering commitment to  the rule of law and to the communities the law is meant to protect.   He began his career as an assistant prosecutor in Union County,  handling a wide range of cases across the appellate, juvenile, and  adult trial units. Then, in Essex County, he went after carjackers and  murderers, including the first prosecution of a homicide under New  Jersey's domestic terrorism statute.   In 2018, he was sworn in as an assistant U.S. attorney in Newark,  climbing the ladder and ultimately serving as chief of both the violent  crime and organized crime units. Today, he is the deputy chief of the  criminal division, a role in which he is responsible for supervising  all phases of criminal investigation and prosecution.   In each of these positions, Mr. Semper has demonstrated unflinching  fidelity to the rule of law. Time and time again, Mr. Semper has kept  New Jerseyans safe, while also building bridges between residents and  those who have sworn an oath to protect them.   This community-focused approach to law enforcement has earned Mr.  Semper plaudits from individuals and organizations representing diverse  interests, especially those who advocate for communities of color in  the Garden State.   Consider the words of Rev. Ron Slaughter, the pastor of St. James AME  in Newark. He said:         ``Semper has touched all the bases, stayed connected to the       community, and remained patient. This is a great day for New       Jersey, America, our judiciary, and my community.''    Truer words haven't been spoken.   Mr. Semper's confirmation today not only furthers our collective goal  of addressing judicial vacancies across our country; it also advances  our efforts to diversify the Federal bench. It brings us one step  closer toward ensuring that our most hallowed institutions reflect the  rich tapestry of America.   For nearly 18 years, I have always taken my constitutional duty to  provide advice and consent on judicial nominees seriously. It is one of  the most solemn obligations as U.S. Senators that we have, and it is  one of the most consequential impacts we have on our democracy as  Senators--confirming judges who interpret and shape the law and our  Constitution for decades to come.   So I am a firm believer that our independent judiciary must reflect  the very best of America's values and its citizens, which is why I can  honestly say that Jamel Semper's relentless commitment to public  service, combined with his temperament and the trust he has built with  New Jerseyans--all this is exactly what we look for in a Federal judge.   He will, no doubt, be an asset to New Jersey's Federal bench, and I  encourage all my colleagues to support Jamel Semper to be in his  rightful place on the District Court of New Jersey.    I yield the floor.    I ask for the yeas and nays.
