 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, it is Thursday, and we are back at it  with  [[Page S3597]]  our Alaskan of the Week series. We have been doing this for, geez, 6  years now, I think.   For the new pages, this is usually kind of the signal of the end of  the week but also some really cool stories about Alaska. We know it is  your favorite.   We think some of the reporters in town like it because it signals  kind of the end of the week for them. But I want to talk about, first,  what is kind of going on in Alaska. Right now, the sun is high in the  sky through much of the day. Some places up north are getting 24 hours  of sunlight; midnight sun, we call it.   In Anchorage, we are getting about 18 hours, but that starts to  decline real quick. But even when the sun sets, it is more of a  twilight look than real night. So you have got to come up and visit;  you will love it. It has been pretty rainy in parts of the State. We  needed that rain.   But it can't dampen the magnificent grandeur of Alaska. So, again, if  you are watching on TV, you want to come up, have the vacation of a  lifetime, do it. The fish are running. We are having a banner year for  sockeye salmon. The rivers all across the State are choked with them.   Last weekend, actually, I partook at a particular unique Alaskan  tradition with my wife and a couple buddies of mine. We went  dipnetting--dipnetting. That is on the Kenai River. That is actually  when there is so much fish you actually put a pole with a net at the  end, and you just put it in the water--boom. You just start to catch  them.   And you know, people go, Well, can you tell if there is a fish in  your net? I am like, Oh, yeah, you can tell.   So my wife and I and our friends, we caught 36 beautiful sockeye  salmon yesterday--or last weekend, about 5 hours of fishing. It was  great. We just loved it.   So fishing, hunting, feeding our families from our land and waters is  a big part of our life in Alaska. These traditions bind us. They keep  us together as a State, as a community, as families.   Our longstanding businesses are also part of the fabric of our State,  particularly the ones that have grown up with our State. When the  State's done well, they have done well. When the State struggled, they  struggled; but they have hung in there. And we want to celebrate these  businesses and the families that have run them.   And the great Alaskan we are honoring today as our Alaskan of the  week is Betsy Lawer. And she is part of an amazing family in an amazing  business in Alaska--First National Bank of Alaska, which this year is  celebrating its 100th anniversary.   So it started in 1922. This amazing financial institution has been  part of the landscape of Alaska--good times, difficult times--for 100  years. Betsy has been at the helm, a strong, sturdy force helping to  guide this incredible business and, by extension, other businesses and  communities throughout the State, part of her family tradition--the  Cuddy family--for 100 years.   So let's talk about Betsy and the family. She is the president of the  First National Bank of Alaska and also part of a really impressive  family that has run this bank for decades in Alaska.   So here is the beginning: Literally with a vault full of gold nuggets  and untanned animal pelts, that was their original deposits. In 1922,  First National was founded then in what was part of the rough-and- tumble tent city of Anchorage. Anchorage was referred to as a tent  city.   In 1930, the patriarch of the Cuddy family, Warren Cuddy, began  buying stock in the bank. By 1941, he purchased controlling interest,  and Warren became the bank's president. Then, one of his sons, at that  time, joined the bank's board--this is Dan Cuddy, the legendary Dan  Cuddy, Betsy's dad. His service was remarkable. First, I would like to  talk briefly about Dan Cuddy's service as an Alaskan veteran in World  War II.   He served as a captain in the 1255th Engineer Combat Battalion, which  was attached to General George Patton's Third Army. Dan fought in the  Battle of the Bulge in Luxembourg and was one of the troops who  assisted in the discovery and then closing of the Buchenwald  concentration camp. This is an American hero.   And, by the way, throughout his entire career, I was so honored to  meet with Dan Cuddy before he passed away in 2015. Throughout his  incredible career, one thing he talked a lot about was the unspeakable  atrocities that he saw in World War II, so it would never happen again.   So Dan Cuddy comes back from World War II--warrior patriot, war hero.  He becomes a lawyer, and in 1951, he becomes the bank president. And  the Cuddy family's involvement, again, throughout our State is  legendary.   The bank thrived after that under Dan's leadership. It grew with the  State. It helped Alaskans rebuild after the huge 1964 earthquake.   By the way, do you want to read about a huge earthquake? It was 9.2  on the Richter scale, one of the biggest earthquakes ever recorded. It  destroyed cities, tsunamis. It lasted almost 5 minutes. Think about  that, sitting through an earthquake for 5 minutes.   And the bank the whole time kept supporting communities, and it  continues to do that. It was among the first in the Nation to  distribute check image statements to its customers in the 1990s. The  only bank in America to welcome dog mushers through drive-throughs.  Yes, think about that image.   And it is probably certainly the only bank in America that has a  branch that is bilingual both in English and Yupik. That is the branch  in Bethel, 1 of 19 branches across America.   First National Bank of Alaska--100 years of service--has received so  many accolades and awards, including being named one of the top banks  in America, and it was recognized in 2013 as one of America's most  trustworthy companies by Forbes magazine.   You can see the Cuddy family integrity in this institution. But the  most important thing about First National Bank of Alaska's mission  statement is that it is what drives the bank: Success depends on taking  care of the community, employees, and customers. If the community isn't  strong, businesses won't be strong, the bank won't be strong.   So, Betsy, one of Dan and Betti's six children, was raised on those  tenets that I just talked about. She saw how they worked firsthand.   On Saturdays, she would join her father Dan while he went on his  outings visiting customers. Sometimes those visits happened in  Anchorage, where she would politely listen to business being discussed  and then grab a late breakfast at Peggy's, a mainstay in Anchorage.  Sometimes they would jump into a prop plane and head out to rural  Alaska, where she learned so much about that part of our great State.   Betsy said she loved those visits and she learned, in the ways that  children do, that helping people realize their hopes and their dreams  is what her father did, what their business did, and why it was so  important to so many Alaskan communities.   Jump forward to September 10, 1969. Betsy was a college student at  Duke, spending her summers, as she always did, working at the bank as a  secretary at the bank.   Just down the street from First National in downtown Anchorage, the  Prudhoe Bay oil lease sale was underway. This is the giant oilfield in  Alaska--oil and gasfield. The first big lease sale by the State. It was  a huge event for our Nation, huge event for Alaska.   Back then, the country needed Alaska oil and gas, just like today our  country needs Alaska oil and gas.   On that day in September 1969, Betsy remembers looking out the window  of the bank. She said the streets were completely empty, like the  ``Twilight Zone.'' Everybody was huddled in front of their radios,  listening to the lease sale that would change Alaska and, in many ways,  America forever.   First National Bank of Alaska--the Cuddy family's bank where she was  working, her dad was president then--was assisting Bank of America on  the lease sale.   After the sale, get this image, Betsy got a ride back to the east  coast on a jet with bank executives headed to New York to directly  deposit the $900 million check that was made out to the State of  Alaska--that is about 7 billion in today's money--that got our State up  and moving. She was on that plane depositing that money. Imagine the  excitement that she felt then.   The first thing Betsy did after that when she got back to Duke was to  [[Page S3598]]  change majors from interior design to economics, which was probably a  good move for a future bank president.   Two years later--she didn't even wait for her graduation ceremony-- she came back to Alaska and immediately got to work. Now, because  management programs back then were mostly for men, Betsy started from  the bottom up--teller, clerk, secretary--which she said later in life  gave her an advantage when she began processing loans for the bank  because she knew exactly how it all worked and the people at every  level in that bank. She knew the bones of the bank and the banking  industry.   Throughout the years, as the bank has grown, our Alaskan of the Week,  Betsy, has grown with it. She became president of the bank in 2013, CEO  in 2018, and she is also the board president.   She is a mother, a wife, an active member of the community. She is a  great community banker, and I will tell you this. During the pandemic,  there was no financial institution that was more dedicated to getting  the PPP loans out to small businesses in Alaska than First National  Bank of Alaska and Betsy Lawer. They did an incredible job.   Betsy helps people in our State realize their hopes and dreams, and  for Betsy, it all comes down to having a deep understanding and caring  for the community--the many communities that they serve. ``You can't  automate those relationships,'' she said.   So I want to thank Betsy, the Cuddy family, congratulate the First  National Bank of Alaska--100 years of service to our great State, what  an amazing record. And I want to congratulate Betsy on perhaps one of  her most prestigious awards ever: being Alaskan of the Week.                              CHIPS Act of 2022    Madam President, we have been discussing on the Senate floor the  USICA bill, the America Competes bill, the bill that is supposed to  focus on our ability to outcompete the Chinese communist economy, and I  can think of very little legislation more important than this.   This is an issue that since I arrived in the Senate in 2015, I  started talking about the importance of a broad-based strategy as it  relates to China and outcompeting China and recognizing that they don't  play fair, that they steal, that they subsidize, that they coerce, and  yet they are a huge entity in the global economy so we need a  strategy to deal with them.    And this bill that we are now debating on the Senate floor, the U.S.  Innovation and Competition Act of 2021, USICA is something that I, with  a number of other Senators, have worked hard on for literally over the  last year and a half, and I want to thank a number of Senators who have  put their heart and soul into this legislation, commend them: Senators  Young, Schumer, Wicker, Cantwell, Warner, Cornyn.   This is important legislation. As I mentioned, I have supported it  and its Senate iterations when we passed it out of the Senate, out of  committee in the Commerce Committee, but I have concerns. I have  concerns, and I am going to mention a few of them briefly and then one  concern that permeates so much of what has been happening here in the  U.S. Senate over the last year and a half that is really important to  me and my constituents. And I am asking my Senate colleagues--my  Democratic Senate colleagues--to help me on something that I don't  think a lot of them maybe even know that they are doing, but let me get  to the concerns.   First, on the chips provision--this isn't a concern. This is what  Senator Warner, Senator Cornyn, and many others have focused on--really  important to shore up semiconductor manufacturing in America.   Now, look, my State, unfortunately, is not one that is competing  right now hard for a big fabrication plant. I understand that. We have  other assets like energy I am going to talk about here in a minute, but  wherever this government support for the chips industry is going to go  in America, I think it is really important because this industry is  like energy. It is so important to America, and we can't let China  outcompete us in that area.   But let me talk about a couple concerns. First, on energy, one of the  biggest areas that we can compete against China that they are scared  about competing with us is our incredible natural resources, ``all of  the above'' resources, all of our energy.   If you read the intel and you see what China's leadership is worried  about, one thing they are worried about is American energy dominance.   So I have worked hard on this legislation for a year and a half to  make sure that when we are looking at research--advanced research that  this legislation is going to fund--it needs to include all energy.   It has been a struggle, I will admit. Some of my Democratic  colleagues, certainly the Biden administration, have this thing where  they don't like certain areas of energy--oil and gas in particular.  They have targeted it. They want to put it out of business. It makes no  sense. It is probably the biggest strategic blunder of the Biden  administration across so many areas--targeting and unilaterally  disarming American energy, when it is one of our greatest comparative  advantages.   Unfortunately, some of the language coming back over from the House  continues this trend, and I am very concerned that we would have a bill  that could give Federal bureaucrats the opportunity to continue to  target American energy, as opposed to help bolster it in our  competition with China.   So that is one concern. It wasn't in the Senate bill. I made sure of  that. But now after some of the far-left Members in the House got to  put language in that came back over here, it is a concern, and it  should concern every single American, every single Senator.   We need all of our strengths to compete with China, and to not use  the strength of American energy--``all of the above'' energy--is nuts.  Hopefully, this administration is waking up to that, but it hasn't been  a great record at all in terms of that.   There is another provision, something that built on a provision that  I tried to get that I did get in the original USICA bill that Senator  Portman has now put forward with Democrats and Republicans, a provision  to make sure that all of these Federal dollars that are going to be in  this bill do not go to Chinese researchers working in our facilities-- in research facilities, in university facilities--and then take them  back to China.   At a recent hearing, FBI Director Wray said this is one of the  biggest threats our country faces, the counterintelligence perspective  with regard to the Chinese Communist Party. He said:         They are targeting our innovation, our trade secrets, our       intellectual property on a scale that's unprecedented in       history.    So if we are going to spend all these Federal dollars on American  research at American research institutions and American universities,  we need strong guardrails to make sure it doesn't fall into Chinese  hands.   Senator Portman has done a great job on this. It is a commonsense  amendment. Apparently, some have had concerns that this amendment would  be ``racist.'' That is ridiculous. We need to prevent China from  stealing our intellectual property. Period. It is not racist; it is  common sense. I hope we can make sure that amendment gets in.   But I want to go into a little detail on the final issue that I have  with this bill. And to be honest, it is kind of shocking that a bill  focused on competing with China--once again, from the Democratic side  of the Senate or the House, I don't know where it comes from--has  provisions that actually target in a negative way Alaska Natives. OK?   This is an issue that, to be honest, I am kind of flabbergasted. It  comes up everywhere. It is discrimination. It is racial  discrimination--good old-fashioned racial discrimination--that I  thought we tried to get rid of in this country a long time ago, and it  keeps popping up.   I am tired of it, and, remarkably, it popped up in the bill that  competes against China. So I am sure a lot of you are saying: Well,  jeez, how did that happen? I want to explain because I really want my  colleagues, many of whom I am convinced have no idea what is going on,  to understand what is happening. And it happens again and again, and to  be honest, it shouldn't.   I hope some people in our media finally write about this. I think it  is shameful.  [[Page S3599]]    But I am going to explain it here right now. Here is the issue. In  Alaska, we have a very big indigenous population--wonderful people,  incredible people, amazing people. It is almost 20 percent of the  population of my State. They bring culture, heritage, values. By the  way, they have been there for tens of thousands of years. This is  really important to me and to Senator Murkowski. Congress--Congress,  not the Native people, the Congress of the United States--over the  course of many years, essentially, has classified--we in the U.S.  Senate have classified--Alaska Natives into two broad categories. There  are Tribal members, which is this circle here, and there are members of  Alaska Native Corporations. They are in this circle here.   Now, a lot of the indigenous people of Alaska are both Tribal members  and an ANC members. Some are not both. Some are just Tribal members.  Some are ANC members.   But we are talking about tens of thousands of indigenous people. So  whenever we work on legislation that benefits the Alaska Native  people--but American Indians, writ large--what we always try to do is  say: Remember, Congress did this. The Native people didn't do this. So  let's make sure that we cover everybody. Let's make sure everybody is  included. You wouldn't want to discriminate against one of these  groups. They are all indigenous people.   So that is what me, Senator Murkowski, Ted Stevens--every Senator,  every great Congressman, our great Congressman Don Young, whom we just  lost--we have been doing that for decades.   All of a sudden this has become controversial to some Members, to  some groups. This group, the ANC members, these are indigenous people  of Alaska designated as ANC members, not by themselves but by the  Congress, OK?   So here is what happened. Here is the beginning. It is sad, and I am  going to talk about it. It shouldn't happen, and I really want my  Democratic colleagues to help me stop this because if you put another  minority group in and talked about what is happening to the Native  people of Alaska, people would be shocked. The New York Times and the  Washington Post would write front pages stories about official  discrimination by the U.S. Senate against a minority population. But  for whatever reason, it seems to be OK to do it against Alaska Natives.  But it is not OK.   Here is what happened. In the CARES Act we had this historic funding,  $8 billion for the Native people of America. We wrote a definition. I  was very involved with it. Everybody cleared on it--Indian Affairs,  majority, minority. That included all indigenous people of Alaska--OK,  just like we include all indigenous people of Nevada and New Mexico. We  wanted to cover with $8 billion in the CARES Act the very vulnerable  populations, all the Native people.   Unfortunately--unfortunately--as opposed to being viewed as $8  billion, the biggest historic investment in Indian communities in  history, there was a dispute, and certain groups said: Hey, we got this  $8 billion, but we don't want this group to get anything. We don't want  this group, ANC members, to get any of that $8 billion.   Remarkably, the majority leader in a tweet attacked the Assistant  Secretary of the Interior, an Alaska Native woman of impeccable  integrity, saying somehow that these members getting any of that money  was corrupt. Of course, that was ridiculous. One of the Senate  Democrats here, Senator Udall, launched an investigation of this  incredible Assistant Secretary of the Interior, an Alaska Native woman,  on this charge. It was refuted. It was ridiculous. It was sad.   By the way, Senator Udall apologized to her. Our Ambassador to New  Zealand right now apologized to this incredible Alaska Native woman,  saying: Do you know what? That was probably really bad. I am sorry.   It was bad.   So what happened is that you had a group saying: Let's exclude this  group of tens of thousands of Alaska Natives from getting any CARES  money.   Well, look, we wrote the language. We knew that the language was  inclusive of everybody. So that, unfortunately, went all the way to the  U.S. Supreme Court. The Trump administration and, to its credit, the  Biden administration said: No, the language of the CARES Act included  all Alaska Natives. Why would we discriminate one against the other?   So we won that. That was the way it was written. I had a lot to do  with writing it. So I know. But that is just fair. OK, so that is what  happened.   So then my Democratic colleagues write the American Recovery Act. The  $2 trillion relief package, with $20 billion for American Tribes. But  do you know what came out of that package? Express language written by  my Democratic colleagues saying that of the $20 billion, every Native  group in America gets some of that money, but this group--tens of  thousands of ANC members in Alaska--we are going to make sure they  don't get any of that.   That happened, right here on the Senate floor. I have no idea why.   Let me just pose a counterfactual. Imagine you had Congress say there  are two groups of minorities. Let's say not two groups but Asian  American minorities in New York, group A, group B--Congress categorized  them, not themselves--or African Americans, group A, group B; or  Hispanic Americans, group A, group B, in the State of New York--just in  the State of New York. And a Republican Congress said we are going to  do a giant relief package for that minority group across the country.  But, group B in New York, we are going to expressly exclude you from  getting any money.   What would you call that?   I would call that good old-fashioned racial discrimination.   If that happened, if a Republican Congress did that, to say a group  of African Americans or Hispanic Americans or Asian Americans, the New  York Times and the Washington Post would be going crazy--rightfully so,  by the way.   This happened. This happened.   OK, I don't know why. I would love it if one of my Senate colleagues  came down and said: Hey, Dan, here is why we went to great lengths to  exclude tens of thousands of Alaska Native indigenous people from  getting relief. Here is why we did that to you.   I would love for somebody to tell me that.   They haven't.   I think it is wrong. I think most people who know about it probably  would be like: Jeez, I didn't know we had $20 billion for Tribes, but  we specifically excluded this group. Was it because we were mad about  the Supreme Court case?    I don't know. But here is the thing. Back to the USICA bill, there is  a lot of money going to universities.    I am finishing up. So I am not going to yield. It is  important to me, to my colleague from Maryland.   There is a lot of money going to universities.   This is really important to me, and I have been wanting to give this  speech for a long time.   There is a lot of money going to institutions for research to compete  against China. There are specific provisions that say: Hey, there is  going to be money that goes to Native American groups. That is great.  They have a lot to bring to this battle with China.   But that provision that came over from the House--guess what it did.  It said: Not to this group. Not to this group.   So do you see where I am going with this?   I have no idea why Democrats in the House and Senate want to keep  targeting this group of indigenous people. Imagine if Republicans did  this to a minority group in Maryland or New York.   But it is happening, and it is happening even in this bill. So that  is another big concern I have of this bill, this continuation of--I  have no idea. I would love it for someone to come down and say: Hey,  Dan, here is why we discriminate against tens of thousands of  indigenous people in your State.   But it is happening. I sure hope my colleagues listen to this. Maybe  the New York Times or the Washington Post would write about it once.   But just a ceasefire--when we are trying to help Native people in  America, in Alaska we want to help them all. Remember, this is how  Congress set up these groups, not the people. So all I ask is let's  kind of do what we did  [[Page S3600]]  in the CARES Act for all legislation. But I and Senator Murkowski are  going to scrub every piece of darn legislation that comes out of here,  and we are going to start calling out people, asking: Why are you  discriminating against tens of thousands of people in my State who are  indigenous?   Wrong. It is inexplicable, and it is even in the darn bill to compete  with China. And I sure hope my colleagues will work with me to start  making sure this doesn't happen anymore.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
