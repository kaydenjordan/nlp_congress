 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate Mayor Allen Owen  and his almost 40 years of faithful service to a great city in Texas- 22, Missouri City.   Allen served as the mayor for the better part of 20 years. He always  led in a crisis, like the recovery from Hurricane Harvey, one Memorial  Day flood, and two tax day floods. He even cut the locks at a gas  station to give fuel to first responders during those floods.   Allen and his wife of 51 years, Jane, have raised three amazing kids  in Missouri City.   I will close with praise from a Texas icon, the great Texas  philosopher and the coach of the Houston Oilers, Bum Phillips:         Allen Owen may not be in a class by himself, but whatever       class he is in, it don't take long to call the roll.    Thank you, Al and Jane. May you always have fair winds and following  seas.                            ____________________
