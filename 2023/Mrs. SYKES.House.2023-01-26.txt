 Mr. Chairman, I rise today in opposition to H.R. 21, the  Strategic Production Response Act.   H.R. 21 is unnecessary, and it is harmful legislation that will have  devastating consequences for hardworking American families, and its  impact on our environment will resonate for generations to come.   My district is home to the Cuyahoga Valley National Park, which  receives more than 2.2 million visitors every year. Under H.R. 21, this  irreplaceable national park and others across the Nation could be  subjected to unnecessary oil and gas drilling, devastating ecosystems,  our environment, our economy, and our communities.    Our National Park System plays an essential role in the advancement  of our communities. They create jobs, strengthen the local economy,  contribute to local infrastructure development, and help to conserve  the natural environment, cultural assets, and traditions that we hold  dear.   H.R. 21 is not a comprehensive, strategic legislative undertaking  that puts the needs of hardworking Americans first; in fact, it does  the opposite. Therefore, Mr. Chairman, I cannot support this wholly  unnecessary and harmful legislation in its current form, and I urge my  colleagues on both sides of the aisle to vote ``no.''
