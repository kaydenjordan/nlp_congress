 Mr. Speaker, it has been almost 12 months since we reached  a new trade agreement with Mexico and Canada. Both Mexico and Canada  promptly ratified the agreement, but the House majority party refuses  to let us vote on it.   While it is a multinational agreement, the benefits will be felt  greatly in my home State of Indiana. Forty-seven percent of Indiana's  exports go to Mexico and Canada, generating $18 billion in revenue for  the Hoosier State. American workers need this. Hoosier workers need  this.   Speaker Pelosi, please, let's put partisan politics aside and do what  is best for Indiana, for our country, and for all of North America. It  is time to find the courage to bring this trade deal to the floor for a  vote.                            ____________________
