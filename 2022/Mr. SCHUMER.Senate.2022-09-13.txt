 Mr. President, I understand there is a bill at the desk  that is due for a second reading.    In order to place the bill on the calendar under the  provisions of rule XIV, I would object to further proceedings.    Mr. President, shortly after the news leaked that the  U.S. Supreme Court was ready to overturn Roe v. Wade, Leader McConnell  acknowledged that a Federal ban on abortion was now ``possible''--his  words. Well, later today, the senior Senator from South Carolina is  going to make good on Leader McConnell's warning by introducing a  radical bill to institute a nationwide restriction on abortions.   Proposals like the one today send a clear message from MAGA  Republicans to women across the country: your body, our choice. Rather  than expanding women's rights, MAGA Republicans would curtail them  rather than give individuals the freedom to make their own healthcare  choices. They hand that power over to radical politicians.   And let me add this. Republicans are twisting themselves into  pretzels trying to explain why they want nationwide abortion bans when  they said they would leave it up to the States. Even the senior Senator  from South Carolina said a few months ago that ``if the Supreme Court  overturns Roe v. Wade,'' it would mean that ``every state will decide  if abortion is legal and on what terms.'' And yet here he is,  introducing a bill to restrict abortions nationally.   For the hard right, this has never been about States' rights. This  has never been about letting Texas choose its own path while California  takes another. No, for MAGA Republicans this has always been about  making abortion illegal everywhere.   The contrast has become clear. While Democrats want to protect a  woman's freedom to choose, MAGA Republicans want to take that right  away with proposals to ban abortions, to punish women and doctors for  carrying out abortions, and even to push bans with no exceptions for  rape or incest.   We are seeing it play out across the country. It is chilling-- chilling--to the bone. Every single American should stand in opposition  against these radical MAGA Republican views.                            ____________________     Mr. President, now, on the IRA, this afternoon I will  join with my Senate Democratic colleagues at the White House to  celebrate the enactment of the Inflation Reduction Act  [[Page S4546]]  of 2022. When this bill passed the Senate a little over a month ago, I  expressed confidence that this legislation would signal a turning point  in our country's fight to lower costs, to meet our Nation's climate  challenges, and to usher in the era of affordable clean energy.   A month later, the good news is already pouring in. Companies like  Toyota have announced billions in new investments to start  manufacturing batteries for electric and hybrid vehicles right here in  America. Elsewhere, Honda and LG Energy have also recently announced  over $4 billion for EV battery production in the United States. And  recently, the CEO of First Solar said it was the Inflation Reduction  Act that provided the ``clarity'' needed to make their investments here  in America.   Had we not done this, many of these plants would have been built but  probably overseas. And yet, despite this record of success, despite the  fact that Democrats have told Republicans that this is opening a new  way for the future for American jobs with good futures here, not one  Republican voted in favor of this bill.   That is the difference between the two parties in a nutshell: While  MAGA Republicans are fixated on their extremist agenda, Democrats are  focused on creating jobs, lowering costs, bringing our country  together. While Democrats will join today with President Biden to  promote our job-creating agenda, Republicans will spend today  introducing new, radical legislation to ban abortions on the national  level, right here on the Senate floor. That is the contrast between the  parties, clear as day, and we know which side the American people are  on.   And while Democrats want to lower costs, increase prosperity, and  strengthen ladders to the middle class, the junior Senator from  Florida, who serves as the chief elections architect for Senate  Republicans, continues to promote tax hikes--tax hikes--for working  families and putting Medicare on the chopping block.   This split screen is unmistakable for all Americans to see for  themselves. Democrats will spend today focused on the job-creating,  inflation-fighting agenda we promised and delivered for the American  people, while Republicans continue defending tax hikes for the working  class while pushing national abortion bans here in the Senate. And the  American people will have no trouble deciding for themselves which  party is truly in their corner.                            ____________________     On judges, last night I moved to file cloture on the  nomination of Sarah Merriam to be U.S. circuit judge for the Second  Circuit. She will be the sixth circuit court judge this Chamber has  considered since the beginning of this work period--the sixth. She will  be in exceedingly good company.   Later today, we will vote on the nomination of Arianna Freeman to be  U.S. circuit judge for the Third Circuit, followed by cloture on the  nomination of Lara Montecalvo to serve on the First Circuit.   Altogether, the Senate has now confirmed 80--80--judicial nominations  to serve lifetime appointments on the Federal bench. I made clear that  confirming more of President Biden's judicial nominees would be a top  priority for Senate Democrats, and we are making good on our promise by  being on track to vote on six circuit court judges in the first 2 weeks  of this work period alone.   Among the judges confirmed this month are a number of notable firsts:  the first Latino to serve from the State of Washington to the Ninth  Circuit, the first Black Tennessean to ever sit on the Sixth Circuit,  and the first Asian American from anywhere to sit on the Seventh  Circuit. And that is just in the last 2 weeks.   The 80 jurists we have confirmed also include the first Native  American judge, the first Muslim American district judge, and the first  Black woman, of course, in the history of the U.S. Supreme Court. I  mention these firsts because even though it takes a lot to be a  successful jurist, representation is a key part of the equation.   There has been a lot of talk lately about the public's trust in our  courts--in my judgment, for very good reasons. So if our courts are to  long endure--to say nothing of our democracy--they must reflect the  rich vibrancy of our country.   So as we continue confirming judges, we will make sure that the  individuals on the bench meet this important standard. We have come a  very long way, but there is much work left to be done.                            ____________________     Mr. President, finally, on sepsis, I want to say a few  words on a health issue that rarely gets the attention it deserves here  on the Senate floor, and that is the issue of sepsis. Every year,  roughly 1.7 million Americans are infected with sepsis. That is a  population roughly the size of Phoenix, AZ. Of those, 270,000-- 270,000--are ultimately killed by the disease.   For those unfamiliar, sepsis is a terrible, life-threatening  condition where the body overreacts to an infection in an extreme way.  Most cases are preventable, if they are caught with enough time. Sadly,  because of a lack of public awareness, too many cases fly under the  radar until it is too late.   So today, I am here to introduce a resolution designating September  13 as National Sepsis Day. It would encourage greater public education  about this condition, urge Federal entities to streamline treatment  guidelines, and marshal our resources to ultimately bring sepsis to an  end.   The Federal Government has a great model to follow in my home State  of New York, which adopted Rory's Regulations to guide health officials  when it comes to this illness named in honor of Rory Staunton, a 12- year-old from Queens who died from sepsis 10 years ago. These rules  have undoubtedly saved countless lives and should inform Federal  policy.   I cannot imagine the profound suffering that Rory's parents must feel  to this day, but I hope they find strength in knowing that the rules  bearing their son's name have gone a long way to help others.   It is time we take this disease seriously at the Federal level. For  that reason, I am proud to introduce this resolution today.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, I enter a motion to reconsider.
