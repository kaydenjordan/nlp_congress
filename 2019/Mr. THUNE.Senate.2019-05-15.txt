 Mr. President, I want to join with my colleague, the  senior Senator from Missouri, and congratulate the junior Senator from  Missouri on some wonderful remarks.   I came into the Congress with Senator Blunt from the House of  Representatives over 20 years ago, which I guess makes us the old guys  around here, but it warms my heart and gives me great hope for the  future to see the caliber and the quality of people who are entering  public life in the form of people like Senator Hawley.   He is somebody who not only brings great intellect, great passion,  and great conviction, but he is a principled leader who is here for the  right reasons and profoundly wants to make a difference for the future  of this country. In his remarks, he touched upon the genius of our  Founders, and that is that average Americans--working men and women in  this country--have an opportunity to make a difference with their  voices and with their votes by entering the public arena and being a  part of our democracy. That is really what this is all about. That is  what our work should be about every day, is empowering them to do a  better job in raising their families and serving their communities.   I certainly look forward to continuing our work with the new Senator  from Missouri and with the rest of our colleagues here as we embark  upon that task. I hope we can be successful in restoring that vision  our Founders had for what this country should be and in each day waking  up and thinking about the fact that it is not about us; it is about  what we do to secure a better and brighter future consistent with that  brilliant past we have been so blessed by because of those who have  come before and have been willing to enter public life and make a  difference.   So thank you and congratulations to Senator Hawley. It is a great  honor to  [[Page S2851]]  serve with you, and we look forward to working with you in the days and  weeks and months ahead to serve the very people you talked about in  your remarks.
