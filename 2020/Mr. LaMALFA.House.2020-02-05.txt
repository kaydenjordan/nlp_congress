 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize Einar Maisch  for his 34 years of service to the Placer County Water Agency. Water  resiliency and infrastructure are pressing needs in northern  California, and Einar has devoted his career to solving these critical  issues.   As general manager, he worked to make PCWA the local leader in water  rights by overseeing the clear and transparent budget process,  increasing customer accessibility to the agency, and expanding its  regional and national influence on water issues.   Throughout his long tenure, Einar has always prioritized the needs  and interests of the customers and the community. His work will leave a  lasting impact on water planning, resiliency, and management in  northern California for decades come, and the north State is very  thankful for all Einar has done.   Madam Speaker, I thank Einar, and I wish him the best of luck in his  much-deserved and probably busier retirement. May he keep his knowledge  and experience available to all of us.                            ____________________
