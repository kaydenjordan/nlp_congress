 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass  the bill (S. 2796) to amend the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets  Act of 1968 to provide for the eligibility of rural community response  pilot programs for funding under the Comprehensive Opioid Abuse Grant  Program, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  S. 2796         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Rural Opioid Abuse       Prevention Act''.       SEC. 2. ELIGIBILITY OF RURAL COMMUNITY RESPONSE PILOT                     PROGRAMS FOR FUNDING UNDER THE COMPREHENSIVE                     OPIOID ABUSE GRANT PROGRAM.         Section 3021 of title I of the Omnibus Crime Control and       Safe Streets Act of 1968 (34 U.S.C. 10701) is amended--        (1) in subsection (a)(1)--        (A) in subparagraph (F), by striking ``and'';        (B) in subparagraph (G), by striking the period at the end       and inserting ``; and''; and        (C) by adding at the end the following:        ``(H) a pilot program for rural areas to implement       community response programs that focus on reducing opioid       overdose deaths, which may include presenting alternatives to       incarceration, as described in subsection (f).''; and        (2) by adding at the end the following:        ``(f) Rural Pilot Program.--        ``(1) In general.--The pilot program described under this       subsection shall make grants to rural areas to implement       community response programs to reduce opioid overdose deaths.       Grants issued under this subsection shall be jointly operated       by units of local government, in collaboration with public       safety and public health agencies or public safety, public       health and behavioral health collaborations. A community       response program under this subsection shall identify gaps in       community prevention, treatment, and recovery services for       individuals who encounter the criminal justice system and       shall establish treatment protocols to address identified       shortcomings. The Attorney General, through the Office of       Justice Programs, shall increase the amount provided as a       grant under this section for a pilot program by no more than       five percent for each of the two years following       certification by the Attorney General of the submission of       data by the rural area on the prescribing of schedules II,       III, and IV controlled substances to a prescription drug       monitoring program, or any other centralized database       administered by an authorized State agency, which includes       tracking the dispensation of such substances, and providing       for interoperability and data sharing with each other such       program (including an electronic health records system) in       each other State, and with any interstate entity that shares       information between such programs.        ``(2) Rules of construction.--Nothing in this subsection       shall be construed to--        ``(A) direct or encourage a State to use a specific       interstate data sharing program; or        ``(B) limit or prohibit the discretion of a prescription       drug monitoring program for interoperability connections to       other programs (including electronic health records systems,       hospital systems, pharmacy dispensing systems, or health       information exchanges).''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and insert extraneous material on S. 2796.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, let me acknowledge that this legislation is from Senator  Jon Ossoff. I know how important these issues are to him. At the very  beginning, I thank him for his leadership. We have worked together as  members of the Judiciary Committee, he in the Senate and myself in the  House. I applaud him and look forward to more work on this constructive  approach to drug use.   S. 2796, the Rural Opioid Abuse Prevention Act of 2022, is bipartisan  legislation that would establish a pilot program for rural communities  within the Comprehensive Opioid Abuse Grant Program.   The pilot program would make grants to rural areas to implement  community response programs in order to reduce opioid overdose deaths.  These community response programs would involve collaborations between  public safety, public health, and behavioral health systems. The  program will seek to identify gaps in current treatment availability  and establish treatment programs to reduce opioid overdoses in rural  areas.   Data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National  Center for Health Statistics indicates that in 2021 there were an  estimated 107,622 drug overdose deaths. The data also shows overdose  deaths, including opioids, increased from an estimated 70,029 in 2020  to 80,816 in 2021.   Mr. Speaker, what compounds this, as I proceed in my debate here  today, is that, just this morning, I read an article that says Texas  rural hospitals are closing by the dozens, impacted by the pandemic and  lack of personnel. We have an emerging, surging, if you will, synergism  of default: individuals who need care, can't get care, and hospitals in  rural communities that are closing.   With more than 200 Americans still dying of drug overdoses each day,  it is even more important that we pass this critical legislation to get  in the way, if you will.   In my hometown of Houston, overdose deaths have been exacerbated by  strained access to treatment caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Opioid  overdose deaths have increased throughout the State of Texas, rising  from 4,154 deaths in 2020 to 4,831 deaths in 2021.   When we wanted to get the antidote to opioid, unfortunately, we  couldn't get State funding. Police officers and recovery entities, they  just couldn't get it because there was a philosophical disbelief that  that had anything to do with some of the dangerous drugs out there to  be able to help some of those who are in need.   S. 2796 would enable local communities and community organizations to  develop and expand initiatives targeting rural and low-resource  communities. Eligible applicants of the grant program would be required  to have a documented history of providing services in rural communities  or regions highly impacted by substance use disorder.   The programs supported by this legislation would be able to identify  gaps in treatment access for rural communities, leverage Federal  resources to expand treatment options, and ensure rural and remote  communities are not forgotten in our effort to address the ongoing  impact of opioid abuse disorder across the country. The point that  should be made is that rural communities are north, south, east, and  west.   Building on the successful Comprehensive Opioid Abuse Grant Program,  this bipartisan bill would expand it to include a pilot program  targeting rural communities.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Lamb and Senator Ossoff for  introducing this important legislation. I urge all of my colleagues to  support the bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Let me, first of all, again acknowledge Senator Ossoff and  Congressman Lamb. This is an important piece of legislation, but my  good friend knows that I am going to have to add to this discussion by  saying that, again, the question of fentanyl, no one wants to see that  proliferated and causing the disastrous conditions that we have.   But listen to the story of Ms. Alfaro, who was 19 years old. She  lived in Appleton, Wisconsin, and ``was a recent high school graduate  raising a toddler and considering joining the Army when she and a  friend bought what they thought was the antianxiety drug Xanax in  December 2020.''   The pills were fake and contained fentanyl, an opioid that can be 50  times more powerful.   One of the things that we should understand is fentanyl is  everywhere, and it has been determined that most of the fentanyl that  comes across the border is brought over by U.S. citizens.   The other aspect that is very important that doesn't specifically  cover this bill, but at least this bill provides what the mother  indicated, she didn't know anything about these drugs. She wished she  could have helped her daughter. Yes, her daughter did lose her life.   The point this legislation is making is let's provide information to  these rural communities, but also let's understand some of the  techniques that some States and local communities were not providing  law enforcement or anyone else. Certainly, that is the fentanyl test  strips and Narcan. That  [[Page H8747]]  certainly was a problem and continues to be a problem in the State of  Texas.   We have to look at this holistically, and I think this legislation  focuses, certainly, on getting families information, particularly in  the rural areas. This was Appleton, Wisconsin. At least, minimally,  there would have been information about this, maybe in a broader way,  because the mother of the 19-year-old said, ``Two years ago, I knew  nothing about this.''   We have to do a better job of telling the facts about fentanyl that  we all want to see be extinguished from causing the loss of life.   I think this legislation for rural communities is a very good start,  but we need to make sure that our facts are accurate as we talk about  this deadly drug, which we want to get off the streets of this Nation.  We need to find ways that can be very effective, and we need to keep  working.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to offer a number of articles that speak to  the importance of this legislation. I thank the gentleman from Iowa for  his comments in support, and I know that the gentleman from Ohio will  likewise, hopefully, join us.   It is important to speak the obvious. U.S. overdose deaths in 2021  increased half as much as in 2020 but are still up. We know that we  need legislation specifically in communities in rural areas that would  close or identify the gaps in prevention, treatment, and recovery  services for individuals who interact with the criminal justice system  in rural areas and create new efforts to address the opioid crisis.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record an article from the Centers for  Disease Control's National Center for Health Statistics.    [From the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, May 11, 2022]  U.S. Overdose Deaths in 2021 Increased Half as Much as in 2020--But Are                            Still Up 15 Percent         Provisional data from CDC's National Center for Health       Statistics indicate there were an estimated 107,622 drug       overdose deaths in the United States during 2021, an increase       of nearly 15 percent from the 93,655 deaths estimated in       2020. The 2021 increase was half of what it was a year ago,       when overdose deaths rose 30 percent from 2019 to 2020.        The data is featured in an interactive web data       visualization. The 2021 data presented in this visualization       are provisional--they are incomplete and subject to change.        The new data show overdose deaths involving opioids       increased from an estimated 70,029 in 2020 to 80,816 in 2021.       Overdose deaths from synthetic opioids (primarily fentanyl),       psychostimulants such as methamphetamine, and cocaine also       continued to increase in 2021 compared to 2020.        The biggest percentage increase in overdose deaths in 2021       occurred in Alaska, where deaths were up 75.3 percent, while       overdose deaths in Wyoming did not increase at all in 2021       and deaths in Hawaii declined 1.8 percent from the same point       in 2020. The visualization includes:        Reported and predicted (estimated) provisional counts of       deaths due to drug overdose occurring nationally and in each       jurisdiction.        U.S. map of the percentage changes in provisional drug       overdose deaths for the 12-month period ending in December       2021 compared with the 12-month period ending in December       2020, by jurisdiction.        Reported and predicted provisional counts of drug overdose       deaths involving specific drugs or drug classes occurring       nationally and in selected jurisdictions.        NCHS releases both reported and predicted provisional drug       overdose death counts each month. They represent the numbers       of these deaths due to drug overdose occurring in the 12-      month periods ending in the month indicated. These counts       include all seasons of the year and are insensitive to       variations by seasonality. Deaths are reported by the       jurisdiction in which the death occurred.     Mr. Speaker, I think it is important to emphasize  that, really, treatment works, and this is an example. ``Thomas Gooch  has spent more than 30 years struggling with illegal drugs. The 52- year-old Nashville, Tennessee, native grew up in extreme poverty. He  was first incarcerated in 1988 and spent the next 15 years in and out  of jail for using and selling narcotics. `Until 2003,' Gooch says.  `That was the first time I went to treatment and the last time I  used.'''   This has to also be a component, which is the treatment of  individuals whose conditions put them in this way.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record ``The Opioid Epidemic Is Surging  Among Black People Because of Unequal Access to Treatment.''                  [From Scientific American, Dec. 1, 2022]   The Opioid Epidemic Is Surging Among Black People Because of Unequal                            Access to Treatment                 (By Melba Newsome and Gioncarlo Valentine)         In one way or another, Thomas Gooch has spent more than 30       years struggling with illegal drugs. The 52-year-old       Nashville, Tenn., native grew up in extreme poverty. He was       first incarcerated in 1988 and spent the next 15 years in and       out of jail for using and selling narcotics. ``Until 2003,''       Gooch says. ``That was the first time I went to treatment and       the last time I used.'' Since then, for most of 19 years,       Gooch has been trying to get others into recovery or just       keep them alive. He handed out clean needles and injection-      drug equipment--which reduce injuries, infections and       overdose deaths--in Nashville's hardest-hit communities. In       2014 he founded My Father's House, a transitional recovery       facility for fathers struggling with substance use disorder.        But despite Gooch's long experience, the opioid epidemic       recently has brought a level of devastation to the Black       community that has shocked him. ``I had never seen death the       way I've seen death when it comes to opioid addiction,'' he       says. ``There's been so many funerals, it doesn't even make       sense. I personally know at least 50 to 60 individuals who       died from overdoses in the last 10 years.'' That staggering       body count includes Gooch's recently estranged wife in 2020       and a former partner in 2019.        A million people in the U.S. have died of opioid overdoses       since the 1990s. But the face--and race--of the opioid       epidemic has changed in the past decade. Originally white and       middle class, victims are now Black and brown people       struggling with long-term addictions and too few resources.       During 10 brutal years, opioid and stimulant deaths have       increased 575 percent among Black Americans. In 2019 the       overall drug overdose death rate among Black people exceeded       that of whites for the first time: 36.8 versus 31.6 per       100,000. And with the addition of fentanyl, the synthetic       opioid that's 50 to 100 times more powerful than morphine,       Black men older than 55 who survived for decades with a       heroin addiction are dying at rates four times greater than       people of other races in that age group.        The reasons for this dramatic change come down to racial       inequities. Research shows that Black people have a harder       time getting into treatment programs than white people do,       and Black people are less likely to be prescribed the gold       standard medications for substance use therapy. ``If you are       a Black person and have an opioid use disorder, you are       likely to receive treatment five years later than if you're a       white person,'' says Nora D. Volkow, director of the National       Institute on Drug Abuse at the National Institutes of Health.       ``Treatments are extraordinarily useful in terms of       preventing overdose death so you can actually recover. Five       years can make the difference between being alive or not.''       Black people with substance use problems are afraid of being       caught up in a punitive criminal justice system and are less       likely to have insurance good enough to allow them to seek       help on their own. And the COVID pandemic disrupted many       recovery and harm-reduction services, particularly for people       of color.        Gooch blames straight-out racial discrimination in the       health-care system, too. ``When we call different places to       try to get people into treatment, the question they ask is       `What drug do they use?' '' he recounts with  [[Page H8748]]       exasperation. ``If you say `crack,' all of a sudden they       ain't got no bed available. If you say opioids and heroin,       they will find a bed because that's the demographic they       want. A couple of times I told patients that the only way       they're going to get help is to get drunk and turn themselves       into Vanderbilt Hospital because Vanderbilt will hold them       for five days, and that'll get them into treatment.''        Gooch is one of the people trying to improve access to       therapies for addiction and change the overall dysfunctional       dynamic. Other groups are bringing more effective addiction       treatments within prison walls, reducing the chances of       recidivism on release. A proposed federal law would make       therapy with the commonly used addiction medication methadone       less onerous for an impoverished population, as well as less       stigmatizing. And Volkow is using her platform at the NIH to       highlight the overwhelming research-based evidence for better       ways to understand and treat addiction.                             ACCESS TO TREATMENT         The nation's historic reluctance to treat addiction as a       health-care issue rather than a criminal justice one has       resulted in a health-care system where too few people of any       race--just 10 percent--receive treatment for substance use       disorder. Several factors, such as stigma and an inability to       afford or access care, make the numbers considerably more       dismal among people of color. Even after a nonfatal overdose,       Black patients are half as likely to be referred to or access       treatment as non-Hispanic white patients, according to       federal government data.        A growing recognition that criminalization and       incarceration do little to curb illegal drug use or improve       public health or safety has led to harm-reduction policies       such as Good Samaritan laws--statutes that provide limited       immunity for low-level drug violations and increase       availability of naloxone, a drug that can reverse overdose.       But racial disparities have emerged in the application and       effectiveness of both measures. A study from RTI       International found that Black and Latino intravenous drug       users have inequitable access to the medication.        Loftin Wilson, program manager for the NC Harm Reduction       Coalition in Durham, N.C., who has worked in the field for       more than a decade, says the problems with inequality lead to       distrust in the system, which creates a vicious cycle in       which people who need help won't go to institutions that can       provide help. People entering treatment worry, with good       reason, that dealing with the social service system can cause       them to lose their employment, housing or even custody of       their children. ``That's another example of the negative       experiences people who use drugs have. They definitely don't       land equally on everybody, and people don't experience them       all the same way. It is a vastly different experience to be a       Black drug user seeking health care than for a white       person,'' Wilson says        University of Cincinnati psychologist Kathleen Burlew       notes, as Volkow does, that when Black patients enter       treatment, they are more likely to do so later than white       people and are less likely to complete it. In addition to       mistrust, she says, the less favorable outcomes result from       factors such as clinician bias and lack of racial and ethnic       diversity among treatment providers.        Federal resources, such as grants to support local opioid       use disorder clinics and programs, also tend to favor white       populations. According to 2021 data from the Substance Abuse       and Mental Health Services Administration, 77 percent of the       clients treated with grant funding were white, 12.9 percent       were Black and 2.8 percent were Native American. The       disparity is even more pronounced in some states. For       example, in 2019 North Carolina announced that white people       made up 88 percent of those served by its $54-million federal       grant, compared with 7.5 percent for Black people. Native       Americans accounted for less than 1 percent of those served.                            MEDICATION INEQUALITY         Research has shown that there is a bias among health-care       providers against using medication-assisted treatment (MAT),       which combines FDA-approved drugs with counseling and       behavioral therapies. Substance use specialists consider it       the best approach to the opioid use problem. Yet a study       published in JAMA Network found that about 40 percent of the       368 U.S. residential drug programs surveyed did not offer       MAT, and 21 percent actively discouraged people from using       it. Many addiction treatment programs are faith-based and see       addiction as a moral problem, which leads to the conclusion       that relying on medication for abstinence or sobriety simply       trades one form of addiction for another. Many general       practitioners who lack training in addiction medicine have       this misconception.        The three medications approved by the FDA are       buprenorphine, methadone and naltrexone. Buprenorphine and       methadone are synthetic opioids that block brain opioid       receptors and reduce both cravings and withdrawal. Naltrexone       is a postdetox monthly injectable that blocks the effects of       opioids. Very few insurance providers in the U.S. cover all       three medications, and according to the Centers for Disease       Control and Prevention, the full range of medications is far       less available to Black people.        Research suggests that economics and race influence who       receives which medications. Buprenorphine, for instance, is       more widely available in counties with predominantly white       communities, whereas methadone clinics are usually located in       poor communities of color.        To use methadone, patients must make daily visits to a       clinic to receive and take the medication under the       supervision of a practitioner. This requirement makes it       difficult to do things that build a normal life, such as       attending school and obtaining and maintaining a job. There       is also the stigma of standing in a public line known to       everyone passing by as a queue for addiction treatment. ``The       treatment model was developed [during the Nixon       administration] based on racism and a stigmatized view of       people with addiction without any thought of privacy or       dignity or treating addiction like a health problem,'' says       Andrew Kolodny, medical director of the Opioid Policy       Research Collaborative at Brandeis University. The stigma is       made worse by methadone's classification as a Schedule II       controlled substance, which is defined as a substance with a       high potential for abuse, potentially leading to severe       psychological or physical dependence. This categorization       pushed the medication into a quasicriminalized status and the       clinics into minority communities.        Buprenorphine, however, is a completely different story.       When opioid use problems increased in white communities,       Congress acted to create less stigmatizing treatment options.       The Drug Addiction Treatment Act of 2000 (``DATA 2000'')       lifted an 86-year ban that prevented treating opioid       addiction with narcotic medications such as buprenorphine,       which today is sold under the brand names Subutex and       Suboxone. The majority of doctors who got special federal       licenses to prescribe it accept only commercial health       insurance and cash, so the drug is usually offered to a more       affluent population, which in the U.S. means white people.       About 95 percent of buprenorphine patients are white, and 34       percent have private insurance, according to a national study       of data through 2015.        John Woodyear is an addiction treatment specialist in Troy,       a small rural town in south central North Carolina where the       epidemic is exacting an increasingly heavy toll on the Black       and Native American populations. Overall overdose death rates       increased 40 percent from 2019 to 2020, but death rates among       those two groups in particular went up 66 and 93 percent,       respectively. Yet Woodyear, who is Black and practices in a       town that is 31 percent Black, says his patients are 90       percent white. People come to the clinic through word of       mouth or referrals from friends. As long as Woodyear's       patients are mostly white, new patients will be mostly white       as well, he says.        One exception to this racial pattern is Edwin Chapman's       clinic in the Northeast neighborhood of Washington, D.C., one       of the district's predominantly Black and most impoverished       communities. Chapman, a physician, often prescribes       buprenorphine to his patients with opioid use problems, and       the overwhelming majority of them are Black. He says that to       prescribe the drug, physicians like him must get past certain       roadblocks. ``The insurance companies in many states put more       restrictions on patients in an urban setting, such as       requiring prior authorization for addiction treatment,'' he       says. Further, ``to increase the dose above 16 or 24       milligrams, you may have to get a prior authorization. The       dosing standards were based on the white population and       people who were addicted to pills. Our surviving Black       population often needs a higher dose of buprenorphine.''        Chapman says few physicians in private practice are willing       to treat these patients. ``They don't really feel comfortable       having these patients in their office, or they aren't really       prepared to deal with the economic and mental health issues       that come with this population,'' he explains; those       disorders include bipolar disorder and schizophrenia, among       others.        People have their own biases that keep them away from       medication such as buprenorphine, Wilson says. Many view it       as simply trading one drug for another. ``They think, `If I'm       going to take this step, why not just go to detox and not       take any medications at all' '' he says. ``There's a big       cultural misunderstanding about the fact that [these]       medications are the only evidence-based treatment for (opioid       use disorder. Short-term detox isn't the most appropriate       intervention for most people.''        Gooch agrees that the bias is real. He facilitates recovery       groups at a program operated by a group from Meharry Medical       College, a historically Black institution. Yet ``I haven't       seen one Black person yet,'' Gooch says. ``Some think it's a       setup. There's so much distrust, they have a hard time       thinking it's legal. It's just the culture of Black people.       Many are religious and think [taking the drug] is wrong.''        ``Those [misconceptions] are holdovers from our having been       miseducated from the outset,'' Chapman says. ``Whites have       done a tremendous job educating their community that this is       a medical problem, a disease. In the African American       community, drug addiction has always been and continues to be       seen as a moral problem, and incarceration was the       treatment.''                               HOPE FOR CHANGE         In the November 2021 issue of Neuropsychopharmacology,       Volkow argued that it is long past time for a new approach to       drug addiction that would address these misconceptions within       the most affected populations  [[Page H8749]]       and biases among providers. ``We have known for decades that       addiction is a medical condition--a treatable brain       disorder--not a character flaw or a form of social       deviance,'' she wrote.        Volkow argues that treatment reform should start with       prison and the criminal justice system. Even though there is       no difference along racial lines in who uses illegal drugs,       Black people nonetheless were arrested for drug offenses at       five times the rate of white people in 2016. The racial       disproportionality in incarcerated drug offenders does not       reflect higher rates of drug law violations, only higher       rates of arrest among racial and ethnic minorities. Currently       the number of arrests for heroin (which more Black people       use) exceeds the arrests for diverted prescription opioids       (which more white people use), even though the latter is more       prevalent.        These unequal arrests and incarcerations add to the racial       inequalities in drug treatment and survival rates. An       estimated two thirds of people in U.S. correctional settings       have a diagnosable substance use disorder, and approximately       95 percent will relapse after their release. In the two weeks       postrelease, the risk of overdose increases more than 100-      fold, and the chances of death increase 12-fold.        Paradoxically, that makes prisons and jails--institutions       with the most obvious and overt racial disparities--the       places with the greatest potential to bring about effective       change. Volkow points to a recent NIH study as proof that       starting substance disorder treatment during incarceration       lowers the risk of probation violations and reincarcerations       and improves the chances of recovery. But only one in 13       prisoners with substance use problems receives treatment,       according to a Pew data analysis.        Some local programs have started to tackle some of these       issues. In Pittsburgh, the Allegheny Health Network's RIvER       (Rethinking Incarceration and Empowering Recovery) Clinic       opened in May 2021. Its goal is to reduce recidivism among       people with addictions by providing care for the formerly       incarcerated immediately on their release from jail,       regardless of their ability to pay. Since opening, the       clinic's caregivers have engaged with hundreds of people.        New York City recently became the first municipality in the       country to sanction overdose prevention centers where people       with substance use disorder can use drugs under medical       supervision. Two sites, one in East Harlem and the other in       Washington Heights, opened in December 2021. They have had       more than 10,000 visits and prevented nearly 200 overdoses by       administering the medication naloxone.        There are other signs of change, too. California signed a       law that requires every treatment provider in the state to       provide a ``client bill of rights'' to notify patients of all       aspects of recommended treatment, including no treatment at       all, treatment risks and expected results. And federal       authorities loosened methadone regulations during the       pandemic. Instead of daily in-person visits, more patients       were allowed to use telehealth consultations and take doses       home. Senators Ed Markey of Massachusetts and Rand Paul of       Kentucky have introduced a bill that would make that change       permanent. Among other programs and initiatives across the       country, these are an indication that drug treatment policy       may be headed in a more equitable, evidence-based direction.     Mr. Speaker, I also include in the Record the  article regarding the tragic young lady who died in Appleton,  Wisconsin, and even now give sympathy to that family and make sure that  we have the basic facts.   ``Advocates warn that some of the alarms being sounded by politicians  and officials are wrong and potentially dangerous. Among those ideas:  that tightening control of the U.S.-Mexico border would stop the flow  of the drugs, though experts say the key to reining in the crisis is  reducing drug demand.''   She was looking for Xanax. Someone made phony Xanax, and then  fentanyl was in it. That is just heartbreaking. It is tragic. We have  to know where to spend our resources.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record this article: ``Myths about  fentanyl persist as opioid continues to cause overdose deaths.''                  [From the PBS News Hour, Oct. 28, 2022]    Myths About Fentanyl Persist as Opioid Continues To Cause Overdose                                   Deaths         Lillianna Alfaro was a recent high school graduate raising       a toddler and considering joining the Army when she and a       friend bought what they thought was the anti-anxiety drug       Xanax in December 2020.        The pills were fake and contained fentanyl, an opioid that       can be 50 times as powerful as the same amount of heroin. It       killed them both.        ``Two years ago, I knew nothing about this,'' said Holly       Groelle, the mother of 19-year-old Alfaro, who lived in       Appleton, Wisconsin. ``I felt bad because it was something I       could not have warned her about because I didn't know.''        The drug that killed her daughter was rare a decade ago,       but fentanyl and other lab-produced synthetic opioids now are       driving an overdose crisis deadlier than any the U.S. has       ever seen. Last year, overdoses from all drugs claimed more       than 100,000 lives for the first time, and the deaths this       year have remained at nearly the same level--more than gun       and auto deaths combined.        The federal government counted more accidental overdose       deaths in 2021 alone than it did in the 20-year period from       1979 through 1998. Overdoses in recent years have been many       times more frequent than they were during the black tar       heroin epidemic that led President Richard Nixon to launch       his War on Drugs or during the cocaine crisis in the 1980s.        As fentanyl gains attention, mistaken beliefs persist about       the drug, how it is trafficked and why so many people are       dying.        Experts believe deaths surged not only because the drugs       are so powerful, but also because fentanyl is laced into so       many other illicit drugs, and not because of changes in how       many people are using. In the late 2010s--the most recent       period for which federal data is available--deaths were       skyrocketing even as the number of people using opioids was       dropping.        Advocates warn that some of the alarms being sounded by       politicians and officials are wrong and potentially       dangerous. Among those ideas: that tightening control of the       U.S.-Mexico border would stop the flow of the drugs, though       experts say the key to reining in the crisis is reducing drug       demand; that fentanyl might turn up in kids' trick-or-treat       baskets this Halloween; and that merely touching the drug       briefly can be fatal--something that researchers found untrue       and that advocates worry can make first responders hesitate       about giving lifesaving treatment.        All three ideas were brought up this month in an online       video billed as a pre-Halloween public service announcement       from a dozen Republican U.S. senators.        A report this year from a bipartisan federal commission       found that fentanyl and similar drugs are being made mostly       in labs in Mexico from chemicals shipped primarily from       China.        In New England, fentanyl has largely replaced the supply of       heroin. Across the country, it's being laced into drugs such       as cocaine and methamphetamine, sometimes with deadly       results. And in cases like Alfaro's, it's being mixed in       Mexico or the U.S. with other substances and pressed into       pills meant to look like other drugs.        The U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency has warned that fentanyl       is being sold in multicolored pills and powders--sometimes       referred to as ``rainbow fentanyl''--marketed on social media       to teens and young adults.        Jon DeLena, the agency's associate special agent in charge,       said at the National Crime Prevention Council summit on       fentanyl in Washington this month that there's ``no direct       information that Halloween is specifically being targeted or       young people are being targeted for Halloween,'' but that       hasn't kept that idea from spreading.        Joel Best, an emeritus sociology professor at the       University of Delaware, said that idea falls in with a long       line of Halloween-related scares. He has examined cases since       1958 and has not found a single instance of a child dying       because of something foreign put into Halloween candy--and       few instances of that being done at all.        ``If you give a dose of fentanyl to kids in elementary       school, you have an excellent chance of killing them,'' he       said. ``If you do addict them, what are you going to do, try       to take their lunch money? No one is trying to addict little       kids to fentanyl.''        In midterm election campaigns, fentanyl is not getting as       much attention as issues such as inflation and abortion. But       Republicans running for offices including governor and U.S.       Senate in Arkansas, New Mexico and Pennsylvania have framed       the fentanyl crisis as a result of Democrats being lax about       securing the Mexican border or soft on crime as part of a       broader campaign assertion that Democrats foster lawlessness.        And when Democrats highlight the overdose crisis in       campaigns this year, it has often been to tout their roles in       forging settlements to hold drugmakers and distributors       responsible.        Relying heavily on catching fentanyl at the border would be       futile, experts say, because it's easy to move in small,       hard-to-detect quantities.        ``I don't think that reducing the supply is going to be the       answer because it's so easy to mail,'' said Adam Wandt, an       assistant professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice.        Still, some more efforts are planned on the U.S.-Mexico       border, including increasing funding to search more vehicles       crossing ports of entry. The bipartisan commission found       those crossings are where most fentanyl arrives in the       country.        The commission is calling for many of the measures that       other advocates want to see, including better coordination of       the federal response, targeted enforcement, and measures to       prevent overdoses for those who use drugs.        The federal government has been funding efforts along those       lines. It also publicizes big fentanyl seizures by law       enforcement, though it's believed that even the largest busts       make small dents in the national drug supply.        The commission stopped short of calling for increased       penalties for selling fentanyl. Bryce Pardo, associate       director of the RAND Drug Policy Research Center and a       commission staff member, said such a measure would not likely       deter the drug trade. But, he said, dealers who sell the       products most likely to cause death--such as mixing  [[Page H8750]]       fentanyl into cocaine or pressing it into fake Xanax could be       targeted effectively.        One California father who lost his 20-year-old daughter is       pushing for prosecutors to file murder charges against those       who supply fatal doses. Matt Capelouto's daughter Alexandra       died from half a pill she bought from a dealer she found on       social media in 2019, while home in Temecula, California,       during a college break. She was told the pill was oxycodone,       Capelouto said, but it contained fentanyl.        The dealer was charged with distributing fentanyl resulting       in death, but he reached a plea deal on a lesser drug charge       and will face up to 20 years in prison.        ``It's not that arresting and convicting and putting these       guys behind bars doesn't work,'' Capelouto said. ``The fact       is we don't do it enough to make a difference.''        While some people killed by fentanyl have no idea they're       taking it, others, particularly those with opioid use       disorder, know it is or could be in the mix. But they may not       know how much is in their drugs.        That was the case for Susan Ousterman's son Tyler Cordiero,       who died at 24 in 2020 from a mixture that included fentanyl       after years of using heroin and other opioids.        For nearly two years, Ousterman avoided going by the gas       station near their home in Bensalem, Pennsylvania, where her       son fatally overdosed. But in August, she went to leave two       things there: naloxone, a drug used to reverse overdoses, and       a poster advertising a hotline for people using drugs to call       so the operator could call for help if they become       unresponsive.        Ousterman is funneling her anger and sorrow into preventing       other overdoses.        ``Fentanyl is everywhere,'' she said. ``You don't know       what's in an unregulated drug supply. You don't know what       you're taking. You're always taking the chance of dying every       time.''     Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1545     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   I thank the gentleman from Ohio for his work on this bill and  indicate that we are pleased to, likewise, support and thank  Congressman Lamb and the gentleman from Georgia, Senator Ossoff, for  introducing this legislation.   I urge all of my colleagues to support this bill, as well, and to  ensure that we provide really deep collaboration in our rural  communities to help people who don't have access either to this kind of  treatment, knowledge or prevention, and then, as I indicated, to  medical care because hospitals are closing.   This is an important legislative initiative. I am hoping that we will  support the Rural Opioid Abuse Prevention Act because it is bipartisan  legislation. It is time for our Nation to face the increased overall  overdoses and deaths in everyday communities large and small.   With more than 200 Americans dying of drug overdoses each day,  Congress must act to support small and rural communities in addressing  this crisis.   Mr. Speaker, S. 2796, the ``Rural Opioid Abuse Prevention Act of  2022,'' is bipartisan legislation that would establish a pilot program  for rural communities within the Comprehensive Opioid Abuse Grant  Program.   The pilot program would make grants to rural areas to implement  community response programs in order to reduce opioid overdose deaths.  These community response programs would involve collaborations between  public safety, public health, and behavioral health systems. The pilot  programs would seek to identify gaps in current treatment availability  and establish treatment programs to reduce opioid overdoses in rural  areas.   Data from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention's National  Center for Health Statistics indicates that in 2021 there were an  estimated 107,622 drug overdose deaths. The data also shows overdose  deaths involving opioids increased from an estimated 70,029 in 2020 to  80,816 in 2021.   With more than 200 Americans still dying of drug overdoses each day,  it is even more important that we pass this critical legislation. In my  hometown of Houston, overdose deaths have been exacerbated by strained  access to treatment caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Opioid overdose  deaths have increased throughout the state of Texas, rising from 4,154  deaths in 2020 to 4,831 deaths in 2021.   S. 2796 would enable local governments and community organizations to  develop and expand initiatives targeting rural and low resourced  communities. Eligible applicants of the grant program would be required  to have a documented history of providing services to rural communities  or regions highly impacted by substance use disorder. The programs  supported by this legislation would be able to identify gaps in  treatment access for rural communities, leverage federal resources to  expand treatment options, and ensure rural and remote communities are  not forgotten in our efforts to address the ongoing impact of opioid  abuse disorder across the country.   Building on the successful Comprehensive Opioid Abuse Grant Program,  this bipartisan bill would expand it to include a pilot program  targeting rural communities.   I want to thank Congressman Lamb and Senator Ossoff for introducing  this important legislation. I urge all of my colleagues to support the  bill.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass  the bill (S. 4834) to reauthorize the National Internet Crimes Against  Children Task Force Program.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  S. 4834         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Providing Resources,       Officers, and Technology to Eradicate Cyber Threats to Our       Children Act of 2022'' or the ``PROTECT Our Children Act of       2022''.       SEC. 2. REAUTHORIZATION.         Section 107(a)(10) of the PROTECT Our Children Act of 2008       (34 U.S.C. 21117(a)(10)) is amended by striking ``2022'' and       inserting ``2024''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on S. 4834.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 4834, the PROTECT Our Children  Act of 2022, a critical piece of bipartisan legislation that would  reauthorize the Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force, or ICAC,  which has worked tirelessly for 14 years to protect our children from  online predators.   It is no exaggeration to say the internet today is one of the most  dangerous places for our Nation's children, many of whom spend hours  online each day. Predators use social media and other online resources  to groom and entice children to commit sexual acts.   The internet makes it easy for sex and labor traffickers to gain  clandestine access to children and teens, recruit them into their  organization, and exploit them. The internet is also the primary  vehicle for distributing child sex abuse material and committing  criminal acts of extortion against minors. It also provides an open  forum for cyberbullying and online harassment, which can lead victims  of such conduct to withdraw, become depressed, and even commit suicide.   To combat these monstrous crimes and to protect our youth from  exploitation, ICAC task forces work with Federal, State, and local law  enforcement to develop an effective holistic response to cybercrimes  against children. Their programs include forensic and investigative  components, training and technical assistance, victim services, and  community education.  [[Page H8751]]    This network is made up of 61 separate forces, three of which are in  my home State of Texas. These task forces are created and authorized by  the original PROTECT Our Children Act of 2008, which expired this past  September at the end of the fiscal year.   Online threats to children and the need for ICAC task forces are only  growing. Between 2008 and 2021, the number of these arrests rose from  2,500 to more than 10,000 each year. This agency's work resulted in  more than 137,000 investigations and 90,300 forensic exams in 2021  alone.   Earlier this year, the southern Texas task force received significant  funding, its first, authorized by the PROTECT Our Children Act allowing  it to provide substantial investigative, prosecutorial, and victim  services and to utilize tips from the ICAC database and the National  Center for Missing and Exploited Children, a longstanding agency that  has been fighting for missing and exploited children to identify and  rescue child victims.   The work of these task forces nationwide will not be able to continue  unless we fund this critical law enforcement initiative. It is,  therefore, essential that we reauthorize the ICAC program by passing  the bipartisan PROTECT Our Children Act of 2022. The act would extend  funding for these task forces and programs through 2024.   Without this crucial legislation, our children will remain vulnerable  to those who seek to exploit and hurt them in the most horrific of ways  with the ease and anonymity that the internet provides.   I commend my colleague, Representative Wasserman Schultz, for her  work on the PROTECT Our Children Act as far back as 2008, and I urge my  colleagues to support this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record: ``Houston ICAC Task Force  Records Nine Arrests for Child Exploitation'' showing that there is  true evidence that this program works.                    [From the Texas News, July 7, 2022]      Houston ICAC Task Force Records 9 Arrests for Child Exploitation                              (By Amy Gordon)         During the weeks of June 2022, the Montgomery County       District Attorney's Office (MCDAO) Cybercrimes Against       Children (ICAC) Division, part of the Houston Metro ICAC Task       Force, conducted a multi-day interagency operation targeting       individuals who were actively children sought sexual       exploitation via the Internet in Montgomery County. Multiple       law enforcement agencies were involved in the operation       including the Montgomery County Attorney's Office, Federal       Bureau of Investigation, Texas Department of Public Safety,       Houston Police Department, Conroe Police Department,       Montgomery County Pct. 1, pt. 2, pt. 3 and pt. 5 Police       Departments, Humble Police Department, Ft. Bend County       Sheriff's Office, Missouri City Police Department and the       Spring Branch Independent School District Police Department.        The Houston Metro ICAC Taskforce is part of a national       network of 61 coordinated task forces representing over 4,500       federal, state and local law enforcement agencies dedicated       to investigating and prosecuting those who attempt to       sexually exploit children via the Internet.        During this multi-day operation, the Montgomery County       District Attorney's Office ICAC section, moderated by       Constable Ryan Gable and Montgomery County Constable's Office       Precinct 3 deputies, conducted a proactive chat operation in       southern Montgomery County. Task Force members also obtained       an arrest warrant for Thomas J. Manno of Clarion County,       Pennsylvania, and provided local authorities with essential       information to execute a search warrant on his home.        Task Force members contributed to the following arrests       during the operation:        Thomas J. Manno--39--Shippenville, Pennsylvania--Promotion       of Child Pornography (F2)        Robert Clarence Clayton--27--Channelview, Texas--Online Ad       by a Minor (F2)        Isaac Anthony Marino--30--Houston, Texas--Online       solicitation by a minor (F2)        Francisco Xavier Garza--29--Spring, Texas--Online       solicitation by a minor F2) // Possibly with intent to       supply--Methamphetamine (F1)        Elijah Charles Lewis--24--Houston, Texas--Online       Solicitation by a Minor (F2)        Ahsan Shah--36--Houston, Texas--Online solicitation by a       minor (F2)        Lawrence Clayton Hopkins--55--Baytown, Texas--Online       solicitation by a minor (F2)        Edward Stewart Geddes--42--Houston, Texas--Online       solicitation by a minor (F2) // Evidence tampering (F3)        Clinton Brian Harvey--44--Dickenson, Texas--Soliciting a       Minor Online (F3) // Unlawful Carrying of a Gun (MA)        The above accused are still under investigation and       additional charges may be brought at a later date. All       accused are presumed innocent until proven guilty.        During the investigation of Lawrence Clayton Hopkins,       officers learned that Hopkins may have worked as a youth       pastor in Midlothian, College Station and Baytown, Texas       prior to his arrest.        During the investigation of Clinton Brian Harvey, officers       learned that Harvey worked as an officer at the Montgomery       County Juvenile Detention Center.        As our children are more exposed to the internet than ever       before, the ICAC section of the Montgomery County District       Attorney's Office and the Houston Metro ICAC Task Force       encourage parents to be diligent in monitoring their       children's online activities and raise concerns with law       enforcement agencies and the National Center for to report       Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC). Concerned parents and       guardians should contact local law enforcement in the event       of an emergency by dialing 911. Parents and guardians can       also contact NCMEC at 1-800-THE-LOST (1-800-843-5678) or       through their website at CyberTipline.org for more       information and resources.        Lt. Michael Atkins, Montgomery County Constable's Office       Precinct 3, shared: ``The Internet provides criminals with an       often unsupervised avenue to exploit child sacrifice. As       parents, we need to carefully monitor our children's online       activities and talk to them about the dangers they may face       online.''        Shanna Redwine (MCDAO), Head of Special Victims Division,       stated: ``We know the internet can be a dangerous place for       children. The Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force and       the Montgomery County District Attorney's Office are       committed to making it legally dangerous for adults who seek       to harm them. We ask parents and carers to support us in this       effort by closely monitoring children and speaking with them       about online risks, of which there are many.''     Mr. Speaker, I am looking forward to this  legislation passing. Again, I emphasize that anything to protect our  children is crucial.   Mr. Speaker, there are thousands of children exploited on the  internet each and every day. As the global online community continues  to grow, so do the very real dangers facing our Nation's children.   I do want to state that Ms. Wasserman Schultz has really developed  this legislation and worked very hard on it. We have applauded her work  starting in 2008. This will be a major, if you will, addition and asset  to fighting the scourge that goes against our innocent children.   So we have developed a vast and effective program that has continued  to evolve and improve our fight against online child exploitation.  Let's continue this program. We cannot allow this program to die. We  must pass the PROTECT Our Children Act to reauthorize these task forces  and to allow them to continue their brave and crucial work that keeps  our children safe.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms.  Wasserman Schultz) who has worked so hard on this legislation since  2008.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from Florida.    Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to support S. 4834,  PROTECT Our Children Act of 2022.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 4834, the ``PROTECT Our Children  Act of 2022,'' a critical piece of bipartisan legislation that would  reauthorize the Internet Crimes Against Children task force program, or  ``ICAC,'' which has worked tirelessly for 14 years to protect our  children from online predators.   It is no exaggeration to say the internet is today one of the most  dangerous places for our nation's children, many of whom spend hours  each day online. Predators use social media and other online resources  to groom and entice children to commit sexual acts. The internet makes  it easy for sex and labor traffickers to gain clandestine access to  children and teens, recruit them into their organizations, and exploit  them.   The internet is also the primary vehicle for distributing child sex  abuse material and committing criminal acts of sextortion against  minors. It also provides an open forum for cyberbullying and online  harassment, which can lead victims of such conduct to withdraw, become  depressed, and even commit suicide.   To combat these monstrous crimes and protect our youth from  exploitation, ICAC task forces work with federal, state, and local law  enforcement to develop an effective, holistic response to cybercrimes  against children. Their programs include forensic and investigative  components, training and technical assistance, victim services, and  community education.   The ICAC network is made up of 61 separate task forces--three of  which are in my home state of Texas. These ICAC task forces were  created and authorized by the original PROTECT Our Children Act of  2008, which expired this past September, at the end of the fiscal year.   Yet online threats to children, and the need for ICAC's tasks forces,  are only growing. Between 2008 and 2021, the number of ICAC arrests  rose from 2,500 to more than 10,000 each year. ICAC's work resulted in  more than 137,000 investigations and 90,300 forensic exams in 2021  alone.   Earlier this year, the Southern Texas ICAC task force received  significant funding--its first--authorized by the PROTECT Our Children  Act, allowing it to provide substantial investigative, prosecutorial,  and victim-centered services, and to utilize tips from the national  ICAC database, and the National Center for Missing and Exploited  Children, to identify and rescue child victims.   But the work of the task force, and that of the other ICAC task  forces nationwide, will not be able to continue unless we fund this  critical law enforcement initiative. It is, therefore, essential that  we reauthorize the ICAC program by passing the bipartisan PROTECT Our  Children Act of 2022.   The Act would extend funding for ICAC task forces and programs  through 2024. Without this crucial legislation, our children will  remain vulnerable to those who seek to exploit and hurt them in the  most horrific of ways, with the ease and anonymity the internet  provides.   I commend my colleague, Representative Wasserman Shultz, for her work  on the PROTECT Our Children Act, and I urge my colleagues to support  it.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and concur  in the Senate amendment to the bill (H.R. 5796) to amend title 35,  United States Code, to establish a competition to award certificates  that can be redeemed to accelerate certain matters at the Patent and  Trademark Office, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the Senate amendment is as follows:   Senate amendment:          Strike all after the enacting clause and insert the       following:       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Patents for Humanity Act of       2022''.       SEC. 2. AWARD OF CERTIFICATES TO ACCELERATE CERTAIN MATTERS                     AT THE PATENT AND TRADEMARK OFFICE.         (a) Award.--Chapter 2 of title 35, United States Code, is       amended by adding at the end the following:  [[Page H8753]]            ``Sec. 28. Award of certificates to accelerate certain         matters at the Patent and Trademark Office         ``(a) Definition.--In this section, the term `eligible       entity' means an entity that--        ``(1) submits an application under subsection (d) for a       patent that addresses a humanitarian issue; and        ``(2) meets the requirements specified by the Director.        ``(b) Establishment.--There is established a competition,       to be held not less frequently than biennially, to award       eligible entities certificates that can be redeemed to       accelerate one of the following matters:        ``(1) An ex parte reexamination proceeding, including 1       appeal to the Patent Trial and Appeal Board from that       proceeding.        ``(2) An application for a patent, including 1 appeal to       the Patent Trial and Appeal Board from that application.        ``(3) An appeal to the Patent Trial and Appeal Board of a       claim twice rejected in a patent application or reissue       application or finally rejected in an ex parte reexamination,       without accelerating the underlying matter that generated the       appeal.        ``(4) A matter identified by the Director.        ``(c) Administration.--The Director shall administer the       competition established under subsection (b).        ``(d) Application.--An entity seeking an award under       subsection (b) shall submit to the Director an application at       such time, in such manner, and containing such information as       the Director may require.        ``(e) Promotion of Competition.--The Director shall promote       the competition established under subsection (b) through the       satellite offices established pursuant to section 1.        ``(f) Treatment as Successor.--The competition established       under subsection (b) shall be treated as a successor to the       Patents for Humanity Program (established in the notice       entitled `Humanitarian Awards Pilot Program', published at 77       Fed. Reg. 6544 (February 8, 2012)).''.        (b) Rule of Construction.--Nothing in this section, or the       amendments made by this section, may be construed as       affecting any action taken by the Under Secretary of Commerce       for Intellectual Property and Director of the United States       Patent and Trademark Office before the date of enactment of       this Act with respect to the administration of the Patents       for Humanity Program established in the notice entitled       ``Humanitarian Awards Pilot Program'', published at 77 Fed.       Reg. 6544 (February 8, 2012).        (c) Technical and Conforming Amendment.--The table of       sections for chapter 2 of title 35, United States Code, is       amended by adding at the end the following:  ``28. Award of certificates to accelerate certain matters at the Patent                and Trademark Office.''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the Senate amendment to H.R. 5796.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Senate amendment to H.R. 5796  which codifies a competition at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office  called Patents for Humanity. The Patents for Humanity program  highlights the ways that innovation and intellectual property help  solve global humanitarian challenges. I applaud Representatives  Jeffries and Spartz for spearheading this bill in order to ensure that  special recognition permanently extends to inventors who turn their  genius toward allaying or helping the world's most needy and  vulnerable.   The Senate amendment does away with the need for extra rulemaking  before the competition can continue its operation, and, as such, is a  welcome addition to help streamline the bill.   The operative provisions of the bill will make permanent the Patents  for Humanity awards program which encourages the development and use of  inventions that address humanitarian needs in the fields of medicine,  nutrition, sanitation, household energy, and living standards for  impoverished people. Winning inventors are recognized in a public  awards ceremony and receive a certificate that can be used to  accelerate certain examination proceedings at the USPTO.   Since 2012, the USPTO has recognized numerous award recipients across  a wide range of technologies. The recipients have invented  groundbreaking technologies that greatly improve the standard of living  for so many people in need in the United States and around the world.   The bill also builds on the work of Representative McBath who  successfully led a bipartisan effort to pass legislation in the last  Congress strengthening the program. That law allowed the awards  certificate to be transferrable if the award recipient would prefer to  seek its free-market value rather than accelerate a different patent  application.   Today, we are going a step further by ensuring that this program is a  permanent feature of our innovation ecosystem.   In Congress, we strive to make sure that our intellectual property  laws incentivize innovation to the greatest extent possible, but this  category of humanitarian inventions will always deserve special  recognition. H.R. 5796, as amended in the Senate, will make sure that  it will.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support it, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, H.R. 5796 is a straightforward but  important bill that will encourage additional innovations that address  humanitarian needs both in the U.S. and abroad.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the bill.
