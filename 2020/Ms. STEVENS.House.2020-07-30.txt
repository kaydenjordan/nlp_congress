 Mr. Speaker, I am here today to memorialize the  beautiful lives of 13 nuns taken from Michigan's 11th District by the  scourge of coronavirus between April and June of this year.   We honor the memory of:   Sister Mary Luiza,   Sister Celine Marie,   Sister Mary Estelle,   Sister Thomas Marie,   Sister Mary Patricia,   Sister Mary Clarence,   Sister Rose Mary Wolak,   Sister Mary Janice,   Sister Mary Alice Ann,   Sister Victoria Marie,   Sister Mary Martinez,   Sister Mary Madeleine,   And Sister Mary Danatha ``Lottie.''   These righteous women spent their days working and living together as  members of the Felician Sisters of the Presentation of the Blessed  Virgin Mary convent in Livonia, Michigan, some for more than half a  century. At the time of their deaths, they ranged from age 69 to 99  years old, still wholly committed to serving the most vulnerable among  us. They would call it ``from the womb to the tomb,'' the dedication of  their service to the community.   Prior to the pandemic, the Sisters could be found working in our  local schools, libraries, and medical facilities, providing enrichment  to our students and care for our sick. Many of them pursued degrees in  higher education during their lifetimes, always seeking new ways to  instill a sense of peace, justice, dignity, and truth in the world  around them. My heart aches for the harm done to the soul of our  community and with the loss of these incredible lives.  [[Page H3991]]    Since this news has broken and spread throughout the world, they have  heard from the world. From Alaska to Arizona, to as far away as Taiwan,  people reaching out and sending them masks, sending them Hershey  chocolate bars.   This distinguished group has been responsible for the founding of  multiple schools and care centers in Michigan's 11th District,  including our beloved Madonna University, which has become one of the  Nation's largest Franciscan universities, with a student body of  approximately 3,000 students. We, in Michigan's 11th District, are  forever indebted to these beloved nuns for their mission and their  impact. We grieve for the virtuous lives lost, and we hold their  extended community in our prayers.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues today to join me in reflecting on  the indelible mark left by these Sisters on our community, our country,  the soul of our country, and this world. May the grieving find comfort  in the extraordinary legacies of faith and service that they leave.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I rise in support of my amendment on  drowning prevention in H.R. 7617.   This amendment emphasizes the pressing need to appropriate $5 million  to the CDC to continue its lifesaving work on water safety and drowning  prevention.   This amendment is in memory of Jacob Sandy, a loving brother and son,  who drowned off the coast of Lake Michigan just over a year ago.   Jacob graduated from Seaholm High School, my alma mater. His young  adult life was just beginning, and he was known for his deep Christian  faith, his positive outlook, adventurous and humorous spirit.   Now that summer is in full swing, it is time for us to ensure that no  one has to experience the pain suffered by his mother, Carol, his  brother, Paul, his sister, Charlotte, and the countless others who  loved him.   There is so much more we can do to prevent drownings in America.
