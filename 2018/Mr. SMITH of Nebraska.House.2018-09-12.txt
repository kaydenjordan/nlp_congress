 Mr. Speaker, under Federal reclamation law,  irrigation districts that receive water from a Bureau of Reclamation  facility typically repay their portion of the capital costs of water  projects under long-term contracts.   Under its current contract and current law, Northport Irrigation  District is exempt from annual capital repayment if their carriage fee  exceeds $8,000 per year. Given the carriage fee has greatly exceeded  this amount every year since the 1950s, Northport's capital repayment  debt has been stagnant at more than $923,000 since 1952. So long as the  debt endures, landowners are subject to burdensome reporting  requirements and acreage limitations, and no revenue is generated for  the Federal Government.   I introduced this bill to provide members of the Northport Irrigation  District early repayment authority under their dated reclamation  contract. Allowing producers within the Northport Irrigation District  to pay off their portion of the contract means the government will  receive funds otherwise uncollected and landowners will be relieved of  costly constraints that threaten family-owned operations.   For example, at a previous Water, Power and Oceans Subcommittee  hearing, a member of the Northport district testified that acreage  limitations will prohibit parents who own land in the district from  passing down or selling farmland to sons and daughters who also own  land in the same district.   Similar legislation has previously passed under bipartisan majorities  and, according to past CBO projections, could generate as much as  $440,000 in Federal revenue.   This is a very simple bill that would make a big difference to some  family farmers in Nebraska.
