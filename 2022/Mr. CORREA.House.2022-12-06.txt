 Mr. Speaker, this is the oath a soldier takes when he is  joining the military:         I do swear (or affirm) that I will support and defend the       Constitution of the United States against all enemies,       foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and       allegiance to the same; and that I will obey the orders of       the President of the United States and the orders of the       officers appointed over me.    Mr. Speaker, follow me here. A soldier takes this oath without any  reservation, mental or otherwise. He fights for our country, for our  Nation, he or she is honorably discharged, and is not a citizen.   Corporal Jose Angel Garibay lived in my district. Jose Angel was the  first servicemember in Orange County to make the ultimate sacrifice for  this country in Iraq after 9/11. He took the oath. Yet, he died as a  noncitizen. He deserved to die as an American citizen.   And many, many other honorably discharged veterans, are deported, but  they can come back once they die because they still have the right to  be buried in a national cemetery.   Let's pay our debt to our veterans. We ask them to fight, to serve  our country, to defend our freedom, and our moral obligation is to take  care of all our veterans. Let's pay our debt to  [[Page H8769]]  our veterans. Let's pass the Veteran Service Recognition Act.    Madam Speaker, if I may, I just want to say that the  Dreamer issue is not about immigrants, it is about America.   Dreamers are the perfect kind of immigrant that you want in this  country. They follow the law. They pay taxes. They are either gainfully  employed or have to be studying in order to qualify as a Dreamer under  the DACA program.   Now, 70 to 80 percent of all Americas, Democrats and Republicans,  support a pathway to citizenship for Dreamers. They are our friends.  They are our neighbors, firefighters, police officers, and they also  serve in the military.   Here is a poster of one of my constituents, Jose Angel Garibay. He  was the first servicemember from Orange County to make the ultimate  sacrifice for America after 9/11 in Iraq. He died as a Dreamer, as a  noncitizen.   Later on, this body saw it appropriate to give him U.S. citizenship  posthumously.   Jose shouldn't have waited until after he passed away to become a  U.S. citizen because he made the ultimate sacrifice for his new  country--the only country he knew, the United States of America.   Madam Speaker, I am proud to inform you that I represent probably the  largest number of Dreamers in the country: Orange County, California.  Orange County, the county that Ronald Reagan used to say was the place  that good Republicans would go to die.   Not very long ago, my daughter came home with two of her very good  friends, and they were both very scared and crying. They said: We are  Dreamers. Are we going to be deported? What do we do?   Good, sweet, young ladies--students. I said: You keep studying hard.  You keep working hard. You keep following the law. You keep being a  good person and let us work on legislation in Washington.   Today, my simple ask from the Senate is: Do the right thing. Stop  treating Dreamers as political footballs, you kick them whenever it is  appropriate.   I ask the Senate to please pass the Dreamer legislation and give  those 2 million Dreamers the opportunity to earn--not to be given--but  to earn a pathway to the American Dream.   Again, 70 to 80 percent of Americans agree with this concept. Let's  do our job. Let's continue to keep America as the greatest country in  the world.
