 Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, this amendment simply makes a technical  change to the underlying language suggested by the Army Corps of  Engineers and the Natural Resources Committee. To be specific of what  those changes are, it takes the word ``borrow site'' and changes it to  ``borrow source,'' and then takes the phrase ``for a period of more  than 15 years'' and replaces it with ``at least once prior to December  31, 2008.''   There literally is no change to the substance of the underlying text.  This is just an accommodation of the request of the Army Corps of  Engineers.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
