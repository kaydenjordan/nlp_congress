 Madam Speaker, I rise today to urge my colleagues  to support H.R. 3113, the Modernizing Access to Our Public Land Act, or  MAPLand Act.   Access to America's lands is critical. Driven in part by the COVID-19  pandemic, we are seeing more people hunt, fish, hike, and bike than  ever before. Recreating on these lands creates fond memories, improves  the physical and mental health of Americans, and contributes  significantly to our economy.   Each year, outdoor recreation across the country injects $887 billion  into our economy. These dollars support communities in Utah and  nationwide, contribute to high-paying jobs, and connect us through our  shared hobbies and interests.   There are roughly 640 million acres of land in the Federal estate. Of  these, more than 9 million acres in the Western United States have no  permanent legal means of access.   Land users understand firsthand the shortage of information that  exists on which lands are opened, how they can be accessed, and more.  In fact, tens of thousands of important land access files are currently  outdated or only in paper form, filling up cabinets in office building  basements. This just simply isn't good enough for the 21st century.   This lack of access to crucial information prevents us from enjoying  all that our lands have to offer, and it makes it more difficult for  the hardworking employees at our land management agencies to do their  jobs.   It is time to fix these problems by modernizing the data behind our  Federal lands. My bill, H.R. 3113, the MAPLand Act, will do just that.   Madam Speaker, this bipartisan and bicameral commonsense legislation  will help our Federal land management agencies work together better by  creating shared data standards and improving the digital information  available to all who visit our lands.   Making this information more detailed and accessible in the digital  age is one of the many reasons why this bill enjoys such broad support.  This is about helping families spend more time together outside, about  improving the way that our government works, and about fostering and  sharing the joy of the great outdoors.                                time  1515    I am grateful to Ranking Members Fulcher and Westerman and Chairmen  Neguse and Grijalva for cosponsoring the MAPLand Act and helping drive  it forward.   I am also grateful for staff members and stakeholder groups who  worked closely with my office at all hours on this important effort  that will bring our lands into the 21st century. This has truly been a  collaborative effort that will reverberate for years to come and one  that I have been proud to be a part of.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support my legislation, and I  hope my colleagues in the Senate will consider and pass this important  bill expeditiously.
