 ROSE of Tennessee. Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent  to take from the Speaker's table H.R. 3401, with the Senate amendment  thereto, and concur in the Senate amendment. This bipartisan bill  passed the Senate with 84 votes and could be sent to the President's  desk for his signature today.    ROSE of Tennessee asked and was given permission to  address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)    ROSE of Tennessee. Madam Speaker, today the House joined  the Senate in approving almost $4.6 billion in taxpayer money to  address the growing security and humanitarian crisis at our southern  border.   We all share sympathy for the children and individuals who find  themselves in suffering conditions at our southern border, but we  should not confuse that the action that the House took today addresses  the real crux of the problem at our southern border. Indeed, less than  5 percent of the funds that we approved will have a realistic impact on  reducing the plague of illegal immigration that faces our country.   I call upon my colleagues and I call upon the Speaker, upon our  return after the Independence Day recess, to take up this issue and  send a clear message around the world that this country intends to  enforce its borders and enforce its immigration laws.   Madam Speaker, I support and call upon the Speaker to allow us to  provide the funding to build a wall at our southern border and support  the President's efforts to control illegal immigration.                            ____________________
