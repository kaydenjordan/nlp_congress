 Madam Speaker, I rise to urge my Republican colleagues to  come back to work now to responsibly avoid a national default, just  like they did three times under President Trump.   Instead, as the U.S. is on the brink of defaulting for the first time  in history, House Republicans have recessed for the weekend, holding  the global economy hostage and threatening a catastrophic recession if  they don't get to impose cruel cuts on American workers, families,  veterans, and seniors.   The mere threat of default will cost workers close to $20,000 out of  their retirement savings. It would also send interest rates  skyrocketing, cost small businesses $2,500 more per month for capital,  and force Californians to pay almost $300 more per month on their  mortgages.   Republicans already voted to spend the money. Now they are trying to  walk out on the bill and leave the most vulnerable Americans out to  dry. That is inexcusable.                            ____________________
