 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize  one of Eastern Washington's finest young men, Cole Baerlocher.   Cole is a student at Washington State University, and he recently was  elected to serve as the next national president of the Future Farmers  of America.   For Cole, his family, and our entire community, this is a huge deal.  Cole is from Colfax, the county seat of Whitman County, the top wheat- producing county in America.   Having him serve as the face of this organization is a tremendous  honor. The FFA has more than 735,000 members; 37 candidates were  considered for the honor of serving as president. Only one was selected  to lead, and that person was Cole.   Cole, I know I speak for our entire community when I say  congratulations on this incredible achievement. We could not be more  proud. Go Cougs!                            ____________________
