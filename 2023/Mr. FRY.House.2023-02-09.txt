 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H. Res. 104, a  resolution condemning the Chinese Communist Party's use of a high- altitude surveillance balloon over United States territory as a brazen  violation of United States sovereignty, introduced by House Foreign  Affairs Committee Chairman Michael McCaul of Texas.   I would never have imagined that my Saturday afternoon would have  been disrupted due to a Chinese spy balloon. Not only did it float  across most of South Carolina, it floated across the entire Continental  United States, and ended up over my district and, out of all places in  this country, the balloon was shot down right off the coast of my  hometown, Surfside Beach, which I represent.   And yes, it does--if you watched it and if you were there on the  ground--sound like it was straight out of a sci-fi movie.   There is no question that the response or, rather, lack of response  from this administration, in my opinion, was negligent.   More than 19 million people annually visit our area to enjoy our  beautiful beaches and southern hospitality along more than 60 miles of  coast that is known as the Grand Strand.   Myrtle Beach is known for many things, Mr. Speaker, but part of that  equation has never been an international incident taking place right  off of our shores.                                time  1030    The Chinese Communist Party last Friday, February 3, said that this  was merely a weather balloon gathering meteorological data that got  lost in our country. It is comical to me that they would actually think  that we would fall for such a bogus claim.   Let me be clear: This was a blatant violation of American sovereignty  as part of the comprehensive surveillance program on the United States  as well as other countries across the globe.   This was a test by the Chinese Communist Party, and it saddens me to  say that I think this administration failed that test.   This is the United States. Our foreign policy has always been built  on peace through strength. This is our wake-up call. It is time for  President Biden to step up on the world stage and take a page from one  of my favorite Presidents, Teddy Roosevelt: Speak softly and carry a  big stick. While diplomacy should always be our first objective, we  must be prepared to respond with strength when necessary.   This resolution shows that the U.S. House of Representatives, in a  bipartisan fashion, condemns the Chinese Communist Party's efforts to  deceive the international community with their false claims of  intelligence collection. I call on this administration to promptly and  decisively act to further prevent surveillance attempts in the future.
