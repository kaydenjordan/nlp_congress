 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to help raise  awareness for the Stop the Bleed training course.   Recently, I had the opportunity to take this course, offered by the  American College of Surgeons. This simple training teaches you how to  treat bleeding injuries and help save a life. The most common  preventable cause of death after an accident is losing too much blood  after trained responders arrive.   This past June, I saw the difference having these lifesaving skills  can make when several of my colleagues and friends were shot while we  were practicing for the Congressional Baseball Game.   We were fortunate to have the skills of former Army medic, my  colleague, Congressman Brad Wenstrup, who was able to apply a  tourniquet to Majority Whip Steve Scalise and help save Steve's life.   Each year, more than 180,000 people die from injuries sustained from  car crashes, falls, industrial and farm accidents, shootings, and  natural disasters. Every American could potentially save a life by  learning these very simple skills.   I commend this campaign and I hope by raising awareness we will equip  more Americans to do just that.                            ____________________
