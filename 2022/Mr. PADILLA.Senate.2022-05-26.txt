 Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Fire Suppression  Improvement Act and the Post Fire Flooding and Debris Flow Act.   Currently, the Fire Management Assistance Grant, FMAG, Program is  available to State, local, and Tribal governments for the mitigation,  management, and control of fires that threaten such destruction that  they would constitute a major disaster.   However, under current law, FMAGs can only be used to reimburse  expenses incurred after it is granted.   The Fire Suppression Improvement Act would explicitly allow for State  or local governments to use FMAGs for the predeployment of assets and  resources. These predeployed assets are critical to suppression of  fires and are sometimes the only way to contain a fire before it gets  out of hand and needs a major disaster declaration. This bill would  simply allow for FMAGs to help State and local governments cover the  cost of fighting incidents from the beginning of the high-risk event.   Additionally, this bill would make FMAGs consistent with other FEMA  disaster assistance by stating that the Federal cost share of FMAGs  shall be not less than 75 percent of the eligible cost of such  assistance. This bill does not mandate any cost share increase but  simply allows for flexibility. FMAGS are granted on an incident-by- incident basis, and as we have seen across the West, fires often occur  in the same area consecutively in the same year.   Wildfires leave behind severe vegetation loss and soil exposure in  the form of burn scars, which can cause destructive and large-scale  flooding and debris flow when exposed to rainfall. Sudden and deadly  postfire events of this type are well documented throughout the Western  United States, particularly in Southern California. These events are  one of the most dangerous postfire hazards and pose a serious threat to  life and property and have the possibility to block drainage ways and  damage public infrastructure.   The Post Fire Flooding and Debris Flow Act would explicitly include  mitigating and preventing postwildfire flooding and debris flow as  eligible under FEMA's HMGP. This inclusion would allow for State and  local governments to act quickly when storms are incoming to protect  property, public infrastructure, and lives.   This bill would also make HMGP consistent with other FEMA disaster  assistance by stating that the Federal cost share of HMGP shall be not  less than 75 percent of the eligible cost of such assistance. This bill  does not mandate any increase but simply allows for flexibility and  increased federal assistance where necessary.   As States and local governments continue to step up, respond, and  work to recover from more frequent and more  [[Page S2755]]  dangerous fires, it is imperative that the Federal Government has the  flexibility to adequately support them.   These two bills represent commonsense steps forward to meet the  current crisis facing the Western United States and to better support  initial suppression efforts and postfire risk reduction.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Fire Suppression  Improvement Act and the Post Fire Flooding and Debris Flow Act.
