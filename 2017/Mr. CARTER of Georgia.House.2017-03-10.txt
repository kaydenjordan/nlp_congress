 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to acknowledge the  academic accomplishments of several school systems in Georgia's First  Congressional District.   Niche is a website which analyzes data gathered from the Department  of Education that focuses on academics, student life, test scores, and  college enrollment. With this data, they rank each school system and  help families find the best schools for their children.   This year, Georgia's First District had the honor of placing 10  school systems in their top 100 school districts in Georgia. It comes  as no surprise to me that so many of these outstanding school districts  made this great achievement.   Camden County School District ranks as the top school system in the  district and even cracked the top 10 for the State, ranking as the  number 7 overall school system in Georgia. Camden County scored top  marks in the categories of diversity, teachers, health and safety,  administration, and sports.   In addition to Camden County, I am proud to recognize, today, the  other school districts to reach the top 100: Pierce County, Lowndes  County, Ware County, Effingham County, Glynn County, Bryan County,  Bacon County, Echols County, and Chatham County.   Congratulations to each school's administration, teachers, and  students whose hard work and dedication made this accomplishment  possible.   I look forward to the future success that will surely come from these  schools.                            ____________________     Mr. Chair, I was unavoidably detained.
