 Mr. Chair, the gentleman from Arizona has it absolutely  right. When I was in the military as a physician, what you wanted when  you were injured in battle, Mr. Chair, was the best person taking care  of you with the greatest skill. You didn't care what the color of their  skin was. You didn't care what their religion was. You didn't care what  their background was. You wanted a highly trained individual who was  going to keep our fighting force healthy.   Mr. Chair, that is why we need this amendment, to protect our men and  women serving this country. This has nothing to do with other  amendments. It is about having a fighting force that is the best in the  world.
