 Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, I rise today in support of my amendment to  H.R. 3055.   This bipartisan amendment removes and adds $2 million from the Legal  Activities account at the Department of Justice.   I would like to make the intent of this amendment clear, that  Congress is directing the DOJ's Environment and Natural Resources  Division to allocate $2 million to enforce our Nation's animal welfare  laws.   Congress has taken meaningful steps over the past several decades,  and especially in the past few years, to improve animal welfare and rid  this country of heartless cruelty toward animals. These improvements  include the passage of legislation like the Horse Protection Act, the  crush video law, the Animal Welfare Act and animal fighting laws, which  received overwhelming bipartisan support.   While our animal rights laws have improved, there are currently  insufficient resources to ensure that these laws are being adequately  enforced.   The Environment and Natural Resources Division, or ENRD, oversees  many important functions, including pollution cleanup and wildlife  protection. This division also has the unique responsibility to  prosecute animal welfare crimes. ENRD lawyers at the Department of  Justice are doing the best they can to defend the humane treatment of  captive, farmed, and companion animals across the country, but there  are currently not enough resources being allocated for them to go after  animal welfare crimes.   Failure to adequately enforce these laws harms communities and  animals--the truly voiceless. Failure to enforce these laws leaves  animals to suffer tremendously at the hands of people who force animals  to fight to the death for pure entertainment and/or other cruel  actions.   Mr. Chair, I use this opportunity to urge DOJ to coordinate with USDA  and continue working with the U.S. Attorney's offices to prosecute and  investigate animal welfare crimes. Specifically, DOJ should create a  dedicated animal cruelty crimes unit and allow for robust enforcement  of animal welfare crimes. There should be dedicated personnel,  including prosecutors, focused solely on these offenses.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.   I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Crist).                                time  1145     Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.
