 Mr. Speaker, today, I rise in strong support of H.R.  6395, the William M. (Mac) Thornberry National Defense Authorization  Act for Fiscal Year 2021.   Sun Tzu said that ``the art of war teaches us to rely not on the  likelihood of the enemy's not coming, but on our own readiness to  receive him; not on the chance of his not attacking, but rather on the  fact that we have made our position unassailable.''   As reported out of committee, this NDAA funds essential military  readiness to support the National Defense Strategy.   The legislation does a number of things. It makes significant  investments in operations and maintenance and military construction;  invests in essential capabilities to retain military overmatch,  including cyber, space, hypersonics, ground-based strategic deterrent,  and artificial intelligence; begins recapitalizing our surge sealift  fleet; addresses shortfalls in refueling capacity; requires that DOD  develop a long-term sustainment strategy; codifies the DOD Office of  Economic Adjustment; improves energy and critical infrastructure  resilience; requires responsible water use by installations; improves  transparency regarding PFAS releases; authorizes National Guard access  to DOD funds for PFAS remediation; and continues military housing so as  to protect the families.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my friend and colleague,   John  Garamendi, for his leadership on the Readiness Subcommittee, and  Chairman Smith and Ranking Member Thornberry for their leadership to  get this to the floor. Representative Thornberry has left a strong mark  on this Nation's national defense, and we appreciate his dedication.  This legislation reflects the hard work of Members on both sides as  well as the bipartisan staff.   Mr. Speaker, this morning, I voted against the rule. I did so because  the Democratic leadership appears to be playing political games that  could undermine all of this good work. One amendment would reduce the  defense top line, if accepted, by 10 percent. By requiring the  Department to fully fund all the personnel and medical accounts, all  other accounts would have to decrease by 16 percent, more than twice  the cuts imposed under sequestration. That would devastate readiness.   Rules also made in order include two massive land amendments  affecting Colorado and Arizona and other States. These have nothing to  do with national defense, and they are opposed by many citizens of  those States.                                time  1400    Using servicemembers and their families as pawns to support a  partisan agenda is just wrong, so I truly hope this remains a bill that  I can vote for after this debate.    Mr. Speaker, I claim the time in opposition.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, this amendment would be a major change to the  Insurrection Act first invoked by Thomas Jefferson more than 200 years  ago. Under this amendment, a President would not be able to act quickly  and decisively in the event of riots that are not being controlled at  the State or municipal  [[Page H3330]]  level. He would have to, along with the Secretary of Defense, certify  certain findings to Congress and then consult with Congress.   This would hinder and delay needed action to preserve domestic peace.  Any military personnel then deployed would have burdensome restrictions  placed upon them that would make them less effective in controlling  violence and riots.   It is ironic that we are considering this amendment on a day when we  are honoring the life of Representative   John Lewis, an icon in the  civil rights movement whose passing I, too, mourn.   You see, Mr. Speaker, had this amendment been law during the 1950s  and 1960s, the progress of civil rights in this country would have been  stifled. By being forced to consult with Congress, Presidents  Eisenhower, Kennedy, and Johnson could have been blocked by a Senate  majority that at the time was preventing all progress on civil rights.  It is a matter of history.   My Uncle Jim Lamborn was a Federal employee at Leavenworth  Penitentiary in 1957 when he was deputized as a marshal and sent to  Little Rock, Arkansas, with many others so Black children could go to  integrated public schools. President Eisenhower had to oppose the  Arkansas Governor and act unilaterally to make this happen. If  Eisenhower had to oppose an obstructionist House or Senate also, it may  have never happened.   So, looking at today's headlines, I would like to ask the sponsor of  this amendment, in light of the violence and rioting in Seattle and  Portland, which for whatever reasons are not being controlled by the  mayors of those cities, would President Trump be justified to invoke  the Insurrection Act as amended by this amendment?    I yield to the gentlewoman from Texas.    Reclaiming my time, Mr. Speaker, apparently the  gentlewoman is not willing to answer this question. If she can't answer  this question, then I don't think we have to take it seriously. I think  it is a political gimmick.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from Mississippi (Mr. Kelly).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Michigan (Mr. Bergman), who is a retired three-star general and Member  of the House Armed Services Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  [[Page H3362]]    Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to this amendment to add a  package of divisive and unrelated partisan land bills to the NDAA.   First of all, this amendment has nothing to do with national defense.  It is a travesty that the majority has jammed these issues together.  Collectively, this package of ideologically driven bills impacts lands  in Colorado, California, and Washington by creating about 1.3 million  acres of new wilderness. But this will greatly reduce opportunities for  multiple uses on these public lands, limit access to them, and  significantly reduce the available productive acreage in working  forests, rendering them more prone to catastrophic wildfires.   In Colorado alone, this would designate about 570,000 acres of new  wilderness areas, 23,000 acres of expanded wilderness, and 14,000 areas  of potential wilderness, whatever ``potential wilderness'' is. This is  in a State where we have 3\1/2\ million acres of wilderness right now.   While I commend my colleague from Colorado for her attempts to work  with local stakeholders to address some of their concerns, none of the  bills in this package comes close to the type of balance and consensus  necessary for a bill of this magnitude. Many of the local communities  impacted by this package have raised significant concerns.   Now, you know, look, I love public lands, as does the sponsor of this  legislation. My wife and I hiked a national park in Moab last week.  While wilderness sounds good to the uninformed, it really means that  most people will forever lose access to those lands.   Local communities have many concerns with this bill. At the July  subcommittee hearing on this bill, we heard testimony from Montezuma  County Commissioner Keenan Ertel, who shared the county's concern that  this bill would negatively impact individual landowners, agricultural  entities, water providers, first responders, and especially the  recreation and tourism industry. Garfield County has also weighed in  against this bill because of the increased wildfire risk.   In addition to the local grievances, the affected Federal land  management agencies have stated that this bill is inconsistent with  previous designations and existing land uses because it arbitrarily  adds wilderness areas and wild and scenic river designations where  those designations are simply not supported.   Now, actually, there is one connection to national defense, and that  is a negative one. By designating the High Altitude Aviation Training  Site, or HAATS, as being within a wilderness area, it won't be able to  expand if and when future vertical lift platforms come online. Future  platforms will fly higher, farther, and faster, and they will need more  space, and this amendment prevents that.   Because of all these concerns, the Trump administration rightly  issued a veto threat against this bill when it first came up to the  House in February.   I ask my colleagues to oppose this amendment.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1545     Mr. Speaker, I would just like to say to my colleague  from California that at least the sage-grouse amendments in the past  had something to do with national defense. These were next to military  areas that impacted readiness. This amendment has nothing to do with  national defense.   Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time I have remaining.    Mr. Speaker, I yield the balance of my time to the  gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Tipton).    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I demand the yeas and nays.
