 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, I rise to offer an amendment, which I am pleased to say  that I intend to withdraw, because after months of hard work in this  Chamber and with the administration, it is no longer necessary.   Minnesota is the proud home to the Iron Range, which boasts an  abundance of natural resources and critical minerals. When it comes to  protecting the environment while developing our economic assets, nobody  does it better than Minnesota.   Despite this history, on its very last day in office, the Obama  administration proposed to withdraw more than 240,000 acres of land in  our State from mineral exploration and development. This last-minute  action was an assault on our way of life, threatening thousands of jobs  and billions of dollars in State revenue and school trust funding. It  handicaps our national security by increasing our reliance on foreign  sources of minerals.   That is why I offered this amendment to stop this foolish action.   This amendment is identical to one that was unanimously adopted by  this Chamber last year and echoes the good news delivered by the  President to thousands of Minnesotans on June 20 when he announced his  intent to rescind this arbitrary withdrawal, which is now in process.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from  Minnesota (Mr. Nolan), who is my colleague from Minnesota and coauthor  of this amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Calvert), who is the chairman of the Appropriations  Committee's Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Subcommittee.    Mr. Chairman, may I inquire how much time is remaining.    Mr. Chairman, I thank the chairman for his work and  continued support on this issue.   To make a few closing points, nothing about this amendment would  allow for mining in the Boundary Waters, period.                                time  1800    In fact, to demonstrate the disconnect and level of misinformation on  this issue, my colleagues who stand in opposition to this amendment  worked to have report language accompany this bill which incorrectly  calls attention to a ``proposal'' to withdraw lands within the Boundary  Waters Canoe Area, despite the fact there is no such proposal and it  remains unlawful to mine within the Boundary Waters.   Nothing about this amendment eliminates any existing environmental  protections. This amendment reinforces the commonsense reality that  economic growth and environmental protection do not have to be mutually  exclusive.   I am pleased to have the support of the House on this very important  issue during this 115th Congress. I am pleased to have the pledged  support and continued commitment from the administration to end this  withdrawal. I am pleased that we will soon be able to get Washington  out of the lives of thousands of hardworking Minnesotans.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.   Mr. Chair, I withdraw the amendment.
