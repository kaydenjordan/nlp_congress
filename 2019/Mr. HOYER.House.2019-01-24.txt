 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr.  Scalise) for yielding the time.   Mr. Speaker, on Monday, the House will meet at noon for morning-hour  debate. On Tuesday and Wednesday, the  [[Page H1184]]  House will meet at 10 a.m. for morning-hour debate and noon for  legislative business. On Thursday, the House will meet at 9 a.m. for  legislative business, with last votes no later than 3 p.m.   We will consider several bills under suspension of the rules. The  complete list of suspensions will be announced by the close of business  tomorrow.   Members are advised that additional legislative items are possible,  including additional legislation related to fiscal year 2019  appropriations.   I want to make it clear to Members that when we leave today or  tomorrow, we will leave with the notice to Members that they are  subject to being asked to come back Saturday, Sunday, Monday morning,  or any day thereafter, if there is a possibility of opening up the  Government of the United States, so that it can serve the American  people.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, let me make very clear that which ought to be very  clear: We believe the President of the United States, with the aiding  and abetting of the majority leader of the United States Senate, has  taken the Government of the United States hostage, and the President of  the United States is asking for ransom, and that ransom is to accept  his policy or go home and stay shut down.   I will tell the gentleman, Mr. Speaker, that I have been in this body  for a long time. I am in my fourth decade. I have never supported  shutting down the Government of the United States.   Now, the gentleman may point out that I have voted from time to time  against bills that would have opened it up because of things that were  in the bills and these bills passed the House of Representatives when  you were in charge. They did not pass the Senate, of course.                                time  1100    I believe that shutting down the people's government is an  unacceptable--unacceptable--tactic in a democracy when one is  discussing differences that need to be resolved. Unacceptable.   Furthermore, as I said on the floor the other day, Mr. Speaker, I can  find no free government in the world that shuts itself down, other than  the United States of America. Now, we have a relatively unique system  of government.   But I will tell my friend that we are for border security. We have  supported bills that affected border security. During our tenure, there  was more border security fencing, I will tell the gentleman,  constructed than when they had been in charge over the last 8 years.  Look at the record.   But the issue is, we are not going to negotiate at the point of a  gun, which is shutting down the Government of the United States,  affecting 800,000 of our employees.   Some of you say: I run a business. I am a businessman.   Well, if you are a car company, or you are a real estate company, or  you are a contractor, or whatever you may do, can you tell your  employees: I am going to have you work, but by the way, I am not going  to pay you.   Mr. Speaker, we want to negotiate. We want to get this resolved, but  we are not going to pretend this is business as usual. This is the  longest shutdown in history, and the other side has consistently voted  against every bill that we have offered to open up government.   Now, the other side offered a bill where they want to pay employees  while they don't work. I voted against that. I think the taxpayer  deserves to have his employees or her employees working, and, yes, he  should pay them and she should pay them for working, not some stopgap  measure to pretend that somehow we are lessening the consequences of a  shutdown, in light of a consistent, overwhelming vote on the other side  of the aisle to keep government shut down.   I tell my friend, he voted against Boehner, when he was the Speaker  of the House, requesting to open up the government. Maybe he believes,  Mr. Speaker, that shutting down the government is good policy, good  practice, the way to treat your employees. I emphatically reject such a  premise.   When the gentleman asked me if will we negotiate, I am pretty proud  of my reputation, having negotiated with George H.W. Bush a major piece  of legislation that was very controversial, the Americans with  Disabilities Act, negotiating in league with Roy Blunt, one of the  gentleman's predecessors on his side of the aisle; and Jay Rockefeller  and Senator Kit Bond from Missouri to get FISA, the Foreign  Intelligence Surveillance Act, which was a very controversial issue,  resolved, with Democratic and Republican support, and President George  W. Bush signed that bill.   So anybody who knows my reputation knows that I am prepared to sit  down and come to agreement, because that is what you need to do in a  democracy. I won't get everything I want; you won't get everything you  want.   But the fact of the matter is, as long as government is shut down, we  are not going to have business as usual.   I remind the gentleman that his side was in charge last year and went  11 months and 20 days and didn't bring a Homeland Security bill to the  floor of this House--11 months and 20 days. It was in the waning 10  days of the year when his majority brought a bill to the floor that  they knew wouldn't pass the Senate.   We have passed Senate bills that would open up the government. We  have sent simple CRs with no controversy to them that would have opened  up the government. We have sent 10 different bills, 11 different bills.  The 12th lost on suspension, because their side voted against it.   So I tell my friend, I am prepared to negotiate. I am prepared to  negotiate in good faith. I will tell the gentleman, the Speaker of this  House is prepared to do the same, and our Members are prepared to do  the same.   There are significant, strong differences. We differ on whether the  wall is an effective way to keep the border secure. But we agree on a  number of other things.   When the gentleman and I were down at the White House, for instance,  the magnetic resonance of trucks and vehicles that are carrying  contraband, drugs, guns, and other material that we don't want to come  into the United States, we can agree on that. We can agree on much, I  think, of border security.   That was a long answer to the gentleman's question, but until we open  up government, it is not going to be business as usual, until we open  up government and put those 800,000 people back to work. I represent  62,000 of them.  [[Page H1185]]  Now, not all of them are laid off, because we funded some portions of  government. But a significant number of them are, and they are hurting.   A TSA agent comes in at $28,000 per year. We make substantially more  than that, and they are living paycheck to paycheck. Tomorrow, they are  not going to get a paycheck. But they have been told by their  government they have to work, and because they are conscientious,  patriotic Americans, they are working. But you can't expect them to  work much longer. We can't expect people to work when they are not  getting paid, when they are not getting respected, when they are not  getting treated as we would want to be treated ourselves.   So I say to the gentleman, in answer to his question, we are prepared  to discuss and negotiate and compromise, but not in the face of this  shutdown.   I would hope that it would end. It is the wrong policy. It is a cruel  policy. It is hurting America. It is hurting our economy. It is hurting  our reputation around the world. And it is hurting our people who work  for us.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his comments.   The gentleman, of course, just voted against funding the Department  of Homeland Security, as did his colleagues.   The gentleman proudly said that all of his colleagues--and not all of  his colleagues voted against it--but he voted against opening up the  Department of Homeland Security. He voted against paying the personnel  in Department of Homeland Security. Yet, he cites them as experts who  have given us advice, and why don't we follow that advice.   But, Mr. Speaker, the minority party doesn't have enough respect for  them to open up the government, open up the Department of Homeland  Security, pay the people who are protecting our border, pay the people  who are processing paperwork for those border security guards, pay the  people who are answering the phones, pay the people whom we ask to  protect our borders, and then laments that somehow we are not coming up  with a number.   Open up this government, Mr. Speaker.   And, yes, I used the word, ``hostage''; and, yes, I used the word,  ``ransom.'' And, yes, I believe there are two people, and a lot of  complicit people, with this government being shut down and with the  pain and suffering that we are imposing on our employees. Anybody who  thinks Democrats are responsible for that doesn't know what is  happening.   I am very concerned about the President being able to communicate  with the American people. The historic, greatest tweeter of all time.  You can't get away from hearing what the President has to say, every  morning, every afternoon, and every evening. He has plenty of time.   And, by the way, the President said: Yes, I am not going to give the  State of the Union until the government is open. He just said that,  just a few hours ago.   Open up this government.   And for anybody who watches the votes on this floor, watched that we  voted unanimously to open up DHS; we voted unanimously to open up the  other departments of government; we voted unanimously to make sure that  the people are being served by their government agencies.   And, Mr. Speaker, again, I understand Mr. Scalise and I have a  difference. When the Speaker of the House John Boehner brought a bill  to the floor when the government was shut down to open it up, Mr.  Scalise voted ``no''; and the other person who voted ``no'' is Mr.  Mulvaney, who is now the chief of staff.   I get that. They think shutting down the government is not a bad  option to try to force the other side to agree with them or to pay  their ransom.   Yes, I use those words. And, actually, if either one of us adopts  that as an acceptable alternative in the negotiation process, this  country is in real trouble--real trouble.   And so we ought to open up the government, and then, yes, we can sit  down, and, yes, we will resolve this.   But my friend's great angst--he did not mention why it took them 11- 2/3 months while they were in charge last year. They didn't offer a  bill until they were about to walk out the door and be the minority.  Mr. Speaker, 11 months and 20 days, no Homeland Security bill was  brought to this floor. I don't know why. My supposition is they didn't  have the votes, but I wasn't counting on their side.   Mr. Speaker, I have been to probably 37 or 38 States of the Union.  Never was the government shut down. This shutdown is not only of  historic length, it is of historic irresponsibility and historic danger  to our country, to our people, to our national security, and to our  economy.   Let's vote to open up this government, and then let's resolve the  differences that we have in the way democracies resolve differences: by  discussion, by debate, and by votes.    Mr. Speaker, these CRs carry forward the spending in 2018,  the CRs the gentleman voted against. They have $1.6 billion in them. He  voted ``no.''    And would the gentleman tell me why he didn't bring a bill to the  floor for 11 months and 20 days that would have done what he says is  such important work to be done? Can he tell me why he waited 11 months  and 20 days to bring a bill to the floor?    Let me first say that Mr. Scalise and his party over the  last 8 years that they were in charge passed bill after bill after bill  after bill that they knew without any doubt they had no chance in the  United States Senate--none, zero, zip. They passed them for message.  They knew that, we knew that, and America knew that. So that is not the  reason they didn't bring the bill that they talk now so passionately  about to the floor for 11 months and 20 days. They only brought it as  they were going out the door.   Let me tell you what they rejected, Mr. Speaker. They rejected a bill  from the United States Senate which would have opened up government and  paid all 800,000 of the people who are now either furloughed or asked  to work without pay. They rejected that bill that passed overwhelmingly  and unanimously on voice vote from the United States Senate that the  President of the United States was said, by the Vice President of the  United States, to support.   But something happened during those 24 hours as it came from the  Senate to the House. A bill that passed the Senate, they rejected that  bill, the Republicans in this House, and then they, and only then, did  they bring a bill which they knew would not pass the Senate. Talk about  negotiation and compromise, and you have done that over and over and  over, Mr. Speaker--not you but the Republican majority.   Now, Mr. Speaker, let me tell you who sent it over here: Senator  Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader of the United States  Senate.   Let me quote Senator McConnell in a CNN report:         In his strongest words to date, Senate GOP leader Mitch       McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, tried to quash talk that       he would allow another government shutdown if he becomes       Senate majority leader next year.    What was his response? `` `Of course not. Remember me? I am the guy  that gets us out of shutdowns,' McConnell told CNN in an exclusive  interview Wednesday.   Then he went on to say: `` `It's a failed policy,' he said of  shutdowns.''   Now, sadly, in league with the Republican minority here in the House  of Representatives and the President of the United States, he has done  exactly the opposite of what he said he would do. He hasn't opened up,  he has shut down government.   The minority whip is correct, Mr. Speaker. We are not going to  pretend that this is business as usual as long as we have 800,000 of  our employees--some working, some not--not being paid and not being  treated with respect because it is a tactic that they have adopted. And  I tell my friend again: it must be a tactic he believes in because he  voted against his own Republican Speaker and the majority leader who is  now the Republican leader who voted and urged Members: vote to open up  this government.   Now, he was not alone in that vote. There were 143 other Republicans.  Only 87 voted to open up the government. So apparently he believes this  is a tactic  [[Page H1188]]  that is acceptable in a democratic government. We reject that  emphatically and proudly.   We have passed bill after bill after bill after bill that would open  up this government, and Mr. Scalise, Mr. Speaker, and his colleagues  have almost to a person--not always unanimously--rejected that effort.   So I tell my friend: open up the government and we will talk, but we  are not going to talk while you hold hostage the employees of this  government--not all of them, but 800,000 of them--who are worried about  whether they can put food on the table.   There are food lines. Our people at food lines--public employees--do  we have no shame?   Do we have no moral commitment to those whom we ask to work to  protect this country and to serve these people?   What is it that the President and his party refuse to open up the  government?   This is historic. Never in the history--he talked about going back to  George Washington in 1799--has this ever happened before that we kept  the government shut down. The longest before that, of course, was the  Republican shutdown of 2013.   It is not a tactic I tell my friend that we accept. We reject it  emphatically, and we are not going to subject ourselves tomorrow to the  same kind of blackmail or the day after to the same kind of blackmail  or the day after that to the same kind of blackmail.   I will tell my friend: we will have a Democratic President at some  point in time. And he ought to reject this tactic as well because it is  bad for the government. Much more importantly, it is bad for the people  of this country, the economy of our country, and the national security  of our country.   Mr. Speaker, I have nothing else to say.    Mr. Speaker, parliamentary inquiry.    Mr. Speaker, is a motion to recess in order or is the  Speaker empowered to recess on his own?    Madam Speaker, to all my colleagues, I apologize. I may  speak just a little longer than 1 minute--not much.   Madam Speaker, I was sitting in my office just a few minutes ago and  Representative Michael Waltz, whom I do not know, from the State of  Florida rose and said he was here in an empty Capitol.   Scores of my fellow Democrats are here because they are outraged that  we have shut down the people's government, and they are here, Mr.  Waltz, to urge the President of the United States and Mitch McConnell  to open up the people's government. That is why they are here. They  haven't gone home, Congressman Waltz. We are here.   I don't see anybody over here.   Madam Speaker, I rise to join with my colleagues in highlighting the  absurdity of the Trump-McConnell shutdown and share some of the ways,  just some few ways, it is affecting Americans in my district.   Now, you can go to this website, trumpshutdownstories.us, and get  scores more stories than I will be able to tell on this floor in this  short time I will speak.   Maryland's Fifth District, which I have the great honor of having  represented for the last 38 years, has 62,000 Federal employees, tens  of thousands of whom are not getting paid, and some who are being  forced--no, who are voluntarily working because they love this country  and they love their jobs, and they are working without pay.   Is that any way to treat any employee, much less an employee working  for their government?   One woman from Prince George's County, Maryland, wrote to tell me  that her husband, an astrophysicist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight  Center, is furloughed. She isn't working because they have an infant,  and he, the only source of their income.   Another constituent wrote to tell me that he serves in the Coast  Guard. He said:         As I was putting my 9-year-old son to bed last night, he       asked me, ``Dad, how come they are making you work without       pay?''    He went on to say:         I gave him an answer about having taken an oath and that it       is my duty to serve, but he was still confused.    I share that young child's concern and confusion. Why would we do  this? What would lead us to show such disrespect for those who carry  out our policy?   All Americans should be confused about why our hardworking public  servants would be forced to work without pay or be told to go home and  wait while a paycheck doesn't come.   It is not just Federal employees and contractors who are affected.   And, by the way, we are going to repay the Federal employees, as we  should. But the contractors, the small business people, the small shop  owners in my district who have thousands of their customers who aren't  being paid and, therefore, are not customers.   One woman from St. Mary's County, the county in which I live, said:         We were scheduled to close on our home on January 11, and       we received a phone call 3 days before that we would not be       going to closing because our loan was on hold due to the       government shutdown. A time that is supposed to be the       happiest, and here we sit with our house in boxes and living       week to week with a landlord. We don't know if we will lose       our home.    Madam Speaker, I would tell President Trump to listen to these  stories, listen to the humanity that must be in you, be sympathetic, be  empathetic, be caring about these people who are your constituents,  whom you are pledged to protect.   Madam Speaker, I would ask the President and Senator McConnell to  hear the voices of men and women their shutdown policies are hurting.  They are going to hear many more stories.   Democrats have voted now 11 times to end this shutdown, and  Republicans and the President have blocked these measures again and  again.   Let me say, Madam Speaker, to those who might be listening: We passed  Republican bills to open up this government--not our bills, not  partisan bills,  [[Page H1190]]  but Republican, Senate-passed bills which would have opened up the  government.   Madam Speaker, because we care so deeply about our constituents who  either work for or are served by our government, we will continue to do  everything possible to reopen government and share the stories of those  being held hostage by the President and Senator McConnell.   Madam Speaker, I thank my colleagues for being on this floor to bring  their stories of their constituents, of the President's constituents,  to his attention, as well as Senator McConnell.                            ____________________
