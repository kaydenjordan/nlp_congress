 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 2  minutes before we proceed to the cloture vote scheduled at 2:30 p.m.    Mr. President, I was honored when my good friend Senator  John McCain reached out to me 2 weeks ago to suggest that we introduce  bipartisan legislation here in the Senate that would attempt to solve  two of our most pressing immigration issues and keep our country and  Congress moving forward. The bill we have introduced--and which the  Senate will soon proceed to vote on--doesn't solve every immigration  issue we face, and it doesn't try to. What our bill does is focus on  the issues on which we can agree. It is an attempt to break through the  messy political debates and substantive disagreements here and find  compromise.    Our bill would do two simple things: Move to secure our border, and  finally give Dreamers the path to citizenship they deserve.   First, to address border security, our bipartisan bill would ensure  that we gain operational control of the border by 2020 with new  investments, new technology, new resources for Federal, State, and  local law enforcement. It would also reduce current immigration court  backlogs by funding new judges and attorneys, while addressing one of  the root causes of immigration from Central America.   Second, our bill would give legal certainty to 1.8 million Dreamers  who are American in every way but the paperwork--young Americans who  have known no other country but this one. Dreamers who continue to play  by the rules by going to school, serving in our military, and  maintaining consistent employment can become lawful permanent residents  and, 5 years later, U.S. citizens.   Senator McCain and I aren't the only ones who think this bipartisan  solution makes sense; 54 Members of the House--an even split of 27  Republicans and 27 Democrats--have cosponsored and led this effort. It  has been championed by Republican Congressman Will Hurd of Texas, whose  district has 800 miles of the U.S.-Mexico border, and Democratic  Congressman Pete Aguilar of California.   Our bill is more than just a set of policies. It is a way for us to  agree when we can agree and not let our disagreements get in the way of  making progress. There have been misrepresentations and half-truths  said in attacking this bill, and I will simply say this: Would a true  American hero and patriot like Senator McCain have lent his name to  this bill if all these attacks were true? I think not.   Our message is simple. We may not fix every immigration issue right  now, but we can take a historic step forward, and with new technology,  new manpower, a new pathway to citizenship, address Dreamers and allow  them to succeed in American schools and in the American military and to  enrich American communities without fear of deportation. These are  tough issues, but the solution is simple. I hope my colleagues will  join me in voting for the McCain-Coons bill.   I yield the floor.                                Cloture Motion
