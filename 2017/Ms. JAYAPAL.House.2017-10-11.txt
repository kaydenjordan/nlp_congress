 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to the cruel  immigration proposal unveiled by the White House this week. This  proposal goes beyond some of the worst immigration bills. It demands  billions more for border security, tightens asylum standards, cuts off  legal immigration, and implements a faulty points-based system,  undercutting our core values as a country and destroying our economy  and our future.   Mr. Speaker, two-thirds of all immigrants to the United States are  women and children, and these policies will disproportionately hurt  them. A points-based system eliminates family-based immigration, and it  is insulting to the valuable contributions of women, especially.   Nearly 70 percent of all women immigrants with legal status obtained  it through the family system, and many are stuck in visa backlogs  waiting years and even decades to reunite with their families.   Mr. Speaker, immigration has never been just about immigration. It  has always been about who we are as a country and what we are willing  to stand up for. I believe the majority of my Republican colleagues  want to pass the Dream Act, and I ask them to join us in rejecting  these anti-immigrant poison pills and proposing real solutions that  benefit the American people and unify our country.                            ____________________
