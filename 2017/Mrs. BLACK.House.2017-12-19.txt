 Mr. Speaker, this is truly a monumental day for the  American people.   During my 7 years here in the House serving on the Ways and Means  Committee, we have studied, considered, and outlined the sorts of  reform that could benefit the American people.   As a conferee for H.R. 1, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, I am proud that  we kept our promise of providing tax relief for hardworking, middle  class families and making the Tax Code simpler and fairer for all.   It has been more than three decades since our Nation's tax system has  been modernized, and this is finally the day to change that.   I want to remind my colleagues that the process began long before  this year. When passage of the budget provided the key, our ideas for  conservative tax reform were finally unlocked and could be pursued for  real tax reform.   Without question, this conference report reflects our shared  conservative principles. The conference agreement addresses the heavy  tax burden weighing down hardworking Americans and holding back job  creators. It brings simplicity to the Tax Code. It helps low- and  middle-income Americans see more of their hard-earned dollars in their  paychecks. It empowers entrepreneurs and small businesses to continue  opening, operating, and expanding on Main Street.   With every major legislative effort, there will be critics. But the  critics have it wrong. The truth is that the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act  delivers relief at every income level and protects more hard-earned  dollars from taxes. For the average family of four, this legislation  means a tax cut next year of more than $2,000.   The point of this exercise is that we are cutting your taxes, plain  and simple. I urge my colleagues to stand on the right side of history  and support this legislation because the benefits will be felt by all  Americans for generations to come.
