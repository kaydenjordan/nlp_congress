 Madam President, we learned a few minutes ago that new  unemployment claims just hit their highest weekly total since mid- September. It is the largest 1-week jump since back in March, and the  number of continuing claims--people struggling with joblessness on an  ongoing basis--which had plateaued for months but at least not  increased, just ticked back up as well.   Our economic recovery thus far has been faster than expected.  Americans are tough and resilient, but our people need another dose of  support as we hope to close out our battle with this virus. We should  be doing everything we can to prevent layoffs, create jobs where  possible, and race toward the vaccines that will end this nightmare.   While Democrats hold the Paycheck Protection Program hostage over  controversial State government bailouts, family businesses are closing  their doors. While Democrats resist the kinds of commonsense legal  protections that we put in place during past emergencies, our reopening  and recovery is threatened by, according to one estimate--now, listen  to this: So far, 6,500 lawsuits have been filed and counting--6,500  lawsuits filed and counting.   Here is what one litigator told one reporter a couple of days ago.  These lawsuits are ``pretty common these days. I have seen 10 like this  over the last 30 days.''   The American Council on Education told Congress in May--in May--that  colleges and universities need temporary but strong legal protections.   Now, our Democratic colleagues want to pretend they are bravely  fighting big corporations, but they are really bullying small business  owners and college presidents who have been pleading for these  protections for months.   Our Democratic colleagues have not even let us pass noncontroversial  money to invest in vaccine distribution--not unless the two parties  settle a whole list of issues that are controversial the way that they  want to settle.   So I hope our colleagues let Congress deliver more help soon. A lot  of Americans simply cannot afford to wait  [[Page S7380]]                                ____________________     Madam President, now, in the meantime, yesterday, we  began moving the conference report on the National Defense  Authorization Act toward the floor.   For the information of all Senators, we should expect the potential  for a late night tonight and the possibility of votes tomorrow.   Back in July, the Senate passed our version of this crucial annual  bill. Now our colleagues on the conference committee have done their  tough job and reconciled two different approaches so we do not leave  our military in the lurch.   On Tuesday, the House passed the conference report with overwhelming  bipartisan support. Now it is the Senate's turn to make it an unbroken  60-year streak of passing this legislation to keep our military strong  and our homeland safe.   This NDAA will unlock more than $740 billion for the training, tools,  and cutting-edge equipment that our servicemembers and civilian  employees need to defend American lives and American interests. It will  give our troops the 3 percent pay raise they richly deserve. It will  keep our forces ready to deter China and stand strong in the Indo- Pacific, and it will secure President Trump's major progress at  modernizing our capabilities, our technologies, and our strategic  nuclear deterrent.   This legislation will secure wins on priorities that all of us share.  It does not contain every policy that either side would like to pass,  but a huge number of crucial policies are included, and a lot of bad  ideas were kept out. So I would encourage all our colleagues to vote to  advance this must-pass bill.                            ____________________     Madam President, now, on one final matter, it is my  honor today to pay tribute to a truly exceptional U.S. Senator, someone  who arrived in this body with a full head of steam and a determination  to cram as much service as possible into every day he got to wake up  and serve his neighbors who sent him here.   Our good friend, Cory Gardner, the junior Senator from Colorado, has  been a man on a mission from the day he arrived. He already knew the  institution. He was already one of the highest energy high-achievers  that anybody who knew him had ever met. So he got to work, and he spent  6 years delivering a dizzying list of accomplishments.   If you have heard about Cory Gardner's early days, you know that his  high-speed, can-do attitude is nothing new. Case in point, one evening,  when Cory was a boy, he and his friends got tired of their hoop  sessions ending at sundown because the public basketball court lacked  sufficient lighting. The group of friends considered how to remedy  this. Cory's dad happened to be a town councilman. So a little  government relations took place right around the dinner table.   Well, no Senator who Cory ever pressed for a vote will be surprised  to hear that the lighting infrastructure was soon adjusted, and the  kids could take their pickup games into prime time.   So young Cory was no stranger to persistence or public service, but  it was in high school that he scored an opportunity to taste a level  beyond Yuma's local government. He won admission to the U.S. Senate  Youth Program. It is a scholarship that brings promising students from  around the country to these halls for a quick immersion experience.   Teenaged Cory Gardner liked the looks of this place. He made a mental  note. By the way, to this day, Cory, along with his fellow alumna,  Senator Collins, continue to make sure that special experience is paid  forward.   It didn't take Cory long to come back and begin strolling these  hallways for real. After earning honors at Colorado State and a law  degree from CU Boulder, he wound up working for our former colleague  Senator Wayne Allard--and rising quickly through the ranks.   In short order, he developed a reputation as a highly effective  advocate for Coloradans. In fact, he was so well liked, so effective,  and so thoroughly the proud son of Yuma that folks started to wonder if  it wasn't time for Cory to put his own name on a door somewhere. So it  wasn't long before the men and women of Colorado's State House District  63 found out firsthand what happens when you hire Cory Gardner to fight  on your behalf. You get results big time.   Not much later, his neighbors then gave Cory a new assignment here in  Congress. Again, Congressman Gardner didn't just meet the bar as one  out of 435. He excelled as a powerful, energetic voice on the most  consequential issues. He brought home one win after another when it  really mattered.   It didn't take long before another promotion came calling, and so,  appropriately enough, the Senate's freshman class of 2014 included a  new member from the land of ``14ers''--what Coloradans call their peaks  higher than 14,000 feet. Cory was already accustomed to altitude.   So here in this upper Chamber, Senator Gardner hit the ground  sprinting. I believe he has authored 11 standalone bills that have been  signed into law in just 6 years. Without Cory's tireless work and his  travels to the four corners of Colorado and beyond, the biggest  conservation bill in a generation--the Great American Outdoors Act-- would not have become law.   There has been his key role in the Supreme Court confirmation of  fellow Coloradan Neil Gorsuch, his mission to move the Bureau of Land  Management to Grand Junction, and, of course, the nuts-and-bolts  constituent work that Cory and his staff are famous for mastering.   This not-so-junior Senator has used Colorado values to improve  Washington and Washington influence to advance his home State.   He dived head first into his leadership role on the East Asia  Subcommittee on Foreign Relations. His work with regional allies helped  drive the Senate to approve meaningful sanctions against North Korea,  and the impact of the Asia Reassurance Initiative should echo long  after all of us here today have left this scene.   The litany of Cory's work just simply does not end. There is the new,  nationwide three-digit suicide prevention hotline. There is the fact  that this freshman not only scrapped over a national defense issue with  our late colleague Chairman John McCain--talk about fearlessness--but  that he somehow emerged mostly unscathed and with a win on space launch  vehicles to show for it.   But, like I said, one of the best aspects of Cory's operation is his  almost obsessive focus on looking out for his people--one family and  one story at a time.   That is why it is impossible to give a speech on Senator Gardner  without working your way to another name, Don Stratton.   When Don was first met with our colleague, the 95-year-old Navy  veteran was living with his wife in Colorado Springs. But the story  began 76 years earlier, when he was among the fortunate few sailors to  survive the bombing of the USS Arizona at Pearl Harbor.   At 19, Don had survived severe burns but insisted on returning to  combat with the fleet. After the war, he raised a family and wrote a  book about his experiences. But Don's request to Senator Gardner wasn't  anything for himself. It concerned a comrade who had saved his life  that day 79 years ago this very week.   At risk to himself, a sailor named Joe George had literally thrown  the lifeline that brought Don and five shipmates to safety. But Joe's  lifesaving efforts had gone unrecognized before his death.   For years, Don didn't even know who had saved him. So once he found  out, Don Stratton made it his mission to ensure our Nation formalized  our gratitude for his guardian angel.   Let's just say that the Strattons picked the right State to retire  in. Colorado's junior Senator was on the case. Cory and his staff waded  through tangles of bureaucracy. They appealed decisions all the way to  the Secretary of Defense. And you better believe they secured that  Bronze Star for PO1 Joe George, with the ``V'' device for valor to  boot.   Don passed away earlier this year. By all accounts, he and his family  had come to regard Senator Gardner not just as an incredible advocate  but as a true friend.   Now, in fairness, this same eagerness and almost maniacal problem- solving  [[Page S7381]]  can also get Cory in the occasional pickle. I remember recently that  just months after the Senator was sworn in, he and I were on a codel  together in the Middle East. I think the itinerary was something like  eight countries in 6 days.   At one point, we were waiting to meet with a foreign leader. As  everyone else was just waiting patiently in this grand palace, Cory  spots what looks like a stray piece of paper lying on the floor.  Earnestly thinking he should leave the place better than he found it,  Cory bends over and picks up the trash--except, it wasn't trash. Just  then, the Monarch rolls in with a color guard--a color guard that is  looking anxiously for the floor marker that was supposed to indicate  where to stop marching. Luckily, the only diplomatic fallout was a good  laugh by all.   Actually, good laughs tend to follow Cory in his wake. Our colleague  finds humor in the ``everyday'' like few can and shares it freely.   I understand one of his favorite stories concerns a chat in the well  with yours truly and former Senator Orrin Hatch. Cory was filling me in  on his efforts to legalize marijuana in States like his. Orrin comes  by, and sensing an ally, I pulled him in. I said:         Orrin, is this true? What the heck is going on out West?    Without missing a beat, our friend from Utah, a member of the LDS  Church, shook his head sadly and said: ``First, it was tea. Then,  coffee. And now this!''   Cory's version of this story comes complete with his finest Hatch and  McConnell impersonations. Believe me, he has the voices down pat.   For 6 years, Coloradans have been represented by this remarkable  person who lives and works with relentless focus and infectious joy:  globe-trotting diplomacy, a thick stack of signature bills signed into  law, and generational accomplishments that were only possible because  he was here.   Cory likes to say himself: ``Not bad for a boy from Yuma, CO!'' We  know what he means, but I have to observe that Cory's roots and his  accomplishments are not in conflict--quite the contrary. It is only  because Cory Gardner is exactly who he is that he is able to do what he  does.   Cory, everyone knows darn well your transition is no ``retirement.''  This is a brief pause between great chapters. I bet Jaime will call it  a victory if she, Alyson, Thatcher, and Caitlyn can just get you to sit  still--just sit still--and stay home through the holidays.   But we all know it will take about 5 minutes before you have found a  dozen new ways to keep doing big things, winning victories on behalf of  others, and paying forward the ways in which you have been blessed.  Colorado and your country aren't finished with you yet, not by a long  shot. So thank you for everything. We will miss you badly around here,  but we can't wait to see what course you chart next.                            ____________________
