The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Texas (Mr. Marchant) and  the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Neal) each will control 30  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their  remarks and to include in the Record any extraneous material on the  bill currently under consideration.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Texas?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their  remarks and to include in the Record any extraneous material on the  bill currently under consideration.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Texas?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I would first like to thank Chairman Brady for his strong support of  this bill, the Veterans Equal Treatment Ensures Relief and Access Now  Act, the VETERAN Act. This important legislation, which was reported  out of the Ways and Means Committee on a bipartisan basis, will ensure  all eligible veterans have access to quality, affordable private health  insurance.   Mr. Speaker, this Chamber cannot underscore enough the sacrifices of  our veterans and the sacrifices they have made to protect the freedom  and individual liberty of each American. In return for their faithful  service, these brave men and women are promised that, when they return  home, they will have access to affordable healthcare through the  Veterans Administration.   However, some veterans decide to forego their VA benefits and,  instead,  [[Page H4926]]  choose an alternative healthcare. Veterans should have the opportunity  to choose the best healthcare option available to fit their needs. It  is only right that our veterans are given the same opportunity as our  other citizens have and the citizens that they defend.   There have been conflicting reports about the eligibility of certain  veterans to receive tax credits for all health insurance under the  American Health Care Act. Make no mistake about it, no veteran would  see a change in their eligibility status as a result of the AHCA.   In fact, despite the Democrat's claims about veterans' eligibility  for tax credits under the AHCA, when they voted for and signed  ObamaCare into law, they failed to include this very same clarification  in statute. Rather, they left it to the Department of the Treasury to  issue a regulation clarifying that veterans are still eligible for a  credit unless they are enrolled in a VA healthcare benefit plan.   So today this legislation, authorized by my friend and a veteran, Mr.  Sam Johnson, should put into law current practice confirming that  veterans can, without question, get a tax credit to purchase health  insurance in the individual market if they choose not to enroll in VA  coverage.   It is important to note that AHCA initially proposed to put into law  this current practice, but that provision had to be removed due to  Senate guidance about their Chamber's unique reconciliation rules.  While I am disappointed that this happened, I am glad that this body is  acting on this item today.   I would note that this legislation has received the support of  several veterans' organizations, including the Paralyzed Veterans of  America, the Association of the United States Navy, and The Retired  Enlisted Association.   I think that something we can all agree on is that our veterans  should have the choice in where they receive their healthcare, just  like the American citizens they defended. In that spirit, this bill is  something we can all get behind.   To our veterans and their families, I thank them for their service.  To my friend Sam Johnson, I thank him for his leadership and the  authoring of this important bill.   I ask my colleagues for their support of the VETERAN Act.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I agree with Ranking Member Neal that this  is just a difference of opinion. It is a difference of policy opinion.  There is no animosity on either side of this debate.   Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman  from Tennessee (Mr. Roe), chairman of the Veterans' Affairs Committee.  [[Page H4927]]         Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Florida (Mr. Bilirakis), a member of the Veterans'  Affairs Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers at this time,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, again, I would like to express my  gratitude to Ranking Member Neal and his hard work on the Ways and  Means Committee and his keeping the issue before us.   But the AHCA makes no changes to veterans' healthcare. Under this  bill, unless vets decide to enroll in VA coverage, they are eligible  for financial support. Veterans should have the opportunity to choose  the best healthcare option to meet their needs. It is only right that  our veterans are given the same opportunities as the citizens that they  defended.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the VETERAN Act. I ask  for its passage, and I yield back the balance of my time.   Mr. SAM JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I'd first like to thank  Chairman Brady for his strong support of my bill, the veterans Equal  Treatment Ensures Relief and Access Now (VETERAN) Act. This important  legislation, which passed the Ways and Means Committee with bipartisan  support, seeks to ensure all eligible veterans have access to quality,  affordable private health insurance.   Mr. Speaker, I spent 29 years in the U.S. Air Force, so I understand  the sacrifices our veterans have made to protect the freedom and  individual liberties of each American. In return for their faithful  service, these brave men and women are promised that when they return  home, they will have access to affordable healthcare through the VA.   However, some some veterans decide to forgo VA coverage and instead  choose to enroll in other health coverage--as is their right. But  regardless of their eligibility for VA health coverage, veterans should  have the opportunity to choose the best health care option to meet  their needs. It is only fair that our veterans are given the same  opportunities as the citizens they defend.   With respect to the American Health Care Act, some folks have raised  concerns about the eligibility of certain veterans to receive tax  credits for health insurance. Specifically in question are veterans who  are eligible for, but not enrolled in, VA Health Coverage. Make no  mistake about it, we must ensure that these veterans have the same  access to the tax credits provided by The American Health Care Act as  any other American would.   That's where my bill, The Veteran Act, comes into play. My bill would  simply put into law a guarantee that veterans can indeed get these tax  credits to purchase health insurance in the individual market. Without  The Veteran Act, the eligibility of America's veterans for AHCA tax  credits would be left in the hands of IRS bureaucrats. That would be a  mistake. This is too important of an issue to leave in the hands of the  IRS. Bottom-line: this is a belt-and-suspenders approach to ensure  veterans have access to these tax credits.   It's important to note that the American Health Care Act initially  proposed to provide tax credits to veterans, but this language had to  be removed due to reconciliation rules. While I was disappointed that  this section was removed, I am glad we are doing the right thing today.   I would note that this legislation has received the support of  several veterans' organizations, including:   (1) The Paralyzed Veterans of America;   (2) The Association of the United States Navy; and   (3) The Retired Enlisted Association.   As I stated earlier, our veterans should have choice in where they  receive their healthcare, just like the American citizens they defend.  I think that's something we can all agree upon. And in that spirit, I  think this bill is something we can all get behind. I ask my colleagues  for their support of The Veteran Act.   To our veterans and their families, I thank you for your service. God  bless you, and God bless America. I salute you.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for debate has expired.   Pursuant to House Resolution 379, the previous question is ordered on  the bill, as amended.   The question is on engrossment and third reading of the bill.  [[Page H4929]]    The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, was read  the third time, and passed.                            ____________________
