 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today for the first time as a Member of Congress  in complete opposition to the budget reconciliation act.   Today, adding almost $2 trillion to the national debt and eliminating  1.3 million jobs is up for a vote.   This partisan budget reconciliation package allows President Biden to  shove $1.9 trillion of stimulus spending through Congress without any  Republican consent. It is a blue State bailout to States who have shut  down their business, closed their places of worship, and prevented  families from earning an honest living.   We don't need bailouts. We need to get back to work. Taxpayers in  States like Texas should not be left holding the bag for the failing  governments in New York, California, and others who chose to close  their economies.   Congress just passed a $900 billion stimulus package in December, and  over $1 trillion in COVID relief has yet to reach its intended  recipients. The U.S. is already over $26 trillion in debt and counting.   This is totally unsustainable and will have a disastrous consequence  for our economy and future generations. We are talking about the future  of our children and our grandchildren. Nothing could be more important  in this decision.
