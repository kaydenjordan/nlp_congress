 Madam Speaker, I would like to address the  117th Congress and talk about our national debt.   Currently, we are at $28,809,752,000,000. The numbers are rising so  fast, I couldn't name them all. It is continuing to rise, yet we are  considering a budget this week at $4.3 trillion, which would be the  most expensive piece of legislation in United States history, which is  mind-boggling, especially considering the fact that we also are looking  at voting on a $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill that is mostly  socialism, giving things away for free and wasting the taxpayers'  dollars.   Considering the fact that we just abandoned Americans in Afghanistan,  armed the Taliban, and 13 of our own military were killed in the  process, we also just let in tens of thousands of Haitians into our  country through our southern border, which is wide open and out of  control. Also on Friday, the Democrats, all except one, voted for full- term abortion and called it women's healthcare, then celebrated on the  Capitol steps, which most people in this country find appalling.   You see, abortion up until full term for a baby, at 9 months  pregnancy, is evil and something that this Congress should have never  considered. Yet, unfortunately, that is the bill that passed the House  on Friday.   So now we are looking at $4.3 trillion in new spending; $2.1 trillion  in higher taxes; $2.4 trillion in new debt, with more interest; and  $7.5 billion for a Civilian Climate Corps, which is part of the Green  New Deal. Government doesn't need to be creating a climate police  force; government needs to be getting out of the way of the American  people and their businesses so that they don't have to compete with the  Federal Government to hire people to get back to work.   Businesses all over the country are struggling to find people to work  in their companies. We need truck drivers. We need nurses.   We need to stop vaccine mandates and silly rules requiring people to  wear masks everywhere they go and children to wear masks. If vaccines  work, then people who get them should trust them. And if people are  still afraid, then they can wear a mask. And if they are still afraid,  then they can shelter in place. But the rest of the healthy population  in the United States should not be limited and held back. We should be  able to go to work, go to school, go into restaurants and stores,  without being shamed and divided among the American people.   COVID-19 has been a terrible thing sent to us through China and  actually funded, sadly, through the gain-of-function research through  our own Federal Government at the will of Dr. Fauci. Yet, he still has  his job, while hundreds of thousands of small businesses have failed,  and they don't have their jobs.   This government is failing the American people, and the more votes we  take this week we are going to continue to fail the American people.   This is why I walked in here this morning to make a motion to  adjourn. But then I was told I couldn't make a motion to adjourn  because we hadn't said the prayer or the pledge. It is very  unfortunate. We should make a motion to adjourn because Congress should  stop. Congress is the one ruining the lives of the American people, not  helping them, like they claim to do.   It is our Federal Government's role to keep our border strong, safe,  and secure.   It is our government's role to never abandon Americans in a foreign  country ruled by radical Islamic terrorists that would like to kill  them just because they are Americans.    It is not our Federal Government's job to pass a bill or consider  even making a law, abortion up until full term, and then call it  women's healthcare. This is too much. It is out of control.   So, simply, I would like to make a motion to adjourn. I think it is  silly that I can't do so as an elected member of Congress representing  the 14th District of Georgia simply because we haven't said the pledge  or the prayer.   As you can see, rules in Congress just don't work because the rules  here in Congress are allowing everything to continue to go downhill and  hurt the people that pay the taxes and pay for all of this up here  anyway.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now  adjourn.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and  nays.
