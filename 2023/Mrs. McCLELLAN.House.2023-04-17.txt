 Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Horsford and  Representatives Cherfilus-McCormick and Jackson for convening this  Congressional Black Caucus Special Order hour.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in solidarity with my CBC colleagues in  support of the ``Tennessee Three'' and in staunch opposition to the  dangerous precedent set by Tennessee Republicans.   Just 10 days after three children and three adults were brutally and  tragically murdered, rather than working to prevent that tragedy from  happening again, Tennessee Republicans expelled Representatives Justin  Jones and Justin Pearson in a gross abuse of power, a blatant  infringement of free speech, and a disenfranchisement of the voters of  the 52nd and 86th Tennessee House districts.   Attempts to compare the actions of the ``Tennessee Three'' to those  of the January 6 insurrectionists to justify the expulsion trivializes  the tragic events that occurred in this very building. Nobody died in  the Tennessee House. A bullhorn is not a pipe bomb. Nobody called for  members of the Tennessee Legislature to be hung.   Instead, Tennessee Republicans have set a dangerous precedent that  threatens the very foundational principles of American democracy by  attempting to silence calls for gun reform. This is something that  should concern every voter. A controlling party cannot invalidate the  will of the people simply because they don't agree with the position of  their colleagues or the peaceful exercise of their free speech.   I stand with my CBC colleagues in denouncing this overreach. We will  not stand idly by for such threats on democracy.   Mrs. CHERFILUS-McCORMICK. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from  Nevada (Mr. Horsford), our chairman.
