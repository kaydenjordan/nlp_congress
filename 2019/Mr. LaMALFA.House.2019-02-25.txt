 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak about a recent shift  we have seen in this country over the recent weeks--that is Americans'  views on abortion.   Not long ago, a Marist poll found that 55 percent of Americans were  likely to identify as pro-choice compared to about 38 percent  identifying as pro-life--indeed, a 17-point gap. Now, the polls are  tied.   As reported this week by Axios, a similar Marist poll found that  Americans are now, for the first time, equally likely to be pro-life as  they are to be pro-choice, both registering at 47 percent.   Why the sudden change? The horrific rhetoric offered by some of the  left, that is why, including the Virginia Governor's indefensible  remarks that he would support the murder of a baby post-birth. It is  inconceivable to me that someone could differentiate a post-birth  ``abortion'' from actual murder.   The good news is I think most Americans agree with me. That is why we  are seeing, finally, this dramatic shift.   My colleague from Missouri, Representative Ann Wagner, has introduced  the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act in order to end  infanticide taking place after failed abortion attempts. The Democrats  have repeatedly blocked the effort, including tonight. We need to have  a vote on this bill.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, thank you to the gentleman from Washington  (Mr. Newhouse).   Indeed, what we know so far about the Green New Deal, it is more like  a green pipe dream. It would lead to a total government takeover of  just about every aspect of our lives.   Now, it is interesting to watch, since the deal was proposed not that  many days ago, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, many of  them are starting to back away from it. There were 67 coauthors on  that. We are seeing some starting to back away, saying, well, this  really isn't the dream or the deal; it is more of an aspiration.   Well, by the time you freaked out half the country with these ideas  that you put into legislation, maybe we need a little more heads-up on  what really is the goal here.   Some of the guarantees in it:   A government paycheck for those unwilling to work.   Is that really in there? What are we talking about here?   The cost of this implementation? $93 trillion, quadruple of what our  national debt is right now. The cost will be passed on, of course, to-- as always--the taxpayer, to families, to those struggling--especially  middle-income folks--who could see their energy bills going up from  already at a high point to an additional $4,000 annually per family.   We should really have our supporters of this bill benefit from the  lessons learned in California on the high-speed rail boondoggle that  tripled in a short amount of time soon after it was barely approved,  $10 billion by the taxpayers to a nearly $100 billion project, all  under the guise of saving greenhouse gases.   Except during the construction of the high-speed rail in California,  it will make a whole bunch of greenhouse gases with the equipment  involved, so we are going to plant trees to offset that. Yet, at the  same time, they are running the rails through hundreds of acres of  almond trees in the middle of California that they are supposed to be  offsetting.   It is a reckless attempt to undermine America's increasing  dominance--not just energy independence--but now dominance in energy  around the world.   It ignores the basic reality; a lot of what America was built upon  were indeed fossil fuels, those known reserves that we have in this  country.   Now, let's talk a little bit about the Paris accord that I think  President Trump rightfully withdrew the United States from. The goal  being greenhouse gas reduction, CO2 reduction.   Well, when you look at the stats, who is already leading the way  outside of the accord? The U.S.--of those western countries--is the  only one that has actually reduced its number of CO2 in that  amount of time.   We are the ones doing it. You know why? Because we have freedom;  because we have the ability to innovate here, to invent the new  technology, to invent the things that are going to help us do things  better and cleaner into the future.   I don't hear a lot of talk on this about new hydropower, which is  clean and ready to go any time you turn on the switch to the gates to  allow the turbines to flow.   Biomass. In my area of the country--the Western Caucus, my colleagues  here--we burn part of the west every year. We should be putting that  fuel into clean burning power plants to make electricity, cleaning our  forest, making it more fire-safe, better for the wildlife, better for  the environment, not having all that CO2 go up. And then  creating jobs in our backyard to get people to work from cleaning up  the over-inventory the U.S. forest and BLM has from allowing their  forest to run rampant with no management for the last 100 years.   These are things we should be talking about, not this green dream  thing. Instead, we are going to hear nothing but climate change,  climate change, climate change, with solutions that just harness or  handcuff the economy, the jobs, and the people of this country inside  this chamber and in the real world out there where people actually  produce things.   We need to focus on the things that we know can work, producing  energy with hydropower. Yes, with nuclear power, no emissions. With  biomass, help clean that inventory that burns hundreds of thousands of  acres every year of forest land, and put it to work for us.   That is what we are going to be successful at, because the United  States is always number one in developing the new technology, the new  ways to do cleaner, better, more efficiently, instead of handcuffing  our economy and that innovation and exporting it somewhere else.   I do agree with my colleagues that have spoken here tonight. And in  sending the message, we need to strongly oppose this bill and get back  to something that actually works for the working people of this  country.   Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the time of the gentleman.
