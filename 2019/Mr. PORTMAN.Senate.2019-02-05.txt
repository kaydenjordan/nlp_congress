 Mr. President, today I wish to honor the life and  legacy of the late Bishop Paul Alexander Bowers. Known as the Preaching  Machine, Bishop Bowers pastored the congregation at Greater Emanuel  Apostolic Temple in my hometown of Cincinnati, OH, for over 40 years.   Bishop Bowers attended his first Pentecostal Assemblies of the World,  Inc., Convention in Cleveland in 1947, where he slept on the floor of  the church due to the lack of delegate housing. He was ordained in 1950  and began preaching in Cincinnati in 1957. Bishop Bowers was elected to  general secretary from 1968, elevated to bishop in 1976, and elected  and served as presiding bishop of the Pentecostal Assemblies of the  World from 1992 until 1998.   Bishop Bowers' ministry reached communities across Ohio and the  United States. His devotion to the Pentecostal Assemblies of the World,  Inc., and Greater Emanuel Apostolic Temple in Cincinnati changed  countless lives as he used the gospel to help people fulfill their God- given potential and better serve their communities.   I would like to recognize former presiding Bishop Paul Alexander  Bowers' many accomplishments and his decades of service to Pentecostal  Assemblies of the World, Inc. I would like to offer my condolences on  his passing to his family, his friends, and his church, and I hope his  legacy continues in the thousands of lives he has touched.                            ____________________
