 Mr. Speaker, today I rise for Dr.  Jennifer and her patients. This is their story.  [[Page H7690]]    Dr. Jennifer's patients come from my home State of California. They  were a married couple on their second pregnancy. They were so excited  to grow their family. But they discovered, at 22 weeks, that the fetus  was severely growth-restricted, had no fluid around it, had a cardiac  anomaly, and would not survive the pregnancy. Although this was a  wanted pregnancy, they chose to terminate the pregnancy at 23 weeks  rather than prolong the suffering of the mother and her fetus.   Dr. Jennifer wants lawmakers to know that abortion restrictions would  have forced her patient to carry this pregnancy until the fetus died in  the womb, despite the medical advice that their baby would not survive  to term. H.R. 36 and policies like it deny families their  constitutional right to a choice about how they want to move forward  with medical decisions that impact their bodies and their families.   On behalf of Dr. Jennifer and her patients, I urge my colleagues to  vote ``no'' on H.R. 36. We must stop these bans.
