 Mr. President, to honor the heroism of fallen Corporal  Humberto Sanchez, I went to pay my solemn respects on September 13 and  14, 2021, and was not present for votes. Corporal Sanchez was killed in  the attack on Kabul airport helping Americans and allies evacuate the  country.  [[Page S6549]]  Corporal Sanchez is an American hero, and his sacrifice will never be  forgotten.                            ____________________
