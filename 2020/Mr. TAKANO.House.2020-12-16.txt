(b) Retroactive Application.--The amendments made by this       section shall apply to stop movement orders issued on or       after March 1, 2020.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  to insert extraneous material on H.R. 7105, as amended.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 7105, as amended, the Johnny  Isakson and David P. Roe, M.D. Veterans Health Care and Benefits  Improvement Act of 2020.   H.R. 7105, as amended, was introduced by Representative Mike Levin,  chairman of the Subcommittee on Economic Opportunity, and the bill  before us today contains several crucial improvements that will better  the lives of veterans during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond.   Mr. Speaker, the first title of this bill contains legislation from  Representatives Levin, Underwood, Sablan, Brownley, Wexton, and Lee to  improve the Forever GI Bill. These provisions will ensure that  institutions of higher learning are more accountable to student  veterans.   These provisions will improve oversight of colleges and universities,  provide more flexibility for veterans to use their benefits, and  improve information sharing with students so that they can make a more  informed decision on where to continue their education.   Further, building off my Student Veterans Coronavirus Response Act  from earlier in the year, this legislation includes immediate COVID-19- related relief, from Representative Cunningham, to student veterans.  His legislation will extend housing benefits to student veterans,  provide more flexibility when using their education benefits during the  pandemic, and modernize apprenticeship programs to allow them to  continue effectively during COVID-19.   Mr. Speaker, to better serve those veterans who are experiencing  homelessness, this legislation includes contributions from  Representatives Panetta, Peters, Wild, Beatty, and Brownley to provide  more veterans with access to the HUD-VASH program, including veterans  with children and women veterans, and to provide legal services to  homeless veterans.  [[Page H7205]]    Recognition of service and sacrifice is a priority of mine, and I  thank Representative Cox for his bill that awards benefits to military  advisers who served in Vietnam immediately prior to the Vietnam war.  This group of advisers faced hostilities in the years preceding the  formal declaration of war in Vietnam, and some lost their lives. The  Military Assistance Advisory Group will now have greater access to  certain wartime benefits.   Mr. Speaker, similarly, this legislation expands benefits for certain  veterans, including Medal of Honor recipients. Thanks to Representative  Lamb's legislation, those veterans and their survivors will now receive  a greater amount of special pension.   My priority next Congress is to bring more veterans with toxic  exposures into VA and create an easier process to get these veterans  benefits. One group I have heard a lot about is K-2 veterans, who  served at Karshi-Khanabad Air Base in Uzbekistan. These servicemembers  slept in tents above soil that glowed and oozed, and, unsurprisingly,  many later fell ill.   Mr. Speaker, I fully support inclusion of legislation that partners  with the Centers for Disease Control to study these exposures and  resulting health effects.   For veterans who have passed away, burial benefits ease the burden on  grieving families. This legislative package expands these benefits,  creating greater access. Representative Delgado's legislation makes  counties eligible for VA grants to build and operate veteran  cemeteries, bringing a veteran's final resting place closer to home for  rural communities.   Representative Sablan's legislation works to expand those grants,  which are also available to States, territories, and Tribal  governments, to cover increasing costs of cemetery operations.   This legislative package includes several provisions from numerous  healthcare-related bills, and I will just take a minute to highlight a  few.   I am really delighted we are able to include Representative Gallego's  Native American PACT Act, which prohibits VA from collecting copays  from a veteran who is a member of an Indian Tribe.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 7105, as amended, also includes innovative ideas  like Representative Kaptur's the Vet HP Act, which seeks to expose  undergraduate students considering careers in medicine to directly  experience VA's healthcare environment.   In addition, this package includes language requiring State veterans  homes to provide VA with reoccurring reports on COVID-19 cases and  related issues in the facility. This is one more way that VA and  Congress can ensure veterans in State veterans homes have the resources  they need during this public health emergency.   Mr. Speaker, I am especially pleased this end-of-year package  includes the Deborah Sampson Act, introduced by Representative Julia  Brownley, the chairwoman of the Veterans' Affairs Health Subcommittee.  Title V is named after Deborah Sampson, a Revolutionary War veteran  from Massachusetts who served in the Continental Army for 17 months and  was wounded in battle more than once.   Mr. Speaker, Deborah Sampson was neither the first nor the only woman  to serve in the Continental Army, nor was she the first woman to be  granted a pension by Congress, but she was the most persistent. Over 38  years, Congress granted her a pension, backpay; and, ultimately, her  husband was granted a survivor's pension after her death. It is because  of similar persistence by women warriors who followed in Deborah  Sampson's footsteps that we are considering this legislation today.    Among the numerous provisions included in this legislation--perhaps  the most important--relate to eliminating sexual harassment and  assault.   Today, nearly one in four new recruits joining the military is a  woman; and, as a result, women veterans are the fastest growing  demographic in the veterans community, and VA must be prepared to  welcome them.   Unacceptably, at least one in four women veterans experience sexual  and gender harassment at VA facilities. This must end.   Mr. Speaker, last week, both the VA OIG and the Fort Hood Independent  Review Committee issued reports that emphasized the need to do more to  address the toxic culture that exists at the Department of Defense and  at VA. No veteran, caregiver, employee, contractor, or other public  visitor should experience sexual harassment or assault at VA.   H.R. 7105, as amended, requires VA to develop a comprehensive policy  that includes bystander intervention, mandatory reporting mechanisms  for employees, confidential reporting mechanisms for veterans, and  holds leadership accountable for addressing sexual harassment and  assault at VA facilities.   This bill also includes provisions put forward by Representative  Pappas that require new rules for how VA collects debts owed by  beneficiaries to avoid unnecessary harm to veteran credit ratings, as  well as to prevent many overpayments from happening due to eligibility  changes.   Mr. Speaker, finally, the bill before us improves the protections  offered by the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act for veterans and their  families. The included legislation from Representatives Bustos and Rose  provides additional protections to ensure that veterans aren't  disadvantaged by their service to our Nation and that they are allowed  more flexibility and protections for their employment and leases.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to support H.R. 7105, as amended, and  I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1430     Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from New  York (Miss Rice), my good friend and member of the House Veterans'  Affairs Committee.   Miss RICE of New York. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 7105,  the Johnny Isakson and David P. Roe, M.D. Veterans Health Care and  Benefits Improvement Act.   In addition to including the Deborah Sampson Act, a key piece of  legislation that will improve healthcare and access to VA services and  benefits for women veterans, this legislation also includes the  Boosting Rates of American Veteran Employment Act, which I introduced,  along with Congressman Paul Cook from California, to expand employment  opportunities for our veterans.   The BRAVE Act is commonsense, bipartisan legislation that will  authorize the VA Secretary to give preference to contractors with high  concentrations of full-time veteran employees when awarding Federal  contracts.   First, this will reward companies that actively hire and invest in  veterans. Second, it will create an incentive for other companies to do  the same, which, in, turn will help bring more veterans into their  workforce with good paying jobs, the types of opportunities that give  veterans and their families the stability they need as they transition  to civilian life.   Most importantly, as more and more companies hire more and more  veterans, they will ultimately see that investing in veterans is just  good for business. That is what the real incentive should be.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Takano and Ranking Member Roe for  including the BRAVE Act in this bipartisan bill package, and I urge my  colleagues to support H.R. 7105 today.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Levin), my good friend, who is also a member of the  House Veterans' Affairs Committee and is the Chairman of the Economic  Opportunity Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New  York (Mr. Brindisi), my good friend, who is also a member of the House  Veterans' Affairs Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New  Hampshire (Mr. Pappas), my good friend who is also a member of the  House Veterans' Affairs Committee and chairman of the Subcommittee on  Oversight and Investigations.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas and his  devotion to Bill Mulder and his memory.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms.  Kaptur), my good friend, a longtime friend to the Veterans' Affairs  Committee, and a senior member of the Appropriations Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Pelosi), a champion and a staunch advocate, who is  unparalleled in her support for our Nation's 22 million veterans.   Under the Speaker's leadership, the House has passed the largest  increases in veterans funding in history, including investments in  mental health services, Agent Orange disability, healthcare benefits,  economic and educational opportunities, as well as job training.   She understands we must build up, not tear down, the Department of  Veterans Affairs. She has upheld the sacred pledge that, just as the  military leaves no one behind on the battlefield, we must leave no  veteran behind here at home.   This Congress, with her support, we have continued to preserve the  sacred trust of our men and women in uniform and the 200,000  servicemembers who become veterans each year.   Mr. Speaker, I am, of course, referring to the Speaker of this great  House from the great State of California, the Honorable Nancy  D'Alesandro Pelosi.    Mr. Speaker, I am sure Christine Pelosi is going to be  tweeting in just a few moments.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr.  Courtney), my good friend and member of the Armed Services Committee  and senior member of the Education and Labor Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Michigan (Mr. Kildee), my good friend.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute the gentleman from Arizona  (Mr. Gallego).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New  York (Mr. Delgado), my good friend.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from New  Mexico (Ms. Haaland), my good friend.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (S. 2216) to require the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to formally  recognize caregivers of veterans, notify veterans and caregivers of  clinical determinations relating to eligibility for the family  caregiver program, and temporarily extend benefits for veterans who are  determined ineligible for the family caregiver program, and for other  purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  S. 2216         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Transparency and Effective       Accountability Measures for Veteran Caregivers Act'' or the       ``TEAM Veteran Caregivers Act''.       SEC. 2. MODIFICATION OF ADMINISTRATION OF CAREGIVER PROGRAMS                     OF DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS.         (a) Formal Recognition of Caregivers.--        (1) Report.--        (A) In general.--Not later than 60 days after the date of       the enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall submit to the       Committee on Veterans' Affairs of the Senate and the       Committee on Veterans' Affairs of the House of       Representatives a report regarding the feasibility and       advisability of formally recognizing all caregivers of       veterans by identifying any caregiver of a veteran in the       electronic health record of the veteran.        (B) Caregivers recognized.--The recognition of caregivers       described in subparagraph (A) shall include recognition of --        (i) any family caregiver who is approved as a provider of       personal care services for an eligible veteran under the       program of comprehensive assistance for family caregivers       under subsection (a) of section 1720G of title 38, United       States Code; and        (ii) any caregiver of a covered veteran participating in       the program of general caregiver support services under       subsection (b) of such section.        (C) Timeline.--If the Secretary determines that formally       recognizing all caregivers of veterans as described in       subparagraph (A) is feasible and advisable, the report       required by such subparagraph shall include a timeline for       implementing such recognition.

(b) Notifications, Extension of Benefits, and Discharge       From Family Caregiver Program.--Section 1720G(a) of title 38,       United States Code, is amended by adding at the end the       following new paragraphs:        ``(12)(A) The Secretary shall notify the individuals       described in subparagraph (C) regarding decisions affecting       the furnishing of assistance under this subsection using       standardized letters, as the Secretary determines such       notifications and letters to be appropriate.        ``(B) A notification provided under subparagraph (A) shall       include the elements required for notices of decisions under       section 5104(b) of this title to the extent that those       elements apply to such notification, unless, not later than       60 days after the date of the enactment of the Transparency       and Effective Accountability Measures for Veteran Caregivers       Act, the Secretary determines that it would not be feasible       to include such elements in such notifications and submits to       the Committee on Veterans' Affairs of the Senate and the       Committee on Veterans' Affairs of the House of       Representatives a report setting forth the reasons for such       determination.        ``(C) The individuals described in this subparagraph shall       include--        ``(i) an individual who submits an application for the       program established under paragraph (1);        ``(ii) an individual determined by the Secretary to be an       eligible veteran pursuant to such an application; and        ``(iii) a family caregiver of an eligible veteran who is--        ``(I) approved as a provider of personal care services       under paragraph (6)(B); or        ``(II) designated as a primary provider of personal care       services under paragraph (7)(A).        ``(13)(A) If the Secretary determines that a veteran       receiving services under the program established under       paragraph (1) is no longer eligible for such program solely       because of improvement in the condition of the veteran--        ``(i) the effective date of discharge of the veteran from       the program shall be not earlier than the date that is 60       days after the date on which the Secretary provides notice of       such lack of eligibility under paragraph (12)(A) to the       relevant individuals described in paragraph (12)(C); and        ``(ii) the Secretary shall extend benefits under the       program established under paragraph (1) for a family       caregiver of the veteran described in paragraph (12)(C)(iii),       including stipends under paragraph (3)(A)(ii)(V), if such an       extension is determined appropriate by the Secretary, for a       90-day period following discharge of the veteran from the       program.        ``(B) This paragraph shall not be construed to limit the       authority of the Secretary--        ``(i) to prescribe regulations addressing other bases for--        ``(I) the discharge of a veteran from the program       established under paragraph (1); or        ``(II) the revocation of the designation of a family       caregiver of a veteran as a primary provider of personal care       services under paragraph (7)(A); or        ``(ii) to provide advance notice and extended benefits       under the program, as appropriate, if another basis for       discharge of a veteran described in subclause (I) of clause       (i) or revocation of a designation described in subclause       (II) of such clause applies.''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  to insert extraneous material on S. 2216.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 2216, Senator Peters' bill, the  TEAM Veteran Caregivers Act.   This legislation clarifies certain elements of VA's program of  comprehensive assistance for family caregivers and the general  caregiver program.   The bill formally recognizes a veteran's primary caregiver in the  veteran's medical record and requires standardization in letters  determining program eligibility.   Additionally, it extends the benefits of the comprehensive program  for 90 days after a veteran has been determined to no longer be  clinically eligible. This will allow the family caregivers, who have  likely forgone or minimized their own careers in order to care for  veterans, the means and necessary time to transition back to the  workforce without worrying about how to pay the bills. This is an  unnecessary stress on those who have already been through so much.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to support S. 2216, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I would just like to take a few moments to say even more words of  praise for my colleague, Dr. Phil Roe, my ranking member. We have  served on two committees coterminously: the Veterans' Affairs  Committee, which you chaired and which I now chair and which we have  been both ranking members; and the Education and Labor Committee.   It is sort of a fate of coincidence, but it has been an absolute  pleasure to be your colleague, sir. I wish you well in this next  chapter of your life.   I especially want to take note of the example you set by organizing  the congressional delegation trip to Afghanistan. I believe it was  either my first term or my second term in Congress. What an honor that  was to travel with you and a bipartisan delegation to serve turkey  dinner during Thanksgiving. I never forgot that lesson.   I vowed that if I ever became chairman of the committee, that we  would do the same thing, we would continue that tradition of serving  our troops who cannot be with their families during the holiday season.   That spirit of service carried into the work that you have done and I  have done together, with all the Members. We say it is a team effort.  It is a special part of the Congress that we have staff that interact  with each other, not primarily in an antagonistic mode. There are  differences, but we work them out and we work them out bicamerally.   I note that Mr. Towers is going to go work on the other side, and I  say that with all great affection. Some things will change, some things  will stay constant.   This behemoth, it is more than 300 pages of legislative text. That is  a testament to the spirit of wanting to do right.   I want to congratulate my own staff director, Ray Kelley, for that  amazing work of both he and Jon and their counterparts in the Senate.  This could not be the work of Phil Roe and myself alone. It was the  work of incredible leadership at the staff level.   I could go on and name every staff person. I have 28--29 staffers,  and they all have performed magnificently to produce, I think, this  incredible holiday gift to America's veterans and to America.   So Phil Roe, thank you for, together, this gift that our teams have  created for our country. Thank you for the gift you have been to our  country.   And my final word to you is, on your next chapter, Godspeed.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
