 Mr. Speaker, during one of my recent weekly talk radio  townhalls, I spoke to a family member of a veteran who served aboard  the destroyer USS Frank E. Evans during the Vietnam war.   The Vietnam veteran, Richard Grant, from Fargo, advocates for  servicemembers who died during the Vietnam war but are not presently  recognized on the Vietnam Veterans Memorial here in Washington.   The USS Frank E. Evans provided naval gunfire off the coast of  Vietnam, including during the Tet Offensive. While conducting friendly  maneuvers outside of the official combat zone, it collided with a  friendly Australian aircraft carrier, killing 74 crewmembers.   I introduced an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act  to engrave the names of the 74 crewmembers who died on that day on the  Vietnam Veterans Memorial Wall. Their sacrifice and that of their  families is worthy not only of our mention, but of the high honor of  being memorialized forever on the wall.   Mr. Speaker, I am honored to lead this amendment and urge my  colleagues to support it. I look forward to the day when the wall is  engraved with the 74 names of the heroes of the USS Frank E. Evans.                            ____________________
