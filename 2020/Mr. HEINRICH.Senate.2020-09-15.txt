 Mr. President, I want to start by thanking my colleague  Senator Udall for organizing us to talk about the current Acting  Director of the Bureau of Land Management. I say ``acting'' because  this is an individual who would not be able to be confirmed by this  body. But I want to take a step back and walk through a little bit  about why this is important.   There was once a strong young man who rose up through New York City  society. He led American soldiers in battle and went west to learn what  it meant to truly to work hard on America's western landscapes.   This man took all of his hard-driving spirit with him to the White  House and put it to work delivering for the American people. He took on  big trusts and gigantic corporations that had monopolized the American  economy and put a stranglehold on American workers. Despite coming from  a wealthy New York family, this man focused on delivering a ``Square  Deal'' to working-class Americans. But perhaps his most important and  lasting legacy was this: After our country's previous century of  explosive growth across the North American continent, he saw clearly  that we needed to rein in the pillaging of our forests, the draining of  our wetlands, the destruction of America's wildlife, and the loss of  irreplaceable cultural resources. He saw that we had only one chance  left to protect the splendors of our uniquely American landscapes for  future generations.   When Donald Trump looks up every once in a while from his television  screen or from yet another tweetstorm portrait on his phone to the  portrait of that great American President, I am sure he sometimes tells  himself that he could be just like Teddy Roosevelt.   I am sure he imagines that he is equally deserving of a place on  Mount Rushmore and that if it weren't for his bone spurs, he could have  been just as tough as Teddy, charging up San Juan Hill or riding on  horseback through the Dakota Badlands rather than jumping  [[Page S5594]]  into a golf cart. These delusions of grandeur reached a new height last  week, when the President told a crowd in Florida that he has been ``the  number one environmental president since Teddy Roosevelt.''   I don't really need to tell you that this claim is just about as  absurd as saying that he has done a great job protecting Americans from  the coronavirus that has now led to the deaths of nearly 200,000 of our  countrymen or his claims, frankly, that he deserves a Nobel Peace Prize  for sending love letters to a nuclear-armed despot in North Korea or  making long-term peace in the Middle East even more out of reach.   Let's pause and take a look at what President Trump's record has  actually been on the environment. Yes, I will acknowledge that  President Trump has signed some great pieces of conservation  legislation that many of us here in the Senate worked hard to pass with  veto-proof majorities. But since taking office, President Trump has  also empowered an Army of former oil, coal, and timber industry  lobbyists to roll back nearly every protection of wildlife habitat,  clean air, and clean water that they could get their hands on.   He has systematically attacked climate science, setting us up for  worse and worse natural disasters like the fires that we are now  experiencing across the West.   Just 1 year into his Presidency, Donald Trump did something no  President in the last 100 years would have ever thought to do. He  completely erased national monument designation for treasured red rock  landscapes in Southern Utah's Bears Ears. By doing so, he also gutted  key protections for cultural sites that Tribal nations across the  American Southwest hold to be sacred.   That egregious and, I believe, illegal action cut against the very  heart of the Antiquities Act. This is the law that many Presidents over  the last century used to protect so many of our national monuments and  national parks. The Antiquities Act was truly Teddy Roosevelt's  landmark conservation achievement during his Presidency.   Rather than carry on Roosevelt's legacy, President Trump used the  Antiquities Act in a novel, new way. He used it to unprotect two  national monuments--Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante. Now over  2 million acres of the most paleontologically important and culturally  significant sites in the entire Southwest are open for uranium mining,  ATV abuse, and fossil fuel extraction.   Just a few weeks ago, in a similarly destructive act, President Trump  opened up our Nation's marquee national wildlife refuge in the Arctic  to industrial oil and gas drilling. It seems there are no landscapes  that are too sacred to make a quick buck in this White House. Not even  the calving grounds of the porcupine caribou herd will have been  spared. He is also now threatening to allow previously unthinkable  proposals, like uranium mining in the Grand Canyon.   I don't think anyone in their right mind could call that a great  record of conservation or environmentalism, not by any measure.    That takes us to why we are here today--President Trump's decision to  put William Perry Pendley in charge of the public lands that are the  birthright of every American.   We have a saying in New Mexico: ``Dime con quien andas y te dire  quien eres.'' Loosely translated, it means: ``Tell me who you hang  around with, and I will tell you who you are.'' I think it says a great  deal that President Trump has chosen to hang around with William Perry  Pendley.   For the last 30 years, Mr. Pendley has been a driving force in a  campaign fueled by anti-government propaganda--and propped up by  special interests and extractive industry dollars--to seize and sell  off the American people's public lands.   As an industry-paid lawyer and lobbyist, Mr. Pendley has fought  against hunting and fishing access laws and supported the elimination  of protections for our national monuments. In fact, he has championed  the repeal of the very law that Teddy Roosevelt used to protect our  Grand Canyon.   He has filed numerous lawsuits in State and Federal courts, seeking  to deny access to public lands for sportsmen and attacking key  protections for wildlife, clean air, and clean water.   Now President Trump has placed him in charge of the Federal agency  that manages so many of our public lands across the West. This is the  man who is on record saying that we should ``sell all BLM lands'' east  of the Mississippi. President Trump handpicked this zealot to lead the  agency responsible for stewarding those very same public lands. What  would Teddy Roosevelt think?   William Perry Pendley's beliefs hearken back to the era right before  Teddy Roosevelt's Presidency, when railroad barons, hard rock mining  operators, and timber companies were given free rein over our  landscapes and our natural resources. By putting Mr. Pendley in charge  of the Bureau of Land Management, President Trump is saying loud and  clear that he wants to take us backward to those same failed and  destructive policies of the past.   I am proud that the entire Senate Democratic caucus joined a broad  coalition of hunters, fishermen, wildlife advocates, and outdoor  recreation enthusiasts, all of whom called on President Trump to  withdraw Mr. Pendley's nomination. Thanks to that widespread outcry  from those of us who love our public lands, President Trump was forced  to withdraw Mr. Pendley's nomination last month. But forcing the Trump  administration to withdraw the Pendley nomination was only half the  battle.   In fact, William Perry Pendley is still sitting in his office today,  leading the Bureau of Land Management in his previous ``acting'' role.   President Trump has shown that he is willing to circumvent Congress  and skip the constitutionally required confirmation process for other  key Federal leadership posts by illegally placing people into  unofficial and indefinite ``acting'' roles. Mr. Pendley has now been  serving in one of these ``color outside the lines'' acting posts for  well over a year.   As long as the Republican Senate majority refuses to act on its  constitutional duty to hold this administration accountable on  nominations like this, Mr. Pendley and other Trump officials in  ``acting'' roles can and will continue to operate with impunity. That  is not right, and in this case, we are talking about someone whose  whole career has been built on opposition to the very idea that public  lands should remain in public hands.   Mr. Pendley's role in the Trump administration represents a direct  attack on Teddy Roosevelt's legacy for our environment. The mission of  public land management should be focused on serving the American public  and safeguarding the values that deliver benefits to the American  people.   In these times, that means that work by the leaders of our land  management agency should be rooted in the conservation of our wildlife,  our water, and our landscapes. Their mission should include expanding  access to outdoor recreation, preserving biodiversity, restoring  healthy carbon sequestering forests and productive watersheds. They  should work alongside Tribal nations and rural communities to protect  cultural landscapes and promote sustainable economic development--or as  Teddy Roosevelt put it more simply and much more artfully than I could  all those years ago:         Here is your country. Cherish these natural wonders,       cherish the natural resources, cherish the history and       romance as a sacred heritage. . . . Do not let selfish men or       greedy interests skin your country of its beauty, it is       riches or its romance.    The question before us here in the Senate is whether we will stand by  as those greedy interests take what is our American birthright or  whether we will stand up for our sacred heritage.   I choose to stand up. I hope the Presiding Officer and my colleagues  will join us.
