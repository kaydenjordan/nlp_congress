 Mr. Speaker, this month we are celebrating  Women's History Month. Women's History Month is a time to recognize all  the work remarkable women across the world, past and present, have  achieved. It is important to reflect on our accomplishments and  recognize women trailblazers worldwide. It is incredible to see how far  we have come.   Mr. Speaker, while we have cause to celebrate all our achievements,  our work isn't finished, and more must be done. Reproductive rights are  being threatened. Many women are still fighting for equal pay for equal  work, and the ERA is not in the Constitution.   The fight continues until women are given the respect and dignity  they rightly deserve. Let's celebrate and fight for a better tomorrow  for women across the world.   ``Long live women.'' ``Que viva la mujer.''                            ____________________
