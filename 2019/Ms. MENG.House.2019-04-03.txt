 Madam Chair, as the designee of the gentlewoman from New  Hampshire (Ms. Kuster), I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Chair, I rise today in strong support of  Congresswoman Kuster's bipartisan amendment that calls on key Federal  agencies to harmonize their sexual violence surveys and reporting  systems.   This amendment was inspired by a Government Accountability Office  study that found Federal agencies engaged in collecting data on sexual  violence are using different terminology for the same types of sex  crimes, and these crimes are being categorized in dissimilar ways.   As one example, an act some Federal surveys identified as rape is  considered ``nonconsensual sex acts'' or ``sexual coercion'' in others.   For another survey, attempted nonconsensual sex acts are not  specifically included in the definition of ``nonconsensual sex acts''  in the survey, even though they are counted in overarching measurement  of this behavior.   These surveys and reporting systems are important, but their  ambiguities and inconsistencies are very problematic and need to be  corrected.   Ms. Kuster's amendment requires four Federal agencies that conduct  eight critical sexual violence surveys to form a working group to help  improve coordination and develop clearer sexual violence terminology  and categorization. This working group will then complete a report  identifying the internal steps and congressional action that can be  taken to address this issue.   I know Ms. Kuster is proud that this amendment is bipartisan, and she  has asked me to extend her thanks to our colleagues, Representatives  Turner, Speier, Morelle, and Raskin, for joining her to introduce it  for consideration within this landmark legislation to reauthorize the  Violence Against Women Act.   Additionally, she is grateful to House Judiciary Committee leadership  for their support, and to Senators McCaskill and Johnson for  shepherding a similar bill through the Senate last year.   Madam Chair, we know the #MeToo movement continues to shed a light on  the disturbing prevalence of sexual violence in our country. For  survivors, it has been a powerful and moving reminder that they are not  alone. For all of us, it has been a wake-up call that the status quo is  unacceptable and will not be tolerated anymore.   In order to fully understand the scope of the challenge we face, we  need reliable, transparent data. The Federal Government has a critical  role to play to that end. We have tremendous confidence that better  communication amongst these agencies, coupled with thoughtfully  harmonized terminology and categorization, will yield more accurate  data. Armed with that knowledge, we can better prevent and end the  scourge of sexual violence.   Madam Chair, I urge support of Ms. Kuster's amendment, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, my amendment would ensure that incarcerated,  pregnant prisoners who are primary caretaker parents and who have  limited English proficiency will have access to parenting classes.   Mr. Chair, we know that at the end of 2016 there were over 111,000  women in prisons across our country. That is a nearly 750 percent  increase from 1980. Women are the fastest growing population of  incarcerated individuals in our country.   Our Nation has 4 percent of the world's female population, but 30  percent of its female incarcerated population.   We also know that women of color are significantly overrepresented in  our criminal justice system. In fact, two-thirds of women in jail are  women of color.   Additionally, a recent study published just 2 weeks ago in the  American Journal of Public Health found that, during their 1-year study  of rates of pregnancy and outcomes among women in prison in 22 States  and the Federal system, almost 1,400 pregnant women were admitted to  prison.   Given the intersection of these data points, my amendment ensures  that parenting classes be accessible to those incarcerated women with  limited English proficiency.   The Bureau of Prisons already provides certain parenting classes for  pregnant incarcerated individuals. They include the Mother and Infants  Nursing Together, MINT, program; and the Residential Parenting Program.   The MINT program teaches parenting skills to facilitate mother-child  bonding and provides the tools to help build a stable home environment  upon release.   The Residential Parenting Program at the Washington State Department  of Corrections allows Bureau of Prison incarcerated women and their  infants to participate in the program.   Studies show that these programs are significant for incarcerated  females and their families, as they can play important roles in  successful reentry into society.   Under my amendment, all pregnant incarcerated women or incarcerated  moms will be able to better provide for their children no matter what  language they speak.   The BOP's incarcerated female population is incredibly diverse, with  many ethnicities and many foreign countries represented, but no one  should be denied the chance to be the best parent they can be simply  because they are non-English speaking.   Mr. Chair, I thank my good friend Congresswoman Karen Bass as well as  Congressman Fitzpatrick for their leadership in shepherding this  landmark legislation.   The 2019 reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act responds  to our Nation's crisis of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual  assault, and stalking.   Mr. Chair, I urge support for my amendment, and I reserve the balance  of my time.    Mr. Chairman, we just want to make sure that no one is  denied the chance to bond with their newborn or child simply because  they don't speak the language.   This amendment ensures compliance with title VI of the Civil Rights  Act of 1964, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of race,  color, and national origin in programs and activities receiving Federal  financial assistance.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, this amendment would ensure that our Federal  prison develops tools to communicate parenting program availability and  eligibility criteria to each employee of the Bureau of Prisons and each  pregnant incarcerated woman so that each of these women in the custody  of a Bureau of Prisons facility understands the resources available to  them.   Mr. Chair, we know that women are the fastest growing population in  the criminal justice system. Only 5 percent of the world's female  population lives in the U.S., but they account for nearly 30 percent of  the world's incarcerated women. That is an injustice to not only those  incarcerated but to their families, our economy, and our society as a  whole.   According to Prison Policy Initiative, 80 percent of the women who  will go to jail this year are moms, including nearly 150,000 women who  are pregnant when they are admitted, and many of these women are the  primary caretaker of their family.   This means that the impact of their incarceration reaches far beyond  the prison system. As we incarcerate women, we are also incarcerating  their families.   Currently, the BOP does offer some programs to women who are moms or  soon-to-be mothers. Mothers and Infants Nursing Together, otherwise  known as MINT, is offered to moms who are pregnant at the time of  commitment. Participating mothers can enroll in pre- and postnatal  classes on childbirth, parenting, and coping skills. This program  offers the chance for mothers to acquire parenting skills and bond with  their infant after birth.   The Residential Parenting Program offered by the Washington State  Department of Corrections' Residential Parenting Program gives its  participants and their infants the opportunity to reside in the minimum  security unit for up to 30 months after birth.   Mr. Chair, these programs are important resources to pregnant mothers  and parents who are incarcerated. In fact, participants of the MINT  program have reported that the program has helped them learn important  parenting skills and develop a bond with their infants.   However, the September 2018 Department of Justice's OIG review of the  Federal Bureau of Prisons' management of its female inmate population  found that BOP's pregnancy programs were underutilized.   Between fiscal years 2012 and 2016, there were 951 pregnant  incarcerated women in BOP's custody, 558 of whom were in institutions  designed to house sentenced inmates. Of these 558 sentenced pregnant  inmates, they estimate that only 204 participated in MINT or the  Residential Parenting Program. That is, only 37 percent were in these  parenting and pregnancy programs.   The reasons were varied. Incarcerated mothers who may be eligible for  the programs are often not identified as being eligible. While social  workers are responsible for informing inmates of these opportunities,  social worker positions often remain vacant.   Many staff did not fully understand the eligibility criteria for the  Mothers and Infants Nursing Together program, and, even more  surprising, some staff were entirely unaware of these programs'  existence.   These are valuable programs that need to be reaching more people.  This amendment directs the Bureau of Prisons to develop tools to better  communicate the availability of these programs and their eligibility  criteria to inmates. With these improvements, incarcerated individuals  will be empowered to better utilize the resources made available to  them.   Mr. Chair, I urge support for the amendment, and I reserve the  balance of my time.                                time  1800     Mr. Chair, I appreciate the gentleman's comments.   Again, only 37 percent of pregnant inmates utilize these programs. I  think that it is very common sense to make sure that more people are  aware of these programs, both staff employees and those who are  incarcerated.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, my amendment would ensure that cultural  competency training is included in trauma screening trainings provided  to correctional officers and each Bureau of Prisons employee, including  instructors and healthcare professionals.   Estimates suggest that as many as 90 percent of incarcerated women  have experienced some sort of trauma such as interpersonal or sexual  violence in their lives. Female inmates are more likely to have been  the victims of direct violence, repeated sexual violence, and intimate  partner violence. We also know that trauma is experienced in different  ways, depending on the individual's gender identity, culture, and past  experiences.   The BOP's incarcerated female population is incredibly diverse, with  many ethnicities, approximately 30 religions, and women from all 50  States and many foreign countries represented.  [[Page H3048]]    Studies show that trauma treatment programs should be administered  and facilitated during the first 12 months of the incarcerated  individual's sentence so as to maximize the benefits of these programs.   Research also shows that the effects of trauma manifest themselves  differently for incarcerated women and men. This manifestation is  further compounded by the individual's cultural background.   Incarcerated individuals with limited English proficiency have unique  challenges in interaction with correctional officers. This is also true  for LGBT incarcerated individuals who have experienced injustice and  violence in very specific ways.   In order to address the past trauma of inmates, the BOP has tried to  adopt a ``trauma-informed correctional care approach.'' Under this  method, the actions of staff are centered on the understanding that  trauma is real and prevalent, and opportunities to avoid retraumatizing  inmates are an opportunity for healing.   This approach also includes several principles which seek to ensure  the psychological and emotional safety of those incarcerated  individuals and staff, and use communication methods that avoid  triggering memories of past trauma.   And yet testimony from formerly incarcerated women illustrates that  correction staff in women's facilities still often fail to receive  trauma-informed and gender-responsive training, let alone culturally  competent training.   Correctional officers, healthcare professionals, and other staff  members must be adequately trained on methods of trauma-informed care  that address the needs of incarcerated individuals.   The trauma screenings must equip each BOP employee to be mindful of  the unique culturally rooted trauma of incarcerated individuals. A  better understand of these needs allows correctional officers and  instructors to provide the most effective care possible. Such training  would ensure that correctional staff respond to incarcerated  individuals in productive and impactful ways.   In other words, these officials will be able to provide trauma- informed care to those who have limited English proficiency, come from  diverse backgrounds, or live with disabilities, regardless of gender,  sexual orientation, or gender identity.   The dignity of an incarcerated individual must be honored and upheld,  and ensuring the proper training of employees to interact with them  would be a significant first step.   I urge support for the amendment, and I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
