 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the life  of Carl Boyer.   The lives of every single person in my hometown of Santa Clarita,  California, are better thanks to the work and tireless efforts of one  of our city's founding fathers, Mr. Carl Boyer.   After moving to what is now California's 25th District in the late  1960s, Carl worked to establish the city of Santa Clarita in an effort  to help our community receive the resources it needed. His leadership  continued from there as he served on the first-ever Santa Clarita City  Council and, eventually, two terms as mayor.   Carl put his city--our city--at the center of every decision he made.  From his first day on the council to his last day as mayor, he worked  to protect our beautiful open space, and he left office having created  one of the best park departments in the United States.   While serving Santa Clarita, he was also a public school teacher and  a foster parent to young children who came to the United States for  lifesaving medical treatment.   Carl Boyer had a heart of gold, and will be missed by all. On behalf  of the vibrant and wonderful community that he helped create, I extend  my deepest gratitude for the legacy of service, engagement, and  kindness that he leaves behind.                            ____________________
