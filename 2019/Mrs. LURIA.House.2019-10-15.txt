 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this commonsense  and bipartisan bill to make VA websites accessible and understandable  for all veterans.   Our servicemembers put themselves in harm's way to protect American  freedom. It is only right that Congress uphold our end of the promise  by giving them the care that they earned.   One of my top priorities in Congress is eliminating barriers  preventing our bravest men and women from receiving quality medical  care, as well as disability, vocational, and educational benefits.   I met with a group of blinded veterans, and they explained that the  structure of the VA websites makes it difficult for them to learn about  treatments and schedule their doctor appointments. I knew I had to act.   To remedy this problem, I introduced the VA Website Accessibility  Act, which will require the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to conduct a  study of the accessibility of VA websites for veterans with  disabilities. Upon completion of the study, the Secretary will be  required to report to Congress on the study's results and provide a  plan to improve these websites.   This bill will ensure that the ailments and trauma our servicemembers  endured during battle will not prevent them from using the resources  that VA websites have to offer. Veterans affected by blindness or  hearing loss have  [[Page H8132]]  sacrificed for our Nation. They deserve equal access to all VA  services, and I am honored to champion their cause.   Our heroes should not have to wait one day longer. Today, we can help  thousands of veterans receive better access to healthcare resources.   Mr. Speaker, I urge support of the VA Website Accessibility Act, H.R.  1199.                                time  1700
