 Madam President, I want to compliment my colleague from  Delaware, whom I enjoy working with very much on the EPW Committee.   Normally at this time, the end of the week, I talk about the Alaskan  of the Week. So stay tuned for next week when we continue that series.  It has been going on for 6 years.
